<Content>Wonderful pre- and post-cruising stay Very clean nice little hotel. Affordable. Restaurants, convenience stores and Wallgreen within a 5 minute walk. Very convenient for pre- and post-cruising. Well located, right between the Cruise Ship Terminal and Airport. The staff is fantastic FROM THE FRONT DESK TO MAID AND POOL ATTENDANT). Polite, helpful and welcoming. WOW!  Honestly, we were sad to leave. We loved the pool area. Feeling at home. Quiet and peaceful. Wish we could speak Spanish as well as they speak English and a litlle French. We loved the place and those extremely nice people.From the Hotel, it's easy to get to Old San Juan by bus for 0.75 (exact change). Bus stop nearby. Taxi with 3 or 4 luggages is about $20 from Cruiseship to hotel or from Airport to Hotel and vice versa. It varied from $19 to $21 with Turistico Taxis. A two dollar tip is very much appreciated, but they are not waiting for it.This hotel is not a Resort with numerous facilities, but it's the best you can get considering the price, location and friendly service.

<Content>The jury is still out - Amazing personnel... EXCEPTIONAL Manager! OK... I found out about this hotel on this Website. Yes, I was looking for the BEST price... with a high standard. Le Consulat is a Clarion Hotel connection. Not sure what that means... however, Clarion is shielded on the wall behind the Front-Office personnel. That noted, I was surprise at what appears to be a hotel which is not well organized. OK鈥?let鈥檚 start with the good stuff.The outer appearance is very nice. The staff are delightful, very nice. The manager, Janice an absolute doll and genuine! Natalie, superior; Alexis, professional; Gabriella, sweet Joseu, thoughtful, considerate and very bright. Simply quality in the hotel as far as the employees. The problem is鈥?the hotel is too small for the demand. That鈥檚 the problem. Too many people want to stay at this new hotel in the Condado area. They don鈥檛 have sufficient cleaning people to keep up with the ridiculous demand. What I have discovered is San Juan, Condado area is a port city clearinghouse for cruise ship travelers and therefore makes it very demanding on hotel personnel to continue to rotate people in and out of rooms everyday for God sake. If they can somehow, get better cleaning staff, a place to store luggage, electrical outlets in the lobby for people who must wait four (4) hours for their room to be ready, and if they can change their check out time to 12:00 instead of 11:00 a.m. which is way too early, and if they can dump their so call breakfast provider who provide that ??? continental breakfast which is horrible, and if they can do a great job scrubbing the floors, and the bathroom shower floors and walls well because of all the traffic in and out and in and out and in out of there and if they can do a better job of quality control on laudry, towels ect鈥?they will be and do just fine.Location is ideal! Smack in the middle of EVERYTHIG!Price should be around U$80.00 鈥?125.00 max/night including the tax. Their prices are way too high for only a basic room without a refrigerator or water or breakfast. They are too expensive! They must bring their rates down if they intend to hold on.Do I recommend this hotel, yes, I do without reservation because the staff are willing to make up, pick up the slack where the room, inefficiencies, and sundries are taxing on travelers.I am confident that they will be making drastic improvements in future because the employees are aware of their challenges and the necessity to employ changes and enhancements.

<Content>Looooooved Le Consulat Service Staff.... They only semi-confusing thing that I will say about the hotel is that I guess it's changing it's name from Clarion Collection Le Consulat to Clarion Ascend Le Consulat, so it was a little confusing to find it but that should be solved pretty soon...But as far as my stay there let me tell you that it was nothing less than outstanding. The rooms are exremely clean and spacious, it's located almost right on the main strip which makes it great because you're close to everything but not right in the middle of everything so you get your privacy while being in a great location.The Front Desk Staff was awesome, I was checked-in by Leiza (I might've spelled it wrong, sorry!) but she was so helpful with all the questions I had as far as where to eat and where to go so I was really pleased with her service. The other person that helped my there was Joshua, he set up the tours I wanted to go (which I loved), told me the right places to go shopping (loved the mall I was at), and also recomended me a great place to go eat some great puertorican food and listen to some local music, so thatks to you to!!!All and all I had a great time in Puerto Rico shopping and going on tours, but staying at this hotel really made it all go so much smoothly so thank you very much if you read this!!!

<Content>GREAT Hotel We stayed at Le Consulat for one night prior to our cruise from San Juan. I booked this hotel for two reasons: 1-The hotels in SJ can be very expensive, and this one was quite reasonable ($119). 2-The reviews I read on tripadvisor were good.II have nothing bad to say about the hotel at all. It is a boutique hotel, so the services are limited, and the rooms are small. However, the room was spotless, and the bed was comfortable. Newly renovated, the decor in the rooms is quite modern. There's a flatscreen TV in the room, which is nice, as is the large closet (should you need one). I also liked the fact that there was a safe in the room.The hotel is in a GREAT location in Condado. The beach is a few blocks away, as are restaurants, stores, bars, and more. The gal who manned the desk when we checked in at night was great and gave us a lot of information about restaurants and stores in the area. Because we stayed at the Marriott (which is about 2 blocks away) a few years ago, I knew that there was a Starbucks very close and that there was a good pizza place nearby, also.Another big plus, by the way, is the fact that there is free wireless internet service available in the rooms.

<Content>Staff were very nice, rooms good and reasonable. They need a coffee maker This part of town seemed rather dead. I don't know if it was because it was off season or because they are rebuilting or moving out. The hotel is newly remodeled and still figuring stuff out. The buses are easy to figure out and it is close to San Juan. We were comfortable but we didn't stay out too late. There is a horible place arount the corner called Angel's. Don't eat there. I was disappointed with the food ingeneral there. San Juan was OK. Thay have no coffee at the hotel but there is a bakery down the street where they give you a voucher. Good coffee the first day but the machine was broken the second. No worries there are other shops on Ashley. Hosdoc

<Content>Great Pre/Post Cruise Hotel! This is a great pre/post cruise hotel. We stayed a total of 5 nights at this hotel. The rate for a room with 2 queen beds was $126 per night + tax/fees. Rooms with 1 queen bed are usually $110 or less per night. + tax/fees. If you book directly with the hotel chain, you can get a discount using your AAA card. The room had a flat screen tv with limited channels in English (CNN, CBS, ABC, Fox, TNT, etc.), shower and desk. The hotel has a pool and jacuzzi. The rate includes a simple breakfast (drink and pastry) at Pelayo Cafe. The front desk staff is friendly and bilingual (Spanish/English). The room was clean and efficient. The Fan/A/C is loud, so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The hotel is one of the newest in the area, so many taxi drivers need help with directions (Just tell them that the hotel is near Walgreens in Condado)The hotel is a $15 taxi ride from the airport and a $20 taxi ride from the cruise port.The hotel is located in the Condado District on Magdalena Avenue near Ashford Avenue. The hotel is walking distance to Walgreens, Dannys Pizza, Wendys, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Haagen Dazs, Cybernet Internet Cafe, restaurants, shops, cafes.The hotel is very close to the bus stop. From the bus stop, you can pay 75 cents and take the B21 bus to Plaza las Americas Shopping Mall (largest mall in the Caribbean) . You can take the B21 bus in the opposite direction to Old San Juan. The bus ride to Old San Juan is less than 20 minutes. The bus schedule is not predictable--they usually run every 30-60 minutes depending on the day of the week. The buses do not accept dollars, just coins.

<Content>Yes, I'd stay here again This is a fairly new, very very nice boutique hotel. Check in was fast and problem-free. They gave us a room on the first floor, next to the pool (which by the way, was very clean, warm and overall welcoming). NOTE: If you do not like small little brown lizards (they're harmless) or if bringing kids who might be terrified of them, do not accept a room on the first floor; you're bound to see one here and there which is common in many Caribbean islands. Our room, #108, was bigger than expected with two queen beds, a pull-out sofa, and a modern 32-inch flat panel TV with cable. The individually-controlled a/c worked like a charm (thank goodness). There was also an outdoor private patio for the room, equipped with two lounge chairs and surrounded by 6-ft walls to ensure maximum privacy if you felt like sunbathing. The bedding was very very nice, with crisp bright white linens and big soft pillows. We slept like babies. The bathroom was equipped with a shower and toilet (sink is outside of the bathroom) and a bunch of clean beach towels, wash cloths and hand cloths. The large closet had a safe, an iron and a small ironing board. There was no refrigerator or minibar, just an ice bucket.I basically only had two minor complaints. One, the lack of hot water from the shower. Although, truthfully, it was never really ice cold, it still struggled to get even lukewarm. Two, although appreciated, the free breakfast that you'd get at the restaurant up the block was laughably even smaller than the token continental breakfasts most other hotels offer you. Here, you get a choice of one item from a small list of food items, and then one drink item from a small list of small drink items. For example, I chose the fried croquettes (they give you two at 2 each) and an 8oz bottle of orange juice from the voucher. Anything more than that such as coffee, tea, or bread you'd have to pay for at regular price. After wolfing down this free breakfast, we giggled and asked for the restaurant's full breakfast menu, and ended up ordering eggs, bacon, pork, toast etc. at the regular price. It was quite tasty and came up to about $11-14, depending on what's ordered. Not bad.The Le Consulat's location is convenient, not far from the beach or avenida Ashford (which is behind the hotel), and is on a pretty and quiet residential street.Overall, I like this place and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great stay for the price We stayed at this hotel on May 31st and were very pleased with the service and accomodations. It is a small boutique hotel located in the Condado area and very convenient to the shops and restaurants. There is a Walgreen's just around the corner if you've forgotten anything. The staff is very nice and let us check in when we arrived by 2 and rooms aren't to be ready until 3. Just ask. as they are happy to do anything for you. We had a room near the lobby and the pool was right down the hall. The room had a small patio off of it and was lovely to sit outside and have a drink and listen to the coquis sing in the trees. The beds are very comfortable and also have flat screen tv's. They will give you a voucher for a light breakfast for a place down the street called Pelayo. The coffee was very good here. We walked a little bit to a lovely Spanish Catholic church for mass on Sunday . Would advise those who do not like to walk to call a cab to get here. This was a pre-cruise stay for us and was perfect. It took us 10 minutes in a cab to get to the Pan Am port. Clean hotel. Would stay here again.

<Content>Very good and on it's way to completely great... I originally had a reservation for the Coral Princess Inn and I wasn't loving it so I saw Le Consulat and I took a little tour of the hotel and I automatically knew that I would love it... And I sure did! The staff is great, the rooms are beautiful, and the art displays around the hotel and in the rooms are the best I've seen in any hotel.  As I was told there they've only been open a few weeks so I can only imagine they will get a lot better with time... Another good thing is that they give you a voucher for breakfast and you go to a restaurant instead of the lame set-up they have on other hotels where they just leave the food laying out in the open...  I hope that a lot of people that stays at Le Consulat write reviews and not just the one or 2 that may have a little problem... I loved everything about this Boutique Hotel and I can't wait to go back this summer...

<Content>It is new, but it is not that good........ well..... I think I am the third guest to wrtie the review for Le Consulat. I have to say, it is really new, but it is not that good!I went to Fajardo for a conference, and before that I stayed in Coral Princess Inn, which is just 2 doors next to Le Consulat. I also wrote some review for them. I found Le Consulat pretty modern and new, so I decided to stay here after I came back from Fajardo. However, their computer is really really SLOW! When I made a phone call for booking, it almost took me 15 minutes to complete. The staff was very friendly and tried to apologize for the inconvenience. However, for a hotel in 21st century, their computer seems to be with a 286 CPU.......Same thing happened at the last morning when I was about to check out. The staff just could not make things done and let me wait for 10 minutes. Again, the staffs there were very friendly. They always apologize for the inconvenience. I checked in around 3PM, when they should clean and make up all the room. But when I opened the door of my room, it was not made up yet! Of course, the staffs helped me to change to another room! The room is OK! I mean, it is very basic, compared to Coral Princess Inn. There is a safety box, but there is no refrigerator. There is closet, but there is only one hanger inside. They only provided very basic and cheap amenity in the bathroom. The most ridiculous thing happened in my bathroom is the shower seemed to have no water pressure.... so I spent more than 20 minutes to take the shower.... I did tell the front desk but they could not figuer out what happened on it. Again, they apologized! And during night, I have to say it is not that quiet. I stayed in the second floor in the rear of the building, but I can also hear clearly what the staffs talked during night at the front desk, not to say when someone's chatting in the lobby.As a bed  breakfast, they provided breakfast. But it is a coupon that you have to walk about 200 meters far to a bakery to get it. I mean, it is not bad, but it would be better if they have their own kitchen. So, I would like to say, Le Consulat is new, but it is not that good if you have to pay around 150 USD per day. The location is good, the staffs are friendly, but if I have the chance to choose again, I will probably stay in Coral Princess Inn rather than here.
