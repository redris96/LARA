<Content>pleasant stay at a good location We stayed 3 nights at Alexander Plaza: very convenient location a couple of minutes walk from the S9 line which brought us from/to Schonefeld airport in about half an hour. The neighborhood is lively and full of shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is quite pleasant with modern rooms that are clean and comfy. Breakfast is good and abundant but service is a bit too 'discreet'. Beware of renovation work outside of the hotel.

<Content>Need to be more consumer friendly Checked into Alexander Plaza on a Friday afternoon for two nights. Was told that my prepaid room was on the 6th floor and, due to construction, the elevator only went to 5th floor. I'd have to schlep my bags (and myself) up and down the stairs everytime I wanted to go in or out. What an unpleasant surprise! They didn't even offer to have someone carry my suitcases up the stairs. When I mentioned my knee surgery (cane was the tip-off), they made a big show of reluctantly upgarding me to a double on another floor. Tiny room (upgraded!) that looked out on a small interior space--had to keep curtains drawn at all times to prevent office workers across the airspace from looking in.Recently renovated hotel is in a great location for walking to museums and shopping in an interesting gentrifying section of East Berlin. Wait staff at the bar was very pleasant.With all lights on, the room was dark; poor lighting except next to the bed; tiny bath with 30x30-inch shower; only one towel until I asked for another; 17 Euro breakfast that was just okay in content; Business Center that was closed of the weekend at 4p on Friday.

<Content>Be carefull with th Minibar charges It's a good and well located hotel. Nice rooms, spacious and confortable, the only problem is the TV location (on the right side of the bed) that makes very dificult to wach TV from the bed. Fair breackfast, and good service. The problem with me, was the charge of the Minibar. I didn't take ANYTHING from the Minibar and they make me to pay a water a beer and a chocolate. Of course i have told them that i didn't take anything, but it was my word against the housekeeper word. As Minibar do not need any signature...the housekeeper word as win. It is not for the 9.00 鈧?that i have paid, but, for me it was a fraude. So, you just have to watch carefull about this...the rest its a good and well located hotel (with a underground-S station called Hackescher Markt at 100 meters )

<Content>Excellent location, very comfortable Stayed here two nights.. moved from another hotel to this more central location. As mentioned by another reviewer this hotel is a stones throw from the Hackescher Market and handy to the excellent Berlin transit. We took the train direct from this station out to Schoenfeld Airport. The hotel is modern with good size rooms, comfortable beds and an excellent buffet breakfast. While there is a fee for internet in the business center it was quite cheap and there was also free internet access off the lobby to check email. I also appreciated the gratis apples at the reception desk! On a quiet side street , easy to walk to many attractions. Would definitely recommend this hotel.The staff were very helpful and had good recommendations for restaurants in the area.

<Content>Location can't be beat! A very nice hotel located in the Mitte neighborhood of Berlin - incredibly convenient to the Museum Island, Alexander Platz and all public transportation. The S-Bahn stop Hackescher Markt is a stones throw from the hotel entrance and happens to be the site of a nice plaza filled with cafes and bars with ourdoor seating - the whole place was filled with people drinking and hanging out in the evenings. We were able to walk to great dining spots (i.e. places on the Oranienburger Strasse) in 15-20 minutes. *Our only beef with this place is that the cleaning person (we assume) failed to properly lock the door at one point and we returned in the late afternoon to find our door wide open! Nothing was missing and the staff handled it professionally - probably doesn't happen all the time but wanted to mention it.

<Content>excellent, stylish choice Only stayed one night on a business trip to Berlin, but would definitely stay again if I return to Berlin for a holiday. Very large and comfortable room and very stylish decor throughout the hotel. I was particularly impressed by the modern art in the lobby and corridors. I had no difficulty getting a non-smoking room when I booked via email only a few days before the trip. Very quiet in spite of the very central location. Excellent breakfast.

<Content>Non-smokers beware According to staff, this hotel has three floors of non-smoking rooms. I requested such a room 6 weeks prior to arrival. But when I arrived, the hotel was fully booked, and a non-smoking room had not been held for me.I asked the staff whether this was a single mistake, but the reply was no. The hotel does not have an IT system nor manual processes that allow them to allocate smoking and non-smoking rooms according to reservations when the hotel is full. So my conclusion is that this hotel cannot be recommended to non-smokers.Apart from this - and the extremely overpriced internet connection - this is an OK hotel.

<Content>Highly Recommended !! I spent five nights in this hotel and was very pleased. The location is great and very handy tothe S-bahn train. I thought the train noise was going to be a problem, but the windows insulate the sound very well. The hotel staff is great and was very very helpful in every aspect. The only negative issue could be the 15E breakfast, it is expensive but the breakfast spread is great with any kind of breakfast food you could want.There is also much to see and do in the immediate vicinity, Alexander Platz is just across thestreet.I would highly recommand this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic city, fantastic hotel We have just returned from our first visit to Berlin, and having this hotel as our base for three nights worked out so well for us. Just as described here, it is on a quiet side street, but it's only a few hundred yards to the cafes and bars of the Hackischer Markt which we loved, and very close to the river and the Museum Island in the other direction. We thought we'd be using a lot of public transport, but everything is a lot more compact than we expected, and we went everywhere on foot.We booked way back in March, so I half-expected them to have never heard of us, but checking in went very smoothly, and they even upgraded us to a bigger room than we had originally booked. It had all we needed and we were very comfortable indeed.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, just a couple of drinks in the bar on our first evening. Everyone was very friendly and efficient. Really couldn't fault the place at all - ten out of ten. We are already talking about going back again.

<Content>Wonderful Space! We stayed for (sadly) only one night on the way back from Krakow. The room was more of an apartment in size and amenities. It was clean and beautifully designed with huge airy windows, wooden floor and high ceiling. There was an attractive sitting area to lounge about in and a king sized bed with crisp white cotton bedding. There was a simple kitchenette, modern bathroom and separate extra toilet. A classy, cool and elegant room in a perfect location.

<Content>Great hotel I've just returned from a four night stay at the Alexander Plaza. The hotel is in a quiet street in the Mitte close to a train and tram station and centrally located for Unter den Linden and the TV tower. Once the trains start running in the morning you can hear them from the hotel but I didn't find this too offputting.The hotel room was spacious with all the facilities you expect including a quilt which is unheard of in most UK hotels and a good broadband connection (cost 22 euros per 24 hours). The staff in the hotel were helpful and all spoke excellent English. There is a nice bar and and excellent continental buffet breakfast. There are no irons or ironing boards in the rooms but when I rang reception to ask for one it was delivered to my room within ten minutes. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Berlin.

<Content>Alexander conquers? The location is great, close to the sights but off the main drag.We stayed for 3 nights and booked way in advance, but we ended up with the smallest room on the floor! Room was well appointed being newly done but lacked more than one pillow! With great views over the train station. The window insulation made for a very quiet room.Don't have the hotel breakfast, which is very nice but very expensive at 15 Euros. Much better to go across to the station market and take your choice of cafes eating an excellent breakfast outside at less than half the cost.

<Content>Terrible Hotel The service at the Alexandra Hotel was rude and slow especially on reception. When I sat in the cocktail lounge for a drink, I had to wait for ages to be served (along with several other tables). The staff tend to be young and inexperienced. The single room I had was very small with a sloping roof and despite only having a small single bed, there wasn't even room for for a desk. None of the special touches I am used to a hotel of this rating (I had to ask for toiletries because I had forgotton my shampoo but this is something I normally don't need to concern myself with in a 4 star hotel). No clock radio was provided which meant you had to rely on the facilities provided with the TV but all the instructions for the audio/video equipment are in German and no-one gave me the wakeup call I asked for. The hotel is understaffed and staff's knowledge of English isn't good. All in all a very big disappointment!

<Content>Poor Service Booked at this hotle over a month in advance. Upon arrival was informed that our room was unavailable - 'there was a problem'. We were transferred to another hotel having been told that there has been an issue with their computer (and that 25 other people were also affected). Substitute hotel was poorly located for us and, as a consequence, our first break to Berlin was ruined. Staff at the Alex Plaza were unhelpful and had a 'couldn't care less' attitude. We got the strong impression that 'tourists' were very much secondary to 'business' guests. Very disappointed.

<Content>Good Berlin Hotel A really good Berlin Hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful, the room was in excellent shape and the location is close to the city centre.Wireless/RJ-45 Internet connection was 22 euro per day - a bit expensive but it worked perfectly. Breakfast was 15 euro per person/day (make sure to get it included when booking)Only complaint is that the windows (fancy electrically operated ones at the 5th  6th floor) did not close properly - so the noise in the room coming from the outside was (much) more than expected.

<Content>You won't go wrong Situated near the enormous TV mast (tallest structure in Europe), you always know how far you are away from the hotel. Excellent location in the the heart of the old East sector (which architecturally  culturally far outweighs the boring West), this is a great place to stay. Clean, comfortable, great breakfast, good value. If you're a tourist, take the hop-on, hop-off guided bus tour - its fabulous (you can get on just around the corner). Recommended.

<Content>Couldn't Have Been Better Stayed 3 nites in mid-April. Perfect location in center of Old Berlin. Large well-appointed rooms, especially deluxe executive #506. Particularly enjoyed proximity to outstanding, hip and inexpensive restaurants and bars -- all within a three minute walk. Museum Island a short stroll; easy public transit a few steps from the door. Can't imagine a better place from which to explore all of Berlin.

<Content>Centraly Located Hotel This hotel was a surprise for us as thier website did not do them justice. The hotel is modern with a beautiful lobby that opens unto a very nice restaurant that has outdoor seating. The delicious breakfast is served in the atrium set in an enclosed courtyard. The AP is within walking distance from Alexanderplatz and the historic district of Hackescher H枚fe. Our hotel room looked directly across at the Hackescher Markt, with its many outdoor restaurants as well as shops, bars and nightclubs. One block from the tram and subway, it is an ideal location to explore Berlin.
