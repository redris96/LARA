<Content>Good location for a short trip We've been in the hotel last december for three days to see Berlin and the hotel has a perfect location. It's close to the zoo, the Kurf眉rstendamm and one of the bus routes passing all the main attractions in the centre stops just next to the hotel every couple of minutes. The interior is simple and new, most of the staff very helpful and the rooms are small but nice and clean. Breakfast is okay but nothing special. I'm sure it might be boring after a couple of days because it's the same every day. Furthermore, the hotel provides a car park for 10 Euro per night which seems a bit to much.Nevertheless, we would come back to this hotel as long as we're just going for a city trip.

<Content>What a Find We stayed for four nights in late November and booked it with reward points. We were a bit unsure of what standard to expect for 15,000 per night but as our trip was to enjoy a low cost break before Christmas and to visit the markets we weren't expecting 5* standards. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised. The hotel was bright and clean with the new HE Express colourful branding. The room we were given was slightly larger than usual with a 'wet room' style shower. Of course the room was fairly basic but the bed was very comfortable with clean linen and we had a sofa to sit on. The breakfast was fantastic, with lots of choice breads, croissants, cereals, cheese,meat, eggs, fruit yoghurts etc - all extremely fresh and constantly replenished by helpful staff. They also have a wonderful coffee machine which makes delicious cappachino.The girls on reception were delightful and were very happy to help, either with directions, information and our on-line flight check-in. As priority club members we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar one evening . We have stayed in much more expensive hotels in Berlin on previous visits but will definately return to this one and would have no hesitation in recommending it . Great location too - very central.

<Content>Friendly, Immaculate, Easy To Reach From Tegel We were a little skeptical about booking this hotel using Priority Club Pts. After all, for a mere 15,000 points how good could the place be? But, our faith in Holiday Inn Express was well served as we could not have asked for a better place for our overnight in Berlin. We took the airport bus from Tegel to the Zoo and walked (with only hand luggage) to the hotel. It was about 15 easy, flat minutes and luckily, since it was midmorning, they found us a room promptly. The room was certainly small and the view was nonexistent but the beds were heavenly. Spotless linens and a wonderful duvet were too inviting so we caught a nap before doing our city wandering. Ok, so the little bathroom amenities were in absentia and we only had those impossible to squeeze wall mounted soap shampoo combos. They did the trick and we were exceptionally comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely superb with crisp, flaky croissants, wonderful artisan breads, the usual array of cold cereal, butter, cheese. Very very nicely presented and all delicious. The neighborhood was safe but the other mealtime eating options were limited and the crowded fish restaurant across the street disappointed. From the hotel we were able to walk miles and revisit this fascinating city. As Jews we are always a tad uncomfortable in Germany but the abundant markers throughout the city of crimes against Jews will hopefully be the constant reminders needed to make sure that such events are never repeated. As a matter of fact, directly across from the hotel was a historic site decrying the mass murder of European Jews and the admonition never forget.

<Content>Wonderful find in Berlin.... Having stayed on previous visits in Berlin during the last 12 months at the Swissotel (twice) and the Sofitel by the Zoo, i was recommended the holiday inn express berlin city west by family.I am so glad I listened to their advice. This hotel is a real gem. The rooms are modern, spotless and above all comfortable and the complimentary breakfast set me up for a days sightseeing.Forget the rest-This hotel is everything you need and the price is a BARGAIN!

<Content>Biking to Berlin Travelled to Berlin by motorcycle and stayed in this hotel for 2 nights.First class hotel only a short walk from the city centre and handy for all the major sight seeing points.Rooms excellent as expected as was the buffet breakfast.Parking was available under the hotel but a bit pricey for my liking.Well worth a visit and one place i would stay again if visiting Berlin.

<Content>Very Good Central Hotel Overall, a very good hotel and great value for money. The room was modern, very clean and functional. The bed was Comfortable and the bathroom, although small, was very nicely appointed.Some people here mentioned the lack of a wardrobe, but we found the storage space ample. Enough space to hang a few shirts and fold some clothes.Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room is always a nice extra.Very good continental breakfast and very pleasant staff in the breakfast room.The hotel is also very central with the No. 100 bus stopping outside the door. The only issue we would have, is that we reserved 3 double rooms for 3 couples (the confirmation said that the category was double bed with sofa in room). All 3 parties got twin rooms. A request to change only one of the rooms to the confirmed category met with a very inflexible response (change not possible). Only after much discussion with the receptionist did the category we had booked suddenly become available. Other than the above, we'd have no hesitation about recommending this hotel and will definitely return here the next time we're in Berlin.

<Content>Good, affordable hotel with only minor flaws This hotel is inexpensive but offers a lot for the money: clean, comfortable rooms with modern furnishing and facilities, very good location, helpful staff, complimentary newspaper, coffee/tea maker in the room, air conditioning. When we requested a room change in the middle of our stay (we wanted a quieter room facing the backyard rather than the street), the person at the reception was friendly and handled our request efficiently.Our only, minor complaints: Internet access is expensive (EUR 5 per day); there was no wardrobe in our room, just a rail with a few coat-hangers; the image quality of the TV in our room was very low (very distorted picture); they serve the same kind of cheese (just one single kind) and the same two kinds of sausage every morning.

<Content>All I needed Have just come back from a long weekend in Berlin where we stayed at this hotel. We tend to do long weekend city breaks where our accommodation requirements tend to be the need for a clean comfortable hotel room with the basic necessities in a quiet area within walking distance of public transport or, better still, city sites. This hotel met all our requirements, the rooms and bathrooms are clean, large enough for a couple to sleep, dress, lounge about etc. Bathroom had a shower but no bath. I don't know if they have any rooms with bathtubs. A 5 minute walk, to the zoo and the Kurfuerstendamm where taxis, S-Bahn, U-Bahn or bus services are available. 30-45 minute walk to the Brandenburger Tor and Reichstag. Would recommend this hotel without hesitation to anybody wanting simple, clean affordable accommodation.

<Content>A great place to stay Just returned from our Berlin stay at the Holiday Inn Express City Center West on Kurfurstenstrasse. Great place! Here's why:-Wittenberg Platz U-station a short walk from the hotel.-bus stop to the airport- short walk from hotel-Ku-Dam (major shopping area)- short walk(by U-bahn)-free continental breakfast daily with sandwiches, croissants, coffee, juice, cereal... no need to go anywhere else-AIR CONDITIONING IN YOUR ROOM!!!-comfortable beds-nice room and bathroom-very pleasant view of street-wireless internet (for 5 euros/24 hours)-small bar downstairs-big screen t.v. in lobby if you likeOverall, this is a great location to get anywhere in Berlin. We were there 8 nights and will definately stay here again if possible.The price was right, close to all the transportation and very pleasant atmosphere.

<Content>A disappointing stay I am a frequent visitor to Berlin and like this city very much. Usually I prefer to find a cheaper rate in an expensive hotel, but I am no stranger to Holiday Inn Express. We have seen the hotel being built and anticipated our first stay. What a disappointment it turned out to be! First off, the rooms were truly small. The quality of furniture was bad. The laminate veneer was already peeling off in places. The double bed was too small for two, and the mattress was uncomfortable. The bath was functional, but it's cleanliness left much to be desired: several drops of recent blood as well as a few pubic hair on the floor of the toilet cubicle, suggested that the HOUSEKEEPING WAS INADEQUATE. My reservation confirmation from the IHG (parent group for Holiday Inn) listed: 1 DOUBLE BED WITH SOFA BED NON-SMOKING - 3 PERSON(S) MAX PER ROOM WITH HIGH SPEED INTERNET COLOUR TV WORK DESK WITH LAMP ENSUITE WITH POWER SHOWER TEA AND COFFEE MAKING FACILITY SELF CONTROLLED HEATING HAIR DRYER DUVETS DIRECT DIAL TELEPHONE. You would think that the wireless internet is included in the rate, same as the bed and the TV and the direct dial phone, but no, the hotel demanded a 5 Euro charge for the Internet access. The hotel manager (visible from the reception), would not come out and talk to us, and the clerk would not budge. It was only after the intervention from the Holiday Inn (toll free to Ireland) that the charge came off my account. The hotel does not offer wake up calls, and the skeleton staff looks visibly stressed.I am a top tier member of the Holiday Inn Priority Club, and that review is based on apples to apples comparison with other Express Hotels by Holiday Inn. Not surprisingly this hotel is a franchise operation owned by a small English topmast with a distinct ring of a Ma and Pa operation. I will not stay there again, regardless of rate advantage it might offer

<Content>Good value for money Typical HIE, great for a few nights in Berlin if all you're looking for is somewhere to sleep and have breakfast. Location is fine (Berlin is very cosmopolitan) and although in the Western end of town, transport connections are very good - the 100 bus stops nearby  runs through the Tiergarten, past the Reichstag then along Unter Den Linden to Alexanderplatz; U-Bahn station at Wittenbergplatz (next to KDW store) is 5 minutes walk.True, there are no cupboards, just open shelves/hanging rail, but you pay your money, you make your choice. The place is clean, new  breakfast was good cold buffetDo try the Vietnamese resaurant across the road, we had the 3 course lunchtime menu - soup or salad, chicken  noodles, ice cream scoop - all for EUR6!!

<Content>A Good basic choice of accommodation in Berlin I accidentally found this brand new (opened April 2008) on the Holiday Inn site. The location is ok. We took Bus X9 from TXL to Zoo station then a taxi ride of Euro 6.20 to the hotel.Bus 100 bus stop is closeby, Bus No.100 is a good tranport option to the city and Kurf-damm.A 'pure guy' bar is right next to the hotel. I was not cognizant of that. The area is ok. it's a 5mins walk to Ka-Da-We Dept Store and the U Bahn stationThe hotel room is basic. The photos already posted earlier are very candid. Our room face to the back of the hotel which is v. quiet. there is a sofa bed in our room with a double bed. As others have commented, there is no closet that makes putting things a problem. The bathroom is small but well placed.A flat screen TV is a plus.The complimentary breakfast is with good variety of food, eggs, cold cut, cheese, yoghurt.. fruits.. much better than many motels in the U.S. taking into consideration of paying Euro 76. The hotel got a German sign said Euro 53 and up. Since hotels in Berlin can be costly for some travellers, so this new HIE is a good option for those with a limited budget, provided you don't mind to be in an area with quite a few 'guys' bars.

<Content>Nice hotel, but... We stayed there for 6 nights from April 23rd to April 28. It is a new hotel, rooms are designed carefully. Our bathroom had only a shower, which was fine with us. The WC itself is in the same space but the door can close it leaving the sink and shower free for others to use. Really sophisticated. The room was small-medium in size. What I did not like at all is the there is no wardrobe, only a few open shelves. A desk with no drawer, and only 1 chair. Another chair would be great although the room is small. Staff - young and nice, but when the hotel was full they did not cope so well. We had a problem and it was not dwelt properly. Breakfast - a small buffet with rolls, jams, cereals, salami and cheese and some other items. The same everyday. Thgey did not replentish items fast enough, and many times items were missing for over 20 minutes. Location is very good, with good transport right out of the door, some restaurants and a nice cafe next door. It is suitable for a short stay 1-2 nights, for longer stay it is not that comfortable. Room too small and no where to put your staff.

<Content>Really great hotel I love holiday inn express brand very good value esp when you have children in tow. We stayed 3 nights at this newly opened hotel. Check in was quick and easy and the rooms were lovely and clean. As its been mentioned breakfast can be a little hit and miss but there is plenty of food if you can wait! They seem to be a little late in replacing certain food stuffs but hopefully they will get better at this as time goes on. The breakfast on offer is typical. Warm bread rolls (brown and white) sliced breads for toasting, Crossaints(warm) sliced salami,cheese and turkey/ham. Yogurt, cereals, Jams and boiled eggs. Nice coffee from a machine as well.The staff were lovely and friendly too and the hotel bar served a nice beer!We came from the airport on a late flight and this is how we got to the hotel.We arrived at Schoenefeld airport at 11 p.m and asked at the imformation desk the times of the airport express trains. We then brought tickets (A B and C Zone) from the newsagents inside the airport.The train station is a five min walk across from the airport. We stamped our tickets and boarded the train. At the Zoo Station we turned left and walked towards Berlin Zoo, after the Zoo we continued walking up the Kurf眉rstendamm and the hotel is easy to find. From the Zoo station it is approx a 15 min stroll.

<Content>Non smoking heaven in Berlin Stayed in this brand new 158 room hotel for 3 nights and got a very good deal: 鈧?62.00 per night including a buffet breakfast with a minimum 14 day advance non-refundable reservation. The entire hotel is non smoking which is absolutely wonderful.Location is very good on Kurfuerstenstrasse, about a 10-15 minute walk from Bahnhof Zoo station  Europacenter  5 min from Ka-De-We  U-station Wittenbergplatz.. Bus 100, which runs from Bahnhof Zoo to Alexanderplatz stops 1 block from the hotel. It's a fairly quiet area, mainly residential and with a god mix of different restaurants. Enjoyed an absolutely wonderful dinner at Indian restaurant Mumtaz, only 2 blocks away. Highly recommended !The hotel opened early April this year. Rooms are of average size, equipped with flat screen TV  coffee maker. Beds  pillows are on the firm side, bathrooms are small but well planned  functional. Safe deposit boxes are available free of charge at the front desk. No restaurant on premises, only a bar and a breakfast room. A parking garage is available if you drive.The overall experience was very positive except for a disorganized breakfast service and uneven food supplies. They constantly ran out of bread, boiled eggs, cold cuts, clean cups etc and there was appearently no one in charge of overseeing it all. Instead you had to tell the staff to add missing items which they gladly did but it should not be up the guests to ask for this.Maybe part of growing pains since they only had been open for 2 weeks.Would definitely return !
