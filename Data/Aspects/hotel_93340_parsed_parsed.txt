<Content>Lovely ambience at Elysee I tried the Elysee after the Library Hotel, where I've often stayed , was less than efficient at handling the reservation. The Elysee is less hip but, for me, more convenient and pleasant in its own way. The reservationist asked my preferences and then seemed pleased to offer a room with 2 exposures. With a chandelier, the well-appointed room (comfortable bed!) was peacefully Old New York-y, though the tub was shallow and there was big noise, even 10 floors up, from some semi-continuous garbage operation down 54th. Adding to noise were rambunctious kids on my floor. The front desk offered to address the issue, but, since I was staying only 2 nights, we just made a joke of it. Breakfast and the evening wine offerings were satisfying, in a comfy atmosphere. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful; the hotel supplied an umbrella; and when I traipsed in from my wet wanderings, the Elysee truly felt like a refuge.

<Content>A Comfortable Hotel in New York As a frequent guest over the past ten years, The Elysee is a very conveniently located hotel for both business and pleasure. The amenities are limited but the ones offered are quite nice. The rooms are simple but large and comfortable. Nice upgrade with the new flat screen TVs. The one elevator can at times be a challenge, but in the end, that is not a problem. The staff are very accommodating and the hotel is maintained in a clean and attractive manner. The Monkey Bar was closed, which was a bit of a disapointment, but Bill's across the street is always a fun place for a nightcap. Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Love the Elysee' This stay was our 4th and as the other three stays we enjoyed our stay immensely!

Right in the heart of Manhatten, everything was just perfect. Looking for ward to our next visit next spring.Merci Beaucoup!Maureen and Ray Russell

<Content>Bed Bugs My husband and I stayed for two nights and went home with what our doctor said were bed bug bites. I notified the hotel manager who said he had an exterminator inspect our room, and denied the existence of bed bugs. ??????No offer of a refund or any other type of restitution for medical bills etc. was made by the hotel manager.

<Content>Give Us Your Money Unpleasant and unhelpful front of desk staff. If you are paying by debit card please be aware that you will require the funds for your hotel stay to be fully available at check-in as the desk staff will contact your bank to confirm this. If you do not you will need to pay each night cash in advance or by credit card. Also rooms on the ninth floor at the front of the building do not seem to be sound proofed and are subject to constant noise from rubbish collections on the main street. Room decor is tired and dated and carpets need replacing.In addition the front of desk staff do not wish to accomodate requests for information concerning tours of the city.The main advantage of this hotel is it's central location.

<Content>Wonderful stay I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel Elysee and what a wonderful stay it was. We were a group of 5 women celebrating a belated 60th birthday. Every year we make an overnight stay in Manhattan at Christmastime but this was our first stay at the Elysee and from the looks of things, it won't be our last. Everyone ( from Mr. Avina to the young women who set up refreshments in the Club room) was professional, courteous, and gracious. We had a suite and a double room and were able to close off a hallway door to make a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were large and very comfortable(even the pull-out couch was comfortable). There is a complimentary continental breakfast every morning, delicious cookies and coffee all day, and cheese and crackers, wine and Prosecco in the early evening. Everything was delightful! The location is outstanding, the hotel is outstanding, and most of all the staff is outstanding.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Elysee My husband and I stayed at the Elysee mid-week during December and were quite impressed. The location on E. 54th St. is fantastic and the hotel is reasonably priced by NYC standards. Although our visit would have been special under any conditions (loved the second floor library for breakfast, complementary wine and cheese, newspapers, and all day cookies and fruit), we were overwhelmed when the staff upgraded our room to a suite when we checked in! The suite was absolutely beautiful, with fireplace, dining room table, kitchenette, and large screen tvs. We felt like rock stars! Additionally, the staff could not have been nicer or more accomodating...the doorman offered an umbrella when we went outside and was most helpful hailing taxis. We can't wait to stay here again! We used to stay at the Carlysle, but the Elysee is our new favorite. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Perfect in EVERY way! Stayed there for one night and couldn't find a single thing wrong with this wonderful Manhattan gem!The location is perfect for every NYC attraction....the staff was friendly beyond belief...the room was clean, comfortable, and in good shape...small, cozy, friendly, priced right....a 2nd floor lounge serving coffee, croissants, and hors d'oeuvres in the evening...what else could we ask for? Will absolutely stay there over and over and recommend it to everyone who asks. The Monkey Bar will be up and running by the spring which will be a huge plus!

<Content>Nothing Special My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Elysee for 2 nights in early September. We chose this hotel based on the great reviews it got. However, there really wasn't anything special about this place. I have nothing negative to say about this hotel, however I have nothing positive either. The room was average sized, and the bed was comfortable enough to sleep in. There were no major problems, and the front desk was polite. The restaurant attached to the hotel was closed for renovations while we were there, so we stuck to eating out (the first night we were so tired from traveling we just ate food from the deli across the street. I wouldn't suggest that if you have enough energy to walk down a block or to to an actual restaurant). Also, don't be confused by the minibar. It doesn't really cool things. It's not really a refrigerator. Plus, according to their brochure, if you take something out, it will automatically be charged for it. We read this part after moving things around to put our own drinks in, but we quickly replaced everything and were not charged.So overall, this place is okay. I would definitely recommend finding another place to stay, though, if you can. However, if you won't be spending much time in your hotel room anyway, this place should be just fine for you.

<Content>The City That Never Sleeps . . . Do you know WHY the city never sleeps???? Because its innumerable skyscrapers generate a colossal amount of refuse--all of which must be compacted . . . slowly . . . late at night . . . by jarringly-noisy garbage trucks. Please read on, because I do love this hotel, but if you stay there, ask for a room that doesn't face the street. Though I was located on the 11th floor behind double-paned windows during this visit, the bewitching-hour garbage runs were a bit disturbing. Now, the good news. This was the second time that I have stayed at the Elysee while leading a tour group. I've never had anything but praise from the more than 40 travelers I have taken there, and I wouldn't hesitate to use the hotel again. (I doubt that even the nearby Waldorf-Astoria or St. Regis have been engineered well enough to drown out those cursed trucks.) The location is superb. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. On both stays, I have had a spacious, immaculate, and very nicely appointed room. As others have noted, the second floor lounge/library space is one of the hotel's most pleasing assets. It is the perfect spot to relax and feel at home for a mid-afternoon break with coffee and a newspaper or for a pre-theatre glass of wine and hors d'oevres. (Bonus: the nearby 21 Club offers a prix-fixe, pre-theatre dinner that is both a memorable experience and a good value.)

<Content>Bad experience kills good location The location is excellent but killed by 3 negative things:1) Very old and unsufficient furniture, we paid 600 USD a night and had our suite nr 103 has NO DRAWERS :how can you stay 9 nghts in a room with NO drawers and 6 hangers: part of our clothes had to be remained in bags and suitcases2)No room on street side has correct sound proof windows. And no room on back side has correct lights: you then live quite like in a cellar , the suites faces a wall, and the room inside has poor lights.On the second floor, there is however a nice tea room ,with good sound proof windows: why not the same in the street rooms ?3) People on reception desk are smiling, nice ...and give bad service.They were unable to find out the correct number of tthe Blue Note, the room service brought us one day tea without spoons,the other day cold water ,the next hot water without tea bags...etc etc. At the reception desk,we asked for yoghurts, they answered us we have none, go and buy them yourself at the shop opposite of the hotel

<Content>Understated Perfection We decided to treat ourselves with a 4 star hotel in the big apple  it turned out to be a highlight of our trip.The very friendly staff were always courteous  helpful but not overbearing. For me a hotel is somewhere where you can feel comfortable, safe  you don't feel like asking for anything was a chore  this hotel excelled in these respects. The complimentary internet access, complimentary breakfast, papers  evening wine, cheeses  also coffee 24/7 all made the experience more satisfying. The central location whilst in a quite locality was another plus. Overall I would recommend the hotel for anyone willing to spend a little bit more for a near cast iron guarantee of getting your money's worth.

<Content>Disappointed While the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location terrific, the room left a lot to be desired. Dated/drab furniture, very noisy, no window (lower level floor), and the television (if that is important to you) may have been the smallest/oldest I've seen in a hotel room in awhile. If you stay, consider pushing for a higher level floor away from the stairwell (in order to avoid the noise and get a view - any view).

<Content>Great service, not so great room. We stayed at the Hotel Elysee after reading the great reviews it received. While the location and service were very good, the room was very disappointing with dated furniture. For the price, you can do better - even in New York. With updated room decor and furnishings, we would reconsider staying here again - until then, we will choose another property.

<Content>Hotel Elysee ok The Hotel Elysee has two great assets--its location and the comfortable second floor breakfast room/lounge. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Our king bed room on the 11th floor was cramped, especially the bathroom, and the furnishings and carpet were worn. I was surprised, given the overwhelmingly positive reviews that prompted me to try the Hotel Elysee. The other reviewers apparently had superior rooms, so we may have just had a dated room.

<Content>Lovely stay The Hotel Elysee is a lovely hotel in a great location. We had a deluxe double room which was large and, although quaint, had everything we needed. Our room was at the front of the hotel and, yes, you could hear the street noise but it was in no way offensive and we had no problems sleeping in the comfy beds. Yes, there is one lift and it can be a little slow but it was no hardship. Apart from the location and the friendly staff, the best thing about this hotel is the breakfast in the morning and the wine and cheese served in the evening where you can relax after a long day shopping and sightseeing in NY. We found this facility to be something we looked forward to. There are lots of restaurants in walking distance. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone I know who might be visting New York. If you are in doubt about booking this hotel, don't be as I don't think you will be disappointed.

<Author>Sicilybound
<Content>Their finest hour. What can one add to this huge nuber of extremely positive reviews for this true gem of a Manhattan Hotel? Well, I try.In first place, things went pretty wrong. We coming from Vienna/Austria were on our annual works outing, (overseas and extended this year in order to celebrate full decade birthdays of two of my secretaries) I had booked two double rooms and one suite for our party of six. We were given three double rooms, although I had presented the e-mail booking confirmation at the reception desk. I was assured that the one room with the king size bed was meant to be the suite. It was at the (wonderful) breakfast the other day, when we realized that all of us had been given double rooms. I was pretty upset at this moment, because my intention to reward my secretaries for another year of hard work at my law office seemed frustrated. So I turned to the reception desk, and within little more than five minutes, the helpful man at the reception not only had apologized for the mistake, but also had come up with a solution, we never ever could have dreamt of. Simply amazingly perfect management! My main problem for the rest of our stay was to get me and my party out of this hotel to the streets of NYC. And think, this is a Hotel without a restaurant, without a bar, without a spa, without shops, without so many things other hotels boast of, but with a truly unparalleled combination of competence and atmosphere. And consider further that the streets I am talking about that the five women in my company almost refused to go to were Broadway and Fifth Avenue!Now, if You ask, why such small hotel can rank sixth among approx. 400 other New York hotels, I only can advise you: Find out yourself.

<Content>A review of the Hotel Elysee We have stayed at the Hotel Elysee several times. It is a fabulous hotel with a staff that makes you feel like you actually live there with recognition and hospitality. When I have traveled alone to NYC, I have a sense of security staying here. I always recommend this sweet property to anyone going to NYC. Renay Martin

<Content>Cozy hotel It was the first time we stayed at Hotel Elysee, and it was a excellent choice: it is very close to the Rockefeller, St Patrick's Cathedral and Central Park. Another point is its european style. The highlight was the weekday wine and cheese that hotel served in a cozy room.

<Content>5 Star Price 3 Star service This November 7-11 was my second stay at the Elysee.The event was a girl's 50th birthday celebration. The hotel was right priced at $356.00 per night for my first stay in May two years ago. However, for $515.00/545.00 per night before taxes and fees, the hotel came up short in several areas -decor is a little dated and the furniture in the breakfast area was shabby and missing ameneties such as a fan in the bathroom and more than 1 elevator were significant. Overall the cleanliness of the hotel was excellent but the carpet in our room could used a cleaning. In terms of service the staff were very pleasant. However, the very young getlemen at the desk were not particularly knowledgeable. The turn down service was also lacking- the shades were not drawn and there was no complementary sweet on the pillow. Had the choice of hotel been mine, I would have opted for the newer Palace hotel at the same price or lower.

<Content>Great Suites We recently stayed here for the weekend of 11/14-11/16, we wanted to return again because we feel this is the best hotel for the best price and what you get in NYC. We had a large suite, room 94 the first night, but it was too noisy near the street, so the staff moved us to another suite, room 60, which was perfect, we could not hear a sound. We really enjoy the free evening wine and cheese hours 5-8 pm, Mon- Friday and the nice breakfast every morning in the Club Room and Library. The staff is so nice and accomodating and really go out of their way for you, they had no problem moving all our belongings for us to the new suite. We will always stay here when we travel in NYC, we prefer very small hotels, instead of big chains any day of the week!

<Content>beautiful escape in new york We booked our stay directly with the hotel and upon arrival had a lovely card from the sales director welcoming us for our honeymoon with a box of chocolates. We had a beautiful deluxe king room near the back of the hotel on the 12A floor (not 13). Upon check-in we found Will to be extremely helpful in our concierge needs (even helping to book Mavis Staples tickets at the BB King club in the theater district for an upcoming evening. The bed was ultra comfortable with triple sheeting with a duvet insert and a beautiful coverlet. We were warm enough and even ran the air conditioner just to not get too warm in November. The bathroom was well kept and my only complaint is that they don't offer the towel reuse or any type of conservation measures. Maybe they think clients of a 5 star wouldn't participate, but they should give us the option.Service was attentive but not overly so,and we left the hotel each morning with a smile and a full night's sleep. We only had breakfast once (quite a continental spread) but enough to get us through on our last morning before the car arrived to take us to the airport. The coffee was very good, something that I really look forward to in the morning and yes, coffee, tea and my husband's favorite cookies are available all evening. Wine and cheese was nice with a little bubbly (sparkling wine - a nice touch and also included a vegetable crudite if you're worried about your cholesterol.Wish there was more traditional information in the room on what to see, other than the commercial magazines. Maybe a list of favorites from the staff would be a nice touch. But, we did find with tripadvisor as our source. I also was there to attend a show at the Javits center and found the subway safe and easy to navigate. I was even asked directions in the city, must have looked like i belonged. The city is so easy to get around in and only gets difficult when you get in the southern area where the grid becomes congested. But, we highly recommend the trip as it was all worth it.Bring good, comfortable walking shoes. I thought I had and still had a blister to take home after 5 days.Thank you Elysee for a memorable visit. We look forward to our return.

<Content>Chossing the Elysee justified all the 5 star reviews We spent 6 nights here to celebrate our 39th Wedding Anniversary.We have no negative comments whatsoever, only ones of praise and gratitude. The hotel has a wonderful warm and intimate feel, aided by the most attentive staff in all departments. Our bedroom on the 14th floor (deluxe double) was a luxurious sanctuary when our poor feet could take no more walking. Super King Sized bed, lovely marble bathroom, and solid mature style furniture - like being in a rich friend's country home for the weekend. Rarely did we have to wait long for the lift, and even then we chatted to pleasant guests who were also enjoying their stay there.The breakfast (included in the price) was wonderful every morning, with a huge choice of cold foods and very willing and attentive staff. Both this and the weekday wine and nibbles were served in the Club Room on the first floor, which was large enough to take plenty of the guests, but still retained an intimate feel. The wine and nibbles between 5pm and 8 pm is a generous and inspired idea, as is the perk of being able to drop in here for tea and coffee at any time of the day.. The location is excellent - close enough to the centre of things, but still in a more quiet location than near Times Square. It was possible to walk to some reasonably priced restaurants in the evening, but we felt subway travel was safe, and ventured further afield on our $25, 7 day subway pass with confidence.We will HAVE to try to secure a room at the Elysee on our next stay. I felt obliged to leave the recommended tip that gujde books suggest as we left (both for room staff AND Club Room staff) because of the wonderful time we had been given here.Thank you, Elysee Hotel, and thank you Trip Advisor for leading us to this wonderful place.John and G W.

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else in New York City We are a couple in our 50's. We loved this hotel especially for its location. Walk to Central Park, Broadway, Times Square, Rockefeller Centre and a wide selection of restaurants and bars. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast, which is included in the room rate, is an excellent bonus as is the weekday wine and cheese. We had booked a room and got a suite that had a separate sitting room with couch, chairs, table and mini bar as well as a small bar fridge that you could stock with your own purchases.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A gem of a Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Hotel elysee and very much enjoyed the whole hotel experience. It is a superb little hotel in a fabulous location. Most of the NY familiar attractions are within walking distance. It is a tastefully decorated old style hotel and spotlessly clean. The rooms are large (for a hotel) and has all the mod cons of any high class hotel. The hotel includes breakfast, which we thought we would not avail of, as we planned to have breakfast in the many diners/delis of NY, but the breakfast was so good and in a very relaxing room we ended having breakfast there every morning. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is only one lift to service the building and it is a bit slow, however its not as bad as some people have previously mentioned, your on holidays anyway, so whats the rush!!! Conclusion: I would highly recommend this hotel and will be staying here on my next trip to New York. Mark, Kildare, Ireland

<Content>Loved Hotel Elysee!! My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Elysee in October, We loved everything about the hotel, from the gracious people at the front desk to the housekeeping service. the young ladies who worked the morning breakfast and afternoon wine hours were so very sweet and accomodating. The location is perfect and the two resturants across the street, Oceana and Cellini were wonderful. The hotel staff recommended them and made our reservations for us. I could not have been happier with my stay and look forward to returning. I contacted the hotel directly and the young lady, Ashley, was so very kind in noting our requests. She was able to give us a wonderful room for a special anniversary celebration in our life. I recommend this hotel to anyone regardless of the purpose of your trip

<Content>Great classy hotel We had a great time at this small very classy hotel. Breakfast is included as is wine and snacks during the week and the spread is amazing. They have a deal with a great gym a few blocks away and it is in the heart of the East side. We have another New York trip planned and will definately stay here

<Content>Operalover at the Elysee I travel to New York four or five times through the year to hear performances at the MET and other theaters, and to visit my favorite works of art in the museums and galleries. Not to speak of places to dine. I've tried various hotels on South Central Park, until a friend alerted me to try out Hotel Elys茅e. I went for the first time about three years ago, and have returned ever since. The staff is effective and courteous. The rooms are clean, especially the bathrooms where the plumbing is in excellent shape. The location is splendid. One can cover quite a lot of Midtown Manhattan just by walking out the door. I have adopted the practice of making the reservation for my next stay when checking out, and when that next stay is due, I receive a friendly e-mail reminder. The Hotel Elys茅e has become my New York home away from home, for many years to come.

<Content>Hotel Elysee measures up to reviews Stayed 9-13 Oct 08. This was our first trip to New York. My wife and I took our 2 teenaged daughters for 4 days in NY City. Booked this hotel based on ratings at Tripadvisor. It did not dissappoint: very quaint, great front desk staff with awesome personal service, older but clean rooms, great wine and cheese every night (except weekends), excellent free continental breakfast daily, great beds, called me a fews days in advance to confirm our reservation, booked our car to and from airport. Great restaurants and liquor store right across the street! unbelievable location; 1 block off Madison, Park and 5th Ave. Short walk to Times Square and Central Park. We would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. Hopefully when we return, the Monkey Bar will be open; it's closed till spring '09 for renovation. The only negative is that it's a little noisy at night (welcome to New York): truck deliveries, sirens, etc...bring ear plugs. in truth, this is one of the quieter areas so it's just part of staying in the heart of a big city. I travel a lot and stay mostly in chain hotels. I was very pleased that we chose this hotel and experienced great personal private hotel service. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Perfect stay Three couples met this last weekend in NYC. We chose Hotel Elysee because of the excellent location and its association with Hotel Casablance which we had enjoyed previously. We found ourselves overjoyed with our choice. With rooms on floors 4, 7 and 10, we each appreciated how quiet it was....a real find in NYC. The lounge was the perfect meeting place for us all weekend....breakfast ample and delicious, wine in the evening accompanied by wonderful snacks and each day plenty of copies of The New York Times. We had an enjoyable casual Italian meal directly across the street at Cellini. The staff was helpful in all respects...storing our luggage, giving directions and even providing wine and chocolate due to a mixup in rooms. Can't imagine choosing a different hotel when we return to New York.

<Content>New York City Gem Our stay at the Hotel Elysee for 4 nights was absolutely perfect. The location, the charm and character, the service and the courteous staff made our trip all the better. The fact we could slip across the road to Bill's Gay Nineties Restaurant and Piano Bar added to the success of our trip. We will always come back to the Hotel Elysee when in New York City and it is the only hotel we would suggest to others looking to book in NYC. It is a quiet, intimate and sophisticated gem.

<Content>Awesome! This is our second trip to NYC. We stayed in Affinia 50 in 2006 and decided to check out Hotel Elysee this time. It was awesome.The staff are VERY courteous and accomodating. I called them to request a balcony (during booking) and although the lady that I spoke to could not promise it at that time, I did get a balcony on the 14th floor. There was a bottle of red wine waiting for us and chocolates! A nice treat to a couple celebrating an anniversary.Our room was certainly lovely. It smelled of gardenia...Our bed is comfy and there is a fridge available. Also got a high-end flat-screened tv. The Hotel offers a scrumptious breakfast on the second floor each morning. Healthy choices starting from the huge bowl of fresh fruits. The staff continously replenished the food and maintained the place immaculately clean. Our experience with Hotel Elysee is 100 percent positive! I highly recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Unforgettable stay at the Elysee Hotel New York We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Elysee Hotel.The outstanding service and hotel room both exceeded our expectations. The fact that this is a small Boutique hotel only added to our excellent overall impressions. The breakfast and early evening aperifitif were unexpected and greatly added to our enjoyment. We shall certainly return to the Elysee Hotel on our next trip to the USA.

<Content>Perfect place to stay in NY We have stayed at the Hotel Elysee seven times in the last seven years and always look forward to going back. It is a wonderful hotel in an ideal, yet quiet location that is convenient to everything in NY. The rooms are comfortable, tasteful and always in excellent condition. The staff is friendly, courteous and always helpful. We really enjoy the complimentary continental breakfast in the lounge. I have recommended this hotel to friends and family and will continue to do so. It is the perfect place to stay in NY.

<Content>We Will Return We have just returned from our first trip to NYC. We spent four days/nights and loved the Hotel Elysee, mainly for its great location. Staff was very accomodating when we requested a room on an upper level at the back as our first night on the fifth floor was disrupted due to garbage trucks and street noise. Everything else about this boutique feeling hotel was excellent. It was recommended to us by friends and we know others who have stayed there and they return as well.

<Content>Hotel Elysee is a very special place!! From the moment you arrive, you're made to feel special and given one-on-one top notch service. We were pleasantly surprised to learn of an upgrade upon our arrival. Our room was spectacular (although no true view). Every member of the hotel, regardless of their 'role' were knowledgeable and extremely courteous. The character of the hotel is truly one of a kind!

<Content>Hidden gem in New York This is my second time here. Quiet; rooms are nice and clean. Rather small and personalized hotel. No hoards of people but no hotel store, no big lobby. Bathroom works well- shower is great. Excellently located. Friendly staff. Quick check-in and check-out. Some trouble using the web-site reservation system. Executive lounge (available to all) is comfortable; breakfast is limitd but of good quality- good coffee. The restaurant: Monkey Bar is closed for renovations, but plenty of good restaurants within 150 yards. Hotel priced just right and also seems to price more evenly- without wild price swings according to occupancy, which I appreciate.

<Content>Fantastic Stay at Hotel Elysee My family and I stayed at the Hotel Elysee in New York City for 2 nights and really loved it. We have 2 children ages 9 and 12. The rooms were kept meticulously clean and the hotel staff were very helpful with suggestions for dinner as well as providing great directions for getting around the city on the subway. A courteous and friendly hotel staff definitely makes one's stay more enjoyable.The hotel is in a great location and convenient to everything. My wife and daughter caught a Broadway musical and my son and I caught the subway out to Yankee Stadium. Both very easy and convenient to get to from the hotel. The hotel even had loaner umbrellas for guests to use since it did rain quite a bit while we were there. The complimentary breakfast included with our room was fantastic and one less thing to worry about during our stay.We stayed in a suite and it was very spacious with luxurious amenities. The kids slept on the hide-away bed in the family room sofa while my wife and I slept peacefully in the nicely decorated bedroom. Although we did not have a chance to use the kitchen inside the suite due to our schedule while in town, we could have made a home-cooked meal right in our room had we wanted to.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York City, whether on vacation or business.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay We had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel. The location was great. The check-in procedure was very efficient. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.The club room was a real bonus as it provided a place to relax, with free coffee and snacks, overlooking the street without having to venture out into the Midtown crowds. The only problem was that the hairdrier in the bathroom didn't work. We reported that to reception and a replacement was provided.

<Content>Why stay anywhere else? We have stayed here several times and we have never been disappointed. The rooms are large and this time we had a room with a beautiful outdoor patio. It's location is great. It's close to the theater district , great stores, and several subway lines. The staff is very friendly and professional. The complimentery continental breakfast is amazing. There are a large variety of fresh fruits, breads and cereals. this would cost $30 anywhere else. The same holds true for the wine and cheese every weekday evening. All of this in a lovely sitting area and library with free internet connections. My wife and I are already looking forward to our next stay there. This is simply a very charming and wonderful place to stay.

<Content>great place They gave us a very spacious room since we needed a crib for our toddler. Staff made every effort to accommodate all our requests, including microwaving food in the evening for our daughter and making a number of excellent suggestions for dining. I definitely recommend this hotel, even if you are traveling with children.

<Content>Great Hotel with little extras Hi,I Spent two night here with my wife on Fri 15th  Sat 16th August. Rooms were very spacious with their own kitchen area and seperate hallway which made the room bigger. There was plenty of wardrobe space with an iron and ironing board. An excellent added feature is the wine and or'dovres that are served on week nights only, also the free breakfast provides an excellent start to the day without having to fish around looking for somewhere to have breakfast. The one issue I had was that the Monkey Bar is under renovation and was not open and this was not advertised on their website.the location is excellent, beside Park Ave. and about a 10 min walk to Times Sq.

<Content>Wonderful, wonderful! This was our fourth trip to the City and wanted to stay somewhere quiet and peaceful - unlike most chain hotels! We took our eleven year old son so we could go see Yankee Stadium and the New York Waterfalls. My son raved about the hotel. Wanted to know when we were coming back and said that he didn't want to stay anywhere else. He actually wanted to stay all day in the room. I would have also but you can't do that in Manhattan!! We enjoyed the view from our hotel windows. My son especially loved the little deli across the street - perfect for a quick bite to eat at the sidewalk park maintained across the street from the hotel. The breakfast was great and the rooms were fantastic! I loved the bedding and pillows. The tv was a little small but while we were there, we saw stacks of flat screen television boxes being unloaded. Looks like an upgrade is coming soon!Very disappointed that the Monkey Bar was closed but don't despair - it is under renovation. We are already planning on another trip and I know just where I will stay!

<Content>Stay here! My daughter and I stayed at the Elysee from 9 - 15 August, and would recommend it to anyone planning a visit to New York.Rooms are spacious and clean, the complimentary canapes and wine on weekdays are a nice touch, but the superb location of the hotel and the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff made it a fantastic first trip to New York for us. We'll be back!

<Content>A wonderful stay - could not have been better My husband and I stayed at the Elysee hotel from July 30th to August 5th. Having done a massive amount of research on NYC hotels, and having stayed in the city three times previously, we wanted to stay somewhere away from the hustle and bustle of Broadway but within reach of all NYC's best attractions. The Elysee's location was superb as all of the 5th/Madison/Lexington Avenue shopps plus Central Park were minutes away and Broadway was either a ten minute walk or a short subway ride away. The hotel has a convenient subway station located at the back of the block it sits on.Our room was located on the 11th floor and we arrived to a very prompt and polite welcome. As it was to be our honeymoon, and the hotel were aware of this through their booking online service, after we had entered our delightful hotel room, we were pleasantly surprised by the gift of a bottle of Prosecco and some superb chocolates sent up by the management of the hotel, wishing us their congratulations.Our room was always kept beautifully clean, the maid always serviced the room whilst we were out on our many visits around Manhattan. The room was spacious and had a very elegant feel to it. The windows were double glazed. we were at the front of the hotel and were never disturbed by road/traffic noise (although if visiting NYC you would probably expect this). The aircon does make a noise but its hardly something to complain about. we stayed in NYC during 32 degree heat and were not disturbed by the airconditioning as this is something again you would expect to hear and it is entirely under your own control.The breakfast/evening wine and cheese were also excellent and had plenty to choose from, the club room was such a lovely area to sit and relax in.Overall, I cannot fault our stay at this hotel. The staff were extremely professional and could not do enough to help us on a daily basis yet were not intrusive. Any concerns/questions were met with a serious yet friendly response and all staff always met us with a smile and a hello, which can often be very hard to find in such a city. On future visits, my husband and I will only stay here and have recommended this hotel to many of our friends who are thinking of paying NYC a visit.Thank you Elysee!!!

<Content>Quaint Yet Elegant My husband used Trip Advisor to find a hotel for our 25th anniversary trip and it did not let us down with this elegant boutique hotel right in the heart of the city. Hotel Elysee is in a great location and the staff is extremely accommodating and friendly.The room was large (especially by NYC standards), clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. There was even a small bar area with a refrigerator. The king sized bed had luxurious linens and slept like a dream.We enjoyed the weekday evening drinks and appetizers on the 2nd floor club room area. It was a nice touch before heading out to a play or dinner. The continental breakfast was great too--especially in a city hotel! There were servers there to make sure everything was attended too--they even toasted the bagels and brought them to you.We asked for a late check out due to the time of our flight and were graciously given 3 extra hours and then they stored our luggage until time to hail our cab to the airport and back home again. We will definitely stay at the Hotel Elysee when we return to NYC!

<Content>Wonderful place--elegant Absolutely beautifully decorated, spacious, and beautiful vew from verandah. Magnificent bedding. Steinway was an incredible amenity (needs a bit of tuning), but a joy to play!

<Content>Hotel Elysee- many pluses and a few minuses My daughter and I just returned from New York, where we spent five days at the Hotel Elysee. This small hotel is located in Midtown East, which gives it easy access to most destinations in Manhattan, including the museums along Upper Fifth Avenue, the theatre district and many restaurants. Shops along Park and Lexington Aves, including Bloomingdales, are also very close.We enjoyed our stay, appreciating the pleasant staff and the bright dining area where guests could gather for a substantial continental breakfast. Coffee and tea and fresh fruit were available all day, with wine and cheese in the late afternoon. Our blessedly quiet room had plenty of space,- always a plus in New York- consisting of a foyer with an ample closet and marble-topped dresser and a good-sized bedroom. There was a pretty , well-maintained bathroom off the foyer . There were a few disappointments. The carpeting was pretty worn and had a few stains and, though I want to emphasize that the bedding and towels were impeccably fresh, I did wonder when the elaborate drapes had last been cleaned. I also noticed that the television set was ancient, with a very small screen. I don't go to New York to watch TV but I was ill one day and found it disappointing that a better set had not been provided. The single elevator was comically slow, as it seemed to be determined to go all the way up to the top floor before returning to the lobby.Although I think our room was overdue for renovation, the hotel is well-run and should still have a lot of appeal for travelers who are looking for a more intimate, European feeling than the large chains can provide.

<Content>Hotel Elysee is my home away from home Although I am now living in California, New York is where I was born and I go back at least twice a year to NYC to see friends and be part of the city life. Hotel Elysee is where I have been staying for the last 10 years - it feels like my home away from home. I love everything about it especially its history and location. The second floor club room is a great place to meet my friends and I love reading the NY Times on a Sunday morning. The staff is gracious and the rooms remind me of being in Europe. I always enjoy my stay there.

<Content>A small boutique hotel in the middle of the big apple My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Elysee for two nights in late July. True to TripAdvisor reviews, the hotel is just beautiful. The location is excellent, the service very good, the rooms beautiful and I might even say spacious (for New York City...).We asked for a room on a top floor and away from the elevator and received just that. Room 152 on the 15th floor. Truly quiet, and quaint - it actually reminded us of a romantic hotel we stayed at in Venice, Italy.Breakfast was very nice. The snacks in the evening a bit disappointing (but still a nice touch).Only two small drawbacks: there is only one elevator and you may find yourself waiting for it for a couple of minutes. Secondly, we asked for a late check-out and they granted us 30 minutes only (over an hour is charged at $100).

<Content>Just wonderful!! The Elysee is a truly superb little hotel in midtown Manhattan. The location is perfect, the staff could not be more friendly and helpful, the rooms are elegant, the bed, bath and linens are gorgeous, and the price is quite reasonable for NYC. My daughter and I spent 6 days here, and it was simply wonderful. Especially in the summer, the name hotels with their large lobbies can become engorged with masses of folks waiting for their tour leaders or their buses. The Elysee has a very small entry lobby, but an elegant large room on the second floor, where a daily complimentary breakfast and evening cocktails are served. The quality of the complimentary nightly wine and cheese (not available on the weekends) is excellent. There is no little coffee maker in the room - but every type of tea, coffee, cookies and fruit are available to guests 24/7 in the 2nd floor lounge. There are no stains on the carpets, the French provincial furniture is covered in elegant silks, and the rooms are decorated with lovely old and antique furnishings. We loved our stay at the Elysee - and, of course, we'll be back.

<Content>Hotel Elysee, FANTASTIC Of all the hotels we have stayed in over our forty years of marriage , Hotel Elysee had to be the most pleasant, rooms, food and most importantly the staff. Restaurant reservations were made and confirmed for us in advance of our arrival. We could have paid double for a room and not received as good service. The location on 54th street is ideal. We plan a January visit and will stay at the Hotel Elysee.This hotel is a must when you visit New York.RegardsElaine  Ron

<Content>A very special hotel Our trip to Manhattan was a very special one as I was taking my parents to visit with my brother and his family who they had not seen in over 7 years. The Hotel Elysee was highly recommended by a friend and business colleague. The fact that the staff called me the day before my departure to confirm my visit was rather impressive. Once we got there it was very evident that attention to detail and first class service was the order of the day.The staff in every instance was outstanding in their delivery of service and went out of their way to be helpful. I would like to congratulate Mr John Avina the GM for heading up such a remarkable team. The location was also idea, we were able to walk to the shops and several great restaurants. Whenever we did need a cab, Tony and the rest of the doormen were always on hand. The suite was spacious and more than adequately met our requirements. The breakfast staff were always prompt and so willing to please.I have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel and would certainly consider it for a return visit.

<Content>Great Hotel The hotel is clean, comfortable, well-located and has a great staff. We were upgraded to a suite, which really spoiled us - large sitting room, dining table, small kitchenette and separate bedroom.The breakfast was a nice size and actually pretty good.A slight warning - the bed is on the hard side. I thought it was fine, but my husband thought it was uncomfortable. The only other complaint we could come up with was that the TVs didn't get all of the channels they were supposed to. We didn't complain to the staff about it because we spent very little time actually watching it. Despite those 2 small complaints, I'd still definitely recommend it.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Elysee was recommended by a family friend who is known for his excellent taste so I knew this would be a wonderful experience. The service was outstanding, especially the breakfast/snacks and the people at the front desk. They gave my mom and me wonderful recommendations for restaurants. I will agree with other reviewers that the rooms are in need of an update as far as decor is concerned. The hairdryers mounted on the wall are the old ones that look like vacuum hoses. My solution to that problem was to ask the front desk for a hairdryer, which was then promptly delivered to my room. The location of the hotel is ideal for those who want to see plays, walk in Central Park and shop Madison and 5th Avenues. The Subway is just around the corner, so access to the rest of the city is easy.

<Content>Best hotel in New York City Its been a little over one week since my stay at the Hotel Elysee. I was so happy with my stay that writting a possitive review is the least I can do. It was my second trip to N.Y.C. with my granddaughter. She just turned 16, and as her birthday present I planned a trip to New York for the Bon Jovi concert. Everything had to be perfect, especially the hotel. I spent several weeks deciding on a hotel near mid-town/central park area. I read all the reviews and checked out all the hotels and kept comming back to the Elysee. It had the best location, for the money, and the best reviews. I wasn't disapointed and can't thank the staff enough for such unreal customer service. This is what impressed me. I get an instant e-mail confirmation. Then within 3 days of travel they again contact me by phone to confirm my reservation. Then the biggest problem turned out to be a blessing. My room was on the noisey side of the street, and was given a queen bed insted of my requested king. They offered to relocate me the next day to a king 3 floors up. The next day, the garbage trucks come at 5:30 am, everyday, and while I was site seeing they call to let me know my room was ready and up graded to a suite . They were always polite and seemed to care about they're customers. And even displayed alittle sence of humor.  As for the room, clean and spacious, even the Queen rooom was nice. Large by N.Y. standards with spacious baths. They had an old time hair dryer, witch didn't work but was quickly corrected by bringing us a hand held dryer. Again excellent service. The suite was breathtaking, 2 tv's and soft, extremly comfortable king sized bed, and, every quite! I loved my stay, and strongly reccomend this hotel for anyone traveling to N.Y.C. I will diffenately return, and again I'd like to take everyone connected to the Hotel Elysee.

<Content>Great stay at The Hotel Elysee We just returned from a five night stay at the Hotel Elysee. We had read all the wonderful reviews they have received and were hopeful that they were accurate. Everything is true. We had two connecting rooms, guaranteed by the hotel for our college-aged sons and ourselves. One room had two double beds and the other a king. The rooms were lovely and spacious. They were private and quiet although only on the fourth floor. We had read that the rooms might be noisy but there was very little street noise and a nice street view. The location of the hotel is great. The breakfast and the wine and cheese in the club room are wonderful. This made our stay truly relaxing. We could go to the club room at anytime also for cookies, tea and coffee. Also the free internet in the rooms and computer in the club room are a great value considering that most New York hotels charge for this service. We had an air conditioner burn out in our room and it was fixed promptly with very courteous service. The front desk staff and bellman were always helpful and very nice. Overall it was a great experience and we will return.

<Content>Fabulous experience Originally were supposed to stay 4 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but had to cut the trip short and only able to stay one night. On arrival, were told we'd been upgraded to a suite. It was beautiful and service at every step was excellent. The club room where complimentary cocktails and continental breakfast are served is very pleasant and comfortable. The Elysee atmosphere is definitely old world European and the furnishings and decor reflect that - very pretty. Not inexpensive - but good value for the money. We hope to return to Hotel Elysee.

<Content>Still a winner... We have been staying here for years and it is always our first choice. Small, safe, well located...it is a gem. Rooms are on the small side, but adequate. The amenities of the hotel make up for it. Adult oriented and very international. Hope to go back.

<Content>Great hotel and location Stayed for three nights after checking many hotels in Mid-town Manhattan. Rooms were clean, could use new carpet. A/C somewhat noisy. Staff and location made up for this. Complimentary continental breakfast could be easily upgraded to include a couple of hot items, such as oatmeal, eggs other than hard-boiled, and a toaster would be nice for the bread offered. Complimentary wine and cheese should be offered on weekend nights also. Would recommended and stay again, compared to nearby hotels.

<Content>Wonderful Stay My wife and I stayed at the Elysee for 7 nights in June. The stay as wonderful, with excellent care shown by the hotel staff.Breakfast was provided daily at the lounge. I shouldn't be complaining, but I guess about the only issue I have with this was the lack of variation when it came to the breakfast buffet menu. Otherwise, as I have said, my wife and I was given perfect service, and we would certainly stay there again if we do visit NY.

<Content>Excellent but could be better This is a wonderful property in a good location in Manhattan. The staff were very accommodating, and our suite was very comfortable. There were two things that kept me from rating this as excellent. First, the club room, which is where continental breakfast and afternoon wine and hors d'oeuvres are served, both complimentary, is understaffed. As a result, tables are not bussed in a timely manner, and it was often difficult to find a place to sit at breakfast. Second, the hotel does not have a fitness facility on premises. They have an arrangement with a health club several blocks away, and although that might not be uncommon in Manhattan, I still think that is a negative. Otherwise, our stay there was very enjoyable.

<Content>Our favorite hotel in NYC I brought my daughter to NYC this past weekend for her 10th birthday and we stayed at the Hotel Elysee, as our family always does when we come to NYC. We have stayed at a variety of Manhattan hotels over the years, but once we had been to Hotel Elysee a few years ago, we never have stayed anywhere else, whether it is my husband and I travelling together or one or both of us with one or both of our daughters (now 10 and 13). The hotel is lovely, the staff courteous and helpful --- and the location couldn't be more convenient.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel The Hotel Elysee is well located in Mid-town. The room was lovely and very comfortable. We especially liked the breakfast and cocktails on the 2nd floor. The staff was courteous and professional and our every request was met. I left an item in the room and it was sent to me the next day. We will definitely return to Hotel Elysee.

<Content>Loved the Elysee! The room was HUGE. The staff anticipated our requests. The bell man arranged tentative airport transport without our asking. We had only to approve his choice.Since our flight didn't leave until 8 pm, the use of the club room and a place to change our clothes transformed the last day of our honeymoon.We had moved over from the Waldorf (having wanted to try it once in our lives)--no comparison. How can they get away with charging 50% above the Elysee?We want to come back, they made us feel more than at home!

<Content>Loved the Elysee We have stayed at several hotels in NYC but the Elysee is by far and away the best. The room was excellent and we had a fantastic terrace which was great as the weather was good. Continental breakfast is ok, filling, with a good selection. Free wine and canapes in the evening is a definite bonus! The room we had was a double and definitely not small, in fact by NYC standards, it was positively spacious and the bathroom was beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. The staff were absolutely fine, very helpful and friendly. We tried the Monkey Bar and restaurant in the hotel, and would definitely recommend this. Some of the dishes were unfamiliar (although we are widely travelled) but our server was really knowledgeable and helpful when it came to choosing our dishes. We had a good meal and will go again.Also, the location of the hotel is excellent and contrary to other reviews on TA, we did not find it noisy. I am really glad we cancelled our Hilton reservations and chose this hotel instead - we will definitely book again!

<Content>What an experience! This was our second stay at the Elysee. The staff was helpful and friendly. Our room was lovely. The breakfast is included and has wonderful baked goods, fruit, cereal and hard boiled eggs. On weekdays, there is a complimentary wine and cheese served. The location could not be better for all the sights in and around Midtown. For the location, the price is right! We will be back.

Upon arrival, we were received by the most uncourteous front desk person I have never encountered in my long years of travelling. I had a question on the hotel debiting my credit card of the overal bill in advance, question to which that person answered that if I did not like it, I could go to another hotel in NYC ! Since the cancellation notice was 48 hours, we left the hotel after two days stay. I had asked to see the hotel manager, who, of course, never showed up.A part of this extremely unpleasant experience, the hotel is just very, very average. Location is OK, hotel is quite noisy. Breakfast was mediocre, and the so-called evening drinks were nothing but an indifferent wine with cheap cookies.Needless to say will never return to that place again.

<Content>Enchanting Elysee My husband and I were enchanted by the Hotel Elysee during our two night midweek stay. We chose the hotel solely because of its proximity to the Museum of Modern Art. Little did we know we would fall in love with nearly everything about the place.If you've ever stayed in a small hotel in Paris offseason, you know how it feels to have all the benefits and privacy of a hotel stay with the warmth and hospitality of a visit with good friends (who also happen to have a lovely home).The moment our taxi driver dropped us off a couple of hundred feet short of our hotel, the Elysee bellman rushed over to welcome us and take our luggage off our hands. When we walked into the lobby, four fresh smiling faces greeted us from behind the reception desk. These young men and women couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, and I swear they never go home or sleep! Our room was on the seventh floor and faced the street. It was small but impeccably decorated and laid out. There was a wee bit of street noise but nothing unusual or jarring. We had a gracious sitting area where we enjoyed a bottle of champagne, a desk (with free Wifi) overlooking the great architecture of E. 54th St., a handsome marble bathroom with a terrific shower, a very, very comfortable bed, and tons of closet and drawer space. After long days of sightseeing, dining and shopping, we enjoyed coming home to sit a spell in the second floor library and dining area. There's nothing like some coffee, cookies, and a few minutes of quiet time on a comfy couch to reinvigorate you before a big night out on the streets of NY. The daily breakfast and happy hour were simple, but gracious, touches that added to our comfort and relaxation.The Monkey Bar next door was a great place to meet friends before heading out for dinner -- everyone in NY seems to know that spot.We've visited New York 10-12 times over the years, and we try a new hotel each and every time. After this trip, I no longer feel the need to do that -- I'm ready to make a commitment. My husband and I agree that we will return to Hotel Elysee -- at last, we've found our little New York home.

<Content>Elysee is great option Always love the location of the Elysee. Staff was friendly and concierge helped to make dinner reservations. Room  bathroom were on the small side and could use updating. Would stay here again...for the right price!

<Content>European feel, good Manhattan value Our family stayed at the Elysee over Memorial Weekend. We had two rooms, one in front on the 4th floor, and one in the rear on the 8th floor. Neither had a terrace or any special feature. The lower front rooms should be avoided due to noise. The windows are single glazed and every street noise comes in, almost amplified at times--conversations across the street could be heard, but garbage pick-up was the worst. ASK FOR UPPER AND REAR!!!That being said, the hotel is very well located in midtown, and is a good value for Manhattan. It felt very like a smaller European hotel--smallish rooms, but well kept. Minimal lobby, but pleasant concierge and bell staff. The breakfast buffet was nice--not special--but the staff went out of their way to help--toasting bagels and so forth. The weekday wine and cheese hour is also nice--I wish it were on the weekends as well!The Monkey Bar restaurant was fun. The food is Asian fusion, served family style, and is quite good. I have no idea why Open Table limited available reservations to 6:30 and 8:15--we went into an absolutely empty restaurant! I also did not sense any dress code (jackets for gentlemen) on the weekend--it seemed quite low key. I recommend the Elysee for a good midtown value and a small, European style stay.

<Content>Excellent Boutique Hotel We selected the Hotel Elysee for our 10 year Anniversary. We have stayed at other upscale hotels in the city but liked the warmth and the intimacy of this property. The staff was very gracious and welcoming. The only minor difficulty was getting a taxi for dinner. (Leave extra time for the bellman to hail you one!!!)We will definately return to this hotel.

<Content>Elysee A Disappointment I expected a luxury hotel and not a step back in time. While the hotel may have been a jewel some years ago, at not time do I expect to encounter dust (on top of the armoire and on the headboard). Lighting was dim everywhere, the elevator was slow in arriving every time and the bathtub had all the height of a wine bottle. The hairdryer had tubing attached to it that looked like central vacuuming and I wondered if they had Ernestine on the switchboard somewhere. The continental breakfast was nice enough but for the price, I was very disappointed in the hotel.I'd asked for a room on a high floor to avoid street noise and was not given one although I booked more than a month in advance. The noise was noticeable immediately. I asked to be moved and was put on a lower floor facing the 'courtyard' which is a large grouping of fan coil units which was noisier than the traffic had been. My planned four night stay turned into a one night stay and a search for something nicer. I found it at The Millenium Broadway which exceeded expectations.

<Content>Elysee = Perfection New York City is the epicenter for so many of the world's finest things: food, fashion, business and finance, etc. So it always stuns me when I see chain restaurants and hotels packed with tourists when so many unbelieveable options exist to truly have that quintessential New York Experience.My wife and I came here for a week long vacation and to visit family. We chose the Elysee for its close proxmity to shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. It came through in every way imaginable. The rooms were clean, elegant, and comfortable. The staff was incredibly accomodating and offered world class service. When you stay at the Elysee, you really feel like a guest in a someone's home instead of some drone in some 40 story monolith with a fanny pack and an I heart NY t-shirt on. John the general manager personally went out of his way to make sure we had the best vacation possible. It was that small attention to detail that truly made our vacation as relaxing and memorable as it could be.PROS: Close to subway, world class restaurants, shopping, Central Park, excellent service without being overbearing, clean and comfortable rooms, free breakfast, free happy hour with wine and snacks, SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICECONS: The hotel could not do anything about it raining our last day there.Rest assured, the Hotel Elysee will meet your expectatios and more. If you have never been to NYC, do NOT eat at TGI Friday or Crapplebee's, do NOT stay at some chain hotel. Stay at the Hotel Elysee and revel in the outstanding service, quality rooms, and perfect location.

<Content>Fabulous find in Manhattan Our 6-night stay at the Hotel Elysee was all we had hoped forand more! Our room (junior suite, no. 144) was perfect -- including THE most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in! The entire staff was attentive, gracious, courteous and helpful, from the concierge crew to the young women who delivered our room service breakfasts to the doormen and bellmen. The location is unbeatable -- close to all the shopping anyone could want, plus Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and many terrific restaurants.An added bonus is the Monkey Bar restaurant downstairs -- we ordered room service dinner two nights we were there and marveled at the quality of the food. We are from California's Wine Country, a bastion of fine dining, but no meal we've had in Sonoma or Napa rivaled what Chef Christopher Cheung is turning out at the Monkey Bar. Bravo!Having walked through the likes of the Waldorf-Astoria, the Palace and other grand hotels nearby, we would still opt for the boutique charms of the Elysee. Having such a lovely and comfortable place to return to after each day's adventure made our New York sojourn special indeed. Worth EVERY penny.We look forward to our next trip to Manhattan, and will definitely plan to stay at the Elysee.

<Content>Perfect in every way! We just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel Elysee, chosen on the basis of these reviews. What can I say besides perfect in every way? Fabulous location, first-class restaurants all within walking distance (and even across the street), adorable ambiance, lovely spacious room, European feel, fantastic breakfast and week-night wine and cheese reception that comes with the price of the room, a reasonable price for that great a location, helpful but not overly cutsey front desk staff, free internet, I could go on and on. Suffice it to say that we will now be staying at Hotel Elysee on every NY trip. Never have to stay in another over-priced large chain again. I would only recommend booking well in advance since this hotel gets consistently great reviews.

<Content>Great location  Hotel Elysee is the third of the four HK Hotels at which I've stayed in NYC (Library Hotel  Casablanca Hotel are the other two). All have offered reasonable rates (by NYC standards), with some very nice amenities not usually found for that price (extended continental breakfast  evening wine reception). The room at Hotel Elysee (which is in a very convenient location in midtown) was the largest of the three hotels  very clean (my FIRST  most important criterion). While the AC/heating unit was a bit noisy, I could find no other fault with the room. Comfortable bed, quiet, beautiful marble bathroom, large closet, complimentary robes, etc. Staff was very pleasant, although having been to the city many times, I did not ask for restaurant or other types of recommendations/conceirge services.Considering the large chain hotels (Hyatt, Marriott, Hilton) had rates that were almost twice the cost of the Hotel Elysee--with very little/no charm, I would never stay at one of those again as long as I could get a room here.

<Content>Up to our expectations An excellent stay at the Elysee. We had a wonderful large room on 14th Floor which had a balcony and view which was just what we asked for. The breakfast and afternoon cheese and wine were really enjoyed. The hotel is ideally situated close to main attractions and Central Park and just across the road from Metro but in a very quiet road. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great value  We made our reservation based on other Trip Advisor reviews and were very impressed with the hotel. It is an excellent location in the heart of things yet tucked away so that is quiet. We stayed on the 14th floor and our room had a beautiful, large balcony. We knew hotel rooms in NYC were expensive and thought that we would get an average room for big price, but we both feel that the hotel far exceeded our expectations. The quality of the furnishings and bedding and amenities are top-notch. The helpful and knowledgeable front desk crew were able to provide us with good information and recommendations. The breakfast and afternoon refreshments were top quality. Also having free access to the internet in our room and access to a computer in the breakfast room was a huge plus. We will definitely stay here on future trips to the city and will highly recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>One of the best in NYC - You'll love it If you like French style, you'll love this hotel. This is one of my all time favorites in NYC. The hotel is very conveniently located for everything in midtown. You can walk to most shops and attractions. The rooms are very traditional. Bathrooms are beautiful with wonderful thick towels. Complimentary breakfast is served in the Club Room every morning and they also offer a complimentary wine and cheese reception late afternoon to early evening. Other beverages and snacks are also available free of charge. It's a great way to relax late in the day after seeing the city. This hotel feels like a home away from home and we chose it because of the traditional look. Fun place to stay.

<Content>Underwhelmed vs expectations We expected more for our ~$375 a night. While our room was fair sized (for NY standards) and had a nice bathroom, there were some issues with the property. First, the heating system in our room was extremely noisy when it kicked in. We were awakened every night at least once as the heater/radiator clunked and clinked into action. Second, with only 1 elevator for the entire hotel and 15 floors of rooms, we always waited several minutes for the elevator to arrive. Last, the bed linens were clean, but scratchy - again not quite up to snuff for the price.On the plus side, the morning breakfast was a great convenience. And the afternoon wine and cheese was a nice surprise.

<Content>We loved Elysee Hotel We were looking for a 4 stars hotel because I went with my girlfriend last June.One of things I liked more was the location and that it was built on the first of 20th century it has been refurbished at all.We made the reservation on [-], it was nice because I had to modify one date to check in and between the hotel and gumtrip.com resolve the problem quickly.Other things We liked very much was the staff, they knew many original places to recommend us of the city and the fancy rooms.I have a good opinion of this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! My daughter and I had a deluxe king room at the Hotel Elysee; it was a large room by NYC hotel standards and well decorated. The complimentary breakfast was very good. The staff were very accomodating and helped us with restaurant reservations. I stay in New York frequently and this is, by far, the best hotel experience I've had in some time. Highly recommended.Karen Gettman

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else in NYC Stayed here for the second time this past weekend, this time for two nights. Amazingly comfortable bed. Quiet. Lovely free continental breakfast daily. Convenient to everything in midtown. Valet parking in garage next door. Monkey Bar entry through the lobby is great. Monkey Bar itself has really unusual drinks, all of which were great for us. Hope to return really soon, as there's not much more fun than going to great theaters and restaurants in Manhattan, and not having to concern yourself with the long drive home. Met our daughter and boyfriend for brunch at Bar Americain Sunday morning, and they said they've never seen us so relaxed and happy. If I could afford it, I'd stay there every weekend, but the restaurant bills would bankrupt me, considering I like to go to places like Le Bernardin when I'm in town.

<Author>CmeredithIII
<Content>Top Spot! First time at this hotel and really liked it. Firstly a very good location right between Pk and 5th so good for business and shopping. Very low key, low rise compared to most hotels I've stayed at in NY but better for it. Very welcoming staff. Room was just great and surprisingly big for the price. Bathroom good also. I have to say that staying on the back on the 4th floor the noise of the air conditioning fans was quite extreme but as I wasn't staying for long I was not that bothered but I know if I'd come with my wife she would have been very upset by that. If you have the choice you need to try and get higher or at the front. I had a great lunch at the small italian - Cellini - opposite the hotel and I recommend that also. (about $30 for lunch with a glass of wine). The complimentary breakfast on the second floor from 7am is excellent and you have a huge choice of cereals, pastries,croissants, fruit, various coffees etc. Very comfortable room with loads of the days papers etc. I didn't try the complimentary wine in the evening or the Monkey bar which looked good. All in all a great find and I can't see anybody being disappointed with a stay here. I shall certainly be returning as this is one of the only hotels in central Manhattan which comes within my companies budget. If you can't get in here my brother stays at the Warwick just nearby and likes it.

<Content>Awesome location AND service You can't find a better location with a reasonable price. I have stayed there twice and both rooms were perfect to a detail. The concierge desk is staffed with perfect gentlemen, and your wish is their command! The Monkey Bar next door and wonderful restaurant allows you to return from your daily activites and then never leave the property. A very ample variety of breakfast foods are served on the 2nd floor parlor, and tea and coffee and a business center are available there all day. I won't stay anywhere else in midtown!

<Content>Newly found gem Elysee was recommended by friends who have been longtime patrons of the hotel and our visit confirmed their praises. Entire staff - - (front desk,maids,bellmen,clubroom staff) could not have been more pleasant and accommodating. Couldn't ask for a better location.Our suite except for the relative smallness of the bathroom was well appointed and most comfortable. The hotel is quiet and a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city just outside.The offerings of the clubroom in all aspects were exceptional. I have stayed in many four and five star hotels in New York and will prefer to return to the Elysee.

<Content>Can't ask for more... My best friend and I stayed here one night in Feb/08. We didn't want to leave!The complimentary coffee center was a huge bonus and even made better by the comfortable setting of the club room and library.Breakfast had everything you needed to be absolutely content before a morning of shopping or business. The best part of it was the fresh fruit salad. Hot water and coffee was served HOT (nothing worse than hotel tea/coffee service that has been sitting out for hours and lukewarm).We also enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese in the late afternoon..a fabulous addition to our stay.The room was very cozy, clean, and didn't feel like you were staying in a generic hotel. It felt more like you were visiting a wealthy Parisian grandmother's apartment and popped in for a sleepover! The one negative was we requested a room away from the elevator. Front desk assured us that our room with double beds was clear away from it. What we got instead was a room directly beside the elevator! We stayed in that room anyway and discovered that there was no problem at all being in a room close to the elevator because the corridor in the guest room is long enough to be far away from the noise...and the hotel is quiet anyway.We will be back.

<Content>Genuine good service and an overall nice hotel I have stayed at this hotel for few nights three of four times a year for over a decade. I am motivated to leave this review to recognise that it isn't easy to delivery the same level of service over such a long period of time, This can't be any individual, it has to be the result of the hotel's culture. The breakfast is good, the wine and cheese in the evening generous and enjoyable. There are a range of room types but all with the same style of elegant, albeit a little faded decor. While my friends stay at more well known hotels in the area and I have tried them too, I return to The Elysee and am never disappointed.

<Content>Wonderful boutique hotel in the best part of Manhattan The Elysee is a wonderful small hotel with excellent staff at a great location. Great staff, cookies and coffee in the PM and breakfast in the AM. The most civilized hotel in NY for my needs. Not a kids hotel, but an adult location for the discerning NY tourist and person to stay for personal or business needs.

<Content>first time at Hotel Elysee - loved it! We loved everything about the Hotel Elysee. Our room was very comfortable, spacious and clean. We enjoyed spending time in the club room on the second floor, for breakfast and afternoon snacks, and as a quiet place to meet with old friends we hadn't seen in years. But what made our stay so memorable was the staff. Everyone - the manager, the front desk/concierge men and women, the waitresses in the club room, the porters and cleaners - all were exceptionally friendly and attentive. During our stay, we came to see the hotel staff as a happy family sharing a genuine interest in ensuring that we, as their guests, were perfectly satisfied at all times. We will definitely stay at Hotel Elysee again when we are next in New York.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for more Our trip to New York was made all the more enjoyable by staying at this hotel. What drew us to the Elysee was the fact that a complimentary breakfast was included in the price. What a breakfast! Continental it may have been but there was always plenty on offer wwith the curteous staff always ready to replenish an empty plate. The evening brought wine along with biscuits, cheese and various other nibbles. Again this was complimentary and far exceeded our expectations. The room was very comfortable and clean with fresh towels every day and the bed turned down at night. The staff were all very friendly and keen to help. The location of the hotel was ideal for us being away from most of the biz but still within walking distance. I would certainly go back to the Elysee if making another trip to NY

<Content>Excellent Hotel ! We stayed at the Hotel Elysee in New York City on a Saturday night. Our room was on the concierge floor and we had a balcony. The breakfast on Sunday morning was very similiar to an upscale European hotel's. The service was beyond excellent - every step of the way - from arriving to departing - the service staff could not have been better. We wanted a cup of tea at 12:30 a.m. when we came in for the night and we got it immediately. And the room - beautifully furnished with the most comfortable bed. I truly look forward to staying at the Hotel Elysee again.

<Content>Hotel Staying at the Hotel Elysee is a wonderful experience. Located in one of Manhattan's most desirable areas, acess to any of the City's attractions is easily within reach. The Hotel itself offers a calm serenity. The lobby and rooms are beautifully decorated. Each room a little different (some have terraces) makes staying here more interesting. The hotel also offers a Club Room serving a lovely continental breakfast and wine and cheese in the afternoon. The staff is informative, helpful and friendly. This hotel is one of the best kept secrets in New York City.

<Content>Fantastic! The Elysee is a place my family and I stay for both business and pleasure. The location is ideal and perfect for sight seeing. It has all the conveniences of a large hotel, but with the quaintness and charm you can only get at a boutique hotel. The staff is more than willing to help you with anything you need, and only makes your stay that much more enjoyable. We wouldn't stay anywhere else.

<Content>Wonderful Experience!!! My recent stay at the Elysee was just marvelous! The moment we arrived the staff was friendly and courteous from the Doorman to the Front Desk and even the attentive young ladies in the Breakfast room 鈥?all were there to please. The room was wonderful, exactly what we expected. We were worried at first about a front facing room, as I've read complaints about the noise, but that concern was put to rest after the first night as noise was minimal especially given we're in midtown Manhattan (although the bed was so comfortable I could have slept through anything)! My final comment will be on the bathrooms as my wife and I are very fussy about these things. Although a bit small for our liking it was impeccably clean and the marble was an extra nice touch. The Elysee is our new favorite hotel in NYC as the value, location, and staff far exceeds any of our previous experiences in New York.

<Content>Not what I Expected Pluses - The location is very convenient for the sights of Manhattan. The complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres were good. The complimentary continental breakfast was average. Minuses - Not what one would expect for the price. I stayed a week with a group and we had rooms on various floors in the hotel. We looked at each other's rooms. Some were very small, all had extremely small bathrooms, some had no minibar. At least 3 rooms on each floor are next to the elevators and you can hear them at all times. I was surprised the soaps were never changed and they were getting thin by the end of the week. My radiator clanged, banged and gurgled loud enough to wake me a couple of times a night. I reported it and was told, the system is old nothing can be done about it. One of my friends had no heat for 2 nights because it took that long to fix a faulty thermostat. The hotel states they have a concierge service, but when I asked about the harbor tours, I was give a couple of brochures, one dated 2005, that was it. Service was at best mediocre. (Get used to opening the front doors yourself) Even if they cut the price in half, I would not go back.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Elysee We spent 2 nights at the hotel and every thing was wonderful. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was newly renovated and very clean and the bed and pillows were the most comfortable of any hotel we have ever slept in. Breakfast was very good and it included plenty selections of tasty fresh fruit, pastries,breads, bagels, cereal and even boiled eggs. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to 5th and madison Aves. for shopping, Rockefeller Plaza and a very short cab ride from the train station. We really enjoyed our stay and will return there again!

<Content>Had a great time This was our first time staying with the Hotel Elysee (but not with their sister properties). We were greeted warmly and even though it was only 9 a.m. we were given a room. The room was clean and comfortable and had more than enough space. The bathroom was on the small side but tastefully decorated in marble. Housekeeping came twice a day.We like to go to the gym each day and although the hotel does not have a fitness facility they do give complimentary passes each day to the NY Sports Club which are scattered throughout New York. The club was only four blocks away and had everything a well equipped club should have.It was nice to come back to the hotel at the end of each day to wine and cheeses before heading off for the evening activities. The staff were friendly and courteous.The location was excellent. It was near subway stops and very close to shopping on 5th Ave. We had a bit of a walk to the theaters but the weather was nice and it was fun looking at the Christmas windows and other Christmas decorations along the way.We had a great stay and will definitely return when we visit again. My only suggestion to those who might be bothered by street noise is to request a room not facing the street (our room did face the street and if someone was sensitive this type of noise it would be a problem).

We were able to walk from The Hotel Elysee to Broadway within a few minutes and get a great viewing spot. We were also able to walk to The Rockefeller Center and many great places for shopping the night before. The room was beautiful and clean and had everything we needed. Not being very familiar with Manhattan, the staff took very good care of us from parking our car at a very affordable rate to giving us directions and insight to things to see and do in the city. When we stay in Manhattan again we will definitely be back to the Hotel Elysee.

<Content>Elysee, good place to stay Really enjoyed our stay, room was very pleasent, housekeeping was excellent. Breakfast a bit mundane(I dont want to see a boiled egg or a begel for about 6 months), drinks and canapes in the evening were a really nice touch. Food in the monkey bar was good but spoiled by the extremely high price of alcoholic beverages, would have used it more if it was not so expensive.Overall experience was excellent.

<Content>An Excellent Stay at Hotel Elysee My husband and I spent a week at the wonderful Hotel Elysee. It was my first visit to NYC, so it was great to be within walking distance of 5th Avenue, Central Park, MOMA, Rockefeller Center, and Broadway. Our room was spacious and comfortable and, thanks to the friendly housekeeping staff, it was kept spotless throughout our entire stay. Before and after my long walks around the City, the Bellmen would always greet me with a smile and pleasant conversation 鈥?they were also extremely helpful with directions. I surprised myself by spending quite a bit of time in the 2nd floor lounge area. The space is large with many comfortable chairs and couches. The complimentary breakfasts had a great selection of breads and pastries and the attendants were so pleasant and always willing to help/clear away plates. In the afternoons, I鈥檇 go back to the lounge for the cheeses, cookies, and other snacks. The Front Desk staff made a number of great dinner (and lunch) suggestions 鈥?any suggestion was always followed by the offer to make a reservation for us. I appreciated the free wifi 鈥?even though the hotel provides a computer with access to the internet for guests, it was nice to be able to sit in the lounge with my laptop in the afternoons to catch up on my email. I鈥檝e stayed in many hotels around the world and this was definitely one of the best experiences I鈥檝e had 鈥?across the board. Sometimes, a hotel will be in a great location, but so poorly-run that it just ruins the experience. That鈥檚 definitely not the case with Hotel Elysee. This hotel鈥檚 in a great spot and it鈥檚 a tightly-run ship, with fantastic staff at every level. We will definitely return!

<Content>Marvellous oasis in NYC We loved everything about the Elysee. Our rooms were excellent - spacious and elegant with good marble bathrooms, which were kept spotlessly clean. One of our rooms had a beautiful balcony with potted plants and lovely terrace furniture. Both rooms were quiet and located high up in the hotel - exactly as we had requested. Our email dealings beforehand with the staff were most efficient, and they provided everything we had asked for. On our arrival the reception staff were incredibly pleasant and this attitude was mirrored by all the staff we met throughout our stay. The US can certainly teach us Brits a deal about customer service, which was impeccable and so pleasant throughout this hotel and throughout all NYC. The club room on Floor 2 was just marvellous and very well serviced. We thoroughly enjoyed using it as a bolthole when we were whacked in the late afternoons. Coffee and tea were always available and the prosecco, wines, and cheese and other nibbles were greatly appreciated as aperitifs and appetisers before we went out in the evenings. Although it is 'the thing' to go out for breakfast in NYC, we much preferred to have the lovely breakfast at the Elysee at our leisure, when we could plan our day in comfort. The location of the Elysee is superb - two blocks from 5th Avenue, a short distance to Central Park, Rockerfeller Centre, Grand Central station, UN building, Lincoln Center, and near enough but fortunately not too near Broadway. We found that area tacky and were delighted that our hotel was not located there. In summary, we would have found it hard to better the Elysee in any way. We much prefer smaller, quiet and elegant hotels and this is as good as it gets.

<Content>Lovely room, well situated Pleasantly surprised to find lovely, tasteful decor at the Elysee. The room was decorated in shades of pale yellow and light blue, with botanical prints on the walls. Tiny bathroom, but so what! The entryway with work desk and lamp was a nice touch, as were the included continental breakfast ( of good quality) and evening snacks. The staff at check-in and check-out was very courteous. The stay was quiet and lovely. I would be delighted to return to this conveniently located hotel (even though the bed was not the height of comfort)!

<Content>Great location! Location excellent - a quick walk from Saks! Breakfast featured whole grain rolls that we Scandos like and freshly squeezed orange juice, which made up for the dismal filter coffee in thermos jugs. Lovely room, bigger than expected, but it was unusually hot and humid outside, and the air-conditioner even at the highest setting was weak. Single slow elevator and a full hotel meant waiting a bit.

<Content>Oasis in the Desert My wife and I recently spent a week at the Hotel Elysee and found the ambiance charming and the staff very friendly. Upon our arrival we were welcomed as if we just arrive home by the hotel鈥檚 doorman and front desk staff. We had arrived before check-in and the staff held our bags while we explored the sites and sounds of New York. Upon entering the lobby we were surprised by a beautiful centerpiece of flowers which illuminated the room. Unlike many hotel rooms in New York City, our room was spacious and the furniture in excellent condition. Additionally, I enjoyed using the free wi-fi.My wife and I were skeptical of the complementary breakfast that the hotel offers, but found it to be a nice touch, as they offer a assortment of goodies, including coffee, tea, a wide variety of pastries, and fresh fruit salad, along with a number of periodicals for your reading pleasure. The hotel is centrally located and within easy walking distance of Central Park and plenty of shopping. On multiple occasions, we contacted the hotel concierge for restaurant recommendations and they made excellent choices and reservations without prompting. I would highly recommend the Hotel Elysee and look forward to many comfortable visits.

<Content>Not for tourists We have just returned from this Hotel 1st Oct 07 - 6th Oct 07. The hotel is so wanna be. The staff have attitude and so do the customers. We were your usual tourist types visiting NYC. If you were not middle aged with dinner suit and ballgown on after 7pm the staff were not interested.During our stay the shower developed a leak. It would not turn off. The staff isolated the water to our room fo rth evening. We had no shower toilet or running water in our room. The duty manager seemed to think this was okay. On speaking with the general manager we were refunded that evening. But not the service I would have expected. The staff on the front desk looked you up and down when arriving and leaving and as I said if you were not a middle aged couple with the woman having a pearl necklace forget it

<Content>What a disappointment! We usually stay at a sister property when in Manhattan but it was booked. It was our first stay at Hotel Elysee and the front desk staff was intolerable. They did not help anyone who approached them in a positive manner. Getting their attention required repeated approaches. Our rooms were not ready early, which was fine, so we waited and waited and waited. Finally, after check in time, we asked for the 3rd time and requested the front desk manager, our rooms were miraculously ready! And what shabby rooms they were! There was no customer service going on in our dealings with this crew. They were argumentative (with more than just the two of us), they were evasive, and they were hateful!My coworker and I will neither one EVER go back to this hostile hotel from hell!

<Content>Pleasant surprise! The Elysee' came highly recommended and did not disappoint. We returned in September for 3 more nights and have become fans. The Club room is pleasant and the breakfast and wine and cheese spread were plentiful. We will certainly return and recommend it to friends. Location can't be beat.

<Content>Well Worth It Sept. 12 2007 The Hotel exceeded our expectations both in service and ambiance. We also felt it's location was a plus. Everyone from cleaning help to front desk were extremely helpful.We would definitely recommend the Elysee and would stay again. The only minor area is our mini-suite should signs of getting tired. I am sure the excellent staff wil attend to this minor issue. See you on our next trip to New York.

<Content>Charming Hotel We enjoyed our stay at the Elysee. The staff was very welcoming and helpful with various transportation issues that developed due to a taxi strike. The Elysee has converted me from a regular at the larger hotels in NYC to the smaller, more charming hotels like this one. We look forward to returning soon, and will stay at this hotel or one of its sister properties (Giraffe and The Library).

<Content>Hotel Elysee is a gem! I was a first-time guest at Hotel Elysee: I've stayed at various hotels in NYC throughout the years from the Sheraton and the W -two locations - to Hotel QT, The Drake, Hudson Hotel and Bryant Park Hotel. Hotel Elysee exceeded my expectations and thus far, provided me with the best NYC hotel experience overall.The hotel's location is ideal for doing the usual NYC tourist activities like shopping in Fifth Avenue, viewing art at MoMA, walking around Central Park and people-watching at Rockefeller Center. Yet the hotel is still close enough to subway stations, so one can easily hop on a train to go downtown to experience city grit  and neighborhoods with more character or uptown to visit the museums which dot Fifth Avenue. Grand Central station is a short distance from the hotel but one should probably not venture past Park Avenue after the mid-town offices shut down for the day and the homeless set up camp. (We encountered a few of these camps during a late-night stroll.)The hotel is clean, well-maintained and well-priced (US$325/night plus tax and includes breakfast and afternoon wine). Its ambience is one of old-world yet unpretentious civility. Our room - small for those who are used to rooms on steriods - was very nicely laid out and decorated, albeit in a traditional style.I had read reviews which mention the low water pressure, the slow elevator - there is only one - and the street noise, but we did not experience any of these. (We stayed on the fifth floor in a street-facing room near the elevator.) The only negatives I can think of are the loud air-conditioning unit and the poorly laid-out bathroom - the door barely cleared the toilet. An area for improvement would be the staff: they don't have attitude - although one morning, the breakfast staff in the library was not friendly - and are professional and welcoming but need more polish.

<Content>Outstanding concierge Relaxed atmosphere with friendly and efficient staff. The concierge gave top suggestions for our evening entertainment (Comedy Cellar and Daniel restaurant). Breakfasts had plenty of choice including fresh fruit and pastries. We enjoyed our early evening appetizers including quality wine, cheeses, crackers etc... whilst using the free internet service. Only downer was the noisy Manhattan garbage collector lorries in the early hours.....presumably unavoidable in 24h New York city. However, credit to Elysee, on request they immediately moved us to a quieter room at the back of the hotel. Would stay here again - great location for shopping.

<Content>Hotel Elysee was Fabulous! Date:8/7/07-8/11/07Reviewer: TripAdvisor member from San Antonio, TXFamily of three (son age 14) stayed in a suite for 4 nights. Suite was huge by New York standards. Very nicely decorated, great king bed and large marble bathroom (which had separate shower and tub). Room was on 10th floor facing street--some street noise (particularly early in morning), but not too bad. Second floor clubroom and the complimentary continental breakfast were outstanding! And service was perfect. Second floor library has complimentary computer with internet access. Staff overall was great--very friendly and helpful. No full time concierge, but front desk staff was knowledgable. Location is super--on 57th Street between Madison and Park. It's only a block and a half from great 5th Ave shopping and very close to Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Also easy walking distance to Broadway shows and Times Square. Did not try Monkey Bar restaurant, as they had recently changed the menu and are no longer a steak house. Hotel Elysee is a wonderful boutique hotel in a perfect location; I recommend it without hesitation!

<Content>charming hotel...average staff The hotel is a quaint, charming boutique hotel that has a European feel to it. As others have noted, there is a room where you can get coffee/tea all day as well as a nice breakfast in the morning. There is also a computer available for internet use. The rooms are decent sized (for NY) and quite comfortable. Rooms are clean...decorated nicely. Much nicer than a generic hotel chain. The only downside is the staff. Most of them seem somewhat immature, lacking the sophistication you would expect from a hotel of this caliber. They do the bare minimun, but do not exhude professionalism. Overall, this is a great hotel and I highly recommend it.

<Content>Typical European Hotel My husband and I just returned from a weekend in NY . Even though we requested an early check-in, our room was not ready til after 2. Except for Charles the doorman who was extremely courteous and helpful, we were not impressed with the hotel staff. Rooms were very reminiscent of a small European hotel. Our King room was very clean but small. The bathroom was even smaller!. To get to the sink, you needed to close the door. There was a small dressing room where you could store toiletries and put on makeup. For those ladies with long hair, bring your own hairdryer. The one in the bathroom has little power. The airconditioning was difficult to operate. It was either too cold or very stuffy. Rooms were not cleaned till mid to late afternoon. There is only one elevator, so be prepared to wait. Be sure to try the Monkey bar for drinks. It's a fun place. All in all , the hotel was just average. I would probably stay elsewhere on my next visit.

<Content>A wonderful boutique hotel in Manhattan I stayed here recently for a long weekend the first weekend in August. I like to go then because the city is not so crowded and the Elysee offers good rates then. Our room was $315 for Thursday night and then $295 for each of Friday and Saturday nights. That may seem like a lot but you are in NYC afterall, and included in the room price is a good sized complimentary breakfast buffet as well as complimentary tea and snacks in the early evening, and free wine on weekday evenings. Our room was clean and comfortably furnished and had bathrobes, a mini-bar, safe, etc.. The toiletries were by Gilchrist  Soames and were fully replenished each day. The maid service was also great. One of the best things about the hotel is the location on E. 54th between Madison and Park which is convenient to Grand Central Station, Midtown and the Upper East Side. The subway is about 2-3 short blocks away. There are also several grocery/convenience stores about within a 100 yd radius from the hotel, as well as liquor store that carries a good selection of wine directly across the street. I have stayed at this hotel 4-5 times and always return. It is a dependable, classy place that is very good value for this part of Manhattan.

<Content>Very impressed A very enjoyable place to stay.We make a trip to NYC once a year and we've stayed at a handful of hotels in recent years. None of them stands out in my memory except the Elysee. It's calm and quiet, the staff is friendly and courteous, the decor is nicely done in a subdued-elegance sort of way. Our room was large by NYC standards, comfortable and quiet (we were on the 12th floor).There is a complimentary continental breakfast in the morning and a complimentary wine-and-cheese buffet in the evening. The checkout time is a very civilized 1 PM.No one thing makes the Elysee stand out, but there are a lot of little things that, taken altogether, add up to a very enjoyable experience.

<Content>Elysee's A Deal The Hotel Elysee is in a great location at a great price.If you've been to New York City then you already know that rooms can tend to be on the small side, but the Elysee's rooms are quite large and roomy. Bathrooms were very large, huge tub and dressing area. Large closet and several dressers to unpack into. My only complaint was the hairdryer, a 1200 watt.....it wasn't anything like mine at home and took twice as long as normal to dry my hair, next time I'd take my own.We found the Hotel Elysee on tripadvisor and as usual the reviews convinced us to depart from our usual larger hotel choice for the smaller, boutique size hotel. It was nice having 5-6 rooms on the floor and only 15 floors in the hotel, but the downside is that there is only 1 elevator to service the entire place. So there is alot of waiting for the elevator to arrive.There is free wi-fi in all over the hotel, but very, very slow. Not a quick connection. There is a computer for guest use on the 2nd floor.On the upside, the Club Room on the 2nd Floor is very nice and having continental breakfast available until 10:30am is definitely a perk, as is the all day snacks and then the evening cocktails. At 5pm, there is a choice of champagne, white or red wine with fruits and a variety of cheeses. Very nice place to unwind, or kick off an evening on the town.We were not overly impressed with the staff. Nobody 'knocked our socks off' during our stay or tried to go the extra mile for us, but we dont have any complaints on anyone either.The location was great as well...close to 5th Ave shopping!We liked our stay, but will try other tripadvisor.com suggestions next time. My husband prefers larger hotels with restaurant/bar choices and more elevators....you thought twice before leaving the room because a return back for anything could take a while!

<Content>Great hotel - would go back Our first trip to New York for my birthday and I loved the city and the Hotel Elysee was a perfect choice.A lovely boutique hotel, good size room, great location, friendly staff. The lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks at the end of the day is fantastic after a day of sightseeing.The front desk were very friendly and helpful, recommending some excellent restaurants; booking a car etc. The room was a good size especially after expecting a box size room because it was New York. This was certainly not the case at the Elysee. I would recommend a room on one of the higher levels because of the street noise and also away from the lift.

<Content>A Piece of Tranquility My husband and I stated at Elysee for four nights 26 July to 30 July. The hotel was lovely and clean with a high specification in decor. The bed were amazing, so comfortable and the linen was a very high standard. We stayed on 15 floor (top) and was quiet with little traffic noise. One slight negative, there is only one elevator in the hotel and at busier times it stops at every floor.The Club Room was availbale for continental breakfast, which was very good and was also open for coffee and cookies from 12 - 5. The Monkey bar lacked atmosphere and the drinks were over priced. Other than that, this hotel was excellent. It is ideally located for all Midtown sights. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Centrally located, quiet hotel with indifferent service The hotel has a great location near 5th Avenue so for a shopping weekend it's ideal. Rooms are small but clean, comfortable and quiet. The inclusive continental breakfast will get you off to a good start for the day. Whilst the hotel staff are friendly don't expect grade A service, it's not that it's bad service just a bit slow and disconnected. Overall I would be reasonably happy to stay here again but for my next trip to New York I'll give somewhere else a try.

<Content>Perfect New York hotel We visit New York often, and since we discovered the Elysee several years ago, it is the only hotel we would consider. It is warm and welcoming, with the atmosphere of a small European hotel. The location is wonderful, walking distance to many parts of the city. The rooms are varied and very comfortable, and the bathrooms excellent. Unlike many hotels, there is adequate sitting space, lighting, temperature control and a place to put toiletries in the bathroom. The staff is outstandingly helpful and friendly. We love visiting the lovely club room, where breakfast and snacks are served. With the included breakfast, free WiFi and public computer in the club room, the Elysee is also a bargain for its part of Manhattan.

<Content>Excellent NYC hotel! We stayed 22-24 July and had a king room at the back of the hotel which was extremely quiet. The included breakfast and the free wi fi makes the room rate quite reasonable when comparing to other hotels which charge for those items. A much appreciated exceptional treatment was the opening of the Club room at 4:30 am for this insomniac still on European time to work on the computer without distrubing his wife! The breakfast is the best continental breakfast I have seen and the beds were extremely comfortable. A great location tops it off and we will be return visitors for sure. Gary

<Content>Great Hotel With A Perfect Location We had a girlfriend's getaway weekend at the Hotel Elysee and had a fabulous time! It was centrally located so we were right in the center of great shopping, it was close to all of the restaurants we were eating out during NYC's Restaurant Week and the staff couldn't have been nicer. The valet parking was great -- they even cleaned out our coffee cups from the car -- they kept our bags for us until we could check in and the front desk clerk was so helpful, he even gave us all the locations for the Sephora stores around the city! The room was so clean and well appointed and it was very quiet. And it was great to come back to the hotel after a Broadway Show and have cookies and tea in the Club Room before going to bed. The complimentary Continental breakfast is also great 鈥?as is the free use of the computer in the Club Room. I would highly recommend this as a great hotel for a New York getaway weekend.

<Content>Never Disappointed by the Hotel Elysee Returned to the Hotel Elysee for a weekend in NY, July 13-15, 2007, and once again, had a wonderful stay. In fact, this was my fourth or fifth time to the Elysee and I have never been disappointed. The rooms are lovely and clean and the staff has always been polite and helpful. And we had a special treat in store for us with this visit, a room with a balcony complete with a table and chairs and pots of flowers. How wonderful!

<Content>Hotel Elysee c'est bon! July 15 had a last-minute one-nighter to NYC. Great hotel for under $300. Very pleasant room with corner windows. The second floor lounge was so comfortable with a great continental breakfast and then tea, coffee and fruit available the rest of the day. Very peaceful place to put your feet up. The only problem was the wake-up call never happened. But, we were up so it didn't matter. Have already recommended Hotel Elysee to friends.

<Content>50th Birthday Celebration in NYC was Great at the Elysee! July 14, 2007. We spent a long weekend July 6-9 exploring Manhattan as tourists. Used TripAdvisor to help us find a hotel that was not outrageously expensive and in a GREAT location......Hotel Elysee was definitely it! Very friendly front desk staff, nice and quiet room on the third floor, attentive housekeeping and definitely an excellent location. We loved coming back every afternoon for a quick rest before continuing our explorations. We'll be back!

<Content>Top notch Stayed here July 6-9 and cannot begin to express how wonderful the accomodation was. the only thing to complain about as has been said before is the very slow elevator. The room was dark, quiet, elegantly appointed. Water pressure not great. Service was excellent. The 2nd floor club room is beyond expectations. Breakfast is outstanding and the afternoon wine/cheese is like being in a bed and breakfast in the country. King sized bed room came with twin sleeper as well. If i can get the same reasonable rate again this will be the only place i will want to stay in NYC. Excellent location, this really is the gem that others have described.

<Content>Like a mini Ritz! We stayed at the Hotel Elysee for 2 nights prior to our cruise to Bermuda. I had read the positive comments on trip advisor so I was prepared to like the hotel............but instead I loved it! The hotel is impeccably clean......beautifully decorated and the staff very friendly and helpful. The beds are luxurious......very comfortable. The bathrooms spotlessly clean and elegant with marble throughout. Our room did not face the street and was very quiet. The continental breakfast was nice and suitedthe way we like to eat in the morning. Cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee and juice. I can't believe we only paid $245 plus tax/fees per night for this room in such a great location in New York City!Now that I've discovered this mini Ritz (thanks to trip advisor) I plan on staying here each time I come to New York for business or pleasure!

<Content>Small Gem in Prime Midtown Location I spent 4 July holiday in NYC to attend a friend's wedding and see the sights. While I had walked past the Elysee many times before, I never had reason to stay there until this trip (when they were having a very good 4 July promotional rate sale). All previous complaints here have some truth to them (one slowish elevator for all, street noise from E54th and light pollution through the shades at night), however, I did not find any of these to be noticeably detrimental to my stay. Instead, I will recall the spacious room with step up marble-clad bath and iPod-compatible alarm clock. I'll remember the ample expanded continental breakfast and afternoon cocktails  cheese which were tirelessly replenished by the staff. The location is within 5-7 blocks of many major tourist and business hubs, not to mention multiple subway lines (really, be brave, this is the way to get around town quickly and cheaply). This is a undiscovered treasure in midtown, well worth considering over some of the more famous (and pricey!) options nearby!

<Content>Highly Recommend We recently stayed a week at the Elysee. Location was great - good proximity to the tourist attractions and Times Square, but far enough to escape the same after a busy day. The club room on the 2nd floor was a welcome respite at any time of the day, though we mostly went there for the morning continental breakfast which was outstanding - fresh fruit, bagels/pastries, yoghurt, coffee. We also attended the complimentary wine and cheese in the club room on a few occasions - I enjoyed having the option of enjoying a glass of wine and reading the paper on my own in this quiet atmosphere vs going to a pub/lounge. Rooms were well laid out and well-appointed - very nice. Shower had little pressure, but not a surprise given the age of the building. There was construction noise throughout the day which we heard when going to the elevator, but it wasn't heard from our room itself. I suspect if we would have had a room by the elevator, this may have been a different story. We would return in a heartbeat - have already inquired about booking next year.

<Content>Miss the piano My husband and I have stayed at the Hotel Elysee three times now in the past year and have loved every minute of it. The words gracious, elegant and generous (this last referring to the club room) are only the first to come to mind in thinking of our experience at the hotel. My only regret is the loss of the piano in the bar during the renovation this spring. It was always a pleasure to sit down and play a few tunes, and at other times to hear others do the same. Since almost no place has a piano anymore, it was a treasure, now to be mourned. Back to the good stuff: would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to have an oasis of sweet calm in the hectic city.

<Content>One Big Problem I loved my recent stay at the Elysee in every way except for one--if you are a sensitive sleeper and need total darkness to sleep, you may find it difficult to get a decent night's shuteye. In the first room we stayed in, there was a pull down shade and sheers , but the standard curtains (made of solid material) did not close. That first night, I was awake most of the night because the room faced the street and there was a lot of light coming in. The next day, after explaining the situation to the manager, she ended up accomodating us by putting us on a darker side of the hotel-- and although it was a bit better,I could still see light coming in at night.(My husband ended up going out and buying me eyeshades so I could enjoy the rest of our stay.)Other than that, the breakfast was terrific, the rooms nicely appointed and the staff very sweet. The location is so central to everything. Its a shame that we won't be staying there again because of this one problem.

<Content>Great place - took my 7 year old daughter This was a great hotel. I took my daughter with me for a 4 night stay. Very cozy and quiet. Its out of the hussle of Times Square but near the subway, good restaurants, and central park.the staff was outstanding.Cellinis Restaurant across the street was awesome too and was arranged by the hotel. Some of the best service I've ever received but it is pricey.This hotel was a bit pricey but seems like all NYC hotels have gotten that way due to many hotels shifting to a condo format. There appears to be a supply/demand imbalance!But, very reasonable pricing relative to other options and outstanding service. Room was large and roomy

<Content>Best Service Ever!! I visited the Hotel Elysee in June with my whole family and we all agreed that they provided the best service we have ever experienced! The entire staff was amazing. The maids went the extra mile to ensure that my group was well taken care of, and after only one night the front desk staff knew us by name and got us reservations at some very nice restaurants that we would not have been able to get on our own. Then when we got to the restaurants we were given extra special attention and service. I don't know how they do it, but it made for an incredible experience. The location doesn't hurt either. Whenever I or anyone else in my family travels to NY, we will be sure to stay at the Hotel Elysee.

<Content>Most relaxing hotel experience... I had an amazingly relaxing stay at the Hotel Elysee. The service was exceptionally trained and well managed. The boutique atmosphere and ambiance paralleled the relaxed environment nestled in the middle of everything a tourist could ask for. The room was immaculate every evening, and provided me with a superb opportunity to truly enjoy my stay in and outside the hotel. The lounge was well kept and served as a great meeting point for friends and travel companions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a enjoyable stay in the heart of the city. Thanks Hotel Elysee!

<Content>Unique and cozy boutique My wife and I have stayed here three times over the last couple of years and this little hotel always delivers. The rooms are comfortable and cozy. We love the breakfast/tea room. The whole place is very charming. You wouldn't expect to find a place like this in Midtown, but there it is, and it's in the middle of everything. The staff is great and seems to get friendlier every time I go back. It's the whole package.

<Content>A Small Gem in the Big City A simple review cannot explain the amazing time I had at the Hotel Elysee! This was my first time in New York and the staff made me feel welcome. If you're looking for a hotel with small home town feel, but in the middle of all New York has to offer - this is the place.

<Content>Caveat Emptor Be very careful when you book a room at this hotel. You could be one of the unfortunate people, as we were, to get a teeny tiny room, no hairblower, no bathtub, dirty window sills, and a bed in very bad shape. I wouldn't even relogate this room to the shabby sheik category. After we complained we did get another much better room. The manager, who made no apologies, did imply that it was up to us to have asked for a different room. Unbelievably he advised us that this room was UNDER RENOVATION for handicapped. It was a new one on us that for $400 plus each nite, for 5 nites, we were to worry that our room would look like it did and it was our responsibility to investigate the room ahead of time. Having travelled all over the world I would submit this was one of a very few awful experiences for us.Unless you absolutely adore breakfast and need cheese and wine at 4 o'clock I would stay somewhere else. The hotel is on the East side of the city and major museums and theater, Lincoln Center, etc. are on the west side. There are many accolades on this site regarding Elysee. Indeed if we had had the second room the first time, I wouldn't be writing this review. A word of warning then. Be certain you see your room ahead of time.

<Content>Great small hotel! The Elysee is a great find! Every part of our stay was just as we expected... The front desk was very friendly and helpful and room was comfortable and clean. The best part of the hotel is absolutely the second floor Club Room. The breakfast was wonderful and the evening wine is such a nice treat before you head out for the night. My husband and I will certainly be back!

<Content>Small, personal hotel in great location A smaller hotel with excellent personal service....LOCATION: wonderful midtown location (54th Street between Park and Madison) walking distance to shopping, theater district, most major museums. CHARM/ COMFORT: Our rooms were very clean and traditionally decorated with antiques. The bathroom was small, but had been remodeled and had a terrific shower with lots of water pressure. The bed was a huge King-size with a lovely soft pillowtop mattress. Note: we were on the 9th floor facing the street, and it was noisy at 2 in the morning. If you're sensitive to noise, I'd try for a room on the 14th or 15th floor, or maybe one facing the back. AMENITIES: Very nice breakfast with coffee, juice, baked goods, fresh fruit salad, yogurts, cereals. Also, Monday - Friday there's a happy hour buffet with wine, cheese and crackers, etc. SPECIALS: Check the website for special promotions. I booked a suite months in advance, then saw their sweet deal offering on the website -- $75 per night off on any suite during the month we were traveling. I called the hotel and they advised me to make a new online reservation, then cancel the old one, which I did, for a savings of $375.

<Content>Hotel Elysee -- absolutely first rate What a great NYC hotel. The service was excellent -- the staff very well trained and geniuinely helpful. The continental breakfast was more than adequate and the dining area was different: a casual lounge, much like a luxury home, with sofas, small tables, alcoves. They had free wi-fi in the rooms or you could use the hotel's computer and printer -- all at no extra charge. No nickel and dime-ing. We had a small suite -- it was very nice, HD TV in the living room, nicely furnished. Even the sofa-bed was of high quality. Overall a very good value for NYC. As good a hotel experience as I've ever had in NYC -- highly recommended.

<Content>Loved Hotel Elysee, Will Go Back This was a perfect hotel, very nice, great location, not outrageously priced, and small enough to be personal. The room was charming, lovely and very clean, complementary water bottles in the room upon arrival were nice, as was the bathrobe and slippers. The shower had great water pressure and the towels were fantastic. All staff were friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was very convenient and good: yogurt, hard boiled eggs, cereal, juice, coffee, bagels, pastries, I'm sure anyone could be happy with this offering. I will definitely stay again, and will recommend to friends.

<Content>Great Hotel, no Monkey Bar This is a wonderful hotel that is similar to many classy European hotels. The room (76) was elegant and clean, and the location was perfect. The only negative aspects of our stay were the construction across the street (noise) and the fact that the Monkey Bar was closed for renovation (no mention of this on the hotel website). If you stay here...ask for a room away from the street to avoid the construction noise.

<Content>Great Overall Experience!!! We stayed at the Elysee Hotel back in August 2006 and had a wonderful experience! Before arriving I explained to the sales manager that the weekend I had planned was a very special one and that I needed certain accomodations to make it happen. The staff went above and beyond the requests I made and helped tremdously making the weekend a memorable one. The room was lovely! We had a nice size room, very comfortable bed, very clean, and a balcony over looking the streets below with a table and 2 chairs. We didnt spend too much time in the room, but when we were there, it felt so homelike. The breakfast in the morning was perfect. I am not a breakfast person, but coffee, lattes, muffins, cereal, bagels, etc. You had many choices and just enough to get you through the morning.Like I mentioned above, the staff was extremely nice and personable! I had a few extra requests that they did above and beyond what I asked for. Just another example of their professionalism at the hotel.Overall, a great stay, lovely room, wonderful staff and manager, and a perfect location near the Rock.

<Content>Wonderful, cozy haven in the middle of NYC! This was the most relaxing stay in NYC we've ever had. This hotel has many things to recommend itself, and I just wanted to mention a few:1. The decor is very welcoming and cozy. It feels like you stepped into a private home when you visit the Library for breakfast, or come back to your room. Very nice. Please be advised, the hotel is small with only one elevator, and sometimes the climate control in the room is a little finicky, but these are minor issues when considering the serivce.2. The staff service is impeccable! The maid staff takes tremendous care to keep track of when you are in or out of your room. We would leave for breakfast at 10, and come back 1/2 hour later to find our room beautifully refreshed. Very comforting.3. The location of this hotel could not be better. While it is located on a busy side street, it is moments from the 6 train subway stop and all of the best shopping one expects to do in NYC. The conceirge was very kind and was able to provide us with a map of the basic subway system that saved us time and time again.4. The breakfast provided at the hotel was delicious. While they didn't have ready to order omlets or other such amenities, the spread available was healthy and yet delicious.While other reviews have had issues with the noise on 54th street, I have to say the room we stayed in (on 10th floor) was quiet and the windows seemed updated and sound proof, even though they could be opened. The entire staff, from doormen to conceirge to maid staff were nothing but impeccably mannered and generous with their help. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know. I will definately stay there again the next time we visit!

<Content>Great Botique Hotel I've stayed at this hotel 3 times over the last year and absolutely love it. The location is great (midtown) and very close to most things. The staff is very professional, helpful, and knowledgable....they will recommend a Broadway play, or set you up with dinner reservations around town.The accomodations are nice. Plus, they have a great continental breakfast, as well as, a nice wine and cheese happy hour.The Monkey Bar is really cool and has a lot of history. If you love Italian food, definitely go to Cellini's across the street.

<Content>Country hotel the city Like an English country hotel in mid-town Manhattan. Comfortable room, very helpful staff and affordable valet parking. Included continental breakfast and complimentary tea, cookies, wine, and cheese in the afternoon are nice touches. Note that the Monkey Bar is currently closed for rennovation (until May?), although room service is available.

<Content>Go back every time we get a chance This was our fifth or sixth stay. It's our favorite among a handful of similar small hotels we've returned to in Manhattan. Service is excellent and friendly. The lounge with complementary wine and cheese in the evening and breakfast in the morning makes it feel very relaxed and homey, while at the same time preserving a romantic and European flavor.

<Content>First Time at Elysee - Great Hotel We stayed at the Elysee the weekend of Feb. 23-24 to attend a wedding. We tried the Casablanca, our favorite hotel, but it was full. However we discoved the Elysee is owned by the same owners so booked it. It was a great hotel. We had a small changing room, large bedroom with a sitting area and large upscale bath. The staff were very attentive and we enjoyed the sitting room(s) on the 2nd floor as well as a very nice continental breakfast included in the room rate. We'd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great place to stay because of location, amenities and service After an exhaustive search using Trip Advisor, Expedia and countless other avenues for seeking out accommodations, we decided on Hotel Elysee. And we are so happy we did.To us, cleanliness, service, value and location are imperative and the Elysee offers all that;- Immaculate was how we found our fair size room at the end of every long day adventuring. Yes the room (145) was a little worn, but the king size bed, marble bathroom, spectacular view, turn down service more than made up for it.- Service is what we expect. And we received it from the entire staff. The doormen are great, the front desk staff are quick and everyone @ the Monkey Bar(great place) knows how to make a Martini- Value is key. $275.00 during the week and $245.00 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in February. Breakfast was excellent, cookies and tea in the afternoon was a nice snack. Decent wine, champagne, cheese and crackers in the evening was always a great way to start the night.- Location 鈥?within a few minutes walk we were at Central Park, Bloomingdales, Louie Vuitton, Radio City Music Hall, a Subway Station, Rockefeller Centre, Times Square and more decent restaurants than I can count. New York is a great city to visit, a great place to create a lifetime of memories and the Hotel Elysee is a great place to start

<Content>This Hotel is WONDERFUL! We stayed at the Hotel Elysee for the week of New Years 2005 to 2006. This hotel made our trip that much more wonderful. The staff was helpful, friendly and fun. The included breakfast was very good, served in a delightful setting. On New Years morning we looked out the window, from the diningroom / library, to the snow covered street below. Christmas wreaths hung on every window which added to the warmth and hospitality. The service was always great. The period charm of the hotel was addicting. Rooms were of good size with wonderful decor and comforts. It isn't a large modern hotel, the description of boutique hotel fits it perfectly with all the modern necessities. I hope to come back to this hotel more than once!

<Content>Great weekend at the Elysee We returned yesterday from a great weekend in NYC.The Elysee is centrally located for Times Square and Central Park, and the buses are cheap enough to get out and about in Manhattan.We loved the Elysee, the staff were very helpful. Our room was very clean, and the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and towels.The breakfast in the lounge was really good, with a great selection of bread and pastries, as well as delicious fresh fruit, and a range of teas and coffees.We enjoyed the informal drinks and nibbles in the lounge and met some lovely people over drinks there.The purpose of our trip was to meet up with our daughter and her husband who had flown over from their home in Seattle.I would recommend this hotel, and hope to return one day, but in the summer - it was bitterly cold for this trip!!

<Content>Gorgous Hotel Had a lovely time at the Elysee - the location is great for 5th avenue shopping, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Cute little bar downstairs was nice for cocktails, but the highlight of our stay was the lovely lounge area overlooking the street, where free drinks and snacks are served in the evenings. They also had a fantastic breakfast here, which is included in the price of the room, a big plus on a holiday in America where they usually charge extra for everything! ~The only snag is that the rooms are very small, and not particularly spectacular inside - but easily forgiven when relaxing in the lovely drawing room, ideal for chatting, reading, and chilling out. Would recommend this hotel for women travelers, for kids, teens, and would especially recommend for older travellers or couples as it is very cosy and handy for Mid Town.

<Content>Great Location for a getaway! My husband and I stayed at the Elysee for a getaway weekend. We loved the location and traditional styling of the rooms in the hotel. It was walking distance to the best shopping in New York, Times Square, and the Museum of Modern Art. It was a terrific value and our package came with continental breakfast in the parlor room. We had a great time and we capped off our evenings with a martini at the stylish Monkey Bar off the hotel Lobby.

<Content>More than impressed Having read the reviews earlier in the year when I originally made the booking I was a little concerned that the later reviews gave me cause for some concern.We are a family of 2 adults and 3 teenagers. We booked a suite and a superior room. We arrived very late at night and were swiftly processed and taken to our rooms. I can understand the comments posted on a few points, yes in places it is wearing but I found it immaculately clean and comfortable. The staff were excellent and very obliging.The evening drinks and snacks were great and apart from the greediness of some of the other guests, particularly hogging the free internet access, we thoroughly enjoyed it.We would definitely return.

<Content>Best business hotel for me I have used this hotel since 1994 primarily for business. I can stay in any hotel in NYC; however, I ALWAYS choose the Elys茅e.This hotel's location is optimum for me. It is central to my place of business and affords me access to midtown's best restaurants, shopping and cultural venues. Also, as a female traveler I feel very safe and attended to here.The staff at this hotel is sublime. They know me by name and they are always sure to have one of my favorite rooms available for me upon arrival. Without mention, all of my previous requests are attended to, i.e. coffee maker in room, iron and board. Their new amentities are an improvement from what they had in years past. I use the hotel approximately six times a year, for at least a week at a time. It is comforting to see the same faces at the Front Desk who always remember me by name.My preference is always a boutique hotel. The Elys茅e may not be for everyone, should you need 24 hour room service, a butler outside your door, this may not be the place for you. If you do want a great location and an intelligent staff who remember what you like, then this hotel is definitely for you.Their breakfast is wonderful and the staff there could not be more helpful, especially Lina. She always greets me with a big smile when she sees me. My favorite amentity is their wine and hors d'oeuvre hour from 5-8 pm, a perfect way to end the day. On my last visit, they had a wonderful Argentine Malbec and a fantastic Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.To sum it up, I always look forward to staying here. If I must be away from home this is definitely the place to be.

<Content>Pluses + Minuses We are baby boomer travellers who require comfort and a bit of luxury.The hotel was a little shabby but the room was a little bigger than what you usually get in NY. Staff were friendly and the location central. The breakfast was awful but I think that this is what American accept as OK. Please can someone teach them how to mkake coffee..ahhhh. What is this thing about flavoured coffees?The one big positive about the hotel is Bill's Bar right across the road. Forget about the Monkey Bar in the hotel (it closed at 2am after New Year's Eve can you belive it??). Bill's Bar is this tiny tiny bar populated by octogenarians, I am not kidding, who were once great jazz, stage singers. The piano man starts playing and they start to sing. It is fabulous and you really are back in time. They are wonderfully polite and gregarious and you will have a great evening. Don't foget to tip the piano payer.

<Content>Disappointing My husband and I recently went to NYC for our honeymoon. We had originally planned to stay at a large hotel chain, like the Hilton, but decided that a small, romantic boutique hotel would be much nicer. After reading reviews and seeing that it was rated Most Romantic Hotel in NYC in a travel guide, we decided on the Hotel Elysee. We booked directly through the hotel, told them it was our honeymoon, and stayed for 11 days. We were both less than impressed.The concierge I dealt with over the phone (we used him for help in making restaurant reservations) was usually very polite, but seemed very new at his job. I had to call and remind him to do things several times. I was not being a nag, but when I called to check on things (We stayed over the New Year's Eve holiday, so I wanted to make sure that restaurants weren't booked up.), he often had forgotten to call certain restaurants when he said he would. I also had to call and confirm every reservation on my own. In past experiences, the concierge usually does this for you. I also asked him several times for restaurant recommendations, and never got any. He pulled out his Zagat guide over the phone and flipped through it. I'm sorry, but I have a Zagat guide, too, and I don't need someone to read it to me over the phone. I feel that if you are a concierge, it is part of your job to know about restaurants in the area and be able to make recommendations upon request.The room itself was very average. We had a king suite, and were told twice over the phone that we would have a kitchenette with a full-size fridge. When we arrived, there was a mini fridge in the living room and that was it. We got in so late and were so tired that we didn't complain and just kept the room, but in retrospect, especially considering it was our honeymoon, we should have requested a different room. The flat screen tv in the living room was nice, but the couch was so uncomfortable (just an old fold-out) that we never sat in there to watch. Our view was ridiculous-a lovely air shaft overlooking another building. There are better views in that hotel. The bathroom was small but fine, we understand that rooms are much smaller in NYC. However, we did expect it to be clean. One morning, every new towel that had been left by housekeeping the night before had hair on it. Not a great thing to wake up to.The service was fine, and everyone was helpful in getting our bags to and from our room, but no one was very friendly. We realize that the attitude is different in NYC, but when you're staying in a small hotel like that, you expect more, especially when you're paying so much. It made us feel a bit unwelcome, and as if they were doing us a huge favor just by being there.All in all it's a nice hotel, but not great, unless maybe you have the piano suite. I would try somewhere else next time.

<Content>Charming hotel in great location We stayed at the Elysee over New Year. It's a charming, elegant little place. Very classy and well appointed, yet unpretentious.The library and club room are superb, as is the breakfast (fresh juice, fruit salad, bagels, pastries, toast and cereals). Another nice touch was the coffee and cookies that are available all day long. Due to our hectic schedule we didn't manage the evening cheese and wine.The staff were very respectful and helpful, yet have a bit of fun at the same time. And the guests were equally charming.The whole ambience is very French (as you'd imagine from its name). And the Monkey Bar serves lovely food.All in all, a lovely experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small, quiet, elegant place that is only a few minutes walk from 5th Avenue. Everything about the place is wonderful.

<Content>Calm Oasis in Manhattan Hustle  Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 5 nights between Christmas and New Year. The location is excellent - close to everything you want to see - Time Square, Central Park etcThe Bedroom (no 61) was nice, and quite large, although the decor did look a little bit tired. The bed was great - huge and really comfy. If i was being picky i would say it was a bit noisy - we were at the back of the hotel near all the heating vents, so it was quite noisy - but we didn't complain as i expected noise in a city. If we had complained I am sure they would have moved us with no trouble. The Bathroom was fab -all marble and the shower was great - very powerful.The best thing about the hotel was the service - anything you wanted, all the hotel staff would bend over backwards to get for you. The communal areas are very nice, and the complimentary breakfast was excellent - really good fresh fruit salad, croissants, breads etc.Another tip -if you are a smoker like us, there is a great cigar bar called Club Macenudo 9 blocks from the hotel where you can still smoke - yipee! It is really nice inside, the staff are good, and they do good food - what more can you want!We went to the bar in the hotel once, but weren't that keen - it is nearly pitch black inside and quite expensive compared to the other places we went.I would also recommend Cellini the Italian Restaurant just across the road from the hotel - great food and service and good value - two course and a good bottle of wine for two was $100.Overall we had a fab time in New York and at the Hotel - we will definatley go back and will definatley stay at the Elysee.

<Content>My New Home In New York City I had stayed the Elysee's sister property the Casablanca in June and really liked it and decided to try the Elysee because of the location in midtown. This was going to a quick 48 hour trip from LA to NYC so I e-mailed the hotel ahead of time and requested a room at the back of the hotel as I'm a very light sleeper, and with the trip being so short I was really hoping they would me able to accommodate me. I had booked a deluxe king room. While checking in I was told that I had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite at the back of the hotel. I felt like reaching across the counter and planting one on the nice young man! I was escorted up to my suite and absolutely giddy with delight as this never happens to me. The suite was spectacular! The living room was very large for NYC standards and had a plasma tv in the armoire. The bedroom was equally large and spacious and the bathroom was done in marble. I only wished my stay was to be longer than 48 hours.The complimentary breakfast can be delivered to your room for only $5. I called and requested this service in the morning and it was brought immediately up which consisted of a large pot of coffee, bagels, and fruit. I tipped the deliveryman and dug in! I couldn't believe what incredible service I was getting. The wine and cheese in the evening was generous and relaxing. The free wi-fi in the room was also very much appreciated.What sets the Elysee apart is the staff. Each request or inquiry was met with a professional response. The hotel is boutique style so its very intimate and the staff addresses you on a first name basis, making it feel like home. I travel to NYC quite a bit for business and pleasure and I have tried them all, but this will be my new home away from home. The abundant complimentary breakfast, wine and cheese and free wi-fi make the Elysee such a great value. And no, its not cheap, but what is in NYC? If you add in the complimentary services and the fantastic staff the Elysee simply can't be beat. And thanks again to everyone who made my stay so effortless. Only wish I could have stayed in the suite for a week!

<Content>I love the Elysee A warm and cozy hotel, with a great midtown location, without the crowds and noise of those big hotels. The rooms are immaculate and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and courteous. It's always my first choice if I need to stay in New York.

<Content>Not That Impressed I was so excited having read some wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor but... it was just okay. I liked the quaintness though, and our room was lovely. But, our bathroom was not clean - hair in the sink and tub upon arrival - and quite small. I never thought I would care if my room had a peephole or not but the door buzzers on the rooms to either side of us were so loud, I thought there was someone at my door several times and had to open the door to find out.Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good. Great location but I think not a great value.

<Content>An OK Value for the Price My wife and I stayed at Hotel Elysee for three nights in November over a long weekend. I would agree with another review that says that the hotel is not a great value for the money.Here are some of the high and low points:High Points:- The wine and cheese receptption from 5-8 each weekday night is very nice with good cheese selections and good wine and champagne- The continental breakfast is great with fruit, wonderful pastries, juices, and coffee with a great staff- The location is fairly convenient to most places- Good service throughout with prompt attention to requests (like printing boarding passes, etc)- Very clean throughout- Good quality sheets and towels- Great shower water pressure- I had a package delivered to the hotel and it was promptly delivered.Low Points:- The bathrooms are extremely small with no vanity to place belongings and the toilet was so close to the wall, it was actually hard to use. You end up using the closed toilet lid to place your belongings- Some may say the furniture is vintage or charming. I just call it old and well worn. - The one elevator is extremely slow- Any rooms facing the street have windows that leak, so you will hear wind, noises, etc. all night- The A/C unit isn't exactly quiet and will cycle on and off and on and off throughout the night- You will wait up to 5 minutes to get hot water in the morning- No coffeemakers, peepholes, or morning paper as mentioned in the previous reviewSo, all in all, if you are looking for a smaller hotel, with great service, and the nightly wine hour with breakfast, this can't be beat. If you value larger, newer rooms and bathrooms with more space, you may be dissappointed.

<Content>Great small hotel I stayed at the Hotel Elysee quite by chance. I booked Casblanca(a smaller, sister hotel in Times Square) on the wrong date! The concierges there promptly started calling and got me a room at the Elysee. The location was great(although the party I was attending was in Times Square, hence my first choice of Casablanca) and the hotel was lovely. I believe the rooms have recently been renovovated. There was no noise from the street even though my room was on 54th. The bathroom was clean and nicely decorated. There is a clubby, library-style lounge on the second floor where a complimentary continental breakfast is available( wine  cheese later in the day and coffee all day).  The hotel is small but my room was large by NYC standards; there was a small seating area as well as a double bed. The staff was friendly but not obtrusive. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed at the Elysee for 3 nights. The hotel is very central to all the major sights and shopping streets. When we arrived we were put on the 3rd floor at the front. The room was lovely but very noisy and we didnt get any sleep that night. We complained and were moved, without any fuss, to the 6th floor at the back. What a difference. The room was lovely and spacious and very quiet. The breakfast is lovely and so is the wine and cheese in the evening. I would recommend this hotel to anyone if you could guarantee a room at the back of the hotel.

<Content>My favorite hotel in all of NYC!!! I travel a lot and this is the most accommodating, professional staff I have ever experienced! The rooms were immaculate and quiet. I can't recommend it enough. I tell everyone I know that the Elysee is the best of the best, and that's saying a lot for an avid traveler.

<Content>Not a good value We chose the hotel because of all of the good reviews on Tripadvisor. It is true that the location is excellent and that the staff is quite nice. And, there is a certain quaintness staying in a 99 room hotel in NY. But, for $425 per night for a basic room, the value is not there. Let me explain.No disrespect to our European friends who review on this site, but American expectations for a proper hotel room are quite different: The room must be quiet, the bed superb, and the room spacious. First, why not a coffee maker in the room? The continental breakfast is free in the library, so it's not as if they are trying to force you to pay for the product. It is so darn inconvenient to have to get dressed, go down to the library and fill up a cup and hoof it back to your room with cup in hand.Whatever happened to a free morning paper at your door? Is 50 cents too much for the hotel to spend for a NY times? Or am I one of the last dinosaurs that likes to read a paper in the morning?Because the hotel is old, you will have to listen to the air conditioning unit under the window starting up and shutting down all night long (just like at a Motel 6). (Up to date hotels have units that are vented into the rooms overhead and the compressors are located elsewhere.)Our room was in the back, overlooking an air shaft. I was not interested in a view, just quiet. However, there was a 24 hour low roar from some rooftop mechanical units below us. If the windows had been proper, double-glaze soundproof windows, this would not have been a problem. But, they were not.Our room 92 had no full length mirror (my wife likes that kind if thing), no peephole in the door (to see who is buzzing outside), and, no counter space in the bathroom. If I had stayed at a hotel like this in Europe, I would have thought, how charming. But at $425 per night in one of the most competitive hotel markets in the world, it just doesn't meet New York standards for that price level.

<Content>Friendly Personal Atmosphere I have stayed in other NYC hotels but found this one the best. Spacious quiet room, wonderful breakfasts and friendliness from both staff and guests. Sometimes had to wait for the lift at peak breakfast time but never for long.Rooms all vary and those lower down facing the street can be noisy but I had no problems. I will definitely return.

<Content>enjoy our stay Yes, everything you've read below is spot-on. I can add that the place is booking up far in advance, thanks in part to all the endorsements here. Stayed at the Elysee hotel many times in the past. My wife and I returned recently for a wedding and enjoyed our stay as usual. Hotel is just beautiful and peaceful, refined and atmospheric. If you want a quiet, intimate setting, a real feeling of old-style glamour then this is the place to stay. Breakfasts were perfect. The only think we missed this time was Italian wines that they used to serve here. Even though that was a little disappointed, we did enjoy our stay.

<Content>Very nice, but would try elsewhere next time. I found The Elysee not as European as others. For starters, nobody spoke French. It was more British in feel. Ours was one of the pantry rooms (604). It had a wierd, meandering hallway with a small wet bar, microwave and fridge on the way to the decently sized bedroom. Good king bed, but definitely not great. Standard sheets. Gilchrest and Soames toiletries. All of these choices were not as high-end as I would except for the price. The breakfast was nice, especially because of all of the guests around reading the papers. It had tables and sofas, very comfortable. The coffee was pretty bad, BUT I asked and received complimentary cappucino (doppio). The bottom line is that for upwards if $400. a night, it ain't worth it. Would be for less.

<Content>New favorite hotel in NY Great hotel! Large rooms for NY. Good A/C. Quiet. Marble bath, hallway and wet bar. Spotless. Maids did not disturb when sign was on the door. I didn't eat breakfast but hubby said it was great. Great location. Fine linens, good amenites, firm comfy bed. I liked it better than the Casablanca, the Michelangelo, the Algonquin (tiny rooms), the Lucerne and all the others I've stayed at with the exception of the St. Regis which is twice the price and maybe the Lowell (also twice the price) Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>A hidden gem in the center of Manhattan We love small European hotels and rarely see anything similar in the United States. We could have sworn we were in Paris but we were in the middle of New York. The hotel oozes charm, the breakfast is incredible, the stafff very friendly and helpful and the price is right!

<Content>Great Hotel  Just back from this hotel after staying there for a week. Hotel, rooms and bathrooms were absoutely spotless. Room had a mini refridgerator and mini bar and the beds were so comfortable and big. Breakfast was very filling and it's included in the room rate. Afternoons were also nice to meet up and chat while having complimentary cheese  wine. Staff were friendly. Only problem was the elevator was slow but we got over it. Location for this hotel was brillant, 2 blocks from 5th Ave and all it's glory and a few streets from Central Park. Restaurant in hotel was excellent, great steaks and The Monkey Bar was lively every night. Would defiantely stay in Hotel Elysee when I return next.

<Content>Loved the bed! We booked our stay for two nights based on previous positive reviews of Hotel Elysee. We were not disappointed. I loved the 'marshmallow creme' comfortable bed and slept great. It was nice to have a small frig in the room and thought the size of the sleeping area and bathroom was fine. I liked having a good size soap for the shower, Gilchrist  Soames brand was nice. I thought the front desk staff to be extremely reserved, I really didn't approach them for info (restaurant recommendation, etc.) as they didn't seem very open. I really liked the continental breakfast - they had a huge bowl of delicious cut up fruits which really jazzed up the pastry, cereal etc. choices. If you want your bagel toasted, ask one of the staff, also, one morning we were offered a cappucino which was a nice touch. This is a lovely quiet hotel in a great location.

<Content>Old world elegance without killing your pocket book It was so hot in NYC that when I opened the car door, it felt like I was standing in front of a blast furnace, so when the cool air of this hotel's lobby wrapped its comforting arms around me, I just started to smile. This hotel is great, because it combines the old world elegance I expect to find in NYC, with the extra values that other upscale hotels just soak you for. Here parking for 24 hrs is $25.00 not $45.00, wireless internet is free not $10.00 per day, a wonderful continental breakfast which includes: fresh fruit, bagels and baked goods, cereal, hard boiled eggs, coffee, fresh juice, and tea. The bathrooms are marble, the room furnishings elegant topped off with a crystal chandlier. The elevator is a tad slow, but hey nothing is perfect, nor should it be. I had only one problem which was that drain in the shower didn't work well, it was fixed promptly. The chamber maids to the front desk staff were all considerate, and helpful. The location is wonderful, two blocks from 5th Ave, several incredible restaurants, 2 blocks from the 6 train, and 3 blocks from the new MOMA. A hotel is simply a building, but it is people with the right management who make it work, and this hotel has got the right stuff.

<Content>Unbelievable We just returned from a three night stay at the Elysee. IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER. There were nine ladies and every single one of us felt that we made the right choice. Meeting in the morning in their second flour lounge was terrific. We could set an approximate time to meet and would then be able to enjoy the best continental breakfest we have ever had. FRESH was the word of the day. Could it get any better. Yes. The wine and cheese hours were spectacular. After walking all day, and before the theater, we just loved meeting there. We also loved the location. If I had to make one comment, it would be that the carpet in our suite should be replaced. However, carpet or not, this is where my husband and I are staying on our next trip there.

<Content>Really nice boutique hotel We recently stayed here for 6 nights and I can honestly say there's not one real thing to complain about the hotel. The bar is another story!! Not great service there and noisy. We actually saw a couple wait to pay their bill and getting ignored so they left with their bill in their hand because they were so angry! The hotel itself is small and quiet. We had a room on the 12th floor and it was very hard to hear traffic from the street. The room itself was very nice, mostly antique type of furnishings but very clean. The bathroom is small and no fan in there, but that's a minor quibble. At least you could open the window in there for some air. The breakfast in the am was pretty good. The evening wine and cheese very nice-they even had champagne! We never had to deal much with the front desk staff but they seemed friendly and efficient enough. I loved the second story breakfast/wine and cheese room as you could sit by the windows and see out to the street below and people watch. I think I could sit there all day. This is a very quaint and elegant hotel. We really loved it. We hope to come back next year, hopefully it won't be another record heat wave!

<Content>Another bullseye for Tripadvisor! I picked this hotel out for our 4 night stay in Manhattan in July because of the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed.Positive features: Great location in midtown Manhattan; very helpful staff; complimentary buffet breakfast with free newspapers; large bedrooms for New York; complimentary drinks and nibbles in the Club Room from 5pm to 8pm Monday to Friday; room rates very reasonably priced.Negative features:Only one rather slow elevator; bedrooms somewhat dark and dingy.These are minor gripes. I can highly recommend the place and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Discovery of a Manhattan Treasure From the moment we stepped through the vestibule of this utterly charming Europeran style boutique hotel, we knew we had made the perfect decision. All of our usual hotels were completely full, and we were thus forced to try something new. After much research, and a little apprehension, we settled on the 'unknown to us' Hotel Elysee. I can't begin to tell you how very, very happy we were with the outcome of this decision. The Hotel Elysee is now our FIRST CHOICE destination when visiting New York. From the pleasingly congenial and intelligent front desk staff, to the elegant yet understated and tasteful decor, to the wonderfully comfortable beds and luxurious pillows, to our room's rejuvinating sitting area and fireplace, to the kind and accomodating housekeeping personnel-- this hotel delivers everything a guest could wish for. I shouldn't forget to mention the two complimentary bottles of water and delicious chocolate bar that was waiting for us when we entered our spacious and well appointed room, OR the savory and thoroughly satisfying complimentary wine, cheese, crackers, and fruit that was provided in the evenings, OR the tasty 'gratis' European breakfast that was served every morning, OR the unlimited provision of coffee, tea, fruit and cookies that was made readily availablle at all times in a beautiful sitting area. Perhaps most importantly, we were treated with the highest level of care by the friendliest and most efficient staff I have ever experienced in NYC. This hotel is a gem in every way! An unforgettable home away from home!

<Content>A Special Place As a securities industry professional, I have been traveling to NYC for over thirty years. Fortunately, ten years ago, I discovered the Hotel Elysee. It is remarkable how a warm, inviting home away from home can significantly alter an individual's travel disposition. Others have written about the great location, charming parlour on the second floor, complementary breakfast, nicely appointed and clean rooms, no charge in room wireless, intimate ambiance and overall outstanding value of the Elysee etc.--all of which are true, but what sets the hotel apart is the friendly professionalism of the staff...starting with the Hotel Manager John Avina. John gets customer service and he has imparted his philosophy very effectively on the entire Elysee team. I will not stay at another hotel in Manhattan even if I am attending a conference in a different hotel or if the entirety of my business is centered downtown. My family has joined the Elysee fan club and always looks forward to arriving at our New York home. Quite simply, the Elysee experience softens the intimidation factor associated with New York and gives it a neighborhood feel. Finally, for those who find exercise important, the Elysee has a relationship with a first class health club chain a few blocks away. The facilities dwarf even the best hotel fitness centers in terms of variety and state of the art relevance...and, once again, for no additional charge. The Elysee is many things... but most importantly, it is a wonderful hotel and my family's home away from home!

<Content>Kind of Disappointing We were prepared to love the Elysee after reading the other reviews, but unfortunately our experience wasn't quite as good. The pros: the location is great, the room was very nice (and very large compared to others that we've been in in New York), the shower was great and the breakfast and free internet were definitely appreciated. The major con: the elevator, which several times took so long to reach us and then was full when it finally did, that we were forced to walk the stairs many times - not a hassle normally but definitely a hassle with a 5-month-old baby and a stroller. Beyond that, our problem with the hotel was that the staff always seemed to do the bare minimum and never go beyond. One example of many: when we checked in, the bellman had trouble with one of our room keys. He got the other to work though, and we forgot all about this until two days later when we accidentally grabbed the bad keycard when going to breakfast and subsequently got locked out of the room. It would have been nice if he had followed up immediately and replaced the bad key. We also got the all-time worst restaurant recommendation from the front desk. We love discovering new restaurants in different parts of town and rely on the hotel for guidance. Most of the time this turns out great. However, our request of the Elysee was a nearby restaurant with the best food (didn't matter if it was 5-star or a hole in the wall) and someplace appropriate for a 5-month-old. They sent us to the Brasserie on 53rd. Bad, bad, bad! It was not stroller-friendly, the food was all presentation over substance, and worst of all it took over an hour to get our food - about 15 minutes longer than our very good baby was willing to remain quiet. $140 for a mediocre meal with very bad service, and we were actually still hungry when we left. We will probably stay at the Elysee again next time, since we would love to finally settle on a favorite NYC hotel and it has a lot going for it. However, we would hope for better (and more personalized) customer service next time. The past month we've paid roughly the same $325/night at the Loews Vanderbilt in Nashville and the Mauna Lani in Hawaii, and both of those had such amazing staffs that the Elysee really paled by comparison (maybe not fair to compare, but for that much money we expected more).

<Content>New York Hospitality We were warmly welcomed at the elegant Hotel Elysee, conveniently located on 54th and Park. The Elysee could not have made a better base from which to see the sites being minutes from Central Park, MOMA and a host of NY attractions. The staff were so friendly and helpful (they offered to and indeed made dinner reservations for us, for example), the accommodation so pleasant and capacious (we had a dressing chamber in our reasonably priced room) that staying at home was almost as enjoyable as venturing into this fabulous playground metropolis. The hotel boasts a nice candle-lit bar frequented by nearby office workers and an uninspiring but entirely adequate restaurant.

<Content>Great Value for the Money I loved the Hotel Elysee. We were on a red eye flight so we got to NYC bright and early. The front desk offered to store our luggage for us and asked us to go to the 2nd floor to have breakfast. Breakfast was great...they had bagels, muffins, scones, various teas and coffee to choose from. This hotel is small compared to the typical hotel chains but that is what I found great about it. It is elegant and reminds me of the nice English hotels with its feel and decor. The bathroom is clean and is updated with modern facilities as one would expect. The marble floors was great, the shower was easy to use and navigate, and the water pressure was awesome. On our second day, we didn't realize when the hotel stopped serving breakfast so we went anyway only to find a very nice and accommodating woman cleaning up. She offered to make a tray for us to have it on our room and so we had some bagels, fruit, muffins etc. It was truly amazing service and consideration. During our afternoon downtime, the hotel offers biscuits and crackers and fruit with coffee and tea. At certain time, there's wine served with various cheese and bread/crackers. It is truly a great value for the money spent here in this hotel. The location is great. It is walking distance to a lot of places when cabs are so hard to find in NYC. We walked to our nice dinner, we walked to the theater, we walked to catch the subway. I would definitely stay here again when I visit NYC.

<Content>The Elysee is a gem! The Hotel Eylsee is wonderful! We just returned from a week in one of their deluxe (standard) rooms, which was very good size and well furnished (his and her sized chairs in our room). The 2nd floor lounge is terrific. The extra amenities included - continental breakfast (includes hard boiled eggs!); all day beverages, cookies and fruit; and the wine (including prosecca) and cheese in the evening, make for a very civilized and welcomed relief from the usual no-frills hotel offerings. We felt very pampered! The location is perfect - quiet enough but still within walking distance of the theater (for those rainy times when all the cabs disappear!). Wireless internet access in every room --- and a public pc on the 2nd floor. This hotel is definitely a gem!

<Content>Group Trip a Success We stayed at the Elysee for four nights in March with a group of ten friends. All of us felt the surroundings were safe, comfortable and well located. The complimentary breakfast and snacks in the Club Room are excellent and a good value. This room was also a good place for us to meet each morning. The hotel itself was quiet, clean and well maintained. The staff members that assisted me were all very nice.I would definitely stay again and would recommend this hotel for future stays.

<Content>The Hotel Elysee: Excellent Value My wife and I spent two nights there last month. There are positives and negatives, but on the whole I enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again.First the negatives. We got an excellent rate through Quikbook ($240.00 on Sunday night; $250.00 on Monday night. Although the hotel was not full, the desk staff rather curtly refused to give us a room with a king sized bed because we made our reservations were through Quikbook. Making your customers feel like second class citizens by availing themselves of a program in which you participate is hardly good marketing. The front desk staff on the whole would benefit from reading How to Make Friends and Influence People; they were not rude but curt. Does the name of the hotel encourage French-inspired officiousness? Our room was nice, but slightly tattered. The bed had an iron frame which made it uncomfortable to sit us up in. The chair in the sitting area was scuffed and worn. The chest of drawers was scratched.Now the positives. The location is terrific. You are in mid-town, but the location between Madison and Park is quite upscale and somewhat quieter than points west. The breakfast is fantastic; better than any other freebie I have ever had. The attendant was one of the nicest I have ever encountered. She is probably one of the lowest paid employees at the hotel, but she is the best at the art of hospitality. Other freebies were also welcome. We did not attend the wine and cheese; however, the free passes to the New York Sports Club were great. The bottled water and chocolate were a nice touch. We had the most modest room, but it included a small sitting area. The bathroom was spotless and marble. The hotel has a charmingly old-fashioned air. Phillip Stark is o.k., but I enjoyed the murals on the walls and even on the elevators. The place has a sense of the elegance of an earlier time. With a few tweaks this could place could be world class.

<Content>What a nice hotel We just stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Elysee. Our room was spacious and beautiful. We were on the 12th floor and never heard anyone, although one night I did hear the garbage truck picking up outside. The breakfast was very nice and consisted of pastries, muffins, scones, and lots of bread choices with yummy jellies. Also several cereals, prunes, and hard boiled eggs. There was a big bowl of good mixed fruit, yogurt, and packs of instant oatmeal. Also several kinds of juice, 3 types of very good coffee with syrups, and many tea choices. We thoroughly enjoyed this club room throughout the day and night also, stopping in now and then between our activities. There were newspapers, a pc with internet, and a piano and tv in a smaller attached room which we always had to ourselves. There was always fresh coffee, tea and little cookies. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Great location. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Cozy, charming and convenient I had a very pleasant stay at the Elysee during a VERY busy time in NYC - right in the middle of a huge fashion trade show, the Westminster Kennel Club dog show and a day after the biggest snowstorm in modern city history. The Elysee was a quiet haven, on less-busy 54th Street but within walking distance of Park Ave., Fifth Ave., Rockefeller Center, shopping, etc. My room, with its French decor, crystal chandelier and old-world furnishings, was one of only four on my entire floor (The 15th), so it was very quiet - like being in a gracious apartment building. Housekeeping was excellent. Bed was very comfortable. Two (very minor) things, however, both concerning the bathroom. It was lovely (black and white marble) and spotless, but the water pressure in both the shower and at the sink was uneven. Not a big deal for me, but I know this is an issue with some TripAdvisor members. It may have had something to do with me being on the top floor of an older building, but who knows. There was plenty of hot water, however. Also, the pedestal sink was pretty to look at, but offered no vanity space on which to store things. I'm a guy who can live out of a travel kit, so this isn't that big of an inconvenience for me, but it might be for women travelers with cosmetics, perfumes, etc. Still, minor quibbles. I would be more than happy to return to the Elysee. The breakfast in the Club Room is a nice touch, and the Monkey Bar is a lively, happening spot in an otherwise sedate, peaceful hotel (Good food and drinks, too). Check out Bill's across the street and Cinquanta Italian restaurant four blocks away on 50th St. for alternate places to go. There's also a decent wine shop across the street from the hotel. I highly recommend the Elysee.

<Content>Wonderful hotel; great location We booked an anniversary weekend at the Hotel Elysee based on the reviews we read on TripAdvisor. We were extremely pleased with the service, rooms, ambience, and amenities. Everything about this hotel was wonderful--the room we had was large and comfortable; the continental breakfast (included with the room rate) was excellent, and the appetizers and wine in the afternoon was also a real treat.The location was convenient to lots of places we wanted to visit and we walked all over. This is a gem of a hotel, and reasonably priced for what you get. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Old World Elegance in the Big Apple My wife and I spent a fabulously romantic weekend here right before Christmas and we were treated wonderfully. The Elysee has the feel of a hotel in the 1950s, but everything feels new and well maintained at the same time. Be sure to take part in the continental breakfast on the second floor, with comfortable couches and chairs, delicious eats and plenty of newspapers and books. If you're going to a Broadway play, it's very convenient and just the right walking distance. and have dinner at the Monkey Bar -- with its retro decor, you half expect Frank and Ava to walk in arm in arm. And have a drink at the old-school tavern Bill's 90s Piano Bar right across the street. Highly recommended!

<Content>Absolutey exquisite hide-away!! I will never stay anywhere else when going to New York City!!Yes, it was our first time in the city that never sleeps and I am thrilled we managed to choose to stay in this fabulous hotel. Every single member of staff was always and at all times attentive, forthcoming and helpful. Their whole attitude is the best selling point for this hotel!Our room was of a good size, which was important since we stayed there for 10 nights over the holiday season (Xmas 2005 until Jan. 2006). Furniture of high quality and very stylish. Bathroom of adequate size, nicely smelling soaps and toiletries, bathrobes of soft Turkish cotton. Really good.Our room looked out on the street and yes, weekdays you get some noise. But, since we come from a city it didn't bother us. However, I would recommend asking a room at the back of the building if you are not used to some level of street noise.The complimentary breakfast had a much larger selection of offerings than I would have expected and it could keep you going through most of the day. Coffee and teas remain available for the whole day and as from 5pm they also offer a selection of cheeses and wine (and champagne while we were there). It is a very nice touch, in a cozy and comfortable room, but we didn't run back to the hotel every day 'to take advantage' of this.Personally I would try at all times to stay at this little gem, but by comparing prices! It doesn't exactly come cheap, but you get much more than just 'good value' for what you pay.The only downside in my opinion, is that you need to leave the area for a fair choice of restaurants. There are some places around the hotel but not so inspired in my opinion. Catch a metro and head down to the village of restaurants' row and choices are much better. It's still close enough, but not necessarily 'walkable'.Anyway, DO NOT MISS STAYING HERE!!!

<Content>Charming Hotel I stayed at The Elysee 12/29/05 - 1/2/06 and found the hotel, the room, and the staff to be everything expected. I had a solarium room on the 7th floor that was extremly quiet (which was great as I did an extensive amount of clubbing and slept during the day)The staff were extremely professional and met all of my needs. I would definitly recommed The Elysee.

<Content>Elysee in downtown Manhattan was the Best Just returned from a 4-day stay at the Hotel Elysee in downtown Manhattan. It was a great stay.The staff was fantastic and very accommodating. It's central location was great and made getting around the city very easy, especially for us non-city folk!The continental breakfast was great and the evening wine and cheese was a great added touch.

<Content>Attention to Details At this ideal location (close to Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Times Square), you might think that location would be enough to want to stay here. However, this is a great hotel regardless of the location.The attention to detail really made our stay at the Hotel Elysee a special one. For example, there were fresh orchids on the table at breakfast, and the wines served during the free wine and cheese hour were not some cheap house wine, but unusual and very good brands. The marble in the bathroom and other little touches all added up to a great stay.The concierge was also able to easily find just the kind of restaurant we wanted to go to.The combination of location and attention to details made our weekend in New York a memorable one.

<Content>My favorite hotel in NYC!!! I always stay at the Elysee for business and personal trips to New York. While the location is very convenient, what really keeps me coming back is the outstanding service. Sometimes, it's the little touchs that set a hotel apart from the competition, and the Elysee excels in many ways. The attentive staff, the exceptional breakfast, free internet service; it's all here. They also have a great boardroom that's great for a small business meeting. I also need to give a mention for the Monkey Bar, which is a very cool, historic bar adjacent to the Elysee.

<Content>Great Hotel in Midtown As others have said this is a great hotel in Midtown, 2 minutes from the subway between Maddison and Lexington. Welcoming and helpful staff, great and spacious room, we had a Terrace! Im not telling which room number as you will all want it! The breakfast, the afternoon cookies, all day coffee, tea and the wine and cheese from 5 - 8pm couldnt be faulted. We had the Super Shuttle from JFK which was fine. But the hotel said that they had had trouble with them on occasions so recommended a taxi on return. On leaving at 4.45am, the clerk called a taxi for us and an older Lincoln towncar drew up. I think the driver was a friend of the porter. A fee was agreed $60 and we were wisked, a bit too fastly wisked to JFK in under 25 minutes! You may decide to try different transport. We will definately use this hotel again on returning to NYC

<Content>Even the clients enthuse about the hotel while staying here! My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel for 4 days in Oct'05.It was Room #55. It was in the front, on the Fifth Floor and had a pantry. If we had known this we could have used it more than we did because across the street is a wonderful looking Deli which could have easily supplied any meals needed. But as it was low in the building, it was very noisy at night due to the demolition of some offices/suites in nearby buildings. (Since then I have !!) The room was so nicely spacious  attractive so we were reluctant to move. We now understand that if you ask, quiet rooms are available. But if you like a corner room with windows on two sides, and have good earplugs this room would be simply superb as we are sure many others are from the rave comments of other clients. This is a great location. It has a common lounge that offers breakfast (there is no room service otherwise), tea/coffee/cookies from noon to 5 PM. Then wine  hors d'oeuvres from 5PM - 8PM. Lovely touches. Staff welcoming and informed. What more could one want in a mid to highend small customer oriented hotel? Suited our budget considering all the NY Hotel options. Trust you enjoy as we did!

<Content>Great small hotel in convenient location My husband and I stayed here over a long weekend, and found the hotel to be a quiet refuge, but close to theatre district, Rockefeller Center, etc. We almost stayed in Times Sq. and are so grateful we chose the Elysee instead. It is very clean, the rooms are generously sized (except for a very small bathroom), and the staff was friendly and pleasant. The complimentary continental breakfast was better than at many hotels. The free wine and cheese on weekdays, and coffee and cookies throughout the week, was a nice touch. (Although I think they could have done a lot better than Pepperidge Farm!). We would not hesitate to stay here again!

<Content>I finally found my favorite hotel in New York -- Hotel Elysee I am a frequent traveler to New York, both business and pleasure. Over the years, I tried a new hotel with every visit; I generally had a pleasant experience. And then, a friend told me about Hotel Elysee and now it is my home away from home. This small hotel treats me like animportant member of its family.When I checked into the hotel the first time, the expert staff called me by name and made me feel that they were so happy to meet me; it was as if they had been waiting all afternoon for my arrival. when I returned in the evening, they inquired about my day. No need for an appointed concierge --each front desk person is trained to provide full concierge services.The hotel itself is understated elegance. (It's been voted most romantic several times.) Artistic floral bouquets provide a sweet fragrance throughout the gracious lobby. The rooms, by New York standards, are large, well-appointed including marble bathrooms.And what could be better than your morning starting with a complete continental breakfast available (juices, fresh fruit, Danish, bagels, good coffees and tea); followed with wine (respectable vineyards), cheeses, fruit, fresh breads and crackers between 5:00 and 8:00 pm; and coffee, tea and cookies available until midnight. In fact, I have often met friends for wine and cheese and then gone out on the town.When I ride the elevator, I often ask other guests about their experiences at Hotel Elysee. To date, they all have responded either that they love the hotel and always stay there or this is their first time and they will be back. In fact, during my last stay, as I was riding the elevator down to check out on Sunday, a young couple carrying a wedding dress and bridal bouquet got on. They were married the previous day and that night -- Saturday -- was their first time at Hotel Elysee. With stars in their eyes, they told me they would be back! I smiled and thought, I'll be back too.

<Content>Elysee: Great Staff, Location, Amenties,  As travelers who have grown weary of huge, impersonal hotels we could not have been more pleased with our recent stay at the Hotel Elysee. There are many positive features of this boutique hotel. At the top of the list is the hotel staff. Service was excellent, friendly and personal. The staff made recommendations and arrangements for dining, theatre tickets, and car service. Regardless of the request, the staff was accommodating. The location was extremely convenient to all the places on our NY itinerary (theatre, museums, shopping,  dining). The hotel d茅cor is a reminder of the warmth and elegance of a bygone era. We especially enjoyed the comfortable Club Room where a breakfast buffet is spread each morning and wine and cheese in late afternoon. Loved the personable and friendly staff!

<Content>The Ultimate in Personal Service Having recently returned from our first trip to NYC, it is easy to say that our stay at Hotel Elysee was as impressive as any landmark and as fabulous as any Broadway play. Our amenities and accomodations were bountiful and very tasteful. The free morning breakfast met every expectation with a wide variety of morning drinks, fresh fruit, delectable pastries and the oft-missing proteins in addition to the endless supply of morning newspapers, including The New York Times and USA Today. We were most impressed with the accomodating and knowledgable staff who greeted us by name and made sure we had point-precise directions for every outing. The recommendations for restaurants and shows were superb in every way. It would not be fair to review this uniquely personable hotel without noting the daily wines. champagne and cheeses et al served gratis each day. It was the ultimate in Old World elegance and personality. Without a doubt, we were extremely well taken care of and will return to Hotel Elysee as many times as we return to New York; can't wait for the next visit there!

<Content>Added extras means luxury cost less! We got married in New York and stayed at the Hotel Elysee as our 'luxury' option. They upgraded us to a suite , they didn't even mention it at check in - we just arrived in the room and were blown away - which was utterly fabulous. But even the standard rooms are gorgeous. Really quirkly hotel - great restaurant and the Monkey Bar is a New York Institution - it was featured in Sex and the City - Carrie and Big went there. Where else has bar stools in the shape of pimento olives!!! Small enough for total personal service (great staff) but big enough to have everything you could ask for in a hotel. THey even opened the bar early for us on the morning of our wedding so the wedding party could gather there while we waited on the limo to pick us up. The buffet breakfast is fab and there is even wine and cheese in the afternoon. We chose this hotel for a little taste of luxury and stayed in the Belvedere for a fews days before the wedding as a cheaper option - however - when you add up the extra cost for breakfast at the Belvedere - it was actually cheaper to stay at the Elysee -(we selected both hotels via this website) and you can't beat the wine and cheese after an afternoons shopping in Henri Bendels (just around the corner). Perfect location for shopping and visiting cental park. A great base for Manhattan in general. We'll be back!

<Content>Wonderful quirky boutique hotel Great club room for breakfast and dinner hour snacks. Nice rooms with everything working - which isn't always the case for NYC hotels. Would be nice to have more than one elevator on occasion - being on a low floor allows for a quick trip up the steps (but you can't descend the stairs below the third floor). Having the Monkey Bar and Restaurant on site is a nice plus.

<Content>A TOP choice for Midtown--just avoid a room that faces the street! Just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Elysee...the room was beautiful with a spacious (as far as NYC hotel bathrooms go), recently renovated bathroom. Loved having the two big windows facing the street UNTIL I was trying to get to sleep. Unbelievably noisy! I couldn't believe how many times dumpsters needed to be emptied in the middle of the night. Plus there were often loud patrons leaving The Monkey Bar (adjacent to the hotel) and Bill's across the street. I should have asked to be moved after the first night but didn't want to bother. On the plus side, the location is ideal--in the heart of midtown and steps from the best shopping in the world. The club room on the second floor is a wonderful haven, like having a big living room as an extension of your hotel room. Great place to meet up with friends or business colleagues or just to unwind if you're traveling alone and don't feel like holing up in your room. The evening cheese and wine, vegetables, cookies, tea and coffee can easily substitute for a dinner out if you've had a big lunch. The continental breakfast serves up some of the best bagels you've eaten, fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, even hard-boiled eggs. Piles of newspapers are available, and there is even a computer with online access you can use for free, plus a nicely-stocked library. It is truly a home away from home (just get a room in the back that doesn't face the street!) Plus it's the BEST VALUE you will find in Manhattan, especially when you factor in what you can save on food. I made some phone calls and was pleased I wasn't gouged! And if you need an umbrella the bellhop will offer you one. Everyone was gracious and friendly and willing to go the extra mile. Across the street is one of the city's top seafood restaurants--Oceana--not to be missed as well!

<Content>Beautiful hotel, amazing breakfast, great location! I took my mom to the Hotel Elysee for Mother's Day and we had the most wonderful time. The hotel is perfectly located, 1 block from 5th Ave., close enough to walk to Central Park or the theatre district very easily. The room was big and the beds comfortable, and the seperate changing area/foyer was a nice touch. The elevator takes forever, but the abundant breakfast (way beyond your usual croissants and bagels: they had hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fresh fruit, etc.) was more than enough to make up for it. Staff were extremely friendly, they even tracked down a restaurant for me when I called from the theatre. The 1 p.m. check-out is also a nice tough.We will definitely stay at the Hotel Elysee whenever we come to NYC.

<Content>Ten Year anniversary Just spent a weekend for our 10 year anniversary. Very nice hotel. Told them we were celebrating our anniversary and when we checked in had a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates waiting for us. Great location close enough to walk to times square but far enough away to get away from the noise. Close to 5th ave. shops and central park. Service was outstanding. Served us in the Monkey Bar restaurant even though they were getting ready to close. we were the only ones in the restaurant which was a nice touch. The club room was great. Free wine and cheese during the week is a nice touch. Also serve free coffee and cookies all day. Great place to sit and relax! Would definitely recommend. Had a great time.

<Content>Tranquil Retreat in the Heart of the Big Apple Love this hotel! Where else would you find a staff who would run out in the middle of the night for bandages! Everyone there we talked to felt the same way, an impossible to find, service oriented small hotel in midtown with a fabulous breakfast and sitting area and nice rooms with everything you could want. if a slow elevator bothers you, ask for a room on a low floor and walk down. Cannot recommend this hotel enough!

<Content>Great location Great location - very close to the newly re-opened Midtown Museum of Modern Art and, of course, all of the shopping. Breakfast, beverages and snacks in the second floor gathering room are definitely a plus.Upon check-in, I was originally assigned a room on the 6th floor which was rather noisy (large exhaust fan outside below). I called the front desk, explained the problem, and was immediately moved to a much quieter room on the 15th floor. Very satisfactory handling of the issue.Rooms are traditionally furnished and in good, although not perfect, shape. My room had both a minibar and a separate fridge. The bed was okay - not superb, but certainly not a problem. I slept well every night.One of the earlier reviews indicated that there is only one hotel elevator - actually there are two. The main guest elevator was out of service for a couple of hours one day, so I was directed to use the service elevator (it's off the stairs) - not as fancy, but it got the job done. This hotel has above average housekeeping.

<Content>Loved the Elysee We just returned from a 3 night Christmas stay at the Hotel Elysee. This is a fantastic hotel! The location cannot be beat. The rooms were beautifully appointed, spacious (for NYC) and very clean. The service from front desk to bellman was wonderful. Anything we needed was provided. When we asked for a cot for our young daughter, we were advised that they did not have any cots but would move us, free of cost, to a bigger room with a pull-out sofa. The complimentary breakfast served in the second floor club room was fresh, plentiful and the tea, coffee and cookies served all day were a welcome treat. I would stay here again.
