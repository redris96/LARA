<Content>Excellent - but very expensive! We spent three nights at this hotel just after Christmas and over the New Year. It was a beautiful property with lovely rooms and great public spaces. The staff were absolutely outstanding - courteous, helpful and charming.However: the cost of food and drink was outrageous! Bearing in mind that this is a four star hotel, a continental breakfast should not cost more than 20 Euros, and nor should a round of three coffees and three Cokes in the hotel bar set the customer back nearly 50 Euros! Hilton are really having a laugh with these prices. 7 Euros for a Coke!

<Content>Great Hotel Very nice hotel within a 7-10 minute walk to The Arc de Triomphe and only a 5 minute walk to the Metro......Rooms were lager than normal for a European hotel. The service was excellent and during my entire stay, every staff member gave me the impression they would do whatever it took to insure my stay was pleasant. I will certainly stay at this Hilton again!

<Content>One of the few Parisian hotels that truly caters to families... This is one of the few Parisian hotels that truly caters to families. Booking appropriate rooms was straightforward. The hotel also gives 50% off on the second room for kids. At check in the hotel staff gave nice gifts to the kids (coloring books, teddy bears, etc). This set a good tone for the rest of the stay (July 2008). Restaurants are ok, but there are many nice restaurants nearby. Visit the beautiful Parc Monceau (200 meter walk). Rooms were clean and well serviced.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel We stayed in the Hilton Paris using my Hilton points and found the hotel very nice and up to the normal Hilton very high standards in terms of service, staff etc..We had access to the Executive Lounge which was very nice. It was quite busy in the morning at breakfast but otherwise it was excellent.The rooms in the hotel are lovely. The hotel is located about 10 mins from the Champs Elyesse and about 5 mins from the nearest metro station.Overall we had a very nice time in the hotel and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Treated us like royalty I spent a lot of time trying to decide where my bride and I would stay during our honeymoon. I did a lot of research, torn between wanting it to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience and not depleting my savings account. In the end, I chose the Hilton and was able to use points for a free stay. I made the decision with a bit of trepidation, worrying that I was choosing savings over the memorable experience.I need not have worried. The hotel lobby was pretty, the room was nice and the sauna and jacuzzi downstairs were spectacular. Best of all, the staff treated us like kings. They put us on the executive floor, which gave us access to free breakfasts and free food and drink in the executive lounge. A couple of nights, after a big lunch, we simply stayed in, eating a snack in the lounge while drinking decent champagne. Not bad!Another night, we had a terrific meal in the cozy ground-floor bar/restaurant. The waiter treated us like stars, serving us dinner even though they had officially closed the kitchen 15 minutes earlier.During our stay, the concierge desk answered all of our questions authoritively and with good humor.To top it off, when my wife left behind clothes in the chest of drawers, they hadn't disappeared. Instead, the hotel (for a fee, which was fair), sent the clothes to her.In sum, the Paris Hilton and its wonderful staff left us with wonderful memories of our honeymon stay.

<Content>Perfect From the Moment We Arrived! When you arrive at your hotel after travelling all night, struggling with luggage and finding your way in a new city, it is wonderful to arrive at a hotel that makes you feel welcome and comfortable the moment you step out of the taxi. This was our first trip to Paris (two adults; two teens) and the Hilton was the perfect choice for us. We like to experience as much of the local feel of cities we visit as possible -- experimenting with speaking the language, local cuisine, public transportation, neighborhood pubs, etc. However, having a safe place to land at the end of the day where English is spoken and the accomodations are superb makes the trip all the more special.When we arrived, we were offered a discounted upgrade to a suite, which we accepted. The hotel is beautiful and modern. The location is just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe, where you can hop on a bus or metro. The Executive Lounge was an added bonus, serving a delicious hot breakfast, drinks, wine and beer through the day and evening and snacks. Really first rate!One note of caution! If you do not speak French, be sure to take a card or something with the hotel name, address and telephone number with you when you venture out. Our French is extremely limited and we couldn't pronounce the hotel name and street well enough to be understood and got lost a few times. The Paris locals tried to help, but it was our fault for not having the address and name written down.

<Content>Exceptional Hilton Experience I have been to Paris many times and stayed at many different hotels including the Marriott Champs Elysees and I have to say that this hotel beats them by a mile. The Marriott location is great but that is about all that was great. The Hilton Arc de Triomphe was exceptional in many ways. First and foremost the hotel is beautifully decorated in an Art Deco feel. We were greeted very warmly at the reception and were upgraded to a suite (Platinum American Express). They knew it was our special anniversary and they treated us as such. We had daily use of the Executive Lounge which was wonderful. It had a great selection of drinks and snacks. Our suite was lovely and clean. The bed was so soft I didn't want to get out of it. On our first day when we returned at night we arrived to a room full of roses, champagne, and amazing chocolate cake. They had a note congratulating us on our anniversary. The location is wonderful as well, it is a five minute walk to the metro. It looked to be in a very stylish part of the city with lots of designer shops. On some days when we weren't dying from foot pain, we actually walked from the hotel to the Champs Elysee which was about a 15 minute walk. There is a restaurant right across the street and there is also a pharmacy right next door. The hotel looked to have some beautiful restaurants, however we didn't have time to dine in them (too many wonderful places to eat in Paris to stay in the hotel). I'm sure people are going to think that I am nuts for my next praise, however as an American in Europe, I have to note this because it is rare to find. The hotel has an Ice Machine on every floor. In Europe, they aren't big on ice, but I am and I was so beyond pleased to see it. We adore Paris and visit as often as we can and from now on we won't be staying anywhere else but at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe.

<Content>No Upgrades for Diamond Members The hotel itself is lovely, but do not expect any upgrades or preferential treatment if you are a Hilton diamond member. The manager greeted us which was nice, but then said there were no upgrades available. She proceeded to tell us that we could still use the executive lounge. Umm, this is always included with diamonod memberships, but she tried to pass it off as something extrra. All in all it's a nice hotel, but do not expect anything extra for being a loyal Hilton customer.

<Content>great stay!!! We stayed here for our last night in Paris and absolutely loved it.Great Location and Service. We used Honors points and hoped for Executive level upgrade in celebration of our anniversary. Unfortunately, that floor was booked but received a special surprise in our room upon returning from a shopping trip. Nothing like returning to a bottle of champagne, flowers and dessert. We were impressed and hope to return the favor by an extended stay the next time we are in Paris.

<Content>Excellent hotel This is a lovely hotel; very impressive lobby and great, well decorated (art deco) rooms (ours was lucky enough to have a slight view of the Eiffel Tower). Good location as well, about a 7-10 walk to Arc du Triomphe. I've stayed at other Hilton hotels in Paris and this is by far the best one.

<Content>BEST ROMENTIC GET AWAY! I am very surprise seeing some poor reviews on this hotel from some guests - just maybe they were using points or very demanding without respect.We got in today, we explain very friendly that we were celebrating our 20th Aniversary and would be nice to have an upgrade.They already upgraded us to the executve floor of which we stated we already were on executive floor so they upgraded us to a full suite at no charge.After getting to the suite my wife found it too far from elevator and once again we ask for another room. No problems if we would not mind waiting 30-60 mins.We went to the Executive Lounge, smoking and having a great time with quality drinks/food...very recommend..Our room was ready in 45 mins and near elevator and on top 7th floor - full suite!My wife loved it and therefor I was happy...It is a very GOOD HOTEL in a very nice area... even my friends were recommending it without knowing that we already booked it.When you are polite, nice to people and if they have the availability the staff at HILTON will go the extra mile to make you happy!!!

<Content>Great hotel in excellent location Great room in a great location with an excellent Executive Hospitality Suite. We were celebrating our 40th anniversary and this was the 4th of 5 hotels. As a Hilton Honors Gold member we received an executive level room with access to their executive hospitality suite. Great breakfasts and great light suppers. The room was very well appointed with typical, great Hilton touches. The Metro was a few minutes away and made for easy, fast travel throughout the city. We were treated very well by the staff with no snootyness. But some of the other guests in the executive suite were really PROUD of themselves! But we were just amused by their self-aggrandizements. As a business oriented location, there weren't many places nearby to eat late. But be aware, they do dress up a bit more in Paris. But then, at our age, we really didn't care. Contrary to some guidebooks, take a cab to and from this hotel. The train/Metro thing is quite a pain and physically demanding if you have some gray hairs. Pulling a suitcase up some flights of stairs from the Metro was a bit of a workout. Yes, a cab cost us a bit, but well worth it when we left. If you can afford it, or have enough Hilton points, stay here.

<Content>Great, but not for Honeymoon. We had a good experience, but not a good place for our Honeymoon. We wanted something a little more romantic and with a better view. However, this is a great place to stay with family and friends.

<Content>Very Good Experiences Having now stayed on four seperate occasions, I'm pleased to report that the Hilton Arc de Triomphe is a well maintained, pleasant, and friendly hotel on the west end of Paris, and this assessment has been consistent throughout. Some of the benefits to staying at this property are the larger room sizes (one can very comfortably fit a family of 4 into their Double Double room--an unusual feature in Paris where normally you can only get 2 people in a room), the proximity to the Metro (stop: Courcilles), the prices are generally less than other comparable properties, the neighborhood (8th arrondisement), and the staff (very friendly and helpful at all times, especially Olivier the concierge). Negatives include being slightly further out from the center of Paris--there is no direct Metro to the center of town so you must change trains, very expensive dining and bar, and the fact that is is an American chain so you are not really getting a real taste of Paris like you would in a smaller type hotel. Overall, most Americans will find this American chain a very good value and will be pleased with the space.Be warned, though, the rooms at the front of the hotel which face the street suffer from an incredible amount of street noise IF the window is open. My room was incredibly warm during my last stay here, and I was forced to have the window open, causing sleepless nights. Next time I will insist on a courtyard room to avoid this issue.

<Content>Very good top star hotel in the centre of Paris A very good hotel 10 min walk from Champs Elysee and Arc de Triomphe.I had a room overlooking the small nice internal garden: very quiet accomodation in the centre of Paris.Elegant room in almost new conditions, although there is an obsolete 20 CRT TV and a few minor details to be fixed.Bathroom with shower in tub, no bidet.Very comfortable bed, double glazed window that really guarantees noise insulation, wired internet connectivity, wireless signal was weak in my room.The room is large enough, with sitting area.Underground parking with lift to lobby.The parking is limited in size and many places are reserved, so it may be difficult to park in busy hours.Good breakfast in the restaurant. Room service menu ethnically varied but somewhat limited. Official room rates are very high, but it's a Hilton in the centre of Paris !If you can find a suitably discounted rate, it might be a good choice even for a short touristic stay, right in the centre of the french capital city (which will save a lot of time and possibly money).

<Content>Great hotel I stayed here one night on a work trip. The hotel was fantastic, one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in while visiting Paris. The room was a very nice size. The only downside to the room was that the wired internet in the room didn't work, and after spending 30 minutes on the phone w/ their support' team, it still remained unfixed. Other than that, I would definitely stay in the hotel again.

<Content>Good location, spotty service We stayed here for 3 nights on Hilton points on the executive level on the 6th floor which gave us the ability to use the exec lounge for free (all day drinks, food, etc.) I would recommend if staying at the hotel to check into that option. We ate breakfast at the hotel as well as snacks throughout the day and saved a considerable amount doing so. I will agree that this hotel in the US is probably a 3.5 star hotel. The carpet in the room was dirty, and for 3 nights they didn't change the linens (I had a slight nose bleed the first night and even with a blood stain on the pillocase/sheet they still didn't change them). The location is decent. If you are in good physical shape, the Arc is about 10 minutes away (walking) and the tower about 20-25 minutes. Printemps and Galleries Lafayette are about 10-15 min. walk as well.The staff we found to be pretty helpful and all spoke English well. Would I stay here again? On points or with a great deal (under 400/night) I would, but otherwise, probably not.

<Content>Nice Hotel Decor My husband and I stayed 2 nights at this hotel. We did not have any problems with reception. They all spoke English very well. However, we had 4 large luggages with us and the porters were not easily available on our departure.The decor of the hotel was nice (art deco). Our standard room followed the decor of the rest of the hotel. We had a King size bed in the size of a 'North American' standard room size. It had plenty of room for all our luggage. It was clean and equip with a shower stall and a nice sized bathtub.Unfortunately, there was a fair bit of noise in the room above. I'm not sure if it was a service room as it sounded like people moving furniture around. I never called it in.This hotel was located in a quiet neighbourhood. The nearest metro stop was about a 10-15 minute walk away. There were many restaurants that were within walking distance of the hotel.

<Content>just so so My family of three stayed at the hotel for 7 days. I don`t think the room was cleaned throughly for 5 of those days. We would leave a piece of something on the floor at various spots and it would still be there when we returned.The first day we were given 2 free bottles of water for 3 people then none at all. We left a note and requested more water and 2 more pillows the note stayed on the pad for three days and the fourth day it was gone.Nothing was left.Would i stay again i don`t know.The staff was great but i agree with one poster they do make fun of the people staying there i saw it happen 3 times and one of the times it was at our party.

<Content>Great Hotel!! My wife and I stayed here last week for our anniversary and and thought it to be a wonderful experience. First we arrived on a Sunday morning expecting only to be able to drop our bags off with the concierge, but instead were able to get into our room which overlooked the courtyard. That night when we came back from dinner, they had a bottle of champagne and nice note welcoming us for our anniversary. The entire hotel staff was very friendly and spoke very good english (and were not rude about my lack of french speaking) and the rooms were very clean. They were also very good about providing directions and we emailed the concierge in advance to set up 3 dinner reservations, and even though we arrived right after most of the restaurants had been closed during August, they had all of the reservations made by the second day we were there. The hotel is about 2 blocks from a metro stop and is in a quiet neighborhood, which is nice if that is what you are looking for. Also they do have a unbrella stand which they were more than willing to let us use on multiple occasions (which was good since a couple of times it either rained or looked as though it might).Overall it was a great experience and i would recommend it.

<Content>One of the worst hotels ever We stayed at the Hilton for one night on 22 August 2008.We have booked a prepaid rate at 275 Euro for a King Size Bed. And the drama began. After receiving the credit card statement, we were surprised to find out that they have not only charged the credit card with the prepaid rate of 275 Euro, but also with an additional 1,600 Euro. To make a long story short, it took us more than a week to get Hilton to transfer the money back ! We have never received a word of apology !!!Upon arriving there, staff were friendly as hell. It took ages to check in and my wife had to participate in an urgent conference call. When answering the guy at the reception if there is a quite area in the hotel to take this call, he replied No.. So he got us the keys to the room, my wife rushed upstairs and I have spoken to the Guest Relation Manager about the credit card charge. Finally someone apologiesed and promised us to send some champagne for the inconvience (unfortunately, it has never arrived). In the meantime, I got a phone call from my wife that the keys don't work. So she ran back downstairs and the receptionist thought he might have to give us a lessen in how to use the keys first before putting the code back on. Of course, he forgot it in the first time. While my wife was doing the phone call, I thought about buying some water in a supermarket. So I asked the porter outside the hotel and he simply returned: I don't give directions. So I had to go back inside ask someone at the reception for a supermarket and was told, that they don't know whether there is a supermarket around the area. So I went back outside and it was pouring. So I thought I could take a Hilton umbrella. The porter refused to give me one.Coming to the room. It was very small, the sheets and the towels smelled as if someone has smoked with it (although it was a non-smoking room). The room was facing an office building and you were able to see the screens of the guys working there, which gives you really a nice feeling of privacy for your room. In addition, a church is somewhere close to the hotel and the church bell rings every hour. Furthermore, the air condition was making some burbing sound during our entire stay.The bathroom is as tiny as the room and you can see some stains and mould here and there. The shower is really uncomfortable.Anyhow, having experience in several hotels of this class in various cities around the world, this hotel is maximum a two star hotel and the employees should really get a training in how to deal with guests.

<Content>very snooty Don't stay here if you can get a room at the Eiffel Tower Hilton. The quality of staff here can in no way compare to the staff at the Eiffel Tower Hilton. And the room was dirty and small. The wait staff in the Executive Lounge would openly make fun of the guests with one another. I saw them pointing and laughing at one middle-aged woman because of the orthopedic shoes she had on and they did this right in front of her! And the doormen were only interested in helping the Sheik and his party. I guess this is how the French have gotten their reputation for snootiness. I won't stay here again if I can help it.

<Content>Loved the Hilton Arch de Triomphe HIghly recomend this hotel. Their club floor was one of the best I've been too and it includes a full American breakfast. We had a king terrace suite that had a huge balcony overlooking the Eiffel tower. Beautiful hotel with exceptional service and very conveniently located. If ever I return to Paris, and Im sure I will, I will definately look into staying there again.

<Content>Friendly Staff, location was not ideal for us Decided to stay at this hotel while in Paris. We were a family group of 9 so we booked 2 family suites. The family suites are actually just 2 rooms with a common hallway. I was thinking it would be more like 2 bedrooms with a sitting room. Either way, it worked for us. The staff was VERY friendly, helpful  even managed to help us get our large group to the train station on time! Bed was comfortable, bathroom was a little on the small side but well appointed. The restaurant was fine - we ate there the first night because it was late  we were tired. Had room service one morning for breakfast  it was very good. There is a very nice bar - The Purple Bar - on the main floor with outdoor seating (watch out for the pigeons tho!). The downside is that the hotel is not as close to a main street as I thought. There was not something close by to go grab a soda or pastry. The walk to the Arc was a little long for my elderly parents. Again, the staff was very very nice  helpful.

<Author>SDTraveler007
<Content>Overrated Based on the reviews on this site, I decided to experiment and spend one night at this Hilton during my trip last week. Overall, it's a relatively nice hotel and I can understand to a certain degree some of the enthusiasm here. But, as a frequent traveler and a guest of several hotels in the Paris area alone, I just don't feel that this hotel property merits the accolades people are writing here and certainly not in proportion to the prices that they charge.I ran into several problems in my short stay:1) The biggest problem that I ran into was that the Air Conditioning unit in my room (located in the ceiling near the door) began to vibrate randomly around 2:30 in the morning. To get an idea of how this sounded, imagine a cell phone hidden in the ceiling that would vibrate loudly and randomly every couple of minutes (sometimes multiple times in a minute). I of course tried turning off the AC unit and wearing ear plugs, but the unit would still vibrate (and I could still here the vibrating with ear plugs), so I called the Front Desk (I speak French fluently) to tell them the problem. At first they wanted to send a technician to the room to start working on the unit in the ceiling. I said that this would be fine if I could move to another room (I needed to wake up early), but of course, the hotel was full. So, they said that they would have a technician try to shut off power to the unit from the central station. I was fine with this, but it ended up taking nearly 45 minutes to have the unit's power terminated. So, after being awoken by the faulty unit, I wasn't able to go back to sleep for at least an hour. I understand that technical problems happen and will give them credit for finding a way to stop the problem in a relatively timely manner. However, for any hotel that is charging prices at this level, there needs to be some sort of compensation to the customer in return for any inconvenience like this. This is where they fell short, simply saying that they couldn't offer reduced rates, breakfast at no charge, etc. They simply weren't willing to correct this wrong and so this is the biggest reason that I cannot recommend this hotel to any other potential guests.1) The mattress is way too firm - one of the firmest that I have come across in a hotel. I tend to like mattresses on the firmer side, but this really was extreme. My back and neck were slightly sore the next morning.2) There is a raised tile-covered ridge between the sink room and the toilet room in the bathroom that is unexpected and difficult to see in the dark. I slammed one of my toes on this pretty hard during the night.4) The hallways had a slightly fishy odor. It wasn't strong by any means, but it still smelled a bit off when walking to my room.5) This is more of a caveat and has been mentioned on here, but the hotel isn't located right by the Arc de Triomphe or Champs Elysees. Instead, it is a 10-15 minute walk away.With all the hotels that are available in Paris, I feel that there are other, better options in terms of comfort, price and service. In particular, the service element is what is lacking at this hotel. The staff weren't mean, snotty or anything of that nature. They just didn't seem to care and definitely didn't understand that in response to a problem that interrupts and prevents the client from sleeping, they need to find a way to compensate for this. Instead they acted indifferent about the issue and so I've chosen to come here and offer this as a potential warning to other travelers. Bon Voyage...

<Content>Best hotel I ever stayed in This hotel has a great location near the Arc de Triomphe. Is is however located in a quiet area, on walking distance from all the action, Champs, etc.Staff is very well trained and super great, the design of the interior is fabulous (see the bathrooms in the basement!) and breakfast was superb. Service is flawless.Triple A rating!

<Content>Comfort at the Hilton in Paris Stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for 5 days and found it to be very nice. The room was compfortable and very clean. The staff efficient, friendly and helpful. The location was convenient but was in a quieter residential type area....it was a new location for me and I really enjoyed the area which was good for walking and had some nice restaurants. I will go back. The only downside is the usual over priced breakfast buffet....skip it and go down the street for coffee and a croissant.

<Content>Loved this hotel. Great staff. We stayed here in early July, and while it is true it isn't a typical Parisien hotel (as another reviewer mentioned), it is still superb. The rooms were good size, especially for Europe, clean, well appointed, and very quiet. The staff, though, is the real gem. Every single one was friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. The staff in the bar were so much fun. The restaurant was very good. Breakfast is expensive, however we were given free breakfast coupons, otherwise we would not have eaten there as often, just due to the cost. Everyone at the concierge desk did a fantastic job, and when we explained what we wanted to do, their suggestions were perfect. I would definitely stay there again with no hesitation. Yes, we did use points but this review wouldn't be different if we had paid.

<Content>Are you buying the sizzle or the steak? Don't get me wrong, as the Hilton Arc de Triomphe Hotel was definitely better than most I have stayed in in France, but then again you would come expect this from a Category Six ranked Hilton Hotel. As such, you would come expect that your experience would be superb and with out worry or issues, but this was not the case I experienced.I checked into the hotel and initially I was offered only a standard room! French language difficulties were of no concern as almost all staff speak English fluently even if you try to converse in French. For the record, I am Hilton Honors Gold member and I booked this trip using my Hilton Honors points at a cost of 120,000 points or 40,000 points a day. I insisted that I be offered a room on the Executive level, and I was accommodated, but I felt that I should not have had to ask for what had already been reserved.Upon arriving at my room the air conditioner did not work. Once again I felt that this should have been checked out ahead of my arrival. Needless to say, I had visit the concierge on the executive floor to be relocated to yet another room.The Executive/Hilton Honors floor rooms are nicely decorated and quite comfortable, but the beds do have a single sheet, but a duvet instead. On hot days (July is humid), I had to request that a sheet be added below the duvet. Everything in Paris is quite expensive, so it was a real pleasant experience, unlike the US, to know that the Executive Lounge is stocked with snacks and food at certain times on the day. It is possible to actually eat a full breakfast, lunch and dinner in the Executive Lounge if you choose.Praise: 1. Definitely a better hotel that what is available elsewhere in Paris. For the price you pay you are left comparing actual value perceived versus high expense.2. The staff in the Purple Bar is outstanding and fluent in English.Criticisms:1. TIP: Housekeeping staff tend NOT to knock, but walk right in, unless your door is locked or you have the DO NOT DISTURB sign up.2. The staff in the Executive Lounge demonstrate a bit of an arrogant attitude, and this just shouldn't be the case, especially since most of those hotel guests are Hilton Honors members. A. I found one Executive Lounge waiter joking about another guest which is entirely unprofessional. B. Another Executive Lounge waiter handed me a fork by fork end and not the handle. He looked upset when I asked him for a different fork. Then I informed him that I am a sommelier by profession, and he should have known better. 3. The hotel staff service is definitely better than most other hotels, but it certainly is not the best I experienced on my two week trip to France. Had I not booked this stay using my Hilton Honors points, I would have been very disappointed if I would have had to pay for hotel stay as it was not exceptional by any means.

<Content>Modern Marvel This hotel is a gem--being in Paris, it is safe to say that staying in an american hotel is your best bet because the french can be condescending to Anericans. The service at this hotel couldn't have been any better. We arrived and the terrace lunch restaurant was full, but Sarah, this woman that works at the hotel and helped to accomodate us during our entire stay, made us an extra table just so that we could eat in the gardens. When our room was finally ready, we were thankful to have an elevator to carry our luggage up without a hassel. Our room was gorgeous--very moden Paris--and the bathroom was like every other hilton in that it had a great bath/shower (a giant wonderful tub) and came equipt with bath robes. Breakfast comes with your stay and feel blessed that breakfast is as extensive as it is because in many other htoels you'll find that a toast and tea is all you are served. They had a chef making fresh crepes, pancakes, and omlettes that were delicious and had a variety of other delicious goodies. The concierge at the hotel was wonderfully helpful, and also, the hotel had a transport every hour to the other hilton hotel by the eiffel tower so you could be a short jaunt to the eiffel tower. Also, it is simply a short walk to the arch de triomph.

<Content>Why all the fuss ? At the time of writing, Tripadvisor rates this as one of the top 50 hotels in Paris, out of well over 1 000. Not sure I can see why. There's nothing wrong with it, but nothing that great either. The rooms are pretty small (mine certainly was). It's impossible to get a decent shower because it's underpowered and mounted at an odd angle. The location is not ideal - you have to walk 10 mins to get anywhere - not just the sights, but even a decent cafe or restaurant. The Arc de Triomphe, from which it takes its name, is a good 15 mins brisk walk. It's also very geared to the mass tourist market - each morning there were tour company desks set out in the lobby, and regularly large crowds milling around waiting to be herded off somewhere. I had a business meeting one morning and the only place we could get coffee was to join the throng in the restaurant for breakfast - noisy, crowded and slow service. The building is well kept and the decor is fairly funky but fails to endow the hotel with any real atmosphere. I think this must be the reason for the high rating. Many of the reviews are from non - Europeans and apart from the decor you could be anywhere; nicely insulated from the eccentricities of Paris. The week before I stayed in the Hotel du Louvre, which attracts more critical reviews because its older and to an extent showing its age. Nonetheless, it was in a better location, 鈧?50 less per night, and staying there you really feel like you are in Paris. I know where I'll be booking next trip.

<Content>Good hotel and staff We arrived in Paris, tired and hungry. Our room was not ready until noon, but we went to breakfast at the hotel while we waited. We were a family of four, two adults and two teens. We had a double double room. The room was decorated modern. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom modern. The hotel was nice.The staff was very helpful and everyone spoke english very well. The breakfast was excellent and was free because my husband is Hilton Gold. We did not get on the executive floor, but that was okay since we had a full breakfast downstairs each day. This saved us a lot of money. The room was small, but large enough for sleeping. We had air conditioning which does not go full blast, but cooled down enough. It was very hot outside. We had a view of the Eiffel tower from our room if you looked straight out. If you looked down, the view was large containers in a grass, weedy area. Not very pretty, but it was quiet and that is what I asked for. It is not right in the mix of things, but close enough to everything. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Stay! My family and I just retuned from a 10 day trip to London, Paris and Normandy. We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Waldorf before taking the Eurostar to Paris and staying at the Arc De Triomphe Paris; we can not say enough good things about this hotel! The hotel itself is onyl 5 years old...the lobby is very impresive with large crystal chandeliers and a beautiful sitting area! Upon checking in we were quickly given our rooms which included breakfast. The hotel's decor is inspired by the glamou of the Normandy ship andother grand transatlantic ships. The rooms, beds and amenities are all very comfortable with housekeeping twice a day. Breakfast each moring consisted of omlettes, panckaes and others eggs made to order in addition to pastries, fruit, lunch meats and other breakfast items. It was very plentiful each morning. One night after a long day of sight seeing we decided to take dinner in the adjoing patio restuatrant off the lobby. It was wondeful and the service was very top notch. The location of this hotel is within a 5 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe...take a left and another left when leaving the hotel! Two blocks from the hotel (to the right) is a grocery store for regular items such as water and any forgotten toilteries. The hotel staf was great! We were always greeted with a hello Sir or Maam and everyone was kind. The concierge staff was very helpful with directions. During our stay we had rented a car at Budget...long story short the car caught fire only a few blocks from the rental place! We qucikly retunred the car to Budget to find out that was there last car of th day and that we wer eout of luck! We quickly contacted the hotel concierge and they arranged for a Mercedes Van to be delivered to the hotel within a half hour. They saved our weekend to Bayex and Omaha Beach! While we were gone they haeld our luggage!We had a great stay!

<Content>great location, great staff My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for 6 days and then for 1 day. Staff were all delightful. They let us leave our luggage at the hotel for 2 days while we travelled to the south of France. . All staff spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian and other languages. We stayed on the executive floor and the food was exceptional. Some nights we only had to eat a light dinner, followed by great desserts.The conceirge staff on the executive floor were professional. She checked on the airline scheduled changes and then called our hotel in Los Angeles to notify them that we would be late. A self service laundry is close by on rue Berri, near the BMW dealership ( which is on the corner). It's only a five minute walk and very safe neighborhood.The Arc is a ten minute walk away and Parc Monceau is two minutes away. The park is great and typical of the French people. The metro is only two blocks away ( Corcelles) and directs with all other lines. Champs d'Elysee is also walking distance.Don't miss the opportunity to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Nice. We stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for three nights in early June. The hotel was nice - and the size of the room was quite large - especially for European standards.The room was clean and well kept during the stay - with turn down service. We had a courtyard view - which was quiet for two nights, but were woken up early one morning by a business meeting.The neighborhood was close to Metro stops - which was convenient. However, on both Saturday and Sunday nights we had to really walk the neighborhood for long times to try to find any sort of restaurant open for business. Quite frustrating.Also, the AC unit wouldn't turn down too low - a bit warm in the room at times.

<Content>Top Hilton! This place is EXCELLENT! Close to everything you come to Paris for... and the staff was phenomenal! c'est tres manifique! I have to rate this property along with the Hilton of the Americas in Houston as being the top Hilton properties I have stayed in (246 nights last year in Hilton family properties) worldwide.When we checked in, the bellmen were more than helpful in getting our baggage out of the car - and the hustle and bustle of Rue de Coucelles is a bit harried - at best. Once inside, the wonderful girl at the counter recognized our Diamond status and personally walked us to the executive lounge on the 6th floor where she turned us over to our personal checkin attendant. now THAT is service!!!!The room is EXTRA large by major city standards, with wonderful appointments. The lounge has a deck and chef prepared tidbits... now this is what ALL Hiltons should be!!This is our new home in Paris!ABSOLUTELY TOP NOTCH!

<Content>Classy Art Deco Paris Hotel This Hilton is new in Paris. Art Deco 1930's hip decor. Clean and updated large rooms. Mini refridge, hairdryer, all standard amenities in the rooms. Staff is over the top. Upgrade to the executive level rooms, usually about $25-35e more. Nice because you have access to this lounge if you arrive at 9am and your room isnt ready, nice breakfast, newspapers and connected to an additional lounge with comfy couches and large flat screen T.V., outdoor deck overlooking quaint buildings. The concierge recommended great dining at Bound- a buddhabar.com restaurant and La Cantina- hip cool awsome food and experience. 20 minute walk to Champs Elessye where Bound Restaurant is and about the same to Arc de Triumph. Beautiful Neighborhood. It is less than $40 e taxi to/from the airport. about 20 minutes in good traffic. My advise is to hire a car from the airport into Paris. The taxi lane on the freeway into Paris is LONG and SLOW... not good after a long flight. Its about $50 e -$60 e one way. Worth every penny. Traffic to the airport on return is generally quick. I will stay here again- It was awsome.

<Content>Great service, lovely room We stayed at the Hilton on HHonors points. It is quite a deal for the number of points required. The room is on the small side, as expected for a European hotel, but that is more than made up for by the bathroom - separate bath and shower, beautiful finishings and oodles and oodles of Crabtree and Evelyn La Source products. The room was spotless, and the linens were all high quality. The hotel staff were all excellent. They were eager to please, were well-groomed, and worked hard. The hotel is a 15 minute walk to the Arc and Champs-Elysee, and a 3 minute walk to a beautiful local park. The neighbourhood is quite quiet, as was the hotel. Just a word of caution if you are traveling on a Sunday. There are few restaurants open in the area and your choice will be to either walk down to the tourist areas or to eat in. To get some idea of what it will cost to eat in, a simple hamburger is 18 Euros at the hotel bar. They did give us free champagne, so that took away the sting somewhat.

<Content>Just a Perfect Hotel We always refer to TripAdvisor when wanting accurate info on a particular hotel. Some of the things that we garnered from TripAdvisor for this hotel was modern, quiet and off the beaten path--but not to far. Everything mentioned above was absolutely true. You can now add that the staff was incredibly friendly, most helpful and everyone went out of their way to make your stay better. So, if you're looking for a spotless hotel, modern, quiet and with the comforts of air conditioning and so on, this is the perfect hotel.

<Content>Great hotel with great service We stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for eleven days, using our Hilton Honors points, and we were extremely satisfied with our stay to the point that I wrote thank you notes to many of the staff and sent a summary writeup to the customer service manager of this hotel. We were fortunate in getting a room upgrade that had a balcony, and access to the executive lounge. As many flights from the U.S. arrive early in the morning, it is important that the hotel expedite room availability upon arrival. The hotel let us check in at the lounge and then expedited our room for us, while we had breakfast in the lounge. A full breakfast is provided each day with a wide variety of food including an excellent machine that makes all forms of coffee ranging from espresso to cappucino's. You could also request a full pot of regular American style coffee. One nice thing about this hotel is that most of the key staff speak English and French and this is very handy, especially for those of us who have never been to France before. The concierge staff were really helpful in providing directions (very necessary in Paris), and restaurant recommendations. We also received help over and above the call of duty when I had my wallet stolen on the Paris Metro. The hotel customer service manager on duty called all of our credit card companies for us gratis, and arranged for an interpreter to accompany us to the local police station to report our loss. This helped to reduce our distress immensely. We also used the restaurant on two occasions and had excellent reasonably priced meals (by Paris standards) both times. Each night we had a different chocolate treat awaiting us, and we were able to use the executive lounge about 75% of our time at the hotel. This enabled us to get by with buying an average of one meal a day in Paris, which helped to minimize the horrendous $-Euro exchange rate. Our room was very nice, and very tastefully decorated, with a nice bathroom with excellent amenities, including luxurious towels. The room had a coffee/tea maker, a minibar, and iron and ironing board. The hotel is situated on the right bank in a business district, with two Metro stations nearby. We were able to get to almost any destination in Paris within 20-30 minutes maximum. If you are a Hilton Honors member there is no better way to maximize your points than staying at this hotel.

<Content>Good, but hey its expensive! I Stayed in the Paris Hilton - sorry Hilton Paris - for one night on a business trip.The room was nice, well appointed and I had an excellent rest in the comfortable bed.One major disappointment: the Mosaic spa was closed - business as usual on Sunday, as it seems. Poor that you cannot access the sauna in a 5* hotel! Finally, none staff I met were French - sometimes it was hard to make you understand in the local language. But hey, the Hilton is an American chain....

<Content>Beautiful view I recently stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe in Paris for a business meeting. The hotel is beautiful, clean and the rooms are spacious, especially for European standards. The views are beautiful, whether the city or the courtyard. The food is ok, but very expensive. Paris is a great city to explore and this hotel is very close to everything. I walked to the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. I would recommend this area becasue is was very accessible to most everything. The staff was very helpful. I asked for a coffee maker in my room and received it immediately.

<Content>Good location and exellent staff My recent stay at Hilton Arc de Triomphe was a really nice experience. We got an upgrade due to my HHonors Diamond status, and the executive lounge was absolutely one of the better we have visited. They served a lot of snacksy food all day, and the staff were friendly and serviceminded. We were very satisfied by the fact that they had turned on airconditioning. Otherwise it would have been dificult to get a good nights sleep. The beds were comfy and tha bathroom nice and clean.The hotel's bell boys and concierge were extremely nice and provided first class service.

<Content>Loved It... Nice hotel, Excellent staff The accommodations were very good and service was excellent. We were staying there with points, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Initially I was just happy we were able to find accommodations in Paris that could accommodate a family of 4. But both the room and the staff far exceeded my expectations. First the service. Coming from the US and arriving in the AM is an extremely draining experience. No matter how well (or not) you can sleep on the plane. But from the moment we got there I was just blown away by how accommodating they were. For one they let us check in at 9:30 AM. They also provided us complimentary drinks and passes to the Louve. But it wasn't just what they did but how they did it. They were just so friendly and helpful with everything. If I didn't know better I'd swear we were at Disney World instead of a hotel in the center of a major city. The manager greets you while your being checked in, introduces himself and requests you contact him if we need anything. The conciere's desk went out of their way to highlight areas of interest. And I'm not talking about the the tower and the arc. They advised us what parts of the town we would enjoy, where we could find historic churches, what days each of the attractions were open etc. Room wise, it was very clean and well kept. All we could askLocation was very good. Not right smack in the center of Paris but about a 12 min walk to the Arc. But the part I liked about it is it was right near one of their scenic parks. Personally I like spending time in those less tourist focused areas. And as a runner it was pretty cool as this particular park was well suited for running laps (about .5 mile) and a number of local runners were there as well.

<Content>This Hilton topped the Ritz My wife and I were in Paris to celebrate her 40th birthday. Because I travel for work and belong to Hilton Honors we did the first half of our stay at the Hilton on points and the second half we splurged and stayed at The Ritz. The Hilton was everything The Ritz should have been. The Hilton staff was excellent - particulary the team in the Hilton Honors lounge and Marie, the Concierge. They were friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The concierge was even able to get us in to Jules Verne when all was booked. The Honors club was the perfect place to start the day with a quick breakfast and suggestions and good for a snack later on after walking the day away.The rooms at the Hilton are nice but on the small side. The shower and bathroom were well appointed.The location of the Hilton is in more of a residential neighborhood. The surroundings are beautiful and its an easy walk to the Arc or a metro station. All in all, the Hilton blew away expectations. It was upbeat, upscale and confident compared to The Ritz which was tired, full of itself and not terribly inviting.

<Content>Nice hotel This was a typical Hilton--nice amenities, clean, upscale, well run--but the service wasn鈥檛 as friendly as I would have expected. Since we are Hilton Honors members we were allowed to sit upstairs in the lounge while our room was still being prepared. We did not get our room until 3:30 in the afternoon. However when you spend the night flying over from the US, it would be nice to have a room sooner. Also, the hotel is not close enough to the Arc or the Champs for me.

<Content>Excellent! I just returned from a wonderful 4 days in Paris, and highly recommend the Hilton Arc de Triomphe. The staff was impeccably polite and helpful; the room was clean and spacious. While this may be a standard business hotel, the location is good, the fact that one may not speak great french is not a problem, and the beautiful Art Deco decor lends a true Parisian flair. Parc Monceau is just a block or so away; the Arc de Thriomphe is an easy 5 minute walk. There are decent places to eat in the immediate neighborhoon and the Courcelles Metro station provides an easy connection to get anywhere. I may be influenced by the fact that three of my days were free via Points--I may not wax so lyrical if I paid $500 per night the whole time. But, this is Paris and the dollar is low, so all in all I still highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very nice hotel, great location This hotel is very classy. The lobby is suited for, at least, 50 people to sit comfortably in comfy chairs or couches. We had to wait 2 1/2 hours for our room after flying in and the staff really tried to help any way they could. The family that was in our room got a late check out and stayed until the last possible minute! The hotel was crowded because of a wedding and our stay was close to New Year's so I wouldn't recommend staying during that time, especially if you have children! The breakfast buffet was near impossible but they will feed you as long as you are in the line, which was nice. The evening dining atmosphere is very elegant. Regardless of what you order, you are treated as if you ordered the special five-course meal! Very professional and knowledgeable staff. We did have room service one night and the presentation was top-notch. The bottom of the cart is filled with boxes that keep the food hot and the table setting was very elegant; for room service, this was presented very well. The only negative thing I can say for the rooms are that the hairdryers, literally, have a 12 in cord! Basically, they are pointless. Pack your own!! There is a pharmacy down the block for things you forgot but it is very expensive. Everything (famous landmarks) is within walking distance, at least, 20 minutes or more. But taxis and the metro are good alternatives. Unless you know French, I wouldn't recommend the charming restaurants on the side streets; stick to the more touristy areas. Just my opinion. Natives on the street and metro hardly ever smile; don't take it personally! I would stay at the Paris Hilton again and I highly recommend it.

<Content>Very quiet courtyard rooms Like just about everybody we stayed here using Hilton Honors points. Whenever we do so we always seem to get upgraded and/or premium rooms. For this stay we requested a quiet room and received one overlooking the courtyard at the very end of the corridor. Despite checking in at 11 AM from an overseas flight we were led right away to our room. That came in handy to take a nap and freshen up.About half the rooms overlook the courtyard and are recommended if you don't want to listen to traffic noise. Due to the room being stuffy (even with the heat off) we slept with the windows open. It was so quiet it was hard to believe we were in Paris.The bed was comfy and the bathroom was gorgeous. The shower was probably the most powerful we have ever used. Normally I crank up the pressure but here I only had to put it half way.The area nearby is pretty quiet, mostly high end residential and offices but within a few blocks we found good restaurants. Also close to the Parc Monceau for a picnic.The hotel decor is designed to mimic the era of transatlantic liners such as the Normandie and is very pretty. Now that Paris is smokefree we even enjoyed a late night drink in the elegant bar. Overall it was a wonderful stay.

<Content>Excellent experience I spent three nights here in an Executive room. The hotel is well run, the staff is friendly and helpful, the executive lounge is superb and spacious, and the rooms are very quiet. And the mattress was terrific.There's a Metro stop about 3 minutes away on foot (Courcelles). The neighborhood is upscale ... not touristy. I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay Just returned from 5 nights at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe and really enjoyed it. The lobby was beautiful, nice area to sit with beautiful chandeliers. The staircase leading to the lower level was very grand as well. Our check in was swift and staff was very helpful and efficient. Front desk and conceirge all spoke english. We were upgraded to a suite that had two bathrooms and a seperate sitting room which was wonderful. Our room overlooked the outdoor courtyard and was very quiet. Our kids had a room that faced out over the street and they didn't complain of any noise either. The executive lounge for Hilton Honors guests was very nice for breakfast, snacks, drinks etc.We also had complimentary breakfast in the restaurant. The rooms were clean, comfortable and had art deco style. Our bathroom had both a shower and a seperate tub. The location was fine for us, not in the heart of the sights but close enough. It was a nice 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. There were several nice place to eat within walking distance. The recommendations the conceirge made for dining were all very good, not touristy nor too expensive. We never had to wait for a taxi in front of the hotel and the doorman always made sure to tell the taxi driver exactly where we were going. Highlights of our trip were the segway tour and my husband and son went to the Normandy D Day tour. We are very glad we chose this hotel.

<Content>Unbelievable!! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in February 2008.Arrival: we took the air france shuttle bus from the airport to the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is about a 5 min walk from there but make sure to get the right directions! I think you must walk down avenue de hoche and then turn right onto rue de courcelles and you will see the hotel in front of you! On arrival the doormen whisked our way bags and were extremely friendly, even complementing my pathetic attempt at speaking french!! Our room was not ready when we arrived as it was early but we went to the bar for 30 mins until it was ready.Room: Very spacious with big comfy bed! Television had good selection of channels sky news etc... Lovely fluffy dressing gown and slippers also. Probably the best part of the room was the view from our large windows; onto the courtyard. We were only on the 2nd floor but it was beautiful!Staff: The staff were abolutely fantastic! They even remembered our name and preffered drinks in the bar! Consieierge quite good although perhaps not as friendly as the rest! Doormen excellent!Facilities: The Purple Bar was lovely. We drank here most evenings and although it is quite expensive the staff make up for it! They are so friendly! Also on the thursday evening of our stay, the bar seemed to be packed full of business people having a great time-really good atmosphere for paris!! We did not use the restaurant or have breakfast there so cannot comment. Also we didnt avail of spa as we did not have time!Location: As mentioned before, the hotel is situated very near the Arc de Triomphe/Champs Elysee! We even walked to the Eiffel Tower one evening (about 20 mins walk). For eveything else we used taxis and the metro. The metro stop of Courcelles is 3 min walk from hotel and very easy to use! Not alot of restaurants in immediate area around hotel but many within walking distance. There is a lovely little cafe across from the hotel for crossants etc...All in all we had a truely amazing time in Paris,and this hotel definitely had alot to do with it! I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone, it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in abroad! Hope this review was helpful!

<Content>Fantastic, Impressive and "tres chic" One of the, if not the best Hilton I have ever stayed in. Fantastic location in heart of town, top class staff, great parking and all the other basic things which make a hotel great. On top of this however is the unique decoration and design of the hotel. No standard rooms, but unique designer rooms all in Egyptian theme. This theme you can find trhoughout the hotel. One of the nicest hotels I have ever been in, thanks to the original concept and beauty of it. Highly recommended!! Much better than the dreadfull other Hilton next to the Eiffeltower btw.

<Content>Great hotel- Great Staff I arrived at this hotel on Feb 15th 2008, and it was WONDERFUL!!! the staff greeted me by name each time I entered and left the property and they were very polite. I'm not sure why some people on here complain about this hotel. I was a little nervous about staying here, but I would definitely recommend it, and would stay here again for sure. lounge was great, room was great, staff was great.Only complaint is that the internet was not free, but that's the way every hotel i've stayed at in Paris so far.

<Content>Great Hotel, Nice Staff The staff was friendly and room was clean and bright. We brought a portable DVD player and were able to hook it up to their TV to watch movies. I got sick during the vacation and the concierge was very helpful in assisting with doctor, pharmacy, etc. The H Honors members got access to the lounge, which had a great breakfast and cocktail hour. It was very close to the Arc de Triomphe and subway stop - we never used a cab.Excellent use of points since the dollar is so low against the Euro.

<Content>Great Stay Was upgraded to a family suite for my family of three with executive lounge access as a Hilton Gold HHonors member. It was indicated Gold/Diamond get access to the lounge, it's moments like this that keep me coming back to this hotel and the Hilton brand. The staff was great through out the our long weekend in Paris. It is a little walk to the Metro, front desk was nice enough to loan us umbrellas for the walk on a day when it was raining. Though some reviewers have different opinion, I felt the staff and management prided themselves on running a friendly and professional hotel. The concierge in the executive lounge was fantastic with assisting with reservations for dinner and we specifically wrote a note to the manager on her help. We are heading back this weekend for three nights and are very much looking forward to it.

<Content>Excellent After a week in London and two days in Brugge we stayed two nights at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe Paris. We accumalate a lot of Hilton points on business travel but usually prefer smaller, independent hotels when on vacation. But since we are Diamond Hiltonhhonors we booked the hotel using points.We were greeted at the taxi by name! For check in we were taken to the 7th floor executive lounge. The lounge is very comfortable with newspapers and TV. There is food from 7AM until 11PM. Breakfast till 1030, then snacks and sandwiches. Also a self service bar in the evening. We were only able to partake in the breakfast and late night drinks as we were on the go all day...it almost made us want to stop by the hotel several times during the day.The concierge was helpful in printing up our boarding pass for our flight home.The room was very nice. Large by European standards. Bath had an oversize tub and a separate stall shower. Nice quiet neigborhood near Parc de Monceau about 10 minute walk to the Arc De Triomphe.We would definitley stay there again and can't recommend it enough.

<Content>Dreadful service, poor experience Dreadful service, poor experienceThe hotel is located about 20 minutes walking distance from Arc de Triomphe. We stayed in Paris for 8 days on our route to Italy and Monaco. We specifically picked Hilton in order to utilize our Hilton HHONORS points and get treated as a HHonor preferred member. Up until this trip, we have been going out of our way to stay in Hilton and Hilton affiliated hotels worldwide and enjoying Hilton鈥檚 hospitality and service. Hilton needs to seriously consider having their name associated with this particular hotel and audit the current management structure. Hilton Arc de Triomphe provides no value for the money with zero customer service. Please my travel notes below:Hilton Act1 鈥?The EntranceAs we arrived in the morning, we were faced by a busy lobby and number of people waiting to to get checked-in at front desk. Most Hiltons have a line dedicated to HHONORS members, but there was nobody attending the HHONORS desk at the time. After 15 minutes waiting in the line, we were checked in and ushered to our room. As we entered our room, we noticed the room was not cleaned and the bed was still unmade with dirty towels all over the room. Oh great! After being so tired flying from San Francisco to Paris and now I had to deal with this鈥?br/>I proceed downstairs with my little toddler on my side raising concerns with the assistant manager standing behind the HHONORS desk. He made an excuse that 鈥渋t cannot be鈥?and without apologizing said: 鈥渁re you sure鈥? I showed him a picture that I just took on my digital camera!!! We were assigned a new room.Hilton Act2 鈥?The change of sceneryOur second room was located in section C, exterior. As we entered our room and pushed the window drapes aside, we were unpleasantly surprised by the view of our room that we were going to enjoy for 8 days!!! The windows faced the back of the hotel with full view of garbage, broken wood pieces and a dirt road with flooded ground due to the recent rain. Right under our room, we noticed tour buses honking and waiting to load passengers creating unbearable noises. You don鈥檛 believe me; take a look at the pictures attached. If you are staying in this hotel, DO NOT stay in section C facing the back of the hotel!!! Insist on a room facing the interior. Section A exterior is also dreadful as it faces a busy street.Hilton Act3 鈥?I give up!!!It has been almost 2 hours since we initially entered the hotel. Being extremely frustrated, I went to the lobby again to complain about the room yet again. The assistant manager explained that interior rooms on the high floor have been reserved for the 鈥渆xecutives鈥?staying at the hotel. After insisting a new room, we were assigned a new room on section A facing the interior. That is the room we stayed throughout our stayed at Hilton.Food:As one of the high lights of the hotel, I must give credit to the hotel on their breakfast buffet. They have a great selection of American and European. If you are staying at the hotel, don鈥檛 miss the breakfast buffet.SPA Services:The hotel went out of their way to advertize their SPA and SPA services. We did not use any of the services, but noticed the SPA was located in the hotels basement. As I briefly visited the SPA area, the atmosphere seems stuffy and basement like.CleanlinessThe hotel and rooms are mostly clean and in a good shape. Two major issues are the unpleasant smell of perfume throughout hallways and foul odor coming out of the hotel鈥檚 plumbing and sewer. The hallways have a strange smell of mold masked with the smell of perfume. As we changed so many rooms, we walked around the hotel and visited at least four floors. All floors had this moldy and weird smell. The smell was especially strong during the morning time as I am sure they applied fresh batch of perfumes. The smell coming from hotels plumping was extremely unbearable. Imagine as you are brushing your teeth, you are faced with an unpleasant aroma of the sewer system! I had to empty a bottle of shampoo in the sink to mask the smell while brushing my teeth on a daily basis.Hotel conciergeWe used the hotel concierge to book a tour of Eifel tower with dinner and sine river tour. If you use the concierge, the price will be considerably more. Book directly with the tour operator instead or better yet, just directly go and purchase the tickets.

<Content>Great Hotel! First time in Paris, only there for 2 nights and 3 days. I was looking for a nice place to stay that was convenient. I decided to use Hilton HHonors Points and book a reward stay and I was not dissapointed at all with this hotel. First, as far as getting to the hotel from CDG airport, the best thing to do is to take the Air France bus for 20euros round trip and take it to the Arc de Triomphe stop. From there it's about a 15 minute walk at most to the hotel. Very safe. As far as proximity to other things, it's about a 10 minute walk to the Champs Elysees, which wasn't bad at all. Grand and welcoming lobby. The hotel is very nicely decorated in a art deco style. The statt at the hotel was very friendly and eager to help (also spoke good English!). I checked it at 8am in the morning and was able to get my hotel room immediately.The room was very comfortable, nice size for Europe standards.Shower and tub in the bathroom in all nicely done in marble. Large towels. The bed and furniture were in good condition. Satelite t.v. with several stations in English. All and all, a very pleasant room.I'm not sure if it was because I was a Diamond Hilton HHonors member, but on the first night I received a nice note from the General Manager and a box of chocolates. On the second night I received a very nice bottle of wine again with a note from the manager thanking me for my stay and wishing me a happy new year. Wow, was I surprised.I was able to get the buffet breakfast included and was very surprised with how good the food was. A lot of choices, made to order eggs. Again, very nice spread for Europe standards.Again, can't say enough great things about this hotel. I would gladly stay hear again when I return to Paris!

<Content>The perfect place to stay My husband and I started our Honeymoon staying at the Hilton (stayed there 4 nights.) Because we were Hilton honors members they were able to upgrade our room to a suite with access to the Executive lounge -champagne and treats all day.The staff was WONDERFUL. The reception desk (especially Jean-Micheal) was so friendly and helpful and the staff spoke english (which was great because my french was pretty rusty.)Alain at the concierge desk was extremely helpful in helping us organize a weekend trip to Nice (he found a hotel and booked us train tickets at reasonable rates)The hotel rooms were very clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable with multiple feather pillows.The staff surprised us with champagne and dessert to our room for our Honeymoon on our first night there -it was extra special.The Purple Bar located within the hotel was comfortable and welcoming.In terms of location, there are not a lot of bakerys and cafes nearby but the hotel is within walking distance to the Arc De Triumph/Champs Elysee -maybe 15min? -which in the November cold, may seem longer but still possible.The metro was close by.The hotel itself is expensive but the hotel rooms and hospitality fit the price well.My husband and I would definitely return to Hilton Arc de Triomph.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!!! My fiance and I were in Europe for a conference and decided to stay in Paris for a week of vacation following the conference. We had accumulated Hilton honors points and the hilton representative recommended we use our points here. SHE WAS RIGHT!!!! I wish I could thank her!The Hilton Arc de Triomphe is fabulous. I came in early, 7 am. Check in was not until later in the afternoon. They immediately took my bags and let me into their lounge which had a full breakfast buffet, magazines, and television. They told me to make myself comfortable and gave me a key card for a restroom down the hall should I need it. I was given my room in two hours. They were extraordinarily nice. The room was impeccably clean. We stayed for 7 days. They gave us access to the lounge, which included free breakfast, snacks and cocktails. We also had access to the gym. The spa was also included, it has a really great jacuzzi tub. The room was cleaned several times a day. The bathtub was sparkling! We got bathrobes and slippers to use while in the hotel. All of these amenities are included in the price. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The hotel is located in a very clean and safe area. Not to mention, very quiet. It is also very close to the metro and several shops and restaurants are within a 10 minute walk. The attention to detail and customer service at this hotel is SO WORTH IT!!!!!For a romantic parisian getaway... this is the place to be!

<Content>Great hotel I booked this hotel using points and was so glad that I did! The metro is close by and is so easy to use. While yes, it is in a more business area of town, if you walk a few blocks there are bakeries, a grocery store, etc. Everything that one might need to have a gourmet picnic in your room if you need to save a few bucks because you ate a $150 dinner the night before (which is typical in Paris!!). Everyone was very polite and friendly and extremely helpful. Also, I am an amenities gal and they had robes, slippers, and turndown service every night. Now, would I have personally spent over $500+ for this hotel? Probably not, but if I was traveling on business or if I had points to use then I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Hotel with Wonderful Staff I really enjoyed the associates at this property. I would especially like to commend Carlo at Reception and the exceedingly amusing young male Irish bartender. My son and I had an outstanding time and will continue to stay at the International Hiltons. This property did not disappoint. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe and you can walk straight down from the Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre. It is also close to the Courcelles Metro station and you can get anywhere from there. Treats by our bedside, very clean rooms and rooms much larger then a typical Parisien hotel.

<Content>Top Notch! Well, maybe not the 4 Seasons, but if you don't want to spend $700-1k per night, this hotel is great.My wife and I just got back from the second leg of our honeymoon in Paris. Our first leg was in Florence, and you can read my review of the Hotel Porta Faenza there.I'll start by saying that I used Hilton HHonors points for a free 6-night stay at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe. I am HHonors Gold and was upgraded to an executive room on arrival. The room was large for european rooms and was very comfortable. The bed was fantastic. The bathroom had a tub and shower stall, and marble floors. The Hilton provided 2 bottles of water daily, slippers, and bathrobes.Upon arrival, there was a box of chocolates waiting for us in the room. One word of caution - if you get them, eat them. We left half the box on the table and it was removed by housekeeping when they cleaned. I didn't bother complaining about this (though we would have liked more). Anyway, the second night when we arrived back, we found a second welcome gift awaiting us. The hotel had a plate of desserts/snacks and a half-bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us.The best part of this hotel was the executive lounge. You need to have a room on the executive floor, or an exec room to get access. The lounge is open from 7:30am - 11pm, and serves food and drink all day long (all for free). There is an ample breakfast served from 7:30-10:30am. There is a coffee machine that brews cafe, espresso, cappucino all-day long. The coffee was great (even though it was machine-brewed).The lounge served free snacks all day long, including cheeses, some sort of beef stew, cookies, candy. There was free wine, champagne, liquor, bottled water, coke, etc. all day. One night we were too stuffed to go out and eat dinner. We ended several evenings with a few glasses of wine and chocolates in the lounge.The hotel is also in a good area. A very nice residential neighborhood. Not too far of a walk from the Arc or the Champes Ellysees. I debated between this hotel and the Hilton Paris by the Eiffel. We walked by the other and agreed this one is in a much nicer area in the city. We walked to the Eiffel twice...Not too far, but not too close. Unfortunately, the transit workers were on strike and so metro service was sporadic or packed while we were there. Also, they are renovating the metro stop closest to the Eiffel until next March, so walking is a nicer option.If you find yourself in Paris, there are plenty of nice hotels as I hear. I loved the service at the hilton arc. The staff was friendly, the location was nice. The hotel decor was great, and the hotel was newer and clean. The exec lounge helped a lot too. I think you can book an executive room, and the extra costs may be worthwhile if you consider the free breakfast, snacks, and booze.

<Content>Not worth the money This hotel is not a good choice for anyone who is visiting Paris as a tourist. Considering the price, the guest rooms are incredibly noisy and the beds are not overly comfortable. The location is also somewhat inconvenient as a base for sightseeing and the immediate neighborhood is devoid of shops and restaurants. If you aren't strictly a jaded business traveler, this hotel is a waste of perfectly good money. There are too many other non-corporate, less expensive, more comfortable hotels to choose from in Paris.

<Content>Service means little here I stayed for 3 nights in November 2007 and although I'm normally happy with my expereince at Hilton Hotels this was an exception. First the non-smoking room they checked me in to was filled with cigar fumes. They moved me reasonably quickly but why doesn't housekeeping report the problem before a guest does? Next I ordered lunch from room service. It was promised in 25 minutes but took 45. The room temperature was way too hot and the air con controls in the room did not respond. Also the hair-dryer didn't work. I reported these problems to the front desk by telephone two times across a 24 hour period but the problems were not fixed. The third time I complained (after a sleepless, overheated night) I visited the front desk in person. This time the hairdryer was fixed but the room temperature was not and at no time was any apology forthcoming. It just felt like no one took any responsibility for my comfort. I might have sought out one of the managers if that had been easy to do but I noticed that the 'duty manager' desk remained unstaffed throughout my stay.On checking out there was a line of at least 20 guests in front of me and this took 20 minutes to clear. Breakfast on my invoice was described unhelpfully as dinner, there was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and my pre-booked newspaper didn't arrive on the thrid day of my stay. And all this for over 300 Euro a night for a standard room.Yes the hotel is in a nice area and yes it looks good. But the concept of service is not in evidence at this property and I plan to avoid it in future.

<Content>Good hotel if you are deaf Recently restored hotel. Very nice decorated room, bed is comfortable and bathroom is convenient. The major problem of this hotel is the thin wall between each room. My husband and I heard all the conversation of our neighbor...Also do ask for a room facing the interior yard... since traffic is terrible in Paris. Also, do not trust the Concierge when booking an early taxi for the airport... Even with 1 day advance booking, our 'booked taxi' (a taxi booked through hotel in the early morning for the airport is usually a friend of one of the concierge staff...) never arrived. After 15 min, we took another one.

<Content>Elegance My husband and I visited Paris during the Rugby World Cup. As H Honours Gold Card Members we were upgraded to the Executive lounge. I have nothing but praise for the quality of service and the quality of the food. The free-flowing champagne was also very welcome. Our suite, though small was well appointed and quite luxurious. We travel the world, especially the Middle and Far east. This was better than some of the more expensive hotels in Dubai.We loved the Art Deco theme. We will definately be going back!

<Content>Great Hotel My wife  I stayed at the Hilton Paris Arc De Triomphe for 7 nights from Wed May 23 鈥?Wed May 30, 2007. The lobby and a joining courtyard are quite impressive. The bellmen, concierge, and front desk staff were cordial. After checking in the quest services manager greeted us as well. Most high-rise buildings in Paris are limited to the La Defense business area. The Hilton Paris Arc De Triomphe is not in that area and as such is only 7 stories tall. Executive suits are on floors 6  7, we were given a room on the 5th floor with a view of the lovely courtyard. The room was modern and impressive. The concierge and other staff spoke English. There was only a mini-bar in the room, and they did not have spare refrigerators, so I had them clear it so that we could use it as a refrigerator. They did so without complaint.The area around the hotel is upscale. There are many embassies nearby. There are several brasserie in walking distance. The Arc de Triumphe actually is not that close 鈥?about a 15 鈥?20 minute walk. No convenience stores close, however. There is subway transportation at about a 15 minute walk, though we used the taxis that were readily available out front. We had drinks at the lobby bar after returning from seeing the Eiffel Tower one evening. The service and drinks were great.All-in-all the hotel definitely deserves its 4 star rating if not more. I would definitely stay there again if visiting Paris in the future.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel This hotel was more than what we expected. Terrific staff, very nice, clean, and spacious room! The Executive Lounge was excellent----wide variety of food----all day long! Everyone wanted to bend over backwards for us. Concierge provided friendly, helpful tips and accurate directions. Nightly turn down service included sumptuous chocolates and other delicacies. The hotel stay definitely made our family vacation even more memorable!

<Content>Very Good Hotel All in all, very good experience. Hotel is relatively close to all attraction. Metro is a walking distance away. Excellent breakfast. Nice bar in the evening. Rooms are relatively spacious. NO POOL.. that was not appreciated by my kids!! Service was very good. Friendly staff. Would certainly consider staying there next time we go to Paris.

<Content>Poor customer service... Below is an abstract of the complaint I have sent to the management of this hotel. I think it explains everything. However if you don't have these problems the hotel is beautiful and well located.I would like to bring to your attention my highly unsatisfactory stay at your hotel earlier this week. Checking into the Hilton Arc de Triomphe on July XXX at around 12h15 in the afternoon I was promptly checked-in to room XXX. Spending only a few minutes in the room to drop off my luggage I found the room satisfactory and left at once for my office located down the street on Rue Monceau. Arriving back at the hotel around 20h00 in the evening to quickly change for a business dinner I noticed an odd smell in the hotel room. Approaching the window I realized that the entire carpet and wall below the window sill were soaked with water carrying the distinct grey hue of mold. Obviously there had a been a problem for quite sometime. Having little time before my next engagement I stopped by the reception on way out to inform them of the problem. The staff were perfectly pleasant apologizing for the inconvenience and promising to send someone up to see what could be done to fix the problem and, if no problem could be found, to change my hotel room. Had this occurred I would not be writing to you at this time as I would have been perfectly satisfied with how the situation was handled. Hotels make mistakes and should surely be given the chance to rectify them.Unfortunately when returning to my room at 23h15 in the evening I found that not only had nothing been done but that the stench by this time was intolerable. It would have been impossible to sleep in this room. Calling the reception not one person on duty was aware of my earlier complaint. However after verifying the room number they were not surprised by the problem as I was informed that my room was 'closed' and was not to be assigned due to the leak. At this point they promised to send some up to look at the situation immediately. After waiting, in the hall (because of the odor), for 25 minutes, I was forced to call the reception a second time. It was only then that they sent someone to help me transfer to a comparable room on the same floor. The whole ordeal of transferring rooms meant that instead of going to bed at 23h15 I was not able to get to bed until well after midnight. Having woken up at 4h30 in the morning to catch a red eye flight to Paris and working for twelve hours straight this was certainly a less than ideal way to end my evening.The next morning when checking out no mention to the prior evening's events were made until I brought up the issue. At this point I was clumsily offered a discount on the my room. In all honesty this represents little compensation for me, spending over 100 days a year in hotel rooms neither me nor my employer could care less about saving a few euros on a hotel room. Spending over a third of my time in hotels for work I value a customer service and more importantly a good night's sleep. This is much more important to me than the actual cost of a hotel room and I would venture to say that this is the case for many of the business travelers you wish to attract.''

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay As mentioned in other reviews; it is the staff that makes staying here so memorable. From chambermaids to Executive Floor Manager, all are most pleasant and eager to please. The only problem noted was the somewhat outdated television programing that the hotel subscribes to. But you don't come to Paris to watch TV...do you?

<Content>Lovely hotel! I stayed at this hotel last week with my husband and 2 teens. We booked two rooms with Hilton Honor's points. It was a good decision considering the price of this hotel. I was a little concerned about the location after reading the reviews here, but they were unfounded! It was a wonderful location and super close to a metro station ( 3 minute walk to Glacier). There is another stop near the Arc de Triomphe which is not more than a 10 minute walk. Yes, you can see the Arc. It is in a lovely residential, embassy area but very close to Champs Elysees. We did not have breakfast included and found a very nice bakery down the street. We even bought sandwiches one day for a picnic at Versailles! The hotel seems to be newly refurbished in a very nice art deco style. The lobby is very nice and upscale. The rooms are large with nice marble bathrooms. The bath towels were large and luxurious! The beds were very comfortable and there were good black out curtains. My husband and I had a King room and my kids had a double double. The only negative was that their room had a terrible odor of smoke and it was a non smoking floor. I guess that this could happen anywhere. They offered to change their room but the kids did not want to move. The concierges were very helpful and helped us map out our days and nights. They book us a taxi for our early Monday morning flight and it was waiting for us. It was about $50 to the airport. Hope this helps!

<Content>Great stay My husband  I stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for 4 nights in July. I used 125k Hilton points for the stay and have to say we were very pleased with the hotel. We were upgraded to the Executive floor (I am a Diamond member). The rooms are comfortable but not overly large. We received complementary waters every day. The Executive Lounge had a great breakfast but was marginal the rest of the time.The location of the hotel is a bit away from most sights but if you are willing to use the Metro, the location is great. There is a metro station very close by  the arc de triomphe is less than a 10 minute walk away.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to use Hilton points for the stay or if you prefer American chain hotels. If I were paying for it I would stay elsewhere...there are plenty of cute cheaper hotels in Paris.

<Content>Great Hotel We went to the Hilton Arc de Triumph in April 2007 and thought what a lovely place it was. All the staff were very friendly and polite and very helpful as well. Our room was lovely, we were on the 3rd floor facing towards the garden, and you can open your big double window and have a lovely view. We had breakfast in our room twice and they bring it on a big trolley and put it on your table for you. We always made sure that our windows were open and the table facing out towards the view as we ate our breakfast, it starts your day off beautifully. We had dinner there for one evening and ate outside as the weather was great in April,the food and the service was very good indeed.The Arc de Triumph was only 7 or 8 minutes away which is not far at all. We will be staying there again when we go next time(hopefully this year again!)

<Content>Simply amazing! The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Somewhat of an Asian theme in the rooms we had and the lobby. I had 1 king room and a family room. The family room is two rooms that share a secured entry hallway.Rooms were very spacious. We had been expecting tiny cramped hotels in Europe after speaking with friends and family that had traveled before.The entire hotel appeared quite new. Everything was clean and seemingly only a few months old at best.We spent 5 days here and absolutely loved this hotel. We got 3 night through Hotwire for $216 a night and 2 nights with Hilton points.

<Content>Paris Hilton - great value Great value for the Hilton HHonors points. Spent 2 nights here in complete comfort. Front desk was very helpful  courteous. Ditto the bar staff and room service. Walking distance from Champs Elysees. Also easy to get to CDG airport from here. Do NOT confuse this Hilton with the one near Eiffel Tower, which by most accounts is not what it used to be...

<Content>Tip Top This is a fantastic hotel located approximately 10 minutes from the Arc de Triomphe (walking) and ave. Champs-Elysees. If you are booking a rewards stay through Hilton you may be looking for an economical way to get to the hotel (as was I). Thus, you can take the Air France bus, line 2, from CDG to the Arc de Triomphe stop for about 13 Euro per person (as long as you have quality rolling luggage to make the 10 minute treck from the bus-stop). The ride takes about 1/2 hour. There is a cafe (Le Cristal) located one block from the bus-stop (corner of rue de Tilsitt and ave Grande Armee) that has the best coffee and Croque Madame that I have found in Paris. Arriving by plane in the morning and hitting Le Cristal is a ritual that I would not give up.The lobby and dining facilities at the hotel were appropriately upscale and, despite being a large corporate hotel geared to business travelers, quite romantic. The staff were extremely nice and knowledgeable. Evelyne, a front desk clerk, possesses an outstanding knowledge of the city.I was provided with a Deluxe King room which was, by Paris standards, huge. Although coffee/tea facilities were not provided, the room was otherwise perfect: comfortable bed, quality furnishings, bathrobes and slippers. The view from the window was nothing spectacular, but not shabby either (A view of an upscale street in Paris is pretty nice).When the drain in my bathtub did not work, a technician was sent up to fix it immediately, at 11:30 pm. He had sufficient class not to mention that I had closed the drain by mistake and that there was actually nothing wrong with it (well, that is what I figure since it took him all of 2 seconds to fix it and I believe he hung out there another 10 or 20 seconds so it would not be so obvious to my date that I was a fool...maybe he was just making sure the water drained).I have stayed in numerous other hotels in Paris (some of which were highly rated). This hotel was the absolute best.Note about the food/beverage prices at the hotel: they are steep...very steep. While the prices are comparable to other hotels of this level, you may want to venture out for meals (it is Paris, anyway, so there really is no excuse to eat in the hotel).

<Content>A favorite hotel We love this Hilton. It is very clean and modern. We had access to the Executive lounge. It is fabulous!! The staff are very nice. The food and beverages are non-stop all day long. We loved it!! The breakfast had great smoked salmon, pastries, etc..It is very close to the metro, approx. a two minute walk. It is a good 10-15 minute walk from main shopping streets. However, with the metro so close it doesn't matter. This hotel is well worth the extra 2 minutes on the metro.If you are able to stay in a room with a terrace, the view of the Eiffel tower is priceless. Go get some wine and cheese and sit and watch the tower at night.

<Content>Our new favorite hotel in Paris! Even though I booked this hotel with my Hilton Honors points, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Executive floor. (I'm HH Diamond). We had access to the Exec Lounge and free access to the whirlpool at the Spa. Completely relaxing! This was our fourth visit to Paris in the last 4 years, and this was by far, our best stay. We've stayed at the Westin and at the Le Grand Intercontinental for comparison's sake. The service here was the best - everyone was so friendly and helpful - no attitude at all!The hotel was in fairly good condition. Our room was nice - only issue was some staining on the carpets. Our room overlooked the rue de Courcelles, and I didn't find it too noisy at all. In our bathroom, we had a separate shower and tub. No mold in the bathroom.The room was pretty big - probably because it was on the exec floor. It's about a 3 minute walk to the Courcelles Metro stop. The immediate neighborhood around the hotel is comprised of businesses/residences, so it didn't feel too busy or touristy. We took the Air France bus from CDG to the Arc de Triomphe stop - it was about a 10-15 minute walk to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again, even without using honors points!

<Content>Poor experience - very noisy We stayed at the HAdT during the last week of May 2007 for 5 nights on Floor 1 facing the inner courtyard. We were on vacation on our first visit to Paris.Our primary concern was the amount of noise emanating from the courtyard between 00:00 and 06:00 each night. Hotel workers were cleaning and moving the courtyard furniture around, making an awful amount of noise. Imagine heavy tables and chairs being pulled across a stone pavement (screeeeech...). We confirmed the noises with other members of our traveling party in other rooms. We placed calls to the front desk and asked for a new room which was not available due to the hotel being sold out. Their reply was that they would send security to check on the noises. There was not any follow-up by the hotel staff.The HAdT is a business hotel and it is located in a business section of Paris. I would strongly recommend vacation travelers to look elsewhere. The nearest metro is Courcelles (#2 Port Dauphine / Nation Line) which is a 5 minute walk away on Rue de Courcelles at the intersection of Boulevard de Courcelles. The Charles de Gaulle Etoille metro station is two stops away on the #2 Line. There is a cash/money machine and a pharmacy located nearby on Rue de Courcelles (walk towards Avenue Hoche).The breakfast buffet has a wide selection of pastries, fruits, meats, and juices. On Mondays to Fridays it is very busy as business travelers start their workday. Complimentary newspapers are available near the elevators. The elevators are slow to appear during busy times. We primarily used the stairwell since we were on a lower floor.The concierge seemed very friendly and helpful. They printed out copies of train schedules and gave us directions.Housekeeping was inconsistent as our room was not cleaned everyday. The evening turndown service was also inconsistent. This wasn't a big deal to us but it seemed unusual.Overall, we would not stay at this hotel again. If you are a tourist on vacation, find a hotel closer to the action.

<Content>A delight: Great service and So Comfortable This hotel is a delight! The room was ultra comfortable, the breakfast buffett excellent, and the service excellent. The location is slightly off the beaten track - so if you want to be in the heart of the action in Paris this may not be your choice but we thought accessing the subway from the hotel was not bad - but be prepared for a little bit of a walk. What stands out at this hotel is the service. The concierage service was top-notch and they booked hotels for us in Caen and Mont-Saint-Michel on a Normandie road trip we took which saved us a lot of hassle. The hotel has a nice business center which was also useful. The breakfast buffett was also out of this world.We stayed at this hotel using Hilton points. If you have the points to stay here - go for it. You won't regret it.

<Content>Very nice hotel with a touch of snootiness. I stayed here for a few days during the first week of May (I also stayed at the Hilton Eiffel Tower as well if you want a comparison). The hotel is very nice and the staff were exceptional. I was hoping for a room upgrade, being a Gold member, but there were no upgrades to be had for all 5 days I was there. They did compensate me with free breakfast coupons for their breakfast buffet. That turns out to be quite a deal as they charge 30 Euros for breakfast! I don't know who pays that kind of money for breakfast, but it was always packed. The rooms are small, as expected in Europe, but very neat and mostly clean. There was some normal wear and tear, but in the bathroom there was a good bit of mold in the shower and ceiling. Otherwise, the bathroom was nice with a seperate tub and shower. The only other complaint I had is the airconditioning was turned off. I still find it hard to believe that a hotel like this would still decide when their customers would like airconditioning. It was still a bit cool in May, but being in a small room with stagnant air can become very uncomfortable and warm. Opening a window was just ok, but the noise level outside made it impractical for me. The hotel is very popular with business people and upscale travelers, so I didn't exactly fit in around there. The patrons seemed to have a bit of snob appeal but the staff were very pleasant. The location is a bit out of the way except for the Arc de Triomphe. Making use of the excellent subway system in Paris is recommended and effortless, otherwise you will be spending a good bit of money to get to the rest of Paris from this location.I would stay here again if the price were right, otherwise you will find me at Hilton's Eiffel Tower location.

<Content>New Year in Paris We stayed at this hotel over New Year with friends having booked a flight and hotel package through Opodo.The name of the hotel can be a bit misleading as it is a good 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe, but wasn't a major problem.The concierge was excellent, having booked and changed a dinner reservation for us at the Altitude 95 via e-mail prior to our arrival. He also left a note in our room confirming the reservation.The interior of the hotel is quite impressive, especially the reception area and grand hall downstairs. The service was good as one would expect from the Hilton group, but drinks were a little expensive as seems to be the case in most hotels of this standard in Paris.Rooms were small, but well laid out and equipped.A special thanks to the front desk who allowed us a late checkout without charge at short notice.While we will go to Paris again and would consider this hotel, we ceratinly wouldn't travel for New Year.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Lovely Staff.... My husband and I stayed at Hilton Arc de Triomphe for a long weekend in April 2007. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the rooms modern and comfortable. I loved the Art Deco styling. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful from Reception to Waiters to Bar Staff. They really couldn't do enough for you and they all spoke excellent English.We ate in the restaurant on one night and it was quite expensive but in line with the rest of Paris. The food was well prepared and tasty.Although the hotel is not bang in the centre of Paris it was an easy walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the Metro system (which is a very efficient service). When the weather is beautiful, as it was when we were there, it would have been a crime not to walk around and see the wonderful architecture of such a lovely city however taxis from outside the hotel are always available if you prefer to take the weight off your feet!

<Content>Good Business Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during Jan 2007. The hotel is of a high standard as you would expect for a Hilton in a major city - but it has the price tag goes with this (it is pricey, even for Paris). The hotel is not especially close to any major tourist spots (the ADT would be a 10 minute walk), but I find that this is not a problem in a city like Paris where it can be too crowded if the hotel is right by a tourist attraction. There is a metro station very close by. The rooms are interesting and clean - the property is well maintained. The entrance lobby seemed to be filled with smokers every time we went through, but that is Paris. The prices of food/drinks in the hotel are totally over the top - even for Paris. Overall, this is a good (but for the price, not great) hotel. There is nothing wrong with it, but it does not go the extra mile. I would recommend it and would stay again.

<Content>Wonderful honeymoon experience My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon, and the stay definitely contributed to our fond memories of our week in Paris. As HHonors silver members, we just stayed in a regular room with king bed on the 5th floor, but the accomodations were surprisingly large by European standards and everything was very clean. We requested an interior room overlooking the courtyard, and it was very quiet. The bed was a little hard by our standards, but we were so tired from sightseeing that we fell right asleep. We really enjoyed the location of the hotel, as it was close to a Metro stop (Courcelles), several restaurants, and a nice park (Parc Monceau). If you head down a block, you can see the Arc de Triomphe down at the end of the street, but it's mostly foreign embassies and other housing around the hotel, which kept things quiet. The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but the stand-up shower was awesome (excellent temperature and pressure).The staff made us felt welcome from the moment they opened the door for us, with excellent English spoken, and the concierge that we worked with a lot, Gregory, was extremely accomodating and was even able to mail a package to a relative for me. Upon arrival a beautiful rose bouquet was delivered to our room with a note from the customer relations woman, and later in the day a half-bottle of champagne and strawberries with creme fraiche and pistachios were also sent up.The room service menu is great, and the prices reflect it too. On our last night we ordered the beef tenderloin and had a gourmet meal in our fluffy bathrobes finished off with some delicious creme brulee. We also ate at the hotel restaurant, Le Safran, and the staff was very courteous and even put up with my attempts to order with whatever French I remembered from college. The breakfast items aren't great considering the price, and each morning when we headed to the Metro stop we stopped by a little boulangerie (Mi-do-re) close by and picked up fresh croissants and eclairs to get the day started.Though it was definitely expensive, the hotel was a nice place to come back to at the end of a long day. It made a special time even more memorable staying here and we'll definitely return in the near future.

<Content>A Nice Find My Wife and I were spending our last two nights in Paris after traveling France, and because we had HiltonHonors Points Hilton recommended this hotel to us. I'm glad they did. It's beautiful. The area is a bit off the beaten track but a nice walk through the sidestreets of Paris take you where you want to go. The decors Art Deco and fun, the lobby large and the airy courtyard gives all the rooms great light. The service was friendly and helpful and I'd love to get back and spend more time here. If you're thinking about it ... do it.

<Content>Great hotel, takes care of their honors members If you have Hilton points and want to redeem them, this is the hotel. We were upgraded to the executive floor and their VIP lounge was second to none. Full breakfasts, snacks throughout the day, and an open bar (think high quality Champagne and top shelf spirits not box wine and well drinks). Made for a great start to the day or warm up before heading out on long walks through Paris. There were some hiccups in the service, but nothing major. Great hotel.

<Content>Business hotel in the middle of nowhere I麓ve stayed in this hotel twice - in June 2006 and now, in January for business matter and it is definately not for tourists. It is a large business hotel with lot of people and always very crowded. But the rooms have nice art deco feeling and are really big (what is rare in Paris) and the staff in concierge and reception desk is friendly and nice. The service at the breakfast was horrible - slow and unpolite. Breakfast itself was quite generous with lots of juices, hot and cold dishes, fish, cheese, pancakes - you name it! I also liked the Purple bar which is also popular among locals.Bathroom was very small and has CrabtreeEvelyn amenities.When I first time stayed in Hilton Arc de Triomphe, I also had some problems with the room service - they did麓nt clean the room and they forgot turndown service.Overall - if You don麓t mind to move around by taxi (it costs 7-8 euros to Louvre area for example and 47 euros to airport) and You don麓t mind, that the hotel is overcrowded and noisy, then go for it! But if You prefer more personal touch and intimate feeling and historical atmosphere and to be close to the lively city center, then it is definately not for You.

<Content>Loved the hotel and service My husband and I stayed here January 13-16 on an award stay and as Hilton diamonds, we were upgraded to the executive floor. This is a lovely hotel, only 4 years old, decorated in the 1920's art deco style. While some of my review reflects the executive floor service, I found all staff very pleasant and service oriented, and happy to see and talk to us. Our room was on the seventh floor and while compact was very nicely appointed. The breakfast, snacks and champagne served in the executive lounge were great and the service was very personalized. We also used the hamam steam room in the spa and the whirlpool/spa in the basement--very nice. We told them when we reserved we were celebrating our anniversary and received a bottle of champagne and cake in our room the first night. The executive floor staff noted our anniversary and as we checked out, they called for glasses of champagne (delicious Nicholas Feuillatte champagne by the way) to send us off. January was also a good time for Paris as it was a slow time, good airfares, and Xmas decorations still up. We were walking distance to Taillevent, a three star Michelin restaurant where we had a fantastic lunch.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Super, minor irritations A little way away from the Arc de Triomphe, in a rather nice residential (apartments) street.The doorman opened the door to our taxi, was very pleasant and helpful giving a good impression before we had even stepped into the hotel.Reception was polite and efficient. The main public areas are spacious, comfortable and clean. I was allocated room 307.I did ask for an iron and ironing board to be delivered, it was not so I had to ask again in the morning, when it did arrive. Maybe a minor point, but the iron was low quality, and the ironing board even more so, difficult to use.The room was decorated in neutral colours, gold carpet, neutral walls, a very comfortable bed (there were 2 queen sized beds)An important point in hotels is noise, and I can say that it was very minimal, you do not hear doors banging, the street noise is very low indeed, so a good nights rest is assured.The bathroom is good, clean, lots of hot water. A minor frustration is the mix tap from bath to shower, not easy to use, and I always got it wrong and sprayed myself with cold water when trying to run a bath!Minibar in room, which I did not try. I wanted a cup of tea in the afternoon, no facilities in the room so I had to get room service. Expensive, but delived quickly and well.The Purple bar is a nice place, soft candles, good service, free nuts with your drinks. Staff regularly come and check if you need further drinks. The restaurant on Sunday night, late, was quiet so I expected a good and fast service which we got. Tuna, cooked fine, tasty, drinks service as good as could be.Breakfast on day one was great, good and fast service, a good buffet, my only thought that the fresh orange juice is a little tasteless, (diluted down?)Good selection of hot and cold items, quality ingredients. On day 2, a large medical convention hit the breakfast room in 1 go, so a quequ for everything, nobody brought coffee, could not find a clean table so used a dirty one. Checkout pleasant and efficient.

<Author>HoneymoonPlanning
<Content>Wonderful service on the top floors We spent a weekend at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe in February 2006 - and we'd only wish we could have stayed for longer...My fianc茅 used HHonors bonus points for the stay. We arrived from Gare du Nord with a taxi outside the hotel - and before I'd even stepped out of the car, our luggage was brought inside. We walked up to the reception, and when my fianc茅 brought out the Diamond VIP card, as the reservation was on this card, we were simply given a key card and asked to use the elevator up to the 6th floor. On the 6th floor we were greeted by an extremely serviceminded personell, and taken into an office where they processed our reservation. Unfortunately, the room was not ready (it was about 2 pm) - but I think this is because the reservation was originally for a standard room, but they upgraded us because of the Diamond VIP (funny thing the computersystem hadn't registered that, but oh well). We were given the option of going for a walk, and they would call us when the room was ready, or we could simply hang out in the lounge - which we ended up doing. We watched sports on the giant flat screen, had snacks and drinks - all for free. The lounge is open all day, and all who stay on the 5th and 6th floor are told to think of it as their livingroom. Great livingroom with access to champagne, beer, cappuccino and fruit (and what not!) all day long!!The room was wonderful - the largest bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom wasn't brand new, but still very luxurious and spacious. An hour after we got our room a bell boy stopped by and rang our door bell (yes, an actual door bell... no knocking!) - and gave us a platter of sweets and a dessert wine. All in all, the service could not have been better.There's a spa at the hotel, that we were planning on using before our departure on Sunday - however, the only day during the week that the spa is closed happened to be on Sundays... That was a disappoinment, as I only learnt this Saturday night...and we had to make new plans for Sunday (and travel days are always so stressful anyway...).As for location it is not shmack in the middle of things, and there are few restaurants and bars immediately around the hotel. However, it is only a 10 minute walk to Champs-Elys茅es, where you obviously can find whatever suits you.All in all, a great luxury hotel - however - I have no idea what it is like in the rest of the hotel, as you live a very secluded life on the 5th and 6th floor.

<Content>Lovely hotel and great staff I only stayed one night at this hotel so it was just a flying visit. The most positive feature of the hotel is the fantastic staff. They all seemed actually geniunely delighted to see and speak to us. Not a hint of haughtiness or boredom. The cleanliness of the hotel and room was very high and, very important to me, the room (on the 5th floor) was quiet, both from internal and street noise.The one drawback was that the room was incredibly overheated. Even though I turned everything off, I still could not sleep for the heat and the heavy duvet did not help the situation. The other strange thing about the room is that the curtains are not made to close so the street lights shone all night through the net curtains. These two points were a big let down to an otherwise very comfortable hotel.

<Content>A hilton, but not as I know them! I stayed at the Hilton adt for 3 days at the beginning of December. The location is a little out of the way, but is a 5 -6 minute walk from Les Courcelles metro and is within walking distance of the Champs Elysees.I am not generally a fan of big chain hotels, but this was very stylish and had a bit of character, despite its size. The service was excellent, from the front desk, concierge and bar staff. The breakfast (included in the price) was good in terms of variety (pretty much anything you could want!) and quality, but the hot food was rather lukewarm. The bar had a good ambience; prices were expensive, but then so is the rest of Paris.The room was an adequate size (a standard, on the 5th floor), with plenty of wardrobe space for two. The art deco decor was very nice, and everything was clean and well-maintained. Overall, I enjoyed my stay, and would consider staying at another Hilton!

<Content>Wow, what a great experience We stayed for one night and used Hilton points. We had the best service - free breakfast, late checkout, friendly staff. The lobby was beautiful. Our room was on the fifth floor. Loved the bathroom and the robe. My only complaint was that the tub was too long for me. The breakfast buffet was amazing. I would definitely recommend staying there.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, But May Not Stay Again The hotel is beautifully kept but lacks charm and a welcome feeling. It is within a 10-15 minute walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe and within 5 minute walking distance to a metro station. The staff was not overly helpful and even gave us bad information at one point which cost us a precious day of sightseeing. (We learned an important lesson on that trip - always check to make sure that you are not traveling during a local holiday when 90% of monuments and museums are closed.) However, manager Gregoire made it up to us for the concierge's faux pas. The food was excellent and the bartender friendly! 2 for 1 cocktails (normally 18 euros for one martini) are offered in the later evening. Breakfast is 19 euros for continental and about 30 euros for the full breakfast. The continental breakfast was entirely satisfying with fruit, granola, yogurt, croissants, cheese, cappuccino, etc.

<Content>Airy Art Deco Stayed during a busy October period.The hotel is lovely,with spacious,nicely decorated rooms.The A/C works very well.The bathrooms are equipped with wonderful toileteries(crabtreeevelyn).The layout is a bit odd,with long,long corridors(poorly signposted to elevators).Check-in/out was fast and simple.Staff smiled(a rarity in Paris!),and spoke English easily and with no hang-ups(also a rarity in France).There are shops for every possible forgotten item 100 yards to the left on exiting the hotel(obviously a previous reviewer never turned left during his stay!).The room TV was uneven-some channels reception was on/off;the remote was poor.The separate shower stall had a poor shower head that flopped around and could not be fixed in any direction.But these were small quibbles.Did not try the food,but frankly with all the fine eating establishments available in Paris,you should NEVER stay in a hotel to eat .

<Content>Very Very overrated OK, I TRULY do not understand the rave reviews at this site. As a diamond HH member we had to fight to get an obstructed view room on the executive level but that is not a big deal.This hotel is really very odd. It used to be an old police station that was transformed into a hotel. Yes, the rooms are larger than most of Paris' hotels but the rooms are odd at best. The food in the executive lounge (if you decide to stay there and pay more) is mediocre at best as well. The scrambled eggs are runny and the food is not good. It is also the same boring food every day. Again, for the money that you would spend at the executive lounge (if paying) just eat meals you want to eat out. I cannot understand for the life of me how this place has a 4 star rating! I stayed at the Le Grand Intercontinental last time and it was MUCH MUCH MUCH nicer and less expensive, better location, etc.While it is near the Arc de Triomphe, there are barely any other attractions nearby and extremely difficult to get directions from people as they are unaware of its bizarre location. This is a shabby-chic hotel and that is it! Nothing outrageous and extremely disappointing. While the staff is extremely nice for Paris' standards, we still had to wait about 5 hours for the room to be ready. The rooms are not as big as we expected and the bathroom was OK but again, nothing to write home about. I really cannot understand, for the life of me, the rave reviews of this place at all. Sorry to be a downer, and believe me, I am not a complainer but this was not a great hotel by any stretch of the imagination.

<Content>Some good, some bad... We just found this a really mixed experience. While the hotel is quite pretty, it has some real drawbacks as far as we are concerned. We are very frequent travelers, and have spent much time in Paris, and I can't say that I would ever stay here again. As Diamond level Hilton members, we still had to fight to get a room on the executive level. The rooms are a decent size with lovely art deco styling, but they have one very strange quirk: in order to use the bathroom at night, you have to turn on a light that lights up the whole room! The hotel has no place to buy any kind of basics, and if you check in on a weekend, this can be a problem, as there is no place anywhere near the hotel that is open to get basics such as forgotten toothpaste, etc. And that is one of what I consider the drawbacks of the hotel - it is not in a location that I found very pleasing from a tourist point of view. It's just not a neighborhood - it is within a decent walking distance to the Arc du Triomphe and all of the extremely touristy but not very authentic French bars, bistros and shops- but it has much more of a business district feeling to it than a comfortable, interesting place to relax and enjoy the soul of Paris. I also found the staff quite unpleasant, and I am used to the typical French attitude and am not put off by it. In fact, I kind of enjoy the game! But this staff was just unhelpful. Overall, it's not a bad place to stay. But with all the fabulous places in Paris, I just would not put this anywhere but in the bottom third of my list.

<Content>How many ways can you say Fantastic? I absolutely love this hotel and will without a doubt stay here again on my next trip to Paris.This was my first ever trip to Paris and I was a little worried that the handful of French I spoke wasn't going to get me by. The desk and concierge staff were very kind and helpful in English and didn't make me feel out of place. I ate dinner at the restaurant the first night and was fortunate to get a fantastic waitress who not only helped me order but offered lots of advice on places to go and things to do. In fact she was so nice and so helpful, I'm actually going to write Hilton about her. Will also praise the hotel as a whole.The room was a standard room, as I haven't built up that many Hilton Honors points. But it was actually pretty large, very clean and had a window in the back that faced the Eiffel Tower. Each night, because of the weather I was able to open that window and enjoy the fresh cool air and the fabulous view of the Eiffel tower in all it's twinkly glory. The bed was amazing.If you like to and are able to, Paris is a great city to walk. The location of this hotel, while not optimal, is pretty close to the Arc( 5-10 minutes) and to the Eiffel Tower( another 30 ). I was able to walk to the Louvre and d'Orsay and highly recommend both.Checkout was a snap and the desk staff corrected one small billing issue without fuss. The concierge was especially helpful in getting me to the airport.Great stay, great hotel, great city!

<Content>Great Stay! Just got back from a wonderful one-week trip to Paris. We used Hilton points for a 6-night stay. We liked the hotel a lot. When we arrived from the airport early in the morning after an overnight flight, we were able to check in right away and get some sleep/shower. That was great and unexpected. Room was a bit small but nicely done. We had a courtyard view. Bath had a tub and a separate shower. As Gold members, we were given coupons to use for the buffet breakfast downstairs. Very good - although service there was slow to get a coffee. The area around the hotel was very residential. However, it was easy to get to the metro stop. We walked to the Arc de Tri. area a few times too. All in all, a great stay.

<Content>Great Stay at this Hilton! Stayed here for 2 nights (on points) and it was fabulous. Our room had 2 double beds and a great view of the top half of the Eiffel Tower. It was great to watch it all lit up at night as we were falling asleep. The hotel is located about 5 mins from the Arc D'Triomphe. The first night we didn't get back until around midnight and had no problems walking around the area at that hour. It is located in a quiet neighborhood and we felt safe at all times. There is an ATM, pharmacy  cafe right down the street. The closest metro is Couchelles (not sure if I'm spelling that right!) and it is an easy walk to the hotel from there. If you're an adventurous walker, you can hike it down to Notre Dame and hit the Louvre at the same time. It takes a while but we managed to do it.Our room was big, clean and comfortable. Actually one of the best hotels we stayed in during our 2 weeks in Europe! Everyone who worked there was very helpful  friendly. I would go back to this hotel. Just be aware of the taxi drivers. Fares vary with each taxi. Verify first how much it would cost for 4 people or if you have any luggage with you.

<Content>Awesome stay with wife and kid We stayed for four nights (award stay) last week at the Hilton Arc de Triumphe with my wife and 4-year-old son. Overall, the hotel was beautiful and the service was great.Upon check-in in the lobby, I was given a card for the elevator and told I鈥檇 been upgraded (HHonors Diamond) and needed to check in at the Executive Lounge on the 6th floor. Going upstairs, we helped ourselves to early afternoon snacks (mostly smoked salmon and veggie sandwiches with a wide selection of drinks) and saw our room. My son's reaction: This room is very small.Sadly, he was right. Our room, although on the executive floor, was tiny. Just barely enough room to walk between the beds and the dresser. There were two queen beds, though. And since we spent as little time as possible in the room, it didn鈥檛 really matter too much. The executive Lounge was amazing, though. They had a great breakfast spread of breads, pastries, meat, cheese, fruit, eggs, potatoes, eggs, bacon, yogurt, fresh squeezed juice and coffee served to table (plus you could use the cappucino machine). Snacks were available throughout the day consisting of various nuts, chips, salsa, and assorted other savory snacks, along with sodas, beer, wine, and bottled water. Around 3 pm (afternoon tea time) they put out finger sandwiches 鈥?smoked salmon, chicken, and cucumber usually. The dinner snack was more sandwiches and a hot item (it differed on the night, but there were chicken wings, fried pasta, small ribs, etc), plus the nuts and chips. (After a long day of touring, we usually came back and made a meal of the stuff). Later in the evening, they put out chocolates that were quite excellent. Wine, liquor, champagne, and other drinks were available all day. We made such great use of the lounge (which was a few feet from our room) that we didn鈥檛 mind the small room. They had lots of magazines, newspapers, and a TV with BBC playing most of the day as well. The concierge service in the lounge was excellent as well. Arriving in Paris, our luggage was lost by BMI. I mentioned it at check-in and they asked for the contact info and said they鈥檇 follow up for us. Lo and behold, our bags arrived the next morning at the hotel.In fact, the service at the hotel was quite good. Upon arrival, they sent up a complementary puzzle for my son to try (it had a picture of the hotel on it). It was too tough for him, but a nice gesture. Each night, turndown service left us a special treat. One night, chocolates, another a small incense kit, another a potpourri kit鈥? it was fun to see what we鈥檇 get each night.Location wise, we were on a quiet street, not far from a nice park (Monceau -- good playgound), which is also where the nearest Metro was located. The walk to the Arc was a bit long, but certainly manageable. Overall, it was a bit out of the way, but quiet and nice and near a number of good restaurants. While I did not go, my wife spent one morning at the spa (free for Diamonds and perhaps Golds) downstairs. She went on and on about how amazing it was! Just the thing she needed. Beautiful tiles everywhere and a 鈥渉yrdo room鈥?鈥?a very large room with a large whirlpool tub (4 feet deep). The tub had places to stand, sit and lie down with four different kids of jets and sprays. There was also a steam room and sauna. They had free mineral waster and hot tea available. Though I didn't go, evidently this is one of the best parts of this hotel!The service alone makes this place worth a stay .. though I'd ask for a bigger room next time.

<Content>GREAT STAY  We booked this executive room directly through Hilton. It was not cheap being around 410 euros a night. But it was an inside courtyard room with a panoramic view of the Effiel Tower in the distance approx. one mile away and an exterior deck that was about 18' x 5' in size. We could enjoy the Parisian weather in the mornings and watch the Eiffel Tower light up in the evening. A feature of being on the top floor and what Hilton calls their executive room was that you had a self-serve continental breakfast which included eggs, bacon, sausage, rolls/croissants, cereals and juices. American newspapers were also available on the counter. All during the day they have snacks and in the evening all the liquor and soft drinks you could want. Red and white wines, vodka, bourbon, gin, cognacs and many others there although the wines were low end. Once again pour yourself as many or as few drinks as you desire. Also offered were several snacks like peanuts, chips and a couple of warm chicken satay or beef rolls, cheese and breads.  The room was good size approx.18 x 26 with a nicely appointed marble floor in the bathroom and separate shower and tub. The room is simple decor with a light touch of art deco 1930;s style. Closet and drawer space was good as well as having ironing board and iron in the closet when needed.  The lobby has alot of color and the restaurant offers very high dinner prices . We chose not to eat there as there were several cafes in the surrounding neighborhood.  The staff was very competent and conceige always willing to help. It is about a ten minute walk to Arc De Triomphe. It has a great public park (Parc Monceau) 200 yards away from the entry of this property.Try to not get a street room as it can be a bit noisy as we experienced when we arrived and had our room changed to the inside courtyard. Very easy to get taxis from the front.SUMMARY: The Hilton Arc De Triomphe is a clean property and a little removed from the Champs Elysees but close enough to walk. The cafes are a couple to a few blocks away but close enough. The area is safe at night. You can just get a standard room but get the inside courtyard and not a outside room. Get the executive room and you will enjoy the spa downstairs, gym area and free food and liquor upstairs in the executive lounge. Our 8 day stay there was a good one as there are many areas to stay in Paris. If you want quiet, clean and a n English speaking staff then you might want to pursue this Hilton. There are 4 other Hiltons in Paris but my opinion this was the nicest. This is a two year old property that once was a police department. My wife and I walked for miles each day observing the marvels of Paris. As we returned each day from another outing, we both agreed how much we enjoyed this Hilton. and would return again.

<Content>OK Hotel, OK Location Used Hilton points for a two-night hotel stay. Asked for an upper-level garden view room. Best shower ever, but bathroom was a bit small and lacked counter space. Bed covers and linens were clean, but the carpet definitely needs to be replaced in the rooms and the halls. Lobby was impressive. Staff was very attentive and helpful. Asked about using a pre-paid calling card from the room but was informed we'd be charged twice -- once with the card and once by the hotel. Not sure if that would have been true or not. Did not eat at the hotel. Instead found a very nice outdoor cafe if you walk left out of the hotel and further up the block, pastry, wine and cheese shops. Take the train from CDG to Gard du Nord to avoid traffic, but then take a taxi to the hotel -- too trying to do that with luggage.

<Content>It's not a cheap hotel - so your bed has a mattress. After we fled the 2-star nightmare hotel we'd booked we came here. It was plenty more expensive - but then you get a good hotel. Art-deco style. The standard room we had was rendered smallish by the crib we needed. Clean and bright. Very comfortable bed. Great water pressure. AIR CONDITIONING which you won't find in a lot of hotels. The mini-bar was outrageously priced at 6 Euro for a small water, so BYOW. The location is okay - not my personal preference as I like the Marais district - but it's a short walk to the upscale shopping on the Champs Elysses and the traffic extravaganza they call Arc de Triomph. They want 26 Euro for a bare-bones breakfast, so plan on eating elsewhere unless you're Spendy McSpenderson.

<Content>Stay Away We noticed a strong odor on the floor and my wife couldn't understand why she was suffering from breathing difficulty each night when we returned to the hotel. We later found out that the smell was mold (we suspected but it was later confirmed) due to a problem they had on the floor above with the sprinkler. It is hard to believe that a hotel placed guests on a floor knowing that there was a mold problem.The breakfast, which is 40 Euros (about $55 USD) is ok but I never rec'd the omelette I requested despite numerous requests.Bottom line, for the price there are far more reputable places to stay in Paris.

<Content>Great place We stayed here during the French Open and were pleasantly surprised to see many of the players choosing to stay here as well. We had a room on the 6th floor which gives you access to the executive lounge, so we enjoyed the complimentary breakfast and snacks/drinks that were available throughout the day. We found the concierge to be very helpful. Never felt that it was snobbish at all. The hotel is located in a quiet, safe area and there are two convenient Metro stops: one with a 8-10 minute walk, the other a 10-12 minute walk. There is not much to do around the hotel, but the Metro is so easy to use, that we spent our days out and about and then returned to the quiet of the hotel and relaxed in the executive lounge. The room was very nicely done and a good size for European hotel. Ours overlooked the courtyard, so it was very peaceful as well. I would stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful decor but expensive We stayed at the Hilton Arc d'Triomphe for 5 days at the end of May occupying 2 rooms. My husband and I had a garden view room (using reward points for part of the stay) and my daughter and mother-in-law had a street facing room. Neither rooms were noisy, both were large and beautifuly decorated. At check-in we were informed that the Executive level was full, a disappointment as we were gold level members. As compensatioln, we were given passes to breakfast for each day of our stay but no access to the executive lounge.A big disappointment was the quality of the bed. We booked into Hilton partially because we thought we knew quality of Hilton beds. Not the same here as in the U.S.--hard as a rock. I was having severe muscle spasms in my back by the third night. The very first thing my daughter noticed was how hard her bed was and we all were sore from the beds.Another unwelcome surprise was that the pool/fitness facilities were extra--25 Euros (a little over $30) to use the hot tub per person per usage. We have been overseas before but had really not encountered that before (maybe just didn't notice it).Internet was also very expensive to use. We ate at the hotel and ordered room service and it was great food (expensive but we expected that).The staff was very nice but there were just a few problems. Our toilet ran constantly. They sent someone to work on it the first day but the answer was that we had to jiggle the button until it stopped. That got old. Housekeeping never did figure it out and every day when we returned it was running and we had to go work with it. (Room was 320E per night or a little over $400!)Remote control for television did not work in my daughter's room but she called and they took care of that within the hour. When our reward nights were over and we began paying for the rest of the nights, we had to go through check-out/check-in with room keys. (A bit of a hassle after a long day of touring.)It was a beautiful hotel but for the money, I would stay somewhere with beds more comfortable and a bit closer to the Louvre/Orsay areas.

<Content>Loved it! Just got back from spending 3 nights at this hotel. Yes the food was quite expensive but in Paris everything is expensive. We had terrific service from all the staff we found them extremely helpful and polite. Our room was quite large for Paris standards and quiet and clean.The location was also fantastic - it was a 10 minute walk to the Champs Elysee.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris.

<Content>Heavenly 25th Wedding Anniversary We spent 3 nights here as part of our anniversary and had a wonderful time. The facilities are new and well maintained. Great bed, top notch shower and bathtub, absolutely outstanding concierge desk and hotel staff - we literally had a laughing crowd load our baggage into our rental car as we left. The bar and restaurant were excellent, and Carlos the bartender is helpful and friendly (tell him that you heard about him on the Internet). The hotel exterior is rather dull, but the interior and your room are clean, new, and luxurious.As far as the comments on its location, LOOK at a map! We found the hotel as a great base of operations; it's a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe, metro, Champs d'Elysee, buses, great restaurants, and shopping. It is in a very safe and quiet financial/diplomatic district. It is not at the Seine or the Eiffel Tower, but a brief cab ride will get you there quickly, or better yet enjoy a pleasant and romantic walk. Do take the Air France bus from Charles DeGaulle to the Arc de Triomphe, and walk a few blocks to the hotel. Do consider paying for the upgrade to executive class for the lounge, which has great food and drink available - we had a great breakfast daily, and occasionally used the available snacks as a meal replacement. Do ask the concierge/staff for help and suggestions - buy your Louvre and other museum tickets here to avoid lines - we took their advice and explored the newly opened Musee de l'Orangerie of Impressionist art, and went to a nearby bistro as recommended.Most importantly, do explore the wonders of Paris. We also spent time at the Paris Hilton for a different base of operations and experience and would also recommend it.

<Content>Sterile, snooty, outrageously expensive. Sterile, snooty, outrageously expensive. Rooms ok, the usual Hilton experience only with a French attitude. Which is why I still have to give it above average. The kids in the business center were terrific. No view to speak of. $30 for continental, $45 for full breakfast. $9 for a half cup of caf茅 au lait. Why it was only a half cup -- ?? I鈥榤 a bit of a cheapskate, but that seemed way out of line. There is a small bistro across the street with a very nice $12 breakfast including coffee to your liking. The hotel is quite a walk from anything of interest, use the busses and subway. NOTE TO RYAN AIR passengers. The RyanAir facility is at Beauvais a 45 minute taxi drive. I found a private car shuttle for $47, just Google it a day in advance and make a reservation. The Ryan Air folks let me slide on my luggage weight coming out of Lubeck, but nailed me good out of France.An observation about TripAdvisor (if you鈥檝e seen this in other of my posts, feel free to skip): I used it extensively when planning a last-minute 3-week trip to Europe, was very happy to have the service and felt I should pay back with my comments. I think you have to read between the lines and determine the type of traveler writing the review compared to your own type. I鈥檝e stayed in places that were highly recommended and turned out to be terrible; and the reverse. Try to judge whether the contributor is complaining about a one-time, bad experience as a result of an inattentive employee as opposed to a basic fault with the property itself. If a restaurant manager was rude, so what. If the place floods, and smells -- that鈥檚 a different story.

<Content>Great vacation We were at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe from May 10-17th 2006. We are in in our early 30's and were celebrating our anniversary, my birthday and valentines all in one! We had not had a chance to get away by ourselves since the birth of our two children 3 years ago, so this was very special, being just the two of us.We used our Hilton points and hold the silver VIP membership. We checked in late around 8pm and orginally given a room on the 5th floor. The room was nice with the sink on the outside of the bathroom and a big king size bed. I had asked before I left the US what the availabilty was at the hotel and they has said full for the time I was staying there. I thought since it was a special trip I would go back down and see what I could do to get an upgrade. I just asked and explained by situation and viola! They upgraded us to the 7th floor, balcony room with the executive lounge priviledges! We moved all of our things to the new room and unpacked and checked out the fabulous view of the Eiffel tower from our balcony! We were in the last room on the 7th floor, however, I discovered that the shower head was broken. I called downstairs and after a promise to send someone up in a few minutes to fix it, we went to the executive lounge to check that out. After a couple of drinks, we went back to our room to find that the shower head was not fixed as of yet. Again I called downstairs and they informed me that the part has been ordered for quite sometime and still has not come in. They don't know when it will come in, probably at some point during our stay, but not in the next day or so. So again we were moved to another room, this time closer to the elevators. The room was exactally the same, except the further room had a much bigger safe. So again we packed and unpacked and moved. Finally we showered and changed and played under the sheets and then we went to bed by 2am! After all it was our first night in the city of love! How could we not?? The room was bigger than the one on the 5th floor and had a flat screen tv. Which did stop working one night, but was fixed the next morning. There are only 2 channels you get in English and alot in French and Arabic. I think we saw about 15 minutes of tv if that during our whole stay. There are games you can play on the tv as well, which my husband discovered one night and had a blast playing them while I had a nice long soak in the tub. The bathroom had the sink and standing shower along with a large bathtub all in one room, not separate like the one on the 5th floor. Maid service was good, though they did not speak any English. We had turn down service each night with two liitle boxes of chocolates on the pillows! Yummy! The shampoo and shower gel, is not too good, so you may want to bring your own. They do give you a wash clothes, shower cap, embry board, q-tips, shoe shine, and of course soap. You also get two large and fluffy bathrobes and slippers! The bed was comfortable with goose down comforter and 3 large fluffy pillows. The weather was in the low 70's and over-cast to sunny all of our days there and one if it were any hotter, I don't think the a/c would of been sufficent. I don't know if there was something wrong with our a/c but we had it on the whole time we were there and it barley felt cool. The weather was perfect and it only rained one day for 15 minutes while we were standing in line to the Saint Chappell. Of course the only day we left our umbrellas in our hotel room as well! Figures right? The hotel is very nice in the Art Deco theme and very clean. The closest metro Courcelles is 1 3-5 minute walk. You will need to change to any place you go, not a big deal unless you are under time restrains. The metro by the Arc de Triomphe Charles de Gaulle Etoile is more central and that one is a good 15 minute walk. We took the Air France bus from the airport (pay on the bus, via euros). You can save 16E by buying a roundtrip ticket. It took about 45 minutes to get to our stop by the Arc and then we had only two roll-on bags and a back pack so we walked to the hotel. Not to hard to find at all. Be sure to have a map with you at this time. It comes in handy to find the hotel. If you take the taxi it will cost a min. of 6E, plus if you have bags, not worth it. The bus begins the trips to the airport at 5:45am bythe Arc and runs every 15 minutes or so. We took it back to the airport as well. Very easy and cost effective. We found the staff at the hotel to be just okay. Not really going out of their way, but doing their jobs. We had no problems aside from the broken shower head and the tv. The concerige were always willing to help and most helpful. There are taxis at all times outside of the hotel so that's never a problem either. We did not eat at the hotel restraunts, but did look at the menus and they were very pricey! The bar was pretty busy a couple of nights. There were lots of business as well as leisure travelers the time we were there. But the hotel never felt crowed. There is a very high fee to use the internet at the hotel. We saw many internet cafes that were a lot cheaper around the city. There are two phone booths right outside the hotel which we used nightly to call home to check on the kids. Very handy as it is insainly expensive to use the hotel room phones! We were gone all day everyday from early in the morning to late at night except our last two days there. On those two days, we went to the Executive lounge in the early evenings and found it to be quite full. They did have the same food out for breakfast each day, but plenty of food to get you started. Dinnertime they did have different food the two nights we were there and for late night snacks, they had different things almost each night. Of course there was not a lot of choices, but a few finger sandwiches and the such. Not too bad. One night they had really good food and alot of it and I could of made that my dinner, had I not just eaten two hours before! They always had coke, orange juice, beer, water, champagne, wine, gin, vodka, rum and brandy availabe each day. Apples and bananas each day along with a nice fruit salad each morning. If you can get an upgrade, by all means do try! I heard if you can't get the upgrade, try to get the free breakfast, they usually give you that which is around 20E or so. The street across the metro station Courcelles, has many little shops and places to eat. We found a couple of fun places, Indiana a tex-mex restraunt that was always busy in the evenings and good food at good prices on Hoche street, about a 8 minute walk going towards the Arc. One of the best Cholcalatiers in also nearby, called La Maison du Chocolat on 225 rue du Faubourg St Honore, again only a 8 minute walk away. Nicholas is a grocery store and good deals on wines and beers which is across the street from the Courcelles metro stop. There is no shuttle that goes between this hotel and the Eiffel tower as some have indicated. Perhaps they only run it in the summer? I asked several employees there and none knew anything about this. Since we used the executive lounge for breakfast, after dinner snacks, we really saved a lot of money. We usually ate on the run, simply because of all the sites we wanted to take in, so we did not go to many of the recommended restraunts, but there are tons of places to eat so that shouldn't be a problem. Another benefit being the on 7th floor is that you get to use the spa whirlpool for free, otherwise there is a 25E charge. There is a sauna and a steam room. We only found time to use it on our very last day there, but enjoyed it emmensely as we were the only two in there! The water however in the jaccuzzi was barley warm, but we didn't let that stop us from having fun! You do not need to know much French at all to enjoy the city. I knew probably 30 phrases and I barely got to use them...85% people speak enough to answer your questions no matter where you are. Even those who do not speak any English, we found we could communicate with them without much effort as well. The metro are very easy to use, realiable, fast and cost effective. By the un carnate (10 tickets) or carte orange if you will be using the metro 3-4 times a day. We had a wonderful and romantic time while we were in Paris! If and when we go back someday I don't think I would stay here again, only becasue of the location. Yes, it is quite, but too much walking to get to the center of the city and all the major sites. We did enjoy our time at the hotel in our larger upgraded room and the executive lounge privileges made our stay just that much better!

<Content>Nice hotel - but try to avoid the rooms to the street Stay on the executive floor in Dec 2005 was good value for the money given that I had made a reservation for a standard room over a week-end and was upgraded through a HHonors Gold card. When I came back in May 2006 for a business trip, I got a standard room with windows to the street which was quite noisy. Others might be less sensitive to French drivers roaring through the streets at 3 a.m. and people shouting there, but I could not get any sleep throughout the whole night.Frankly speaking, I had spent nights in a discount hotel on the Porte de Montreuil for 35 EUR per night which turned out more comfortable than here at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe. When I asked for another room with windows to the court yard for the following nights, I was given a room which was really fine and quiet.Another drawback is that the hotel is indeed situated relatively remote. As another traveller in this forum has pointed out correctly, Hilton Arc de Triomphe is a bit misleading as a name, in the sense that you will not even be able to see the Arc from the hotel. You rather have to have a 10 minutes walk to arrive there. The next metro station is officially Courcelles, but as far as the walking distances are concerned, it is almost arbitrage-free whether you walk to Charles de Gaulle Etoile on the Champs or to Courcelles - especially given the fact that you are immediately on the RER line when walking to CdG Etoile. 10 minutes walking distance to the next trou de m茅tro is already at the upper range of what one could expect in central Paris.To sum up, for the relative remoteness and the risk of getting a noisy room, I consider the hotel slightly overpriced. There are hotels of the same standard in this district which appear less remote and noisy and offer standard at a slighly more reasonable price (Sofitel among others).One final adivce for holders of Hilton HHonors Gold VIP cards: Although holders are normally granted complimentary access to the health club and fitness centers at the hotel, the card is not valid for free access to the hotel spa unless you reside on the executive floor.

<Content>A Really Top Class Hotel We had the most fabulous time in Paris staying at this hotel. The decor was very beautiful throughout, especially the downstairs toilets, they were out of this world. The rooms were a little small but the luxury of the sheets and quilts made up for it. The marble bathroom was beautiful and everything felt very plush. The bathrobes even came on cream satin hangers. We tried the spa and that also was a luxury experience. If you can manage to stay on the 6th or 7th floor do. We had a balcolny and had brilliant views of the Effile Tower at night all lit up. The staff were fantastic at this hotel. We have to say we have never met people who seemed so kind and happy in their work they really made you feel like wanted guests. A great stay and a memorable experience.

<Content>what a great stay............ Well we just returned from our Paris trip and can't say enough about how well everything went.The Hilton was a pleasure. We had a room on the 7th floor with a balcony the size of my first apartment and arrived to find champagne from the Hilton in our room (I am only gold level).The bed and linens were very comfortable and the room was quiet!Each night at turndown the were different chocolates and the executive lounge on the 6th floor stayed open till 11pm. They offered breakfast each morning and wine ,drinks and snacks all day.The Coucelles metro stop is two blocks away and the Camps Elysee is a mere 10 minute walk the other direction.We purchased a Carte Orange for the metro which is good for unlimited use from Monday- Sunday (bring a small photo). The Hotel staff was very helpful with directions and restaurant reservations. A great place nearby was Le Bistro de Sommalier on Haussman. It was one of our best dining adventures of the week. We went with the Chefs Menu which consisted of 5 courses paired with wonderfull wines for 70 euros each.Another hotel suggestion was Boeuf Sur La Troit just a ten minute walk south.A great Paris bistro and open on Sundays when most other places were closed.

<Content>A little taste of luxury! My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights, Sat 6th and Sun 7th May. From the moment we walked in we knew we would enjoy our stay. The decor throughout the entire hotel is beautiful - very grand. We used the separate HHonors check in desk, and as my boyfriend is a Hilton Diamond member, we were requested to go up to the Executive Lounge to check in. The Lounge staff are wonderful - nothing is too much trouble.We had been upgraded to a Executive room which was wonderful - bathrobes, slippers, complimentary water and chocolates each night. Again, the rooms, whilst on the dark side, are beautifully decorated, with nice toiletries. Massive, comfortable bed, large bath, small balcony overlooking a courtyard and a radio/CD player which was tuned in to a classical station and playing when we walked in! Nice touches.The Lounge provided us with a place to relax in the evening drinking complimentray champagne, and snacking on chips, pralines, nuts, olives, fruit, and hot snacks. I believe they had sandwiches and hot snacks throughout the day but we were exploring Paris and missed most of those! The Lounge is a nice place to meet and talk to others. We ate breakfast there the first morning, great service and nice food, but we thought the selection was smaller than the previous Hilton we stayed in. Still, cereals, pastries, coffee tea, hot items, fruits meats, cheeses and rolls, etc etc etc. The second morning we asked to eat downstairs in the main hotel restaurant, where the food selection is SO much better!! Try the lounge and the restaurant if you can.The staff happily stored our luggage on the last day, and again, they were all so polite and courteous. The Hotel is not in the centre of Paris, but Metro stop Courceles is a few minutes walk, or a ten minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe where the regional express trains (RER) stop.All in all, a fantastic stay, obviously made better by the upgrade to the Exec Floors. Hopefully we'll be going back!! Contact me with any questions!

<Content>Great stay in Paris A great hotel in the middle of the city. One of the newer hotels in town. Rooms are medium-sized but well proportioned. Good service and great balconies on the executive floor. It has a slight corporate feel to it and is not the most intimate of Paris hotels.

<Content>Ask for an upgrade! Spent 2 nights at the hotel and were impressed by the helpful staff and the decor of the hotel. As Hilton Gold members, we were upgraded to the Executive Floor which was very pleasant and probably saved us a fortune. Snacks were available all day as well as wine and champagne. The hotel is about 10 mins walk from the Arc de Triomphe but in a quiet, safe area. Although we arrived early, we were made welcome and provided with coffee and croissants until the room was ready. The room had everything we needed and the box of chocs on our first night was a nice touch. We would defintely stay here again if we returned to Paris.

<Content>well worth the extra have just spent 4 nights in the hilton arc de triompohe and loved it we payed extra to upgrade to the executive floor and its well worth it you get to use the executive lounge and are able to have snacks and drinks all day and evening including champagne and have acess to the spa facilities we would definatley stay here again also a good tip to get around the attractions use the batobus its a boat service on the seine and it stops at all the tourist spots without getting stuck in the traffic and its really cheap too but we also found the taxis very good value go soon!

<Content>great property My family of four stayed here for six nights in Feb. We were upgraded to the executive level. The hotel is fabulous. Staff is excellent, concierge service was great. The rooms are beautiful and clean, marble bathrooms, windows that open so you can see the Eifel Tower. We have a teen-aged son so the exec level was a real $$ saver. Free breakfast and snacks all day. Just for the price of soda and wine it would've been worth paying for. As you'll read in other posts, the location isn't exciting but it's safe and it's only about a 7 minute walk to the Metro stop. This is a top, 4 star hotel and we'd return in a heartbeat!

<Content>Excellent stay at Hilton Arc de Triomphe I stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for one week on business. The beds are very comfortable with down pillows. The rooms are large for Paris, and include an in-room safe, hair dryer, mini-bar, high-speed internet (fee). Concierge is very helpful finding restaurants if you would like recommendations. Breakfast is available as continental (19EUR) or full (30EUR), make sure you mention which breakfast you want. Hotel lobby is very art-deco and tends to be a bit smoke-filled. Purple Bar is fine for cocktails. Nearest metro is Courcelles, about 2 blocks away; a taxi to CDG airport is about 35-40EUR. Overall, this hotel is good for business travelers or tourists.

<Content>Very Friendly -- Nice location This was our third time in Paris and the best hotel of the 3. Rooms were nice with Art Deco throughout. Small by American standards but above average in size for Paris.The breakfast buffet was very good with a nice variety.What really stood out was the concierge -- very helpful, very friendly, very good service.

<Content>Nice hotel, shame about the location Stayed in this art decoish hotel for a long weekend. Everything up to 4 star Hilton standards although the rooms on the compact side and for Paris exceptionally quiet.Although hotel was full room service was never longer than 15 minutes for breakfast. The only drawback to this hotel and one that will stop us staying again is its off centre location in an embassy/business district - which is very safe, but dull - not the exciting Paris. And to call it the Hilton Arc de Triomphe is taking liberties. The hotel does not have any views at all of the Arc (or of anything but the nearby offices) and is a good 10 minutes walk from the Arc.

<Content>Fabulous! We loved Hilton in the fall. Hello Paris-lovers,This is a hotel for you!My husband and I took a weekend get-away in a quite rainy and cold Paris, in October. And yet, it is one of the best weekend-experiences we've ever had. Hilton Arc de Triomphe is a splendid hotel and the atmosphere is outstanding. Paris is even better in the fall, than in the summer. We took a lazy stroll down a calm Champes Elysee, and walked down all the way, to the Louvre. We got there at 7 o'clock at night and wandered the place almost alone. Extraodinaire feeling, almost out of this world. It was us and the great artists, a friendly and completely stress-less experience. We were alone with Mona Lisa and couldn't help thinking about the Da Vinci Code... Afterwards, we took a taxi to a restaurant called Spice. A nice and cozy restaurant with a 100% Paris-feel to it. Quite cheap and very romantic.Enough about that and more about the hotel.We actually got a cheaper rate from their own website, so check it out. The hotel itself is more expensive than most hotels, but it's SO WORTH IT!The decor is suductive and very romantic, and the service is excellent. The lobby is like I would imagine Titanic's decor was.This is a hotel experience to remember, and we loved it.Breakfast is quite expensive, as they say, but very parisian and we recommend taking a long lunch beside the windows. Sip a cup of coffee, read a news paper and relax.The rooms are so very nice and actually quite ..sexy. I loved the dressing/bathroom. :))Don't forget to have a drink in the bar, when you feel for it. We had a late night-cap, and strongly recommend it.We will absolutely return again, for a nice get away.The hotel is located perfectly. Just off the beaten tourist track, and yet so very close to everything! We have been to quite some hotels and restaurants over the years, in Paris, including the most luxurious ones you can find, all the way down to the middle priced ones. Mark my words - this hotel is different from others, and it gives you a very nice experience.We hold it very high on our personal around the world-hotel list.Enjoy your stay, you will not regret checking in here.

<Content>Excellent Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Hilton for 7 nights including valentines. We have stayed in so many Hiltons in our time that we have become accostomed to thier excellent service however, this trip was out of this world. We had a couple of hiccups ie credit card problems that took a few days to sort but the staff at the Hilton were wonderfull Tatiana the guest relations manager could not do enough to help. We even got Champagne and chocolates in our room on Valentines night. Carlos in the bar is a great laugh if you are lonely or fancy a drink on your own. The rooms are clean, comfortable and excellently decorated/furnished Art deco. If you are a first time visitor the concierge will get you to anywhere and provided us with the most excellent resturant booking on our first night, we loved it so much we booked again for our last night. You will not be disapointed by the Hilton Arc de Triumph.

<Content>Great hotel This hotel is very good. We booked a one night stay for New Year's Eve.We travelled by metro to the hotel, and it proved a bit difficult to find, but if you're travelling direct it is no problem. The hotel itself is located roughly 10 minutes from the Champs Elysees in a nice area of the city. The local area is quiet, with a lovely park opposite and just far enough away from the tourist traps.The rooms were spacious and of a good quality. The bathrooms were lovely, bath and seperate shower was very nice. We looked forward to using the hotel spa and in fact specifically went to the Galleries Lafayette to purchase a swimming costume and were a bit disappointed to be told it was an extra 25 euros each. General room services was very expensive - 5 euro for a Kit Kat. Though this is only trivial.....Generally we were really impressed with the quality of the hotel and would heartily recommend it!!!

<Content>Perfect Hotel With Perfect Staff My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay in this hotel. We rely on trip advisor for hotel reviews, so we thought we should add ours. From check-in to departure, everything was perfect. We were escorted to the executive level for an expresso while registering then escorted to the room. As in the brochure and on the hotel web site, the room had a balcony and a picture perfect view of the Eiffel Tower. It was ready for our 9:30 AM arrival, even though I had requested an early 10 AM check-in. As others have noted, this is a newer hotel (almost 2 years old, I think)and everything is still in excellent condition from the bedding to the baths. The rooms and baths really are like the pictures. Our plasma TV did indeed work just fine. The executive lounge is wonderful: Madame Catherine will even make dinner reservations for you. Refreshments and snacks (including beer, excellent wines and champagnes - complimentary) were served throughout the day starting with breakfast and constantly replenished. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was a very pleasant experience. The wait staff, especially Mademoiselle Cira, was excellent and the food was far superior to many of the restaurants having one of the coveted stars.My husband says I am too picky when it comes to hotels, and we have stayed in some of the best in the world (e.g., Lord Byron - Rome, Mauna Kea Resort- Hawaii, Peninsula - Hong Kong) but in all honesty, I have absolutly nothing but good things to say about this Hilton. We paid a discounted rate for our room (#777 on the top floor) yet experienced first class service. As long as the hotel maintains the service and ambiance that we experienced this time, we intend to stay here whenever we are in Paris.

<Content>Witing this review from my room .. This was a last minute weekend in Paris. I read the review of this hotel and it was a mix bag, I hesitantly booked a room.From the minute of walking into the lobby, I love the Art Deco style through out every nook and crany. The hallway, doors, carpet, even the number font on each door is consistant detail to Art Deco. I honor what a good job this hotel has done and love how it is carried out in the rooms and bathroom as well. Location is a good 5 minute walk to the main blvd.Everything is clean and in perfect condition. Tony the front desk speaks perfect english and knew my name the second time I came down to the lobby. I give this place a thumbs up

<Content>Fantastic From the point when we arrived to our departure we were treated as though everyone was pleased to see us at their hotel. We were met by the bell boy from the taxi. he discreetly checked the labels on my luggage and then checked inside his hat. Welcome Mr and Mrs Chambers he said Please go to floor 6 for your 脣xecutive Floor checkin. We felt welcome already and we were not inside the hotel yet!!!!The room was perfect and had a balcony which overlooked the inner garden and in the distance the Eiffel Tower.Within walking distance of the Champs Ellysse the hotel and staff were as good as your other previous guests had said.Finally the concierge reccomended a wonderful restaraunt Le Cuisine which is a short taxi ride away, try it and we are sure you will not be dissapointed

<Content>The best Hotel in Paris for Art Deco Lovers I stayed there in my hometown just to get away for three days from my apartment... I chose a nice suite and loved the decor of the whole place... The room was absolutely splendid. The service was very discreet, it is a good place for singles. The bathroom was excellent. I loved the room service menu which was good fro dinner and breakfast. The only problem, the room service was not very fast to deliver. But staff was always helpful on the phone. They have a great spa with massage and it has helped me a lot to see the city where I currently live from a very different point of view.Two problems : the bed was a bit too stiff for me and on the two TV sets in the suite, one would only air arab-speaking programms.This is the place to go in Paris if you like Art D茅co ! I would say that this hotel is one of the very best in Paris although it is not much talked about... Maybe people want to keep it like a secret !

<Content>Good Business Class Hotel Stayed one night in September 2005. Pleasant room, very comfortable. This is a very good business class hotel. Modern, not quaint. The art deco blandishments are not in the best of taste (particularly in the hallways) and unnecessary. Not a sterile hotel though. Staff helpful and very pleasant.

<Content>You could do better, you could do worse... I feel a bit guilty about the review I have to give as the stay was a freebie after entering a competition on the UK Conde Nast Traveller website last December. The reception desk was great and very helpful and we were allowed to check into our room very early. This was a bonus as we did want a nap before going out. We were upgraded to a King deluxe suite which consisted on two bathrooms (only one with a bath), living room and a separate bedroom. The d茅cor of the suite and hotel is nice.Besides reception, service was virtually none existent. We called three times to have the plasma TV in our bedroom repaired as there was no reception. When the technician did show up he said very little except the TV was broken which we already knew. He offered us nothing and then my husband asked if the regular TV set in the living room could be moved to the bedroom. He swapped the TVs and we suspect whoever stays in the room next (room 424) will have to make a few calls if they wish to watch TV in the lounge area.The hallway leading to our room was constantly littered and quite a few stains on the carpets. When we arrived there were dirty drinking glasses in front of our door and when we left (two days later) the same glass was there. Kid you not. It wasn鈥檛 like they were concealed.Room service was appalling and way overpriced even by Paris standards. We ordered a cheese plate that came with two small pieces of cheese (mold and all) and a small bistro salad, a croque monsieur that was cold and bottle of Evian for 50 euros. Had the food been good food, no problem, but it wasn鈥檛 so we can鈥檛 give room service a good review.We also had access to the Executive Lounge. The food offerings were slim. It was okay for a drink before going out, but the EL was not worth the upgrade price. Again the service was non-existent and the lounge is pretty much self service.We have stayed in many hotels in Paris and this is not one we would rush back to. There are too many choices in Paris at the same rate level to choose from.

<Content>Loved it My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in September and loved it. The king size bed was incredibly comfortable and the dark drapes and heavy lining under them kept the sun out....we woke up one day to a dark room and it was 1pm! Very romantic hotel with marble bathroom, great toilitries and four large towels, the size of beach towels. Breakfast was just okey...but very expensive - about 30 euros per person. I never made it to the spa because we were so close to the tourist sites and there was so much to do. The Arc de Triomph was a five minute walk, as was the metro station. The Hilton staff was wonderful at speaking English and very informative in helping us with a show at the Lido and providing huge hotel umbrellas for the days it rained. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay their again. During our walks near the Arc de Triomph, we did not see any hotels that would compare to this Hilton.

<Content>paris and the tour de france we were upgraded to a family suite, which basically was 2 rooms with a little hallway-was more than adaquate room.the upgrade to the executive lounge was the absolute best as paris is very expensive and we ended up nibbling on snacks instead of a meal a couple of nights. their was a open bar in the lounge with wine, champagne....was wonderful and free. the service in the executive lounge was super!!!! the hotel was 3/4 mile from the arc de triomphe and alot of walking to get anywhere-metro a 10 minute walk. we were there to watch lance armstrong finish the tour de france at the arc. the area around the hotel is quaint and a nice park not far from the hotel. overall a really nice time.

<Content>Not great for families We spent 3 nights (July 17-19) at this Hilton after reviewing feedback on this site regarding the Hilton Arc de Triomphe. As a family of five, I was concerned with finding decent sized rooms and beds. My initial night, I kept my reservation for 2 rooms, both with 2 queen sized beds, but since our flight from Italy came in late in the afternoon, they could not accomodate our request for 2 connecting rooms. Also, they would not upgrade like many of the HHonors members who seem to write on this site for this hotel. They gave us rooms on the 3rd floor facing the street. If you have young children, mine were 3, 8, and 11, you might be able to squeeze into one room. The 2 separate rooms were overkill and also very expensive. The Hilton website allows only 4 per room, but it is up to you whether you'd rather spend it on sleeping or out on the town.I picked this Hilton as it seemed close to the Air France shuttle dropoff at the Arc de Triomphe. This hotel is too far to comfortably walk to the hotel with all your luggage. Our taxi ride albeit a few long blocks cost us 11 Euros due to added costs of each bag stored in the trunk. I found out that there is a courtesy van that makes stops at the Arc from the hotel starting at 10:15 am on the hour, but only accomodates 8 passangers and you have to ride it to the Hilton Eiffel tower before going back to the Hilton, another 45 minutes total.Breakfast was included in our package, constituting various ethnicities, but the same each day. Eggs were unusually runny! We stayed at the Hilton Charles de Gaulle when we first arrived in Europe and for half the price and the same Hilton service and food, I enjoyed this much better given it's 5 minute free shuttle right from the airport, walking distance to trains into the city and access to the Air France shuttle right into town. Great for families just arriving as we could put our children to bed immediately after arriving to get them acclimated without adding extra travel.Everyone is right, the Hilton Arc de Triomphe is not convenient to many nice eateries nor stores although about 2 long blocks to the metro and down rue de Berri toward the Champs Elysee.

<Content>Loved the Hilton! I stayed 3 nights in Paris at the Hilton and loved it! I spent a lot of time reading reviews of hotels in Paris, and finally selcted this hotel. I wasn't thrilled that I would have to spend as much as we did, but July in Paris in a comfortable hotel with great service has its price. I was not disappointed!At first I was worried about how far I would be from the major attractions, but it wasn't too bad after all. Most of the time we walked 2 minutes to and from the Metro when we went exploring. The Arc de Triomphe was just 7-10 minutes walk from the hotel, so one night we took a stroll to see the Arc at night. We were also informed that the hotel had a shuttle bus that went between the Arc de Triomphe and the hotel every hour on the hour (except lunchtime) from morning until about 6 pm. The weather was great so we never used it.The service was fantastic. When we checked in I asked for a room with a decent view. The young lady recommended the patio as being the nicest view. No fantastic view of the city, but it was pleasant enough. The staff was there to assist with restaurant suggestions, train reservations, just about anything.Our room was clean and smelled fresh. Towels and sheets were sparkling white. Turn down service was an unexpected bonus. Typically we returned to the hotel before dinner to shower and change. Every evening when we returned from dinner, our room had been freshned up (again) - the bed was straightened, and we even got fresh towels (again). The room wasn't huge, but a comfortable size for a couple. We asked for, and got a king-sized bed in a non-smoking room.I wanted a hotel that I would look forward to returning to every evening, and the Hilton fit the bill. Every evening before going to bed, we stopped in the Purple Bar to relax, have a drink and talk about the day's adventure. A great setting to end the day.The Hilton isn't cheap, but for 3 days we spoiled ourselves in Paris and had a lovely time. I would not hesitate to return to the Hilton on my next visit to Paris.

<Content>Good business hotel I have just stayed two nights in this hotel. I got a regular room in the 4th floor with a view on the patio. The hotel is quite new (1 year I believe) and the room was in perfect condition. Location is very quiet. The bed is comfortable with good blankets and a choice of pillows. The bathroom has a separate bath tub and shower. I travelled alone hence the room was perfectly sized, for two persons it would be on the small size.Service was very friendly and helpful. Restaurant offers good food, but be aware of very high beer prices (EUR 16 for a pint of lager in the restaurant!)..Location of the hotel is in a business district, but then again it is only a 10 min. walk to Etoile.Alltogether I would recommend this hotel mainly to business travellers.

<Content>good hotel We got a good deal to stay in this hotel and were quite happy with the 10 minutes walk to teh Arc De Triomphe. We felt it was a good location for the price we paid. The hotel also had parking which was a necessity on a European driving holiday.

<Content>America in Paris Very nice hotel! Stayed 3 nights July 5-8 2005. Paris lost the Olympics to London. Biggest thing to consider is that most of the clientele is American. If you're looking to immerse yourself in French life, this is not the place. If you're looking for guaranteed English speaking staff, air conditioning, and a king bed, you're in luck. But you're more likely to run into fellow guests from Detroit and Denver than from Dijon. And yes, this is a quiet neighborhood. We'll definitely come back.

<Content>This Is Not a Great Hotel Just came back from a 5 night stay on my honeymoon. We had stayed the previous 6 nights in beautiful hotels in Rome and Nice and we're completely thrown off by our stay at the Hilton Arc. Let's face it folks, read the rest of the reviews and you'll find that everyone is either a HH Gold Member (oooooooh) or stayed in Executive class. If you don't have that sought after Gold Card and are just looking for a nice hotel in Paris.....this is not the one for you!. It is completely out of the way (15 minute walk to any signs of life). There is nothing open past 7:00 pm around the hotel. It is quiet because it is in the middle of a business area. The 3 square pillows you get are full of sand, and after waking up with a broken back, I asked the front desk if they could move us to a room with a better bed. Instead, they sent 2 guys to our room to place a big board under the mattress. There are far better hotels, in far better locations, for a far better value!

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Hilton We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton. Great location, close to the Courcelles metro (about a five-minute walk) and wonderful little neighborhood that include a small grocery store, wine store (Nicholas), cheese and sorbet shop etc. Just around the corner of the hotel and down the street a few steps, you will see the Arc de Triumphe and the Champs Elysses. When I return to Paris, I would stay here again in a second. This is a new hotel having opened last year. I don't know why someone would say it is showing its age. Beautiful condition and very, very clean. The valet and bellstaff were wonderful as were the the concierge, Purple bar and front desk staff. The room we had was 250 Euros a night for two double beds. (We are a family of four). Wonderful duvet. Would have liked to have had more pillows but I never bothered to ask for them. I am Hilton Honors but never received anything including a paper. Our traveling companions received welcome macaroons and a note from the manager but they were booked in a family suite which was 400 Euros a night.

<Content>Impressed I stayed for 3 nights for around Eur250 a night, not quite a steal as some other travellers here. Yes, location is not too central, but I enjoy the fact that the neighbourhood is quiet. Furthermore, its not that bad. The nearest subway is Courcelles station, and its a 5 min walk. I have not tried the FB, but felt that the prices for room service is reasonable. The spa is also a great inclusion, not easily available if you stay at the smaller hotels. The pricing turns out to be reasonable although I thought everything in Paris tends to be pricey. Overall, the room is nice. I had a twin, which is great in terms of size. General service level is good and staff are courteous. Would stay there again if I visit Paris again.

<Content>Last Minute Find After showing up for a reservation at another hotel at 10pm and not having a room for us, we were desperate for a place to stay. The Hilton was very accomodating. We had 2 rooms -we were unable to get adjoining rooms for 2 days, but the hotel did make sure the rooms were next to each other. It was very clean and new, great bathrooms, large bedrooms, helpful staff. The breakfast was very good as well.

<Content>Terrific stay Stayed here end of June. Agree with previous posts regarding location. Although close to the Champs d'Elysee, it is a bit off the beaten track. It is located in a neighbourhood of embassies and banks. Very little in the immediate vicinity. This does allow for a quiet sleep. Found a great restaurant on my last day. Head straight out the front door, down Blvd Lisbon (two minute walk) to Place Rio de Janero. Here you will find Restaurant Valois with its red awning. Traditional bistro fare (steak tartare, moules, escargots). Super busy at lunch with bankers etc.. dead at night as is the rest of the neighbourhood. Do stop at Parc Monceau which is right by the hotel. A truly beautiful oasis and a great spot to people watch...Back to the hotel: Comfortable, clean air conditioned rooms (the AC is weak especially when used en masse during a heat wave). Executive lounge very pleasant. Spa was lovely after a day of walking. Outdoor terrace restaurant also lovely. Service throughout stay fantastic. I would definitely return, but I would price shop. I stayed for 199 euros which I felt was a steal. Side note: since my last visit to Paris I found taxi service to be appalling. Several drivers had just begun their careers. Speak to them before you hop in if you can. If they don't know Paris, wait for another driver.

<Content>Terrific stay Our stay at this hotel was fabulous. For 230 Euros a night, we had a spacious, well-appointed room with 2 double beds. All aspects of the room were top notch and we found the service, especially the concierge, to be extremely helpful. The included breakfast buffet was bountiful and delicious. Although the hotel is not at an ideal location, the 5 minute walk to the metro station made it convenient enough. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved It!!!! I have stayed in many hotels and this experience ranked among the best, particularly for the price that was paid. The room and bathroom were very very well appointed and extrememly comfortable (nice large duvet covered bed and marble bathroom). The location is also excellent and only moments away from the Arc and main avenue. The best part of the hotel, however, contrary to one of the writers below, was the concierge service I received. Although my French is not that great, the staff went above and beyond in terms of helping me plan out each day, obtain tickets, car service etc... Not only were they helpful, but they had a great attitude and great suggestions on how to plan our time spent there. I would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Paris!

<Content>Very happy with the hotel We stayed there in Feb 05 for 4 nights using Hilton points. We were very happy with our stay. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable. We got a welcome note and macarons from the manager. A nice touch. Every night there was turndown service and very nice Parisian chocolates. Bathroom had lots of amenities including bathrobes. We spent Valentine's Day there and the concierge was very helpful. He was able to get us a reservation at a romantic restaurant for that night. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Older hotel with excellent location We stayed here May 12-16 2005 and paid 180 Euros nightly. The hotel is older and showing it. As Hilton HHonors members we were upgraded to the executive floor and found the room to be a good size. There were adjoining room doors on either side of the room that let you hear the room beside you. It's redeeming quality was the amazing breakfast buffet that was included with our room; can't say enough good things about it. The location was excellent, very close to two subway lines.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed in this hotel several times now. They upgrade me to the executive floor where you can have breakfast on one of the balconies at the lounge. I did have some problems with the TV which didn't work but got fixed within 10 mins. All together the staff was fantastic and very reponsive and I would definetely go back here for any other trips to Paris.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just got back from the Hilton Arc de Triomphe and wanted everyone to know what a great hotel it is. Don't pay attention to the location on the maps you see, it is not in the hustle and bustle, but it is close to the Champs Elyses. We did walk alot but there really was no need. The room was amazing, we stayed in a suite on the seventh floor overlooking a quiet street, which meant a good nights sleep. The staff were extremely helpful and did not hesitate to assist. We were in a club suite, so had full use of the club lounge. This was a big plus, the snacks were better than average Hilton with plenty of drinks on offer. The Safron restaurant was well worth a visit, with staff taking time to explain the menu and help with chosing the wine (without going for the most expensive). All in all a great trip, made so by a great hotel. Well worth a return visit.

<Content>best hotel staff My husband and I and our two teenagers stayed at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe for a three-night weekend during a family vacation. We had a family guest room, which included two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The rooms were comfortable and well-appointed. The Weekend in Style rate included an extensive and excellent buffet breakfast, with a variety of fresh fruit (cantelope, watermelon, pineapple, mixed fruit, oranges, apples, bananas), pancakes, sausage, eggs, hash browns, assorted delicous pastries and breads, cheeses, meats, cereals, yogurts, a variety of juices, and other items. The hotel is lovely, with art deco styling throughout. We found the location to be convenient to the Champs-脡lys茅es and pretty much every place that we wanted to go. It's a relatively quiet area, about a five minute walk to the Champs-脡lys茅es. We enjoy walking and also walked to the Louvre, the Opera Garnier (worth visiting, especially if you're a Phantom fan), Mus茅e d'Orsay, and Notre Dame Cathedral. The latter may be further than many people would want to walk, but it was a good excuse to walk along the Seine.Even though this was not a business trip, we used the business center in the evening - our son kept in touch with friends on the internet and we used the computer to transfer photos from a digital camera to an iPod.The best thing about this hotel was the staff. Every individual that we encountered in this hotel was completely professional and personally welcoming at the same time. I was continually under the impression that it was the priority of each employee to ensure that our stay at the Hilton was the best possible experience. It is common to hear that the French do not like Americans and may not always treat them well, but our experience at this hotel was just the opposite. We have stayed in hotels in Germany, Italy, Austria, the United Kingdom, Canada, and all over the U.S. We've had many good experiences, but the staff of this Hilton were the best we have ever enountered. We would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Very nice-only a few minor problems First of all I want to say that being an avid traveler I am tough when it comes to reviews. The hotel must be truly extraordinary with no problems to get an excellent rating. I stayed at this property for one night on March 26th. Upon arrival, I was immediately escorted to the executive lounge for check-in. Dissappointingly, there were no available rooms for check-in. I couldn't really complain because it was early (around 10am) Being a diamond member, I asked for an upgrade to a suite. I was told however there would be a 200 euro charge to upgrade and that being a diamond member meant an executive plus room with views of the eiffel tower and arc was the best they could do. I was ok with this and actually content with the idea of of having a view. I was told the room would be ready around 3pm I returned around 6pm and was instead given a deluxe king suite on the 2nd floor, with no view. I was very happy given that my earlier request was honored. Come to find out it was only because the hotel was oversold.What can I say, the suite was beautiful. Beautiful greenish black marble in the bathroom. Separate shower and tub. An abundance of bath amenities. Plush down comforters and pillows. There was also a bottle of red wine and pastries on the coffee table in the living room. It was truly spectacular.Now for problem #1. It was unusually warm that day in Paris and I noticed the air conditioning only worked in the living room, so I cracked the window open in the bedroom hoping I would get some air flow. Well that didn't happen. At around midnight I woke up in a sweat. It must of been around 80 in there. I called the front desk to complain and at first the receptionist was a bit perplexed that I was asking for air conditioning in March, but I explained to her that it was stifiling and she agreed to send maintenance. I am sure she probably thought I was an ugly american to ask for AC in March, but who cares I was hot!! The maintenance guy came up and after about 40 minutes he finally fixed it and I was able to sleep.The next morning the breakfast was great. There was plenty of food, no lines, and prompt service.All in all it was a nice hotel. The location is not too great, kind of far from the nightlife of Paris, but close if you like shopping on the Champs Elysees.I would stay here again, but only if I could use hilton points.

<Content>Avoid the Concierge!!! We stayed at this hotel recently and found it to be a wonderful place. The facility itself is great. The staff was excellent with the exception of the Concierge who was not only not helpful but what I would classify as arrogant and rude. When I advised them they were less than helpful the attitude simply got worse. I thought the idea of a concirge was to help smooth the way for the guests and perform services better and more efficiently than the guests. The two requests made to them they gave wrong information on one and refused to perform the other. If they can't tell you the status of tickets to a art exhibition or order a taxi for a large group. What good are they? Needless to say both of these issues were overcome by simply doing it myself.

<Content>Hilton Arc de Triomphe Paris After a 3 days' business stay at the hotel, it really feels like coming back for a romantic week end.The hotel interior is amazing, it feels like travelling back in time to the glamour of the 30's when luxury liners took you from Europe to America.The room I was in was very nicely furnished and the bathroom is very innovative as well as functional.The staff at the restaurant was very friendly and the food was a remarkable experience ...just what you need when you want your French business partner to sign a contract! Breakfast buffet is just amazing and with a pastry chef baking croissants on the premises, it did not feel like going out for a meeting!Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Very Good service. Staff Excellent. The Hilton Arc De Triomphe is about a 4 - 8 minute walk from that very monument. We were met at the door by a fully rigged out doorman, who spotted us walking up from the Metro... he took our bags and asked us our name.. We told him, and he nodded and took our name out from under his cap!!.. he then said, follow me.....we had a check-in on floor 6 and stayed on 7 which is the executive floor. This is because we are Hilton Gold card members and meant we also had free tea/coffee, cakes etc throughout the day in the executive lounge - Breakfast is served in there as well. Very good value. Sadly, even though we had been given free access to the Spa at the hotel, our daughter aged 9 wasn't allowed in, as you had to be over 18 to enter. This meant we didn't go at all, because she was quite upset she wasn't allowed in and had been looking forward to using the Jacuzzi etc and we didn't want to rub salt into the wound.  The view from our room at night was nice....Eiffel Tower.. and it sparkled on the hour for about 10 minutes. The room wasn't big, but adequate (two doubles), nicely decorated though you couldn't open the doors under the television to get to the drawers, which was a bit silly, as it got jammed into the bed. A little box of chocolates and fruit drinks were complementary.  We had a few problems with the TV, but they were sorted. A big thanks to Catherine on executive staff who was around to help us and give a friendly smile at all times. We used the business services which were also fine.  The nearest metro stop is Courcelles. I'd probably try the Hilton Paris next time as this was nearer the 'bright lights' of the Seine and Eiffel tower, but I would also stay at this hotel again. The nightly charge at this time of year for us was 230 euros.  May I really recommend on walking up the road to see the Arc De Triomphe stopping off at a small cafe called Midor茅 which you will find at 236 rue Fbg St Honor茅 (turn left out of hotel, next left up Avenue Hoche, then left again into Rue Fbg St Honore.. a few buildings down on the left hand side of the road) They have superb snack food. I had a quiche with potato/mushroom and spicy sausage which was out of this world, and the pizza and croque monsieur was sooooo tasty. A Really good little snack bar and first introduction to French food.

<Content>Great customer service My husband and I along with our 3 kids stayed in this hotel over Christmas and we were happy with every aspect, the staff were incredibly friendly. The rooms moderately sized by European standards, exceptionally clean. Good location within 10 minutes walk to Champs Elysee. Would definitely go back. If you have kids book the family suite.

<Content>luxury in Paris Just completed a three night stay in Paris and had a great experience. Hotel located 10 minutes walk to Arc de Triomphe and 3 minutes to rue de Courcelles metro stop (from there you can go anywhere). Rooms and staff were exemplary. Executive lounge, including staff, was among the best I have experienced and look forward to staying there again. Made one request when we were there and there was a knock on the door within 3 minutes from engineering.

<Content>superb business hotel December 2004: I have just returned from a stay in this excellent hotel. Because of my HH gold status I was upgraded to the Executive floor without even having to request it - very unusual for the Hilton Group. This really is a top quality hotel and I am surprised they opted to call it a Hilton rather than Hiltons flagship group, Conrad. The hotel is appointed to a very high specification in attractive art deco style, this comprehensive refit still seems very new. The rooms are beautifully appointed, very quiet and feature superb beds and bed linen. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I would happily stay there again if I wished to stay in this location. The location is in fact the only issue. As a business location it is ideal. As a tourist location less so, it is rather hardwork to get around Paris requiring a change of Metro lines. There seems to be a desperate shortage of taxis late at night in Paris, making this location hard to get to once the metro has closed.

<Content>Superb hotel I was rather concerned to read some of the previous comments on this hotel but was delighted and not a little relieved to find it an excelent choice. I can only assume that this hotel must have had early teething trouble because now it is very well run and most comfortable. The food was first class and complemented by an intimate and relaxing bar. My room was quiet, well lit and with the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. I will be back.

<Content>Pleasant staff, but disappointed still We stayed for six nights on Hilton Points. Although we were HH Gold, the executive floors were booked and we were not allowed access to the lounge. However, we were provided a free buffet breakfast daily. The room was the quietest hotel room I've ever stayed in! Bed was extremely comfortable. Inconvenient Metro stop (Courcelles), we had to change to go to just about anywhere. Rooms and bath were very nice, but small by U.S. standards. Great help from the concierge in booking restaurants, info on trains and tourist traps to see and those to avoid. Excessive phone charges for local calls.
