<Content>Comfortable, standard hotel This hotel has a prominant position not far from the TV tower. When arriving from Tegel airport, is only cost 2.10 euros, was very easy to find and took about 30 minutes.If you can ask for a west facing high floored room to give you a wonderful view of Berlin. I was on the 13th floor and had lovely views each evening of the sun setting and also the Christmas markets close by. We did arrive early and couldn't check in until 2pm, but they were happy to store our bags for us.The room has a modern feel, with the bath and sink in the main room, with a curtain to cover when in use. We were disappointed with the twin beds pushed together and separate quilts, when we had asked for a double bed. However reception informed us all rooms were like this. The room also has a safe and mini bar. There was little room for storage, but as we were only staying a few days this was not a problem. The room was cleaned daily, however when they came to clean one morning and we were still in the room they never came back later and so we had no room service that day!In the area we found a handy supermarket for soft drinks and bread (NB they charged extra for the drinks, but you can recycle them at the supermarket and take the receipt to the tills and get your money back). There is also a lovely Italian style restaurant not far from the hotel just off to the left by the twin peaked church.Location wise, this hotel is not really central and you could stay closer into the city. However it was only a 2km walk to the Brandenburg Gate and the transport links where excellent.Overall a comfortable hotel.

<Content>Good location Park Inn is well situated, close to many major attractions in Berlin and easy to get to from Tegel airport- the bus stops almost outside the hotel. It's also close to rail transport, a few minutes walk from a major shopping centre and good restaurants. Service at the hotel was efficient, the rooms were clean and comfortable. The bathroom is in the room( from one's bed you look through a glass screen into the bath/shower) but this was not a problem. The only (major) disruption in the only hours of the morning was from American guests screaming and fighting with one another in the corridor.Despite the size of the hotel it never felt crowded even though Burger King downstairs was often crammed full of people and the coffee shop at the entrance was mostly full. Escados restaurant is highly recommended for steaks- excellent value, good quality food and value for money prices, even though the service could be improved. At 鈧?7 for breakfast, Park Inn should be avoided. The Galleria shopping mall( a few minutes walk from the hotel) has the freshest bread, rolls, fresh fruit, fresh meats, juices and yogurts at a fraction of the cost. The more people avoid paying exorbitant prices for hotel breakfasts the quicker hotels will realise they're over-priced!

<Content>Fabulous Park Inn My wife,my 6 year old son and myself have just returned home to Ireland having spent 4 incredible days in Berlin.Putting it honestly if anyone is considering a city break then Berlin is the place to go and the Park Inn is the hotel to stay in. We had a junior suite on the 34th floor which cost us 149euro per night without breakfast.The view of the tower and Alexanderplatz from our huge room was unbelieveable especially at night. The Christmas markets are in full swing now and many are only a very short walk from the hotel. U bahn station is only 50 metres from the front door of hotel.We bought 2 Berlin welcome cards at Schoenfeld Airport which cost us 49euro and this covered all our travel for the weekend and also discounts into museums and zoo etc.It was well worth the cost. Cant wait to return to this great city.Paul Mooney,Waterford,Ireland

<Content>Great hotel. Great Location. We stayed in the Park Inn at the end of November 08. It was a trip organised by Citiescapes which included a walking tour.The rooms were comfortable and clean. They had comfortable beds, safe, minibar/fridge, shower, WC, sink, wardrobe with trousers press (no iron), and plenty of towels. We didnt really mind the layout with the toilet and shower. There was a good selection for the hot  cold buffet breakfast including juice, cereals, cheese, cold meat, breads, soup, eggs, fried potatoes.You could get a buffet dinner for 鈧?9 per person which was quite good but the menu did not vary each night.The main bar, Spagos, was quite expensive. I can highly recommend Escados steak house just across from the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shops in the area.Our room on the 27th floor overlooked a construction site. If I was staying again I would prefer a view over Alexanderplazt. There are plenty of shops inlcluding several shopping centres, two, Galleria and CA, were just outside the hotel on Alexanderplazt.Also, the Christmas markets had just started on Alexanderplazt right outside the hotel. One way of getting across town is by using the 100 and 200 buses. A one way ticket is just 鈧?.10. The 200 goes via Unter den Linden, Friedrichstrase, Potsdamer Plazt to the Zoo. The 100 goes via Unter den Linden, Reichstag, Tiergarten, to the Zoo.Overall, a highly enjoyable stay in the Park Inn.

<Content>Loved the Park Inn Berlin My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay in the Park Inn Alexanderplatz and I have to say it was a most enjoyable experience.We flew into Schonefield airport and for E2.80 we were outside the back door of our hotel in 20 mins.The staff were lovely.Breakfast was excellent with plenty choice.Busy early in the morning but with the big restaurant there was plenty seating.The only down side of the hotel is that the bar was rather expensive.Rooms were cleaned and made up daily and service was very good.The area of Alexanderplatz is very nice with Galleria Kaufhof and C  A next door but Ladies if its a serious shopping trip you are on I would advise you stay in the area of Kurfurstendamn.This is where its all happening. Berlin does have a fantastic transport system however and it is very easy to get anywhere in a short space of time.Anyone that is arriving to Berlin on a Sunday the shops are closed so you can do your city tour then which is good value and you can hop on and hop off when you like.Eating out is cheap in Berlin with a vast variety of places to eat. At this time of year the Christmas markets are in full swing and it is magical. Berlin is a city worth a visit and so is the Park Inn.

<Content>Good value, great location We stayed in Park In for five days and it was our first time in Berlin. I highly recommend this place if this is your first visit to Berlin: the hotel is perfectly located (close to the public transportation); it is clean, safe and the staff speak English (check-in was efficient). It is just a walk away from Hackescher Markt (with lots of bars and restaurants) which is very convenient for late night dinner. Our room was comfortable (despite the strange-looking shower explained by the previous posters) and cleaned daily. Perhaps we would try a different place for our second exploration of Berlin, but we were very satisfied at the end.

<Content>good hotel and location Hotel was just across from the train station, we arrived early and was able to check in. The room was clean and modern, as other reviews mentioned about the see through shower and frosted toilet, it was a bit strange, but was not a problem, there was a curtain that you could pull round if you get a bit shy. We both found the beds a little soft for our liking, but still had a good nights sleep. The breakfast had a good choice of food which was nice. Didn't try any of the other places to eat, as there are so many other places around the hotel. The bar was about average on price, it had a relaxing atmosphere about it.I would stay here again.

<Content>convenient clean and friendly We had seven nights at Park Inn. We found it a wonderful hotel - very convenient to public transport - and shopping. Good food - and lots of cafe's nearby. We enjoyed being able to walk to lots of different parts of the city. The room was small and the clear shower was a bit strange but it was so clean and comfortable we managed. The staff was so friendly - and especially as we were from Australia and did not speak the language.

<Content>Good Hotel, in a good Location On my first visit to Germany, earlier in the year ( May-2008 ) I stayed two nights in this Hotel. I understand it was originally an East German Hotel, but completely renovated. The room I was in was simply just about big enough for a single bed, with a toilet and separate shower, as reported on other reviews, both had frosted glass doors, so OK on your own no problem, but in a larger room, if you were shy could have been embarrassing...!!This was a room to sleep in no more, so not a big issue.It is in the heart of Alexanderplatz, with the U-Bahn and S-Bahn right on the doorstep, with a good selection of Restaurants and Bars within walking distance, indeed the walk up the Unter Den Linden, to the Brandenburg Gate passing some Historic sites on the way was no more than 30mins.The Bar in the Hotel was very pleasant, with a Piano playing, great to relax in, Breakfast was very good, if not a wee bit pricey ( 17 euros ) but filled you up for the day, very European rather than British/American, but hey it is Europe..!!I would go back to this Hotel, but if my wife was with me, I would certainly insist on a much larger room

<Content>seethrough shower! We had a very clean room on the 10th floor with a view of a large building site. The shower was lovely (rainforest head) but I didn't like the transparent toilet and shower cubicle. Staff friendly and helpful. Always a queue of available taxis at the front door 24/7. Surrounded by restaurants and fast food eateries if you don't fancy going far. Near to the S and U Bahn but we walked to all the tourist attractions.

<Content>Nice hotel with a good location. Perfect location in old East-Berlin with public transport just around the corner. Loved the hotel with friendly and smiling staff, good breakfast with a large selection of food. We got a nice, clean room on 21st floor with a great view to the TV tower. I was aware of the situation with the bathroom in the bedroom, so that was no surprice to us. Would stay there again.

<Content>Good base We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel is very clean and the staff are good. It was a great base with the Underground station outside. yYu feel that it's certainly in the East Berlin side, with very functional buildings around this stark and huge plaza.Little cafes, for breakfast and the Galleria shopping centre are outside hotel. The breakfast is expensive in the hotel, and the cafes are fine for a croissant or a roll and coffee.The beds are most comfortable, and the bathroom fine, if you're staying with your partner!The Kilkenny Irish pub is close by in the Hackescher Markt station. Look out for the following restaurants:Mutter Hoppe on Rathaustrasse 21, and Brauhaus Lemke in Hackescher Markt. For a snack, buy a bratwurst for a euro on Alexanderplatz!

<Content>Great room, great staaf, great breakfast Park Inn is a old skyscraper from GDR times which has been completely renovated. Rooms are quiet small but very nicely done, in a modern way! We had a stunning view over Berlin and just that was actually worth the price. Breakfast is wonderful with a lot of choices, but a bit crowded due to very many bus tourists. Staff are friendly and very helpful.

<Content>Perfect Location! This was our second stay in Berlin and when I booked I wanted something ultra-easy to get to from the airport. This couldn't have been easier. 22 minutes on the Airport Express and the hotel is straight across from Alexanderplatz S-Bahn station. We got checked in immediately and we were hitting the town within minutes. We didn't book breakfast but it was easy to stock up in the large department store opposite the hotel. The room itself is pretty small but more than adequate. Plenty of space to put your clothes away. Bit of a strange setup with the bath and shower being in the middle of the room but not a big problem. We ventured up on the roof to see the sunset one evening. It's a gorgeous view but I don't know if I'd pay the 3 euros again - added to the 4 euros per beer I though it was a bit of a rip-off, especially when the terrace itself didn't look anywhere near as nice as the photos which advertised it...and it was baltic up there!!!All in all we had a great experience with this hotel and the location was second to none with the whole of Berlin a few steps away from the door due to the excellent transport they have in city.

<Content>Mixed Feelings The location is great. The 1st room they assigned me was a suite that had faux backlit panels instead of windows. I changed into a tiny room but at least it had a window. There were no drawers and the only shelf was filled with minibar stuff so I had to put those on the floor so I could put my clothes somewhere. In the bathroom there is no place to hang your used towel which makes the 鈥淧lease decide for yourself鈥?notice fatuous. Hanger space is very small. 5 hangers and your clothes are pressed against each other. Of course there is a minibar and the checker came in about 4 times in one morning. No kettle, no couch, no luggage rack. I had to stuff the suitcase under the writing desk. Luckily it just fit. The room aircon was a strange metal plate hanging off the ceiling which was cool to the touch but did nothing for the room. Service is where the hotel shines. For a very busy hotel the reception staff is efficient and friendly. When I asked for an iron and 2 pillows I had barely put down the phone when they arrived. Internet speed was lightning fast. So don鈥檛 expect to put up your feet and relax in your room. But you will not be waiting around for service when you request it. The breakfast is in total contrast to the room, ie very ample, with a huge tea selection and good egg chef.

<Content>Good for business The hotel was excellently situated in Alexanderplatz, which made it convenient to get too and was so tall that it was very easy to find (and find your way back to). The Panorama Terrace on the 39th Floor (3 Euros entry and open to non-residents) is a must for great views over Berlin. The room itself was your average high-class business hotel, although internet access was very expensive. Staff were friendly and helpful.One complaint we did have was with the cleaning staff, who even though we hung out the 'Do Not Disturb' sign (we'd been out clubbing), still rang the room to ask if we wanted it cleaned! On Monday, the day we checked out, they tried to get in a 8 a.m. to clean as we'd forgotten to hang out the sign!

<Content>Great Location This hotel is a great base to explore on foot all of the main sights Berlin has to offer. Great views over the City, well laid out, tidy and smart/modern bedrooms with all the amenities you would expect. Bathrooms could be a concern for some as only have glass doors so you can see out whilist showering or using the toliet! I had a great time here however and would recommend for couples and lone business travelers.

<Content>Great experience, fab hotel and location!!! My friend and I got back from Berlin 2 days ago and stayed in the Park Inn, Alexanderplatz. Bristol to Schoenefeld with Easyjet was convenient and when we got to Berlin it was a 40 minute train ride (Euro2.80) to Mitte. Park Inn was located literally as you come out of the station. I would say it is the equivalent to a Hilton. Room was clean and spacious enough and had everything in you need. Only weird thing is the wall and door separating the shower and toilet is made of glass so you can see and hear everything. We overcome this by making sure the TV was on everytime we went to the toilet. The breakfast was superb. We never had to queue to be seated or served. There was hot and cold food and such variety. I would recommend having the breakfast if you are staying here. The hotel is in a fantastic location for everything. The 1 hour boat tour and hop on /off bus tour is worth it. We took a coach to Potsdam/San Succi, which is recommended. Public transport is efficient and cheap. There are loads of restaurants and coffee shops around the hotel and in Berlin. Ristorante Romantica behind the hotel does great pizza鈥檚. We did Berlin in 3 days and we feel we did it all.

<Content>Great Value My girlfriend and I were most impressed by the Park Inn Alexanderplatz. The location is superb, right on the square and a stones throw from every type of public transport imaginable. Getting to the hotel from Shoenefeld Airport couldn't have been simpler (arriving at night, we could see the hotel through the windows of the train even from the stop prior to Alexanderplatz Station).We had requested an upper west facing room, and that is exactly what we were provided with. The lift at the hotel took no time at all to shoot us up to the 26th floor, and the view upon opening the curtains was fantastic, as we gazed upon the Fernsehturm and down towards the Reichstag in the distance.We were very pleased with the room itself. Admittedly, it was quite small, but the ergonomics of the room mean that you don't feel cramped. The bathroom facility layout is a little out of the ordinary, in that there is no bath 'room' as such, simply glass partitions between the toilet, shower and sink. I wouldn't fancy sharing a room with the boss or someone I was not intimately acquainted with, as the partitions leave very little to the imagination. Still, the duvets on the comfortable bed were fantastic, and there was a nice flat screen tv and minibar in the room, and plenty of storage space.Although there is not a massive amount of nightlife on Alex Square itself (possibly due to its rather irregular communist era layout), the hotel is a ten minute walk from the lively bar and restaurant area of Hackescher Markt and a short U-Bahn ride away from the up and coming Prenzlauer Berg district. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel; there is a very nice Bistro next door to the hotel on the square that offers reasonably priced breakfasts. We took breakfast on one ocassion in the revolving restaurant at the top of the Fernsehturm. The food was standard fare, although I would certainly recommend it for the commanding views over the city, although get there prior to 9am, before the queues become prohibitively long.All in all, Berlin is a great city, and the Park Inn Alexanderplatz provided us with an excellent base from which to enjoy our stay.

The hotel is an old building but has been renovated so that the rooms are very modern and smart. There are good views across the city, and it is a very good location. I preferred being based at the centre of Alexanderplatz because it is so close to the older areas of Berlin. Easy walking distance to the Unter den Linden area with it's museums, cathedral and of course the Brandenburg gate and Reichstag. It is also not far to Hackescher Markt and the Tiergarten. From the Berlin hauptbahnhof either take the city S-bahn trains to alexanderplatz, or walk along the river to Alexanderplatz.The hotel was very neat and clean, relatively busy and the rooms were well looked after. There wasn't too much noise from the city, and the room was spacious and smart. Definitely recommended for people who prefer to stay in larger hotels or chains and want a predictable base for their visit to Germany's capital.

<Content>Nice hotel overall The hotel is extremely close to all parts of the city because of its proximity to the S and U-Bahn station a few minutes away. It is a twenty minute walk to Brandenburg gate. The area around it is bustling during the day as Alexanderplatz is a large square and the hotel is right across from a huge department store. The room was small (typical European fashion) but everything seemed new and updated inside. You have to pay for Internet access as we found common in many places we stayed in Germany. Personally I thought the area of Berlin that was west Berlin was prettier than east Berlin (where the Park Inn is located), so if I was returning to Berlin I鈥檇 stay there, but overall we liked this hotel.

<Content>Park Inn "Hotel" I strongly recommend you to go somewhere else if you can. It was the first time in my entire life that I went to a hotel that didn't have a proper bathroom. There is no proper wall between the shower and toilet and the rest of the room. From the aesthetic point of view it's awful.These are my wife's comments. I pretty much agree with them, though personally I think that the lack of auditory privacy is more of a problem. I also found the beds (two single beds together) far too soft, though that's obviously a personal preference. Worse, in my mind, is the fact that a clear space between the two mattresses therefore opens up, because of their softness. We've become accustomed to the two single mattress situation in hotels in Germany and the Czech Republic but this is the first time we've experienced a problem.We booked a business class room, and the hotel management have assured us (twice) that this is the room that in fact we've got. The only difference appears to be that we have marble floors in the shower and a rain shower. But the room couldn't be any smaller and our view is over the building site, rather than over the more picturesque view that (fortunately for us) appears on the photograph facing the bed. Business-class rooms are supposed to have tea and coffee; we had to request that service, but there's almost no room to put the hot water heater.The hotel does indeed provide internet service (which is what I'm using right now), but you should know that (unlike in the other hotels in which we've stayed during this trip) to use it costs 6.5 euros per hour or 18 for 24 hours.To be fair, the room itself (though very small) is clean and functional (if you don't care about privacy). But our bet is that you can do much better in Berlin than stay here.

<Content>Good location and Value for money Stayed here for a weekend in July. Hotel was good value for money, and nicely located at Alexander platz. S Bahn is very close by as are shops and restaurants. You can walk to Brandenburg gate if you dont mind a long walk (but enjoyable). Rooms are clean and confortable. I did not take breakfast in the hotel, since there is a nice cafe/restaurant adjoining the hotel on Alexanderplatz and breakfast there is half the price. Hotel is easy to spot, since it is the talled buolding the area.

<Content>don't stay there! I encountered two big problems:a. more than one week has passed since check-out and 417 euros are still blocked on my card. The necessary payment has been made but this amount (which is more than what has already been charged) is still blocked. I called the hotel 5 times already, they say it will be solved, but nothing changes. They never say anywhere that some amount will be blocked on your card for weeks after the check-out.b. toilets are awful! they are transparent! if you are staying as a couple, you will have no privacy - you need to know that you will see each other in the toilet and while taking shower.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I stayed at this hotel for a friend's hen weekend, and was very impressed. It is easy to get to the hotel from the airport, and is in an ideal location for shops, bars etc.The rooms were fairly small (without being cramped) but had everything you need. The bathroom was cleverly designed with glass walls to make the room look more spacious - but there is a curtain to draw around the glass!!The buffet breakfast was the biggest I have ever seen, and all the food was of exceptional quality.The only thing I could find fault with was the shower, which kept going hot and cold. Other than that, the Park Inn is a fantastic hotel to stay in.

<Content>Took a chance with the location and we're so happy we did! My boyfriend and I stayed for a week at the end of May 2007. I was attending a conference at the International Congress Center on the west side of town and originally wanted to stay closer to the conference site, but a little online research and some comments from relatives who live in Germany and visit Berlin frequently, convinced me that the east side of town is a little more up-and-coming. We found that to be true, and we couldn't have been happier with our decision to stay at the Park Inn. It's location is fantastic. The Alexanderplatz station makes it convenient to get anywhere in town via subway or train. Just a short walk north of the hotel puts you in an area full of cute, modern restaurants and bars. Head west one stop on the S line to Hackescher Markt, and the plaza is full of restaurants with outdoor seating. From this location you can find a nice compromise between accessing touristy stuff and wandering into quaint, off the beaten track restaurants and bars. The hotel itself was fine. The room was a bit small, by American standards, but well appointed for Europe. It was clean, and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom would definitely be an issue if you are sharing the room with someone and want more privacy, but if it's you alone or you are with a loved one, it's fine. Our air conditioning didn't work particularly well, but the weather was nice enough that we could open the windows. The view from the top of the hotel is nice, although you have to pay a small fee to access it.In the end, we were extremely pleased with our stay at the Park Inn and would go back again.

<Content>Alexanderplatz is the place to be! We spent three nights at this hotel from 13th to 16th June. We chose it for its good location(near to many major sights) and for the good local transport to be found right near the hotel, taking you all across Berlin and to the various airports.The hotel is in the middle of a big shopping area and is opposite the famous television tower. Yes, it is a big hotel but we found the staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 16th floor with a lovely view over the square and tower. Everything was very modern and yes, the bathroom is a little strange, but it was a very comfortable room and the only down side is once again the lack of storage space. There was a good wardrobe but no drawer space - you can't hang everything in a wardrobe! Ask for a room overlooking the shopping square. If you get one on the side of the main entrance you'll be looking at a building site. Note that Berlin seems to be one big building site as construction work is going on everywhere you look.We had breakfast included and there was a lot of choice on offer, mainly cold dishes, but a few warm ones too. It was all very tasty but you obviously need to get a deal with breakfast included. I would never do otherwise.In the evening the hotel offered a very good buffet of starters, main courses, salads, desserts and cheese - as much as you wanted for 19 Euros! I think this was a bargain in a capital city.Sightseeing tours leave from opposite the main entrance and take you past the main sights in Berlin and as it's a big city it's worth doing on your first visit to Berlin.We were pleased with the overall service in this hotel and would certainly consider going again.

<Content>Perfect location, lovely rooms, great value Park-Inn Alexanderplatz has recently been renovated, and they have done a marvellous job. The rooms are small, more like cabins, but elegant and practical. My room had a view to the Alexanderplatz itself, with the old tv-tower from DDR. This TV-tower is a landmark, and it's so tall that you are able to make it back to the hotel from any part of Berlin. And the location is excellent - walking distance to Hackesche Markt with all the bars and shops, not to far to walk to Brandenburger Tor etc, and only a short taxi ride to Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg. It wasn't very expensive either, so I will definitely stay here next time I go to Berlin.

<Content>Good hotel Stayed in the hotel for five nights in April and found it an excellent modern well run hotel. Location was excellent with friendly and helpful front of house staff. Our room which was cleaned daily was comfortable, although the view was onto a rather large building site although this should be gone in a few months. Bathroom privacy could be a problem with some people as only a curtain and some slightly opaque glass seperated the bed and washing areas from the toilet.Breakfast was not included in the room price and was on the expensive side however the food-hall in the Kaufhof Department store just across the street served an excellent cheap breakfast.All in all the hotel was very good value for money.

<Content>A mature view We visited the hotel in early May as part of a group travelling through Germany on the railways. Vast difference of expectations within our group - we were happy with our room (which did have a bath), but it was not acceptable for some of our group who were mature  well travelled. The configuration of the rooms (bath/shower curtained off from the bedroom) was quite unacceptable for mature couples and friends sharing.On the plus side - the position was great - public transport excellent - even the Berlin Tour Bus picked up at the hotel.The hotel was next door to the SBan train station.Breakfast was OK (we have travelled extensively and judge a hotel by it's breakfast )- so even though this was pretty good, it was not excellent.The great recommendation was the service - our TV reception broke down at 17.00 on Sat evening - and reception could not fix it. We had almost accepted that we were going to give up - but the maintenance guy called in - diagnosed the problem and disppeared at 5pm on a bank holiday Saturday. We assumed that was it for the weekend - but 50 mins later, he knocked on the door with the required replacement part. In the UK - you would undoubtable have been left until after the weekend.Full marks to the hotel for service.One black mark - In the bar I paid 16.50 Euros for a large glass of red wine described as 'Californian'by the waitress which at the current exchange rate was approx. 拢12. The price was not offered when I ordered, and the following day I checked the price list which proved it was correct. However - I still feel cheated. Do not discount this hotel - we travelled as part of a pre-booked group, and found the whole service excellent.Give it a try.Judith/Mike

<Content>Don't Stay Here!!! At first I was happy with my stay until a the last night before my departure from Berlin when I could not withdraw any money from my account! It turns out that the hotel blocks the amount of money of your stay PLUS a 100 euros for the mini bar in your account WITHOUT telling you!! The problem is that I specifically asked when checking in if any money will be deducted from my card and they said NO. So You can imagine when I was shocked that 750 dollars had disappeared from my checking account during my stay there. The hotel not only didn't realize the severity of the problem that this may create for some travelers, especially if one is traveling alone... but they also proceeded to NOT compensate me for even one nights stay or offer to make my stay more pleasant. Not only these things happened to me during my stay but my friends bathroom flooded his room and the hotel was not so keen on the idea of him changing rooms even though his entire carpet floor was soaking wet! In all , you pay for the location, so don't expect anything special at this hotel.... just a cheap room with a good view. Overall, unpleasant experience.

<Content>I was surprised to find I loved this hotel! This hotel was a real surprise to me. On first sight, I thought, Oh, no! It looked like one of those Communist mega hotels, and indeed it is in Alexanderplatz which Honecker intended as a DDR showpiece of Stalinist architecture. I only agreed to stay because it was almost the only place with room over the bank holiday. (Once again, I thought Oh, no! what's the problem with it?)But - I was so surprised. I really liked it and would return again. Our room was on the 11th floor, a reasonable size, modern and well fitted in dark brown and chrome. It was very clean and the beds were very comforatble. Towels were nice and toiletries smelt good although they weren't well known brands. We paid 18 Euros for 2 to have breakfast but others seem to have paid 18 Euros each? Maybe we got a bargain or they paid too much ?? But anyway check the price and I can assure you it was really excellent, with a huge choice of items. It included 3 types of scrambled egg, Nuremberger sausages, yogurt meusli, little pastry cases to put jam in, lots of different types of bread and rolls, cakes, salads, cheese, fruit - including passion fruit and other exotics, lots of different types of tea, and more. We made a point of eating a large breakfast so we didn't have to have much lunch. By the way, there are 2 breakfast places. One is a sort of ocean liner type dining room, which is quite grand, the other is in the bar downstairs which we preferred because it was bright and (when the sun shone) sunny and in our view had more interesting food. I don't think they give you a choice of breakfast room after your room is allocated - so check this at the time of booking. The hotel was very well soundproofed and quiet, despite being so large. There is a concierge, which was a plus. The reading lights were good, with an extra LCD light on a stalk attached to each one so you didn't have to keep your partner awake while reading. There is a safe and mini bar, etc. Theres also a wellness centre with massages which I didn't use so can't comment on.  One reviewer commented on the disconcerting frosted glass in the shower and toilet. This is true but you can pull a curtain around to conceal the blurred sight of your room-mate showering or sitting on the toilet. There is a separate shower and toilet, which to me was a plus. No bath, though. Alexanderplatz is not beautiful but it is quite a lively square and right across from the hotel is a huge and good 6 storey department store which also has a food hall. The U2 underground line is steps away, and you're in walking distance of Hackischer Markt - a fascinating older area of Berlin with loads of good restaurants. You can also walk to many places of interest, although be warned, places in Berlin seem to be very spread out and there's always lots of walking.  One evening we had a buffet supper in the hotel, that was 19 euros each and once again a huge variety, it's not that exciting to eat in the hotel when Berlin has so many unusual restaurants but it suited us well since we were tired and didn't want to go out.  I read from a guidebook that the hotel had some rooms which were not renovated,but this may have changed by now. That is probably something else to check in advance. We felt it was good value for money. As it is a very large hotel you do run the risk of having to wait at busy times to check in and check out. I didn't find the staff either good or bad, they were just people doing their job and quite polite about it.

<Content>Park InnTastic We booked the Park Inn Berlin via a no frils UK airline, we checked the hotel's web-site pre -travel  liked what we saw but the reviews were mixed so we traveled with some trepidation. What a contrast to what we expected, it is so easy to get to, being on the main line from the airport with the station being 200 meters from the hotels doors. The locationn of the hotel could not be better for getting around the main sights of Berlin. The hotel is an impressive 37 floors being the largest hotel in berlin but is nestled under the massive TV Tower which is one of the main Berlin sights  only 500 meters away. We were told that there was a computer convention on the day we arrived  had been allocated the last room of the the day at 10pm (our hearts sank) but we had been allocated a suite,  what a suite it was. Recently re-furbished  fantastic quality, with a state of the art open plan bathroom with plate glass windows between the bath  the living room, a bit strange but quirky  great fun. We had a well stocked mini bar, LCD TV, bath robes, slippers, clean towels every day, spotlessly clean, quiet when it needed to be  enhanced by friendly helpful staff. The whole area is surrounded by restaurants, bars  shops so eating in  out of the hotel was not a problem. The hotel boast its own sauna  fitness center, casino, bars, roof terrace (with amazing views)  ajoining restaurant cafe. Booking out was 12 mid day  they have a secure baggage store to leave your suitcases all day if you still have time to roam before flying. If you are visiting Berlin  looking for a suitable hotel or have already booked this hotel, pleae rest assured that going to the Park Inn hotel Alexanderplatz is a top choice  I will amazed if you don't love it.

<Content>excellant hotel Just back from the park inn. beautiful hotel, central location ,very clean. we booked with otel.com our breakfast was included , this was self service restaurant on the second floor lots to eat fruit cereals , breads, meat, eggs and lots more. The toilet and shower situation is not good, you would want to be there with someone you knew well. rooms were cleaned every day .bed was very comfortable. no noise from outside as we were on the 27 floor. the area outside the hotel is lovely lots of stalls with food and beer There was live music playing there on the saturday afternoon. lots of people sitting around enjoying a beer and the sunshine. there is a lovely restaurant accross the road called Escados we went there twice. Overall berlin is wonderful and so is the park inn.Thanks to all those who recommended it on this site

<Content>Central hotel The Park Inn is a high rise hotel right beside Alexanderplatz in the heart of Berlin. The location is excellent for a visit to Berlin. The standard rooms are very small but fine for 2 people. Our room was very clean, very nicely furnished and up to date. Our room was on the 19th floor overlooking Alexanderplatz so we had a great view.The Alexanderplatz station (train and metro)is only a minutes walk from the hotel so you can go anywhere in the city very quickly.The restaurant at the hotel is nice but we found it expensive so we only had breakfast there once and ate out the rest of the time. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance to choose from.The staff were friendly enough but very busy so it was hard to talk to them and when you did they were in a bit of a hurry.Overall I would say this hotel is good for a short break to visit the city whether on buisness or pleasure but I wouldn't recommend it for a relaxing luxury holiday

<Content>Very comfortable and convenient hotel We stayed at the Park Inn a couple of weeks ago and the hotel was close to train station and buses with easy access to everywhere. We were on the 19th floor which had been completely refurbished (quite recently it appeared) and the room was adequate and very comfortable. The only drawback was one assistant on the concierge desk and as it is a very busy hotel one had to wait some while for attention. The staff are however very helpful.

<Content>Amazing view, but different classes of guests I stayed 8 nights at the Park Inn. It is Berlin's biggest hotel - and you feel it, at latest when you try to make your way thru the lobby full of package tourists. A couple of points to note:- You can get a much more decent rate when booking through a reseller like Hotelclub.com (I paid 86鈧?per night w/breakfast, compared with 100鈧?upwards without breakfast on the hotel website).- They seem to categorize their customers by how much they pay for the room and give them according room cards with different colors. If you get an orange card (the best you can get!), you can choose your breakfast restaurant (there are two) and get for free in the sauna. With a white card, you will be refused entry to the ground floor breakfast location (Spagos) and will have to pay 5鈧?to get into the sauna. If you have a blue card, no breakfast for you.- Ask for a high floor room facing the TV tower. I got a room on the 20th floor, it was just great. The room itself was smallish, but modernly and smartly furbished. And the view is great, anyway.- The Spagos restaurant is terribly expensive. 15鈧?for a platter of spaghetti (even with beef stripes), that's impressive! Look around, there are plenty of places to eat out for much less.- The wellness/sauna is nothing special from my point of view.- The concierge was, let's say, avergage -- she did not even have a city map!

<Content>Great Location The hotel is in a great location and we had a great view as we were on the 21st floor. The bathroom is somewhat unique and as mentioned in previous reviews; it does lack privacy. I used the shower on the first night and due to a blockage in the drain it actually flooded quite a large area of our room. The cleaners were great and came up within 5mins to deal with it. However due to the carpet getting rather damp it did smell, but again the staff were great and when we returned to our room it smelt fresh and clean. On our departure we informed reception of the incident and they knocked 20% off for the first nights stay.I would stay here again as the location is great and the room is a good size for a European hotel. My only negative comment would be that the hotel has a roof terrace which is a big selling point when booking the hotel, but they actually charge hotel guests to use the terrace :(

<Content>Amazing Views A superb hotel.The rooms are very modern and very stylish. Perfect for a romantic getaway although the shower/toilet arrangements may not suit all. The service was great with the staff were always looking to help.The location to Alexanderplatz train station,tourist sites and shopping centres could not be better. Everything is at your finger tips.If you can get a room facing the tv tower then you have the perfect view from a wonderful room.

<Content>Spoiled by The Adina Stayed for 3 nights in Feb. Second time to Berlin and couldn't decide which hotel so we split the trip. Loved the location! The hotel was nice enough. Asked in advance for a room with a view--not. Low floor and a construction view. Paid for a business class room and was given what I believe was a regular room and was told that to have a room with more windows would be 20 more a night. The amenities for my type of room were also non existent. Their website does not list 2 types of business rooms. Also asked to use a computer to check our flight and was told it would be 8 e.The Adina really spoiled us--very friendly staff. The Park Inn let us check in early, but acted like they were doing us a Huge favor. We would have been happy to store our luggage if we could have got the room we paid for. Also very sneaky during check in asked if we wanted breakfast which they would have added to our rate--yet didn't say that it would be extra till we asked about it.The Park Inn is lucky it is in such a great convienent area otherwise I think it would be lower on tripadvisor .

<Content>Excellent stay!! My husband  I stayed at the Park Inn for 2 nights at the beginning of March. Travelled to Alexanderplatz from Schonefeld Airport via the airport express. Take platform 3-4 and look for the green S sign as it's not immediately obvious. Bought a Berlin travelcard which allowed us to travel throughout the city which was very good price of 24.50euros for 72 hour pass.We arrived at the hotel at 10.30am before the check in time and we were allowed in to our room straight away. Had a room on the 30th floor with a superb view, overlooking the city  the TV tower. Room was very clean  a good size (for only staying for a short break). The bathroom area was fun and power shower was brilliant. Continental/American buffet style breakfast was very good. Very helpful staff.The hotel was in an excellent location for all tourist sightseeing. Galleria Kaufhof is right next door (like a House of Frazer type store). The Alexa shopping centre is also very good, which is across the square. Also along Friedrichstrase there are a couple of shopping centres which are good too!! Tip - If going to the Reichstag, then get there early or when it opens - we got there about 11am and we had to queue for an hour.Overall had a lovely stay at the Park Inn and would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Six of us (3 couples) stayed in this hotel for two nights from Feb 26th-28th. The tallest hotel in Berlin is located right on Alexandra Platz and is situated directly across from the train station which makes it that bit easier to find your bearings. We had absoloutely no problems with check-in. We actually checked in 3 hours before check-in time and we all got our rooms straight away. We all stayed on the 14th floor which provided us with a beautiful view of the city. The rooms themselves are extremely clean and are a comfortable size for two guests.The shower is definately a little more intimate than other hotels I've stayed in (from top to bottom its all made of glass). I'd definately recommend this hotel for a nice break away in this beautiful historically drenched city!

<Content>Great Hotel in a superb location stayed here with my husband on a last minute deal for a couple of nights - paid only 拢118 through hotelsclick for 2 nights BB.Hotel is in a great location for transport links throughout the city - it is a 2 minute walk from alexanderplatz train station from where you can get trains to just about anywere you want to go!!!Room we had was on the 27th floor and we had a super view of the tv tower and the alexanderplatz - one point to note the room was stifling hot even with the window open and no matter how hard we tried we found no means of cooling the room down using the air conditioning!!! another point to note is that some of the walls are quite thin in the hotel - we were lucky we had really quiet neighbours but we did hear people comment that they were kept awake by a rather vocal lady being pleasured by her companion for most of the night if you get my drift - not exactly what I want to hear while on a short break!!!the bathroom we didnt find too much of a problem - but then we are married i guess!!! ours offered quite a bit of privacy with frosted glass right to the roof of both cubicles so not too sure what the other rooms are like - - only comment i have to make is why do other hotel guests insist on slamming their room doors at all hours of the day and night - the doors of most hotel rooms are on self closing hinges so you dont need to slam them after you - show some respect for others who may have arrived on early fligths or leaving on early flights please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Breakfast was great with a huge selection of cereals, cold meats, fruit, breads, cooked items - you certainly will not go hungry - it kept us filled up for a good part of the day so if you can do try to get a deal with breakfast included - if not there are burger king, mcdonalds, dunkin donuts, subway and various others within 5 minutes walk so you wont starve!!!Good little restaurant and bar just as you leave the back entrance to the hotel onto alexanderplatz - it is a little pricey for drinks though - we paid almost 5 euro for a large beer and discovered that an equally quaint little bar in the train station ( i know it sounds crap but trust me all the locals drink there!!!) served the same beer for only 拢 euro - have a guess where we spent some time????anyway for me it was a nice city but i wouldnt go back again - i just dont enjoy trawling museums all day and thats anout all there is to do - i would highly reccommend the hotel for its location and the breakfast - we didn't have to wait to check in as described by many others on here - we had our room at 10.30 am so maybe we just got lucky!!!!anyway if you get a good deal then go and enjoy the beer - its fab!!

<Content>Berlin from a height I stayed in the hotel in Feb with 3 other women. We asked about the possibility of having rooms on the same floor or nextdoor. No was the impolite answer - no reason given - just couldn't be bothered!! Other than that, it was a great hotel, fabulous location in east berlin. Rooms a bit tight and the bathrooms were very intimate. Not ideal for a first date. The breakfast was very good and the bar at night lively enough. Great big couch to sit on and you can take off your shoes. Great after a long day queueing etc to see the sights. Really good location. Train station, underground train, tram and buses just outside on alexanderplatz. Get tickets at hotel from the concierge who has great english. Also the 100 bus is great for all sight seeing. Tip - make sure to take the express train to schonfeld airport not the slow line. It's confusing and time consuming and you will need to change twice. Oh and the galeria on the square is a hugh 5 floor department store worth a visit.

<Content>Nice stay in the Park Inn Alexanderplatz Alright, bad news first: if you have some need for privacy, this is not the hotel you wanna stay: there is no walls separating the room from the bath; there is just a glasswall between them. Further more, the hotel is tremendously big, you just can't believe it. There is 42 floors, with a non sense number of rooms in which one of them. That aside, the hotel is great. The staff is very friendly, the breakfast is very good, the room was nice and clean. If you stay there, you gotta go to a small restaurant in the neighbourhood called Pizzeria Romantica. Ask for a waiter called TTony and you'll get a great food, with an unmatchabled wait service for an absolutely ridiculous price.

<Content>Amazing Experience Park Inn Berlin Alexanderplatz is a wonderful hotel. It's a real treat. The location is absolutely PERFECT-easy to get to, day or night. As central as you can get! The hotel room was a bit small, but had excellent views over Alexanderplatz and the TV tower. The breakfast was incredible-best choice of food I've ever seen in a hotel. Coming from Ireland, the height of the hotel was really exciting. Would really reccommend this hotel!

<Content>Best hotel ever, best breakfast and superb staff We stayed at this hotel 3 nights in january. It was superb. We ordered the hotel through hotelsclick.com and payed 500 euro for two doubleroom friday-monday included breakfast.. I upgraded the room directly by caliing the hotel for 20 euro pr night. The room was upgradet to panorama wiew witch meens that you have a panorama room with two windows on a corner. This room is bigger than the other ones and also includes a bath tub. I askes for a coffee and teamaker and that was brought up to the room. Everything was perfect. The location is superb.Breakfast was the best i have even seen. The best variety of breakfast i have ever seen at a hotel ever. The cleaning of the room was great. The roomservice from the restaurant was extremely good. We ordered clubsandwich, pizza, french fries and two coke for the price of 40 euro. Enough for 3-4 people:)I would recommend this hotel for everyoneBut keep out of the restaurant beside burger king at first floor. We were all sick after have dining there.Worst food ever..

<Content>Definately a 3 star hotel Have just got back from a weekend in Berlin and stayed at this hotel booked through lastminute.com which had it listed as a 4-star - it is definately not! The location (and the views) are excellent, and while we did a lot of walking, we had no problems navigating the underground either. The rooms are small, and as two single travellers, the bathroom set up wasn't the best, and because of that I wouldn't stay there again. The service was fine and we did use the Concierge a couple of times, but his recommendations were not that good to be honest.An Italian restaurant just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie called Sale E Tabacchi was recommended to us, and it was so good, we went there twice.

<Content>Excellent Excellent Excellent Stayed 3 nights in early Dec. What can we say except EXCELLENT. For such a big hotel the customer service is spot on. We arrived bleary eyed from Schonfeld via the airport express (鈧?.40pp) at 11am and were allowed check in to our room immediately. Rooms are a little small but everythings works extremely well. This hotel ticks all the boxes - location, price, facilities, cleanliness, great breakfasts- what more can I say?We booked thru hotel club.com and got a got deal- 鈧?0 per night including the excellent breakfast.Request a tower facing room for the best view and get as high a floor as is available.We ate at the Block House (8 min walk away) and had fab steaks at unbelievable value.Enjoy all the Xmas markets and remember your luggage allowance for the flight home!!!!!

<Content>City Break We were in Berlin for a short City Break. The main reason for our visit was to see the sights and to visit the Christmas Markets. The hotel was ideally located - right next to public transport but also within walking distance of lots of main attractions. Staff in the hotel were pleasant and helpful. Our room was on the 33rd floor and had a tremendous view right across the city. The rooms were well fitted and spotless. The beds were very comfortable. Don't let the toilet set-up put you off, it's really not as bad as you might imagine. We chose only to have breakfast on the last morning of our stay - it was lovely but a lot more expensive than in any of the many eating places which are nearby. I would definitely use this hotel again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as it is great value for money.

<Content>Excellent hotel in wonderful location I am so pleased I booked this hotel. My wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening and were met by extremely pleasant English speaking reception staff. Within a few minutes we were shot up to our room on the 28th Floor by an express elevator. (The speed is amazing) Our room faced the Fernsehturm and we had a beautiful view of the city below. Our business class room was very clean and welcoming. Many reviews here mention the quirky shower / toilet facility in the room but no one has actually mentioned how the thing works. The door is on a hinge that lets it swing 180 degrees which allows it to be the toilet door one moment and the shower door the next. Very ingenious indeed. Great Kaffee shop at the entrance to the hotel which is where we would get take away morning coffee as there are no facilities in room for hot drinks. The location is excellent being just across the road from Alexanderplatz station which has the S-Bahn and U-Bahn. There are also trams and buses and the travel round zones A and B is cheap and easy to work out. However we walked most places to soak up the atmosphere and you will be surprised how many markets you come across, they do it in a big way. We went primarily for the Christmas Markets and were not dissapointed at all. They are everywhere and the effort that is put into them is superb and made the trip very worthwhile. I could go on and on because we had such a fantastic experience but the bottom line is that this is a very clean, popular, busy well run hotel in a truly great location. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone I know. Final points to note; take a hat as it is very cold and beware they do not have the no smoking ban in public buildings yet and it seems that everyone smokes and avoid the minibar in your room. 2.90euro for a beer you can buy for 95cents in the Galleria shop opposite the hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, perfect location I've stayed here a number of times now, and it's always been the perfect place to stay in Berlin. Located right beside the Alexanderplatz train station, it's a short walk to most of the places of interest in Berlin.The hotel is always clean and comfortable. Yes, the bathrooms are a bit quirky, but if you're looking for value for money and a great location while in Berlin, you can't beat this hotel!

<Content>Great Place to Stay Just got back from Berlin. Had a great time! There were wonderful views from our hotel room. There is a Christmas market with an outdoor skating rink just outside the entrance of the hotel. They sell yummy Bratwurst, Currywurst etc. Don鈥檛 forget to try the Mulled wine, because you are going to need it, it is very cold at the moment in Berlin, colder than I was expecting, so wrap up warm. The hotel was lovely  the rooms very modern, the bath  toilet are a bit strange with the frosted glass, but there is a curtain you can use to maintain some privacy. The staff were very friendly  we didn鈥檛 have tea  coffee making facilities in the room but we requested some at reception  they brought it up to the room within minutes, we didn鈥檛 have to pay any extra for this. There are good transport facilities from the hotel, you can get the U-bahn/S-bahn near the hotel or the 100/200 bus from across the road which takes you to the zoo etc. Also if your travelling from Tegel airport just get the TXL bus which drops you off outside the hotel  costs 2.10 Euros鈥?each, you can buy tickets on the bus. Great location with lots of sights nearby within walking distance. Don鈥檛 forget to visit the Gendarmenmarkt, Christmas market as to me this is the best one in Berlin; you have to pay 1Euro each to get it but definitely worth it.

<Content>Superb!!!!!!!! We just came back yesterday from our trip to Berlin. The trip itself was great. We love Berlin. The hotel was superb. It is located central, near to the 'fernsehtur'. We had a room at the 34 floor, in the corner off the building. We had 2 windows . One looked out at the fernsehtur and the other to another part of the city. What a view, we almost could see the whole city. The room was superb too. It was very clean. We loved the bed. We had a bathroom with bath. Everything in the room looked new (except the television, but it worked fine and we didn't really use it).The room was cleaned everyday and provided with clean towels. The breakfast was great too. I loved the Kaiserbrotchen and the scrumbled egg. The only thing that I can mention as a minor point is, that the coffee was not strong enough. But that was no problem, because near the Fernsehtur there is a Starbucks (there is no better coffee then Starbucks-coffee). On our last day we went for the Spa. 20 euros for a massage and after that you can use the sauna and chill out as long as you like. It was great. All the major sightseeings are nearby the hotel. There is a subway-station in front of the hotel, that can bring you anywhere. The public transport in Berlin is great, also because it still goes at night. Overall I think there is no better place to stay in Berlin.

<Content>Love the Park Inn!! We have stayed in this hotel twice and find it excellent value. Great location beside a u bahn/s bahn station, excellent view from the rooms. We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. The breakfast is the best we've experienced in any hotel. There's no excuse to go hungry!! Would always return to this hotel.

<Content>Loved the View Just back from Park Inn Alexanderplatz ,this is a great hotel for a short break in Berlin.The hotel's location could not be better it is a 25 min walk to the Brandenberg gate and you are passing all other musems along the way.Our room was on the 32nd floor which gave us a fantastic view down unter van linden,we also had a great view of the berliner Fernsehturm tv tower.While the room 's are on the quirkey side,they are totally fuctional.The buffet breakfast was great and filled you up for your day of sight seeing.We would have no hesitation of staying here again.

<Content>good value and good location This hotel has an excellent location to the train and tour bus stops! this was a major plus since some of our day tours started very early in the morning. The run was overall clean. There is a lot of construction going on in the entire area. As it has been noted in some of the reviews the location of the shower is really out of place in the middle of the room. My only negative comment is that the front desk staff was not very friendly. It was like pulling wisdom teeth to get information. I ask to speak to the manager and she was not very helpful at all. We checked in late in the evening and no one had a smile on their face. I did notice that the morning crew was a lot more helpful. I will also note that the glasses in the room were questionably clean/unclean. My tip would be to grab some paper cups.

<Content>Cheap luxury on advance internet bookings We booked our room a few months ahead online and got it very cheap considering what a posh hotel it is, so we were very pleased! Our room was very quiet and clean. The only minor problem was that Berlin hotel cleaners seem to open the door fairly early in the morning to see whether you're in there or not, rather than just knocking! It's a great location, especially if you want to explore Mitte, the centre of former East Berlin, and is near major S-Bahn, U-Bahn and tram stops, lots of good restaurants and some kebab shops, and a big department store. It's a short walk from the Fernsehturm, the Marx and Engels monument, Under den Linden, Nikolaiviertel and various museums. But do go out for breakfast unless you're very rich.

<Content>Good location and comfortable I would concur with most other reviewers - great location particularly as you can access most S and U bahn lines to get you to most tourist spots but it is also walkable to most major attractions - 10 minutes to Berlin Catherdral - 5 minutes walk to bus stop for buses to the airport - between 20 - 30 minutes to Brandenburg gate, postdamer platz, berlin wall gallery, reichstag. There are also plenty of shops / cafes / snack bars and restuarants nearby to meet your needs (fast food, take aways, to chain restuarants, pizza places and german food places). We did not have a room rate with breakfast but there is a reasonable cafe at one of the hotel entrances (on square rather than main road side) next to a burger king, which save you money as we ate and drank there for about 5 euros and I think breakfast was at least double this at the hotel. There is a casino and a restuarant in the hotel but I did not try either of these out. I note people comments about the slowness of service at reception - we had a problem as we were allocated to two rooms which had not been cleaned and finally on the third try we got lucky! I was disappointed at the lack of apology but on realising that I had left paperwork in one of the rooms (which had since been cleaned) there were incredibly helpful and located the papers in the bin for me and returned them. We were on the 20th or 21st floor and the views were great and you could watch Berlin at your lesuire - this meant that noise was very minimal - we were at the end of the corridor and I was not disturbed by any noise from other guests which was great. Rooms were clean and comfortable and not massive and the bathrooms were fine although a little strange it was not as bad as I had anticipated - the curtain ensured privacy and the toilet was fine and separate which was good if you wanted to use the sink. Sometimes the lobby could be very busy - it is quiet small for such a big hotel and when people were gathering to meet it could be noisy and difficult to get to the lifts. Luggage can be left in safe storage until you depart.

<Content>Great base for exploring Berlin! Wow! What can I say, this is such a well-located hotel for exploring Berlin! It is located metres from both the S  U-Bahn's and Alexanderplatz seems to be a 'main' station for many of the lines in Berlin so you can get to most places without needing to change trains!I've just come back from Berlin after staying 4 nights in this hotel with my boyfriend and have to say we were both more than happy with it. We got a good service at reception, the concierge was very helpful and they can provide you with the Berlin WelcomeCard should you wish to use that whilst over there.We were on the 26th floor and had magnificent views!As others have mentioned, the toilet/shower facilities may be a touch different to what you expect but we were fine with the arrangement - for those that don't know, its an area within the bedroom that is sectioned off with frosted glass around it and so although you can't actually see the person, it may not be appropriate for those that don't know each other quite as well!Breakfast was included in our rate and it was quite a spread! Something for everyone! Yes it was busy, it's a big hotel at the end of the day, but not so much so that we couldn't find a table and there were many people working and they really were efficient at clearing tables etc!I genuinely can't think of any faults with the hotel, it delivered all we expected.We had a late arrival and this wasn't a problem with the hotel and also our flight home was not til early evening and they have an area where you can store your luggage safely until you need it which was at no charge.Overall, I think this hotel should definitely be considered to all those wanting to explore Berlin!

<Content>Impressive hotel - great for big groups Arrived late on a friday night having booked via the internet for 14 people. Because of the advance internet booking, we got a great rate for the hotel (97 Euros per night). However, this didn't include breakfast but that wasn't too much of a problem. I'd say buying breakfast separately is too expensive, especially when you can buy it round the corner for a better price. The hotel lobby staff were very polite and helpful and seemed to like working there. The hotel itself is fantastic - very new and modern looking with incredibly fast lifts. Although not very big, the rooms were along the same lines. They had the basics and were very comfortable. However, the cleaning staff seemed a bit too keen at getting into the room on a sunday (at 9am)!The bathroom situation is not as bad as some of the other reviews have made out. They are a bit strange (clear glass into the upper half of the shower cubicle  frosted glass toilet door) but there is a curtain to pull round the whole area. Even for those who don't know each other that well, it's not so bad. Probably the best features of the hotel are the view from the room window (assuming you're on a higher floor), the size of the hotel (it's easy to find), and the excellent location. It has to be in the best place for going out in the evening (restaurants, bars etc). I'd definitely stay here again and again if returning to Berlin!

<Content>Great Value Arrived early evening, first impressions very good, staff attentive efficient.Great location, room comfortable but not lavish but great views over the city (but it would depend on which floor your on)There's a casino on the top floor, however there's a dress code - I went up to have a look but it's no entry without a tie, no boots/trainers or jeans - I failed on all three countsBreakfast was a treat

<Content>Good value and Great breakfast Stayed there for 4 nights in mid-Sep. The room was small and facilities were basic. However, its location was unbeatable - reachable by all kinds of public transportation. Breakfast was impressive when compared to many 4-5 star hotels in Europe. Staff were generally friendly and professional.

<Content>Not all it's cracked up to be Moved to the Park Inn from the Mark Hotel, as could not get a booking for four nights, so had two nights in each. Reception was OK when we booked in, however noted long queues at other times, as limited desks for the size of the hotel. Stayed on 20th floor, good views, rooms small,and had bath in room which is very strange. Clean and pleasant, but nothing special. Didn't eat there, but were charged over 10 euro for a glass of red wine! In general hotel was OK but overpriced, we paid for one night and got one free from Radisson loyalty card, and paid a rate of 147 Euro, but heard people paying up to 190 Euro, not good value.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed for this hotel for three nights and I cannot fault it in any area. The location was excellent and the view from the bedroomwas unbelievable. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The rooms were clean and modern and the breakfasts were incredible. The choice available was excellent and the buffet style layout meant you could help yourself to as much or as little as you wanted. The bar and restaurant were also good with entertainment each evening. The only downside was the odd toilet and shower arrangements so it would be advisable just to be aware of this before booking. Having said that I believe that my stay in Germany would have been less enjoyable had I not chosen this hotel for my trip.

<Content>Disappointed We picked the hotel because we read it was convenient to everything and the reviews were good But Berlin is a sprawling city so this location was not as convenient as we had hope--Alexanderplatz is just too far from most tourist attractions. We would recommend being near the Sony Building and Potsdammer Plotz. Also, while our room was quiet and comfortable, everything was shoehorned in with the result that the shower was separated from the bed by a curtain and the toilet area was what I would described as a stall in terms of soundproofing. If you were by yourself it would be fine but otherwise....Also we asked for a tourist street map but the person we asked charged us 2 1/2 Euros.

<Content>Superb Hotel I recently stayed at the Park Inn for a 4 night stay. This was my first time to Berlin and I was so pleased with my choice of hotel. Location wise it is second to none, with Alexanderplatz S-Bahn and U-Bahn running from virtually your doorstep. I found our room to be excellent, we were lucky enough to get a corner room. It was cleaned thoroughly daily. Breakfast in the morning was a joy. There was always a huge choice and plenty of seating for everyone. You are also within walking distance of probably the best nightlife in the city. Using the excellent city map provided we navigated our way to Dirkenstrasse. This is a short stroll from the hotel and here you will find many bars and restaurants housed within the arches of the railway line which runs overhead. A must visit is the Lemke Brauhouse where you get to sample a selection of the local beers before selecting which one (or ones) you wish to have. Next door is Riva Bar where they have an amazing list of cocktails available. It is a little pricey (2 cocktails averaging 17 euro) but they are well worth it. Following the road right round you come to a small square where you'll find several more bars where you can sit outside or if you fancy a dance a must is AM to PM, more great cocktails and a jumping wee dancefloor. During the day the area is just as nice with loads of shops with favourites like Adidas, Hugo Boss as well as one off boutiques. Just strolling around you'll find and eclectic mix of shops and I'm sure spy a nice restaurant to come back to that night. If you are there to sightsee, it is all so accessible thanks to teh location. We travelled to the Reichstag, Jewish Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Zoo and Brandenburg Gate using the public transport. It was very punctual, clean and safe no matter what time of the day. Just dont forget to buy a ticket before you board and validate it at the wee machines next to the ticket machines. If you dont have one you will be fined 40 euro!! Highly recommended city and will always return to the Park Inn.

<Content>nice hotel good location This is a lovely hotel nicely located right in the hart of the city. I found that almost every thing in this hotel was very nice with the only possible exception being the staff at the front desk. The rooms are nicely appointed, very clean and have wonderful views. the location is great as it sits with in walking distance of many major attractions and right next to numerous public transpiration lines. This is certainly not the cheapest option in Berlin but if you can get a slightly discounted rate as we did it is well worth the money.

<Content>Good Location We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on a quick trip to Berlin. We were on the 26th floor and had a room looking towards all the major sites in Berlin, the view was fantastic.The hotel is very easy to get to from the airports. We landed at Tegal and caught the TXL bus straight to Alexanderplatz - fantastic value at 2.10EURO. If you have a day pass, this trip is included in it.Rooms are not huge and as mentioned the shower and the toliet are in little glass cubes, rather than in one separate bathroom. The room has a minibar and small fridge.Check in and check out was fast and friendly. We didn't use any of the other facilities at the hotel.

<Content>Great value and location Returned from a very pleasant seven night stay at Park Inn. We had a room on 29th floor with view to two directions. Room was fairly small in size but in perfect condition.Breakfast was sufficient. Have had better at other hotels but in overall it gave us a good start for the day as it was included in our relatively low price. Breakfast restaurant does get pretty loud and crowded but that is to be expected in hotel this size.The location is simply perfect for touring Berlin. Restaurants and shopping right next door. S- and U-bahn stations once you walk outside. Also many of the Berlin sites are within walking distance.TXL bus from Tegel airport stops right next to the hotel and there is car rental agency on street level.

<Content>Highly recommended The Park Inn is a star above its rating. Fantastic location, within easy reach of everything. 2 quick train rides (even around the midnight hours) from Schonefeld or Tegel Airports (or single bus for Tegel from the station just across the square). It seems to have been recently (and attractively) refurbished, so some complaints about the bathrooms may have been addressed.Overall, highly recommended!

<Content>Strange Shower Arrangements Stayed in this hotel recently. Situated in east Berlin right on the slightly seedy square . The hotel staff are very effecient and friendly. Food in the restaurant is reasonably priced and very good. The twin bedroom turned out to be a double with two duvets. The en suite consisted of a washhand basin in the room partitioned off from the shower and wc by semi-opaque glass - an astonishing arrangement which gives little or no privacy. Shy couples beware! Great views from the rooms don't really compensate.

<Content>Superb value, excellent room Stayed at the Park Inn Alexanderplatz in Feb 2007. Arrived at the hotel late at night (Around 30 Euros from Schoenefeld airport by taxi) and were checked in really promtly. First impressions were that it was a nice hotel, lobby with bar/restaurant looked very modern and newly refurbished.We asked to upgrade but were advsied not to as the room we had was also newly refurbished and so on a par with an upgrade so we decided not to. When we got up to the room we weren't disappointed. The room was quite a decent size and the fittings were very new. The bathroom also was a plus with a large walk-in rain shower. The only disappoinment was that we were on a lower floor so didn't have a great view.The TV tower which is a few minutes walk away through Alexanderplatz station and was well worth visiting for a drink and even breakfast/lunch/dinner as it was quite reasonable.Alexanderplatz station, aswell as having tube lines running to the former West Berlin, also has overland trains. These go to airport which we used on the way back for a few Euros each. They also run to the Hauptbahnhof, which is within walking distance of the Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag, aswell as West Berlin with a station opposite Berlin zoo making it the easiest way to get around. We bought a card to get around, which I can't remember what it was called, but cost about 鈧?0 each for a few days and included all travel on the metro/overland trains/buses and trams. It also included discounts on attractions.There are quite a few restaurants around the Park Inn and all are very resonable and really nice. Most seem to specialise in steak or italian food. Te hotel bar was a little pricey but had a good atmosphere and always seemed busy so was a good location for a drink.Although this hotel seems a bit isolated from West berlin there is plenty around it and public transport in Berlin is fantastic and so easy to find your way around. All the forms of transport around Berlin make it, what I think, is the most easy city to navigate that I've been to, so the fact that the park Inn is out of the way isn't an issue. Most of the travel routes seem to run to Alexanderplatz which is ideal.Overall the hotel was fantastic value for money and I would definitely look to stay there again when I go back. Its newly refurbished and has everything you could need.

<Content>Much Higher Quality Than Anticipated Came to the Park Inn expecting very little and was very pleasantly surprised. The rooms were of an excellent quality, very newly refurbished and modern. The bed was excellent and sheets crisp and white. The communal areas of the hotel were adequate although not lavish. The breakfast was of the usual German very high standards. Overall excellent VFM and i will be sure to return. A nice bit of trivia about the hotel as told to me by my guide on a tour of Red Berlin was that this hotel before the fall of the wall was probably one of the most bugged buildings in the whole of the GDR as this is where they would house visiting western diplomats.

<Content>Can confirm other reviews Stayed here for four nights in June. Ideal location if you fly into Schonefeld, as the airport express stops at the adjacent station. Alexanderplatz itself is fairly bland but the station affords easy access across the city. Reception friendly and efficient. Plenty lifts, good size and ear poppingly fast. Room smallish but fine. Comfy bed but strange double duvet approach. Toilet/shower unusual and only for close travelling companions. Good aircon, which was essential as it was 31 degrees.View we had was towards the TV tower and was excellent. Breakfast was buffet style and fine. We always went down after 9am and there was plenty space. My first trip to Berlin for 16 years and the developments in that time have been amazing. Will come back, although not in the heat of summer, and would certainly consider staying at the Park Inn.

<Content>excellent hotel, excellent location Stayed four nights from June 10. Excellent hotel with good service, very good value for money.Rooms are amazingly quiet and spotlessly clean. We asked for a room with a (great) view on the town and got it. Very good air conditioning control (handy if it is 32 degrees outside, as it was when we were there!) and the beds were excellent. Good breakfast buffet., which can be busy at certain times (hotel has around 1000 rooms), so just pick your times. Location is another of its assets, a 100 metres from Alexanderplatz station.

<Content>Great value for money Spent the last (extended) weekend of May in Berlin at the Hotel Park Inn Alexanderplatz and was quite pleased. Everything as I had expected according to reviews from TripAdvisor and even better. The room was nice/modern with a great view and everything very clean. Excellent breakfast buffet (incl in our price) served 麓till 10:30 (make sure you麓ve finished eating by then, 麓cause the lady with the vacuum cleaner comes marching in and starts vacuuming on the dot, wont find any crumbs on her floor... ). Though the hotel is big there is no lack of good service. Enjoyed eating at fancy Spagos on the ground floor, good food and service. Went to check on the view from the sun deck on the 37th floor, but they were closed due to strong winds, maybe next time.Found location to be good for different walking ventures; the river Spree with boat cruises, Berlin Dom and Museum Insel, Nikolaiviertel, Hackisher Markt (beware of pick pockets) and Oranienburgstrasse where we had a great 3 course dinner at the lovely restaurant Kadima (Jewish/Russian, non kosher) for 30 Euros pr person, excluding wine. Also recommend a good restaurant downtown on a sidestreet from Ku麓damm, Sachs at Knesebeckstrasse, definately the best dinner of our five day city-break.All in all, a good hotel which I can recommend and would consider staying at again, great value for money.

<Content>Fantastic Location We stayed here for 2 nights and absolutely loved it.It is a huge hotel 37 stories high anbd located at the historical Alexanderplatz with a Underground stop right outside. The rooms are quite small but very new with cool bathrooms and a great shower.Next door is a huge department store open til 7pm most nights. Burgerking and a few other cafes,and a beer garden is also downstairs. The included breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection although in a giant crowded resteraunt.The open top bus tour stops on the road opposite.I also had a swedish massage at the sauna gym area and was very impressed.We liked this hotel although it is huge and impersonal.

<Content>Good Choice We spent 3 nights in the Park Inn and were really happy with our choice. The room itself was small but contained all we needed. It was spotlessly clean. The bathrooms are quite funky and the rain shower is fab ! The beds were very comfortable. The rooms are pretty quiet, we were beside the lifts and heard very little noise.The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing. The train station is 2 mins away, Brandenburg gates are about 15 mins walk, passing some great sites (Dom, Babelplatz etc).The square itself is fine, based on some reviews I had been quite concerned but these concerns were unfounded. There are a number of shops in the square and lots of little bakeries in the train station which was great for breakfast.On one night, we headed to the Hackescher Markt area to eat and can highly recommend this area for food or a drink. Its a short walk or 1 stop on the S-Bahn from Alexanderplatz. Would also recommend the New Berlin free walking tour.Berlin is an amazing city and the Park Inn is a good base to explore it. We would return to this hotel.

<Content>Nice interior  I stayed here for 4 nights while in Berlin with work, and its a nice hotel and location is great if you want to see the museums.The rooms looks like they've been recently redecorated, and they are both clean and decorated nicely... its clear a bit of effort and thought went into the d茅cor. Having said that, it was a little odd that the bath/shower in our room had no wall, but a glass panel which was open to the room, but hey, open plan is great too.As the Park Inn is Berlin's tallest building, naturally the views are spectacular, although cleaning the windows more often would make this view more enjoyable. The hotel is in Alexander Platz, which is central and near a very convenient U-Bahn line that runs through the main tourist sites, although the square itself is soulless and lacking any charm. Plenty of shops in the nearby platz and in the Galleria Kaufhof behind the hotel. Check in/out was all very efficient, and the staff are very friendly. The hotel also has a terrace on the higher floors (Floor 39, I think) and is an excellent and relaxing place to have a quick drink in the evening before planning your night-life excursions.Having said that, if you are an English speaker, there is only 2 English channels available in the room (both news!)... some kind of satellite or cable choice would have been great, especially for a hotel that advertises itself as international. I was also very disappointed in the lack of wireless internet, although wired internet (via LAN cable) was available in the room, but at a ridiculous cost.Personally, I don't think expecting free or affordable in-room internet access to those who need it is unreasonable.Overall, a great place to stay for comfort and cost, but you could probably do better finding a hotel in more pleasant surroundings than the very drab Alexander Platz.A few tips when in Berlin: Give yourself plenty of time to explore the museums, but if time is limited, the Pergamon is a must if only for the Istar Gates of Ancient Babylon. Museums open until 10pm on Thursday and are free. Check Point Charlie is a little bit on the touristy side (the checkpoint itself isn't the original, just a mock up), but the museum next to it is quite good. If the weather is good, a stroll in the Tiergarten is a nice way to spend the afternoon. A day U-Bahn ticket is a great and very inexpensive way to get around, the U-Bahn (and S-Bahn's) are very safe and clean - if you want to go a little further outside Berlin, get the three zone ticket (Zones A, B,  C), its not much dearer.

<Content>Nice I have just returned from a 3 day trip to Berlin and a stay in the Park InnI arrived as part of a large group close to midnight yet check in was quick, efficient and accurate and I was in my room on the 16th floor in a matter of minutes. I am aware however that the coach that arrived at 2 found that although their rooms were pre paid (not just pre booked) ended up in a nearby 5 star hotel (at the Park Inns expense) because the Park Inn chose to overbook. Don't you just hate it when hotels do that?Anyway my room was very modern with a double bed (well 2 twins put together) and a small table by the window. Plenty of cupboard and hanging space and overall, a perfectly good room. As mentioned in other reviews the the glass walled shower does mean that you should only ever share one of these rooms if you are happy for the person you are sharing with seeing you naked in the shower.The room was served by wireless internet access for which there was a charge however as I use iPass I cannot tell you how much it would have cost but it did work fine.The mini bar was of the over flowing type by which I mean that there were other items such as bottles of water and crisps spread around the room which were all to be paid for if used. The cost of the minibar was not cheap although I don't think the words mini bar and cheap go together anywhere anyway.As the weather in Berlin was stunning this week (27 degrees) I spent some time up on the rooftop terrace on the 39th floor. It cost 鈧? to get in and did seem a bit makeshift but had a bar, music and deckchairs and the 2nd best view in Berlin (the first being the TV tower next door) so 鈧? was cheeky but a cost I was prepared to pay.Breakfast was however a joke.It is a large hotel and the breakfast area is large as well but there is no seating help so you just find yourself a table if you can. One morning, 2 of us spent the best part of 10 minutes walking around trying to find a table and some people were starting to argue about people taking their tables. This is plain daft and the hotel needs to do something about it.Transport from the hotel could not be better. It is right next the the station where you can get over ground trains, under ground trains, trams and busses. You can buy an all day ticket that covers the whole system for 鈧?.30 which offers fantastic value for money considering the trains were frequent and quick. I caught the over ground from the hotel to the ICC which is the other side of town and it took 25 minutes door to door. The same journey by taxi took 45 minutes.So overall a good hotel in a good location and I would be quite happy to stay their again if staying in Berlin.

<Content>Modern Hotel Near TV Tower This is a conveniently located hotel in East Berlin. There is a casino on the 37th floor. The rooms are modern, and make very efficient use of the space. The shower is completely enclosed with glass, and so you have a curtain to give you privacy from the rest of the hotel room. The rain shower, and underfloor heating in the bathrooms are great! There is a shopping center connected to the hotel. The breakfast buffet is adequate. Mass transit is located nearby. The one tourist attraction right next to the hotel is the TV Tower. You can go up to the observation deck of the TV Tower to view the city sites. Do not miss going up one floor from the observation deck to the revolving restaurant where the food is good, reasonably priced, and you can sit and enjoy the view as long as you want.

<Content>Great short break Excellent hotel. Took my wife here for an Anniversary break. Managed to book a junior suite - only 130 euros (less than 100 pounds) per night. Room was on 35th floor with great view of the tower.Room was very large with bed (Seemed to be twin beds pushed together athough bopoked as king suite!), minibar, chairs and a great flat screen TV.2 minutes walk from the AlexanderPlatz Sbahn and Ubahn stations.Great reception very friendly.Downside - limited menu and hours for roomservice. Our flight was delayed and we had hoped to get something at midnight - but nothing available

<Content>A great stay at the Park Inn Just returned from a four-night stay at the Park Inn. It was a wonderful hotel. It is huge, but everything runs very smoothly. The concierge and reception staff were very helpful. The breakfast was wonderful, even though it got crowded, supplies were replenished, coffee was always hot and on the table. Rooms were immaculate. The bathroom, as everyone mentions, takes some getting used to, but functions well. The rooms are on the small side, but we were sightseeing all day, and just slept in the room. I can't imagine any hotel being more convenient. You can walk to the cathedral, boat trips on the Spree, and museum island. Buses and trains are right outside the door as are two department stores. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel! Stayed here for three nights as the first part of our trip around northern Germany. If you are flying into Schonefeld airport, it is very easy to get to as the S-Bahn goes directly from Flughafen Schonefeld station to Alexanderplatz station in half an hour. Upon arrival, it was only a five minute walk to the hotel from the station, just going round the huge Galeria Kaufhof shopping centre. Check in was easy and efficient and the hotel in general looked very clean and modern. The rooms were the same. Although they were quite small by comparison to other hotels, they were extremely clean and modern, with satellite tv, a minibar and a safe. The bathroom was open plan, however, with only a curtain covering the washing and bath area, so i'd recommend staying somewhere else if you're not staying with friends or family. The hotel was also linked to the shopping centre, making it very easy to get anything you needed, for example, for breakfast in case like us, you were on a room only basis. The station, being only a stone throw away, meant that you were only ten minutes away from most of Berlin's central tourist sights and a mere five minute walk to the huge 368m televison tower along with Alexanderplatz's bars and restaurants. The casino on the 37th floor requires you to register with your passport and to wear formal clothes (ie. a jacket and tie), but besides that, all the hotel's facilities are fine to use and I hear the breakfst is good too, although for us it was a little too expensive at 16 euros each. Overall, I think it was a hotel of outstanding value, given its cost of 97 euros a night for a double and its very convenient location! I would stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel, quirky shower We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. We found the hotel room to be modern, very clean with nice furniture. As other reviews have mentioned the bathroom facilites are open plan however, frosted glass does save your modesty.The breakfast was of very high quality with plenty of choice.We were fortunate enought to stay in a room close to the top floor over looking Alexanderplatz, this meant we had wonderful views over Berlin. If staying in this hotel try to request a room as high up as possible.We used the spa facilities during our stay - which you pay extra for. This was a disappointment as we were expecting jacuzzis, steam rooms etc. all we got was a Sauna.The Park Inn is in a great location as it is right next to the train station and is only a 10-15 min walk to the Brandenburg Gate. If staying in Berlin again I wouldn't look past the Park Inn.

<Content>fantastic view Arrived 0830am but got a room at once.24th floor with af marvellous view of Berlin.Fancy room with just a curtain to screen the bathroom from the bedroom. I would prefer an oldfashioned wall, but it is seen in more and more hotels with glass and marble.Room was small but ok.Staff was efficient and polite even though they had lots of guests to deal with.Central location with S and U-Bahn on the doorstep and the buses 100 and 200 going to all interesting sights in Berlin.One day travelcard: 6 Euro

<Content>Saved by the Park Inn We booked into the Park Inn, after our orginally hotel was awful and miles from anywhere (Dormotel, Hoppegarten) , We turned up stressed and upset but were greeted by a friendly smile!! They were able to accommodate us and we checked out of the other horrid hotel!!! They were very busy and had a queue of people at the desk, but remained calm and very helpful, we asked for the highest floor possible and this was granted!!Rooms were very trendy and the views where stunning! All our needs were catered for, we had cocktails in the bar and again all good!!This holiday was a special one for my boyfriend and I and it was saved by THE PARK INN, Thank you!We will be returning very soon!!

<Content>Everyone should stay here!! After reading the trip advisor reviews, and bearing in mind which sights I wanted to see with ease, I decided on the Park Inn, in Alexanderplatz, east Berlin.Getting there very late at night I got a taxi, which wasn't a fortune compared to UK prices.First impressions were, wow, the tv tower at night next door looks really lovely, but looking at the hotel I thought am I going to the office?!! This is because the exterior of the hotel isn't what you would call classy. However, as soon as I stepped inside, I knew I had picked the right place! Very modern, tip top condition, spotlessly clean, and soundproof. Excellent value for money, considering it's location and views, couldn't believe my luck!I asked for the highest floor possible and was very very happy to have been offered a room on the 34th floor which was smack opposite the tv tower - that was it, I was totally mesmerised by that view, I only wish I could have captured that lit-up, night-time view from my room on camera (sigh).Again, the room was spotless, and very swish. As it was just me I didn't mind the wc having just a glass door, in fact I thought it was ultra trendy!The bedding, I just have to tell you, was the most comfortable ever - I cannot describe it, but the material and weight of that duvet was sheer luxury. Each night I slept like a baby!The hotel was brilliantly situated for the olde Jewish quarter, and for tram rides eastbound outside the city, but also what was great, was, right next door to the hotel was a massive C  A dept store - for us from the UK this is a luxury, for there are no more C  A stores in the UK anymore, so I was pleased to have a store on my doorstep! Also, a U-bahn, S-bahn, and a tour bus all there for the asking, just a few feet away, and, a huge dept store adjoining the hotel, with I might add the most amazing range of chocolates!The hotel has a terrace roof which only opens at certain times and under certain weather conditions, but if you ask nicely, someone will let you go up there, on the roof, to take a few photos - incredible to be so high up, from where you can see all of Berlin's major architecture.Decided to eat in the a la carte restaurant on the 2nd floor. Asked for the pork meal, but the staff advised me not to order it, as it wasn't a pork chop, but a whole leg of pork - for one!!!! Ordered another dish, couldn't even eat that there was so much of it, but the desserts well I had to have some of that so I found room!The only criticism I have is the breakfast - it's an average affair. Granted there's lots of choice, but as a Brit I found all the herbs and sausage meats and breads too heavy and spicey/herby first thing in the morning, but it was great to have a whole jug full of coffee on the table so I could drink as much as I liked.I would definitely stay here again and, as one of the previous posters wrote, it's best to ask for a room away from the lifts. By the time I left, I kinda liked the way the exterior looked, and, where-ever I went in east Berlin, I could spot my hotel from afar, even from the plane when it flew over Berlin before hitting the clouds, and just thinking about the Park Inn now makes me smile; I know I'll return there again!

<Content>Romantic break @ Park Inn Have just returned from a wonderful 4 night break. Our room was on the 35th floor giving a fantastic view across the city. It was clean, warm and had a well stocked 'fridge. The shower and toilet area was designed in such a way that it would be a good idea to share the room with a 'close' friend and not, perhaps, your mum or dad!! The staff were friendly and helpful and the location was ideal. All in all a wonderful holiday and great value for the money. (4 nights for the price of 3)

<Content>Belfast Ireland Just returned from a 5 day break in Hotel. We had an excellent time - Hotel staff friendly and gave us a Kettle/jug when requested. Room safe did work so Hotel allowed us to use Hotel safe. Economic use of shower/toilet door - one door done both. The staff were very accomodating as we had a late departure and they allowed us use of our room until 3pm. If visiting Berlin would stay here and would recommend to our friends.

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a long weekend at this great hotel.It is in a fabulous location with Alexanderplatz station opposite. You certainly don't get lost getting off the train from the airport!There are lots of great eateries and pubs in the vicinity. Try the cocktails in AM/PM at happy hour! We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food there.Our room was on the 30th floor facing the TV tower which had fantastic views.This hotel is certainly value for money and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone considering a short break in Berlin.

<Content>Smelly.... Stayed here for a weekend in Februaury. Fantastic location. Everything within a stones throw of the hotel. The only problem was the smell. Our carpet had been washed and was damp for the whole weekend and they wouldn't change our room for us. It smellt so bad we couldn't stay inside for long, just to sleep and i had to buy air freshener so that it would be bearable. The staff were unfriendly and not willing to help us. Berlin is a fantastic city and the people are so nice, it was a shame that the Park Inn didn't reflect this.

<Content>Best Value Hotel in Europe Booked this hotel for long weekend after positive TA reviews - was not disappointed, modern clean room, in fact was upgraded to a suite taking up large corner views of 34th floor. Often travel to Europe with business but never felt the need to add any comments. But on this occasion was very impressed with hotel staffing and location. PS try out the Spanish Tapas bar across the road (Las Olas) on street level do not be deterred by the exterior.

<Content>Central to everything We only had a day and a half to try and fit in as much as possible so we decided on the Park Inn after reviewing on tripadviser.com. I can honestly say that we were not disappointed.We caught the train to Alexanderplatz and you couldn鈥檛 miss the Hotel, as it is the biggest building around (apart from the TV Tower of course) right opposite the train station. At the Hotel the reception staff were very friendly, and most helpful. Once in the rooms we were delighted at how clean and modern they were. Personally they were of adequate size.The hotel is situated in the middle of a shopping plaza, mixed with some historic buildings in the surrounding areas together with a small park. The bus stop for the sight seeing bus every 15mins (20 euro for the whole day, getting on and off when you please) is again just across the road from the Hotel.The only drawback we came across was that the groundfloor bar/club is rather expensive so we ventured out to the surrounding bars  restaurants which were value for money. Two good places to eat were ALEX鈥檚 around the corner from the Hotel near the base of the TV Tower, which is a bit like a British Whitherspoons, and also Mutter Hoppe, which specialised in traditional German cuisine. Again this is just around the corner and was absolutely fabulous.We will certainly be visiting again in the near future.

<Content>Brilliant stay at the Park Inn We stayed at the Park Inn for three nights over New Year and had a superb time there. When we booked the stay I requested a high room facing the television tower and although they said they could not guarantee it we got a room on the 34th floor with an amazing view. Everything about the hotel was great - the staff was helpful and the location excellent. We paid extra for the business breakfast and it was worth it. The buffet had everything you could think of and it wasn't crowded at all. Thoroughly recommend the Park Inn and will definitely go back to stay again.

<Content>Modern room I was pleasantly surprised by the very modern room, obviously very recently renovated, with all new aminities. Very clean also. I have stayed in 5 star hotels with inferior rooms. Excellent view and good breakfast. The price is excellent considering the very central location and quolity of the room. My room was the last one of the corridor with a view to two directions. Room size was decent.

<Content>Free Minibar Staying in the Park Inn - Alexanderplatz as we speak due to leave tomorrow. Rooms are a tad on the small size but for the price I paid on Last minute.com it was more than sufficient (got 3 nights for the price of 4 and a free minibar, YES A FREE MINIBAR) went up to the 37th floor casino last night (make sure you wear a tie) but quickly left due to not being sure how to play the games but the views are immense. shower and toilet are both cordoned off by the same glass door in the room (so if you dont like the though of hearing your partner in the toilet then find somewhere else just turn the volume up on the telly when they go). Location wise excellent as yo煤 get the train from the airport and the hotel is just accross the square from the train station.

<Content>pretty much ok. We stayed for 4 nights in the Park Inn Berlin in January 2007. We've been to Berlin a couple of times before, so we already know a few hotels in the city. Our first choice (schoenhouse appartments) was already booked and since we booked the night before we went most places in the city were booked. This is how we ended up at the park inn. Now the hotel itself is located right on the Alexanderplatz and very near the TV Tower. It's not the most beautiful area of berlin, but you're close to all the public transport, close to Hakkischer Markt (nice area), well you're pretty central in berlin so that's very good!The hotel doesn't look very charming from the outside, but the rooms are pretty good, with (if you're lucky to get a room on a higher floor) great views of the city! The rooms aren't very spacious, but sufficient. I don't think we'll come back to this hotel, but all in all it isn't a bad choice.

<Content>Excellent location The Park Inn's location in the middle of Berlin next to the train and subway station makes it very interesting. The rooms are modern, clean and have a decent size. High floors come with a fantastic view of the city.Make sure you avoid rooms close to the lifts, given the density of rooms you'll have quite some people going up and down at any time of the day.

<Content>Excellent Location, Horrible Guests The hotel is very nice with views overlooking the city that is absolutely fantastic. The staff is extremely friendly as well as the concierge although it seemed a bit overwhelmed by the Christmas time traffic at the hotel. Berlin is absolutely beautiful at Christmastime and the city is strangely friendly for a large European city. My only complaint about the hotel was not with the hotel itself but the guests it draws. Mostly snobbish overly rude people who have no manners whatsoever. I would gladly stay here again considering the price and location. The amenities were excellent and the bathroom was very nice but.....I wouldn't stay in the same room with someone I didn't want to share a shower with.

<Content>Great hotel, great location The hotel is in an excellent location easily accessible by rail from the airport.As said in previous reports the rooms are unconventional in that the shower cubicle is in the middle of the room!!! Do not let this put you off as there is a curtain that can be pulled around for privacy. The rest of the room is modern and clean.On our first night we ate in the hotel restaurant (there are 3 think this one was called Spagos) The food was very good an reasonably priced.The underground network is about a two minute walk from the hotel and trains are frequent taking you all over the city.This hotel is an excellent base for discovering Berlin and I would definately return.

<Content>Functional and good value Big busy hotel in a good location. Rooms are very clean, beds comfortable but towels thin and small. For the rate paid- about 100 euros for superior room incl. breakfast it麓s good value. If you prefer personal service or small extras as tea/coffee or complimentary water in the room this is not your hotel. But we liked the stringent service and had a great stay. The food in the beakfast buffet is fine- but the restaurant is very crowded and the waiters wont show you to a table- you will have to find one yourself which can be hard during rush hours.Try the Spagos restaurant/lounge in the lobby- great food/service/interior and not expensive. For other good restaurants take the tram to Hackesher Markt ( five minutes - walk 10 min.) - which is also right next to Oranienburger Strasse where a lot of good restaurants and bars can be found.

<Content>Top Notch - What a City We booked this Hotel on the back of the reviews from Trip Advisor, I have to say that we were delighted with the hotel, it is located right in the heart of the Mitte district and is only a few stops on the S/U bahn from the main attractions.The rooms were clean  spacious and if you are on one of the higher levels you get a fantastic view of the city. The staff are friendly and very helpful and the breakfast is excellent. I don鈥檛 normally write reviews but I felt obliged as the Hotel contributed to one of the best Holidays we have had!Enjoy!!!

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a great weekend break in Berlin - lots to see and do. We spent the last evening at the Staatsoper, which was an incredible experience, and one I'm sure we won't forget for quite a while. We stayed for four nights at the Park Inn - Alexanderplatz. It's a very functional hotel - in a perfect location to access all parts of the city, since it is right beside the U- and S-bahn station. This was particularly useful for us, since we arrived late at night. The rooms are pretty unique in design, as other reviewers have mentioned. The sound proofing of the loo is not the best, though, and may ruin many's the friendship! The hotel bar/ restaurant was one of the busiest we've seen in quite a while; lots of people around, plenty of atmosphere. Maybe these two ideas are linked! In general, more than adequate for the price; but I would recommend a rate including breakfast.

<Content>Great Value We have just stayed at Park Inn. Fantastic Hotel, great service, except in the middle of the night, when we checkedin. It was very very very late, and the man in the reception claimed that we already were checked in. Finally - we got our room card, but we didn't get our ordered smoking room. It was not possible - period ! However, at 9.30 in the morning, I asked the reception (new person), and Yes, we could of course get a smoking room. So we moved rooms. Moved from 13th to 17th floor.Otherwise - Fantastic hotel, fantastic view, great breakfast, nice rooms, great locationThe bathroom is unusual. The shower and bathroom are out in the open. A bit strange - but you'll get used to it. The transportation (u-bahn, trams and busses) are right outside,and easy to use.We would stay there again !

<Content>East is best? This is a really nice hotel even if the bathrooms are, as other people have stated, a little unconventional! The rooms are a good size and comfortable and even though the hotel is huge the lifts seem to be readily available to speed you up and down. Unfortunately you need a shirt and tie to access the Casino on the 37 floor.Breakfast could be enough to see you through the entire day, I've never seen so much choice!The hotel is very close to the U-Bahn and other public transport stops and is on a direct line to Potsdammer Platz with a short walk from there to the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie and the Reichstag etc ( in different directions).All in all a nice play to stay for a weekend.

<Content>Excellent location and value for money! The Hotel is located right on Alexanderplatz, East Berlin's main square. Right outside the Hotel there is a Metro and tram stations, and within 1 minute walk one can find bus stations and Berlin's main train station; the location could not be better!The Hotel itself looks very new, modern and luxurious. I have stayed both in a Standard room and a Business-Friendly room, and I can say both were spaceous, modern and well-equipped (Business room even had an LCD-TV).For about 80鈧?per night, the hotel is excellent value for money, and I will return to it when I visit Berlin again!

<Content>Nice hotel, shame about the loos Good location in the old Eastern Germany. Right across from the railway/underground station. The only better location would probably have been nearer to the Brandenberg Gate. However you can get anywhere around the city from here on bus, tram or rail. This is a massive hotel 37 floors. Ask for a high room overlooking Alexanderplatz and you will have a fab view at night of the Berlin landscapte and the incredible TV Tower. Check in was smooth and quick and our request for a high room granted. The rooms were small but very comfortable. However these were let down by the shower and toilet being cubicles in the room itself. The door swung between toilet and shower so you wouldn't want to stay here with someone not particularly close.Breakfast was brilliant and had almost everything, except a toaster. The hotel was immaculately clean and despite being a busy hotel the service was very good. We wouldn't have hestitated to stay again if it wasn't for the toilet setup. Nearby you will see a few cafes, bars and fast food joints and some good restaurants such as a Steak house called Block which served scrumptious steaks. Also plenty of stalls selling Brockwurst etc but unless you are a particular fan of German Sausage i would give them a miss.If you are into shopping there is a fabulous Department store with 6 floors opposite the hotel. All the good designer names and a fabulous foodhall with quality wines at brilliant prices and fabulous chocolate gifts. The hotel also has its own casino and a couple of restaurants which looked good but we didn't try these.One word of warning, make sure you check out on time otherwise you will come back to your room to find your door card won't work. Having said that the hotel couldn't have been nicer about it.

<Content>Great hotel for a great price Stayed for 5 nights in early Sept 2006. Shower/toilet took a while to get used to but no problems. Room was good size, plenty of wardrobe and storage space and cleaned every day to a very high standard. No-one can complain about the breakfast - such a selection and help yourself. At night we tried the 鈧?7 dinner buffet - again, great value with polite and efficient service. Lucky to be in Berlin with beer festival in local park. When we came in at nights we went to the casino on the top floor - free entry and great fun if you can stop when ahead! Location is absolutely no problem as beside major transport links - use the 100 and 200 bus as these take you everywhere. Would not hesitate to go again to Berlin and would definitely book the Park Inn.

<Content>A bit of a monstrosity This is not a bad place to stay, it's very near public transportation and has clean and spacious accomodations. The service staff at the front desk were very helpful. There were a few minor irritations, however. The bizarre shower in our room leaked all over the floor of the toilet and sink area. The television reception seemed to run off of antenna and was subpar. The bar/cafe in the lobby breezeway had free Internet if you were eating or drinking, but they didn't take credit cards or allow charges to the room. What the hell? Who doesn't take credit cards in a major European city in a major hotel anymore? The other complaint is just the sheer size of the hotel and the size of the groups the place attracts. It reminded me of the days of the Hotel Rossiya in Moscow. You'd see 4 tour buses pull up out front and all of the sudden the lobby would be full of 300 new check-ins and you'd have a devil of a time using the elevator or just walking out the door. Also, adjacent Alexanderplatz is undergoing massive construction that has fencing up all over the place. It really makes it a hassle to get in and out of the place.

<Content>Loved this hotel Very Modern Hotel opposite the train station. Stayed in the Park Inn in August 2004 and it was fantastic, Fabulous room, a little small .Rooms had been recently renovated to a very high standard, spotlessly clean, towels changed every day. Breakfast is hot and cold buffet. The buffet breakfast has to been seen to be believed, two years later my partner is still taking about it. Staff were extremely friendly and spoke excellent English. Fabulous hotel, very highly recommended. Front entrance right beside Tram stop and back entrance right beside U Bahn station. Bus stops less than five minutes walk across the square, Great location to explore Berlin.

<Content>Great location My husband and i have just spent three nights in this hotel. It is ideally situated to see all the main sights as it is right across the street from the train station and under ground, which I must say we found to be brilliant as they all seem to arrive on time. The hotel and the rooms are very clean. The staff are friendly and the concierge are excellent for information about the best way to get to sights.All in all an excellent trip and I would have no hesitation on recommending this hotel.

<Content>The best location in East Berlin We spent 4 nights in this 4-star-Hotel. We booked it through hotelclub---. It has the perfect location to visit Berlin. Close to Museums (a 10-minute-walk), and to the major sites. It's located in Alexanderplatz which happens to be under construction. It can be a little confusing to find your way into the main entrance..But it's not a problem at all. The room was nice but, as mentioned in other reviews, bathroom facilities are weird..YOU MUST BE FAMILIAR with the person you are sharing the room with..But again not a problem at all. Breakfast buffet was a little crowded at times. Take the hip on/hip off bus. It's 20鈧?and it's worthy. Also we took a taxi from Tegel airport and it was just 19鈧?

<Content>Great for groups I booked this hotel through Vaughan Edmonds at totalstay ([--]) for our group of 24 and you got us a brilliant rate.The place was ideal for everyone in the group as we could all get around very easily and staff at the hotel were very friendly even though we had mucked up the rooming list they had the time to change a few things on arrival.Rooms were in nice and clean and i got a room with fantastic views over Berlin.We all had a great time in the Casino before heading out to all the bars close by.I would reccomend this hotel for both couples and large groups like ours as the facilities and location will meet everyones need plus we got very good prices.

<Content>Great location! Stayed at the Park Inn for four nights in May with my husband. Would probably say it is a smart 3* rather than 4*, but we had a very pleasant stay there. The bed was especially comfy and no, it isn't weird to have the two separate mattresses and duvets for a double bed, that's what they're all like in Germany! The toilet and shower had one 'shared' door (in fact we didn't work this one out until 30 mins. before we checked out!! Doh! But the 'open plan' style of the room allows little privacy, so probably best you stay there with someone you're at least vaguely intimate with! Fantastic location, you can virtually roll out the front door and straight into the U-Bahn. Alexanderplatz is also a central station on the S-Bahn line and is direct to and from Sch枚nefeld airport.

<Content>I'm still dreaming about their breakfast. I stayed at the Park Inn from July 2nd through the 6th. My father booked this hotel through his travel agent and we paid 109 Euros a night.I think the location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn are just a few steps away (you're on the S-Bahn line to Schoenenfeld), as are the 100  200 bus lines. If you feel like walking, Unter der Linden is about 10 minutes away. Museum Island is about a 15 minute walk, or just take the bus. And right outside, there is a department store plus several places to eat or grab a snack. We must have paid the business rate because were were entitled to the free fancy breakfast - omg, what a spread. Eggs, sausages, fresh fruit, yogurt, jams, random veggies, muesli, cheeses, meats, all sorts of drinks and more varieties of delicious breads than I have seen in a while. The service was pretty good and I could have stayed there all morning. Seriously, I would go back just for the breakfast.The people at the front desk were polite and helpful. There was some problem with our reservation (I blame the travel agent) but it was quickly resolved and we had rooms next to each other, despite arriving on different dates. Plus, they let me check in at 10am and the check-out went smoothly (we also lets on different dates). FYI - the front desk staff speaks perfect English.We were on the 33rd floor. While our view was not of central Berlin, I still enjoyed looking out at the night lights. The bathroom set-up with the shower/toilet in the room was a bit odd, but the closets were nice and there was plenty of storage space. If the hotel had fluffy towels, I would have given them an Excellent rating. I enjoyed the built-in lamps by the bed and the nice comforter. Plus, the cleaning staff folded my pajamas for me. My sense was that the hotel gets lots of large groups, but it also works well for the individual traveler.Of the amenities, I only used the spa. No one was there, so I could play in the showers and saunas to my heart's content. Also, the International calling rates seemed reasonable though I had trouble figuring out how to use the VM and calling out system (probably because my German [-----]).

<Content>Ideal base for discovering Berlin I ventured out to Berlin alone for the 2nd time this Easter. Having stayed over in Charlottenburg before Christmas and undergoing a long, long walk back to the hotel from sightseeing, I decided to stay in a hotel in the Mitte district where a lot of Berlin's attractions can be found. Trawling through a few websites, I came across a brilliant deal for 4 nights at this hotel. Arriving from Tempelhof, this hotel couldn't be easier to get to, take the U8 towards Alt-Tegel then change at Stadtmitte onto the U2 towards Pankow and alight at Alexanderplatz. It's even easier from Tegel (catch the TXL bus) and from Sch枚nefeld (simply jump on the S9). The hotel entrance is literally 10 metres from the U-Bahn exit. Checking in was fairly easy, even if I was nearly mistaken as part of a tour group from Hamburg! The room was on the 9th floor, minimalist in nature (rather funky IMO), being made of dark wood, white materials and glass, and it was near enough perfect. Despite the building works going on at the adjacent Galeria Kaufhof, I still managed a couple of lie-ins! The hotel has a casino and bar on the 37th floor and I think there were limited fitness facilities too, though I never got to use them as I was out most of the day (and night) sightseeing and sampling the nocturnal habits of Berlin. Breakfast was excellent on the day I had it, 15鈧?for as much as you wanted, vast selection of breads, meats, cheeses, fruits and they even did Englischesfr眉hstuck (a full English)! Couldn't really complain about the service either, the two meals I had in the Zille-Stube restaurant were spanking! Veal schnitzel, apple strudel, German smoked meats platter, the works! If you wanted to eat out, there were numerous restaurants in the vicinity, from Chinese to Italian to Vietnamese to Hungarian! I truly recommend this place!

<Content>Fab hotel  Stayed at the Park Inn Alexanderplatz 24-27 June 2006. We took the Airport Express (train), 2.10 Euros each, direct from Schonefeld airport to Alexanderplatz station - 2 mins walk to hotel. You can see the hotel from the station whilst on the train - the only 37 floor building in the area. Had a room on the 35th floor with breathtaking views of West Berlin. Hotel + room very modern, toilet + shower separated from the bedroom by a frosted glass door - not a problem at all when on holiday with your husband/partner. No noise can be heard whatsoever from outside, the quietest hotel we have ever stayed in. All previous comments about the beds + pillows are true - the most comfy beds we have ever slept in! Had breakfast in Spagos Bar/Restaurant which is a new addition to the hotel on the ground floor of the hotel, 15 Euros each but well worth the money. Not busy at all with plenty of choice: sausages, mushrooms, scrambled egg, grilled tomatoes, cold meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, fruit salad, yoghurts, bread, pastries, tea, coffee, fresh juices. U + S Bahn seconds from rear entrance to hotel which take you all over Berlin. Didn't have time to visit the casino in the hotel or the wellness area, simply too much to do outside of the hotel so cannot comment on these facilities. We highly recommend this hotel and after seeing other hotels whilst wandering around we were glad that we had chosen to stay at the Park Inn. Excellent value for money - try booking a 4* hotel in the UK for 拢65 per night!!!

<Content>Good location, good breakfast,but! the room seemed a little too small, especially the shower and w.c. which were merely enclosed within glass panels and the hand wash basin was actualy on view in the room. This said, the quality of the rooms furnishings and the service, surrounds and food seemed to be 4 star standard. ( would have been nice to have a kettle and coffee /tea making facilities inside the room)The location is very good for a tourist needing to see Berlin, for the hotel is in the  more interesting east and the excellent transport links are within 100m.The price paid was about 拢70 /night for a double roon B and B, through Last Minute, which seemed to be a good price.....but then the room was not as good as one that I had used during an earlier stay.

<Content>Not so impressive We stayed at the Park Inn at the end of May 2006 and were less impressed than other reviewers. The area, though convenient to Alexanderplatz railway station, resembled a building site - indeed on one morning we were woken early by the sounds of construction. We had booked (via Expedia) a room on floors 26 - 35, and paid extra for this (拢233 for 3 nights) but our reservation did not confirm this in writing and we were assigned to a room on the 14th floor (we were refused an upgrade on the grounds that the hotel was full, which seemed unlikely), so the views were average. We were disappointed that there were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. The room rate did not include breakfast and we did not try the hotel breakfast, but ate locally instead. The room itself was small but stylish (lots of mirrors, glass, chrome, marble) and comfortable - wonderful beds and cotton bedlinen! Other reviewers mentioned steam-jet showers, but these weren't in our room. Perhaps we expected too much after all the rave reviews...

<Content>Excellent choice We chose to stay at this hotel because of the good reviews. They were not wrong, and we were not disappointed.The location was perfect, with access to the S and U-Bahn right opposite the hotel. Gettting around the city was cheap and easy. Our room was on the 30th floor with spectacular views. The room was extremely quiet and yes the bathrooms are a little quirky (frosted glass cubicles in the room) but not a problem for us. Although not so sure that they would be to everyone's taste.We managed to get a deal including breakfast that was cheaper than the hotel's direct rate for room only. There was a good choice at breakfast but it was very busy. On one occasion we could not get a table so we went out for an hour and returned later, as they served until 10.30am. Staff very friendly and welcoming.All in all this hotel hits all the positives, clean, modern, comfortable and excellent value, we would definitely recommend this hotel and we plan to return.

<Content>Great Hotel! We went to Berlin for a long weekend and decided on the Park Inn for 2 reasons. One being price and the other being the location. The bus from Tegel airport cost only 鈧?.10 each and dropped us off approx 50 yards from the door. We were early but were allowed to check in anyway. Once inside the room we were very impressed. We had a corner room on the 27th floor and had a fantastic view (from 2 sides of the room) of the whole city as well as a close up view of the TV Tower!The bathroom was somewhat unusual as it didn't have walls as such, but frosted glass panels! All the usual amenities (toiletries, tea, coffee etc) we included in a very clean and comfortable room.Alexanderplatz is a great location to get around the entire city as well. U Bahn, S Bahn, Trams and buses all run from virtually just outside the hotel entrance.I'm planning to go back to Berlin later in the year and I will definitly stay at the Park Inn again.Thoroughly recommended!!!

<Content>Excellent location, avoid the hotel breakfast We stayed here for 3 nights and loved the hotel. Rooms were sufficient and staff very friendly.The breakfast is pricey at 15 Euro per person. I suggest you skip the hotel breakfast and walk across to the new department store Galleria - it's literally across the road from the hotel, and you need to walk through it to get to the train station. On the ground floor of Galleria, there is a complete eating area, which as well as being like a mini-supermarket also has a bakery that has yummy pastries and tea/coffee. Or you could pick up some fresh fruit from the supermarket area. We ate like kings, and spent less than 10 Euro for the 2 of us - much better than the hotel breakfast!

<Content>Immaculate! It was impossible to find something to complain about! We couldn't believe that we got to stay somewhere so contempary, clean and cool for the bargain price that Expedia offered us! We were on the 22nd floor (we asked for a higher room after being offered the 8th for a better view and this was no problem). Lots of shops, cafes, pubs etc nearby. The Alexanderplatz station is right next to the hotel and can take you all over the city although you could walk due to its fab location! Please go - it's great!

<Content>Fantastic down duvets This hotel was fantastic. Perhaps I was overjoyed because I'd never stayed in such a nice hotel, but everything was great. The room was big  modern, with lots of windows. The beds were very comfortable with super soft down duvets and pillows. The bathroom was very clean  the staff was super quick with bringing you anything i.e. an iron. The room came with a hair dryer, soap, shampoo, a shower cap  shoe polish. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a mini bar fridge in the room, which we emptied out (don't eat/drink anything! very expensive!) and put our own food into. There is a supermarket right downstairs underneath the hotel.My only complaints would be that the double bed we booked was really 2 twin beds pushed together. Also, don't use the telephone in the room if you can avoid it. The costs are astronomical!! It costs 0.33 euro/min for a local call. I had to call Canada while i was there and it cost 0.94 euro/min!!! There are lots of internet cafes with telephones in Berlin, so use those instead. There was also ALOT, and i mean alot, of construction around the entire hotel, so it was a bit hard to navigate around it. While I loved the hotel, I wouldn't stay in this location in Berlin again. The eastern side of Berlin is quite barren and alienating. I would stay in the western side should I go back.

<Content>Centralized location with a view I stayed at this hotel for a week vacation in August 2005. This was my backup hotel since the Swissotel in the trendy Kudamm/West Berlin was booked. The surrounding areas of the hotel are rather dodgy as much of Alexanderplatz is a construction site with graffiti covered walls, and punk anarchist kids hanging around, which oddly adds to the beauty of being in the heart of East Berlin and all of its former Marxist glory. The lobby was being renovated so it wasn't that sexy. The room I was in on the 34th floor had a great view looking west facing the Observation tower, Museum Island, Berliner Dom, Potsdamer Platz, the Reichstag and all the main attractions of Berlin - feel sorry for those who have to look out towards the East. The room itself was small yet clean. Theres a little fridge with snacks and drinks in it which is nice. The bed was comfortable. The shower and toilet are kind of in the open to the room. Don't get too crazy splashing water around because the shower has a tendency to leak. The on-site restaurant had good breakfasts, dinners were rather bland. The concierge was very helpful in giving directions and suggestions. There's a Burger King on the ground floor if you wanted to grab something quick to bring back to the room. Theres a internet cafe connected to a Dunkin Donuts on the otherside of the Alexanderplatz station opposite the tower. The s-bahn and u-bahn station is probably the biggest plus because its right outside the hotel. Another big plus was going out at night to restaurants, pubs, and bars and EASILY finding where I had to go back to since the observation tower is visible everywhere in the city. Otherwise my stay at the Park Inn was not that bad, if you want luxury yeah that Swissotel would have been better, but this hotel's strongest point is convenience.

<Content>Fab hotel! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Park Inn because of its location and it was perfect. We checked in earlier than the usual check in time and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 30th floor, giving great views of the TV tower and the centre of Berlin. Other reviewers have mentioned the 'different' bathroom, it wasn't a problem for us: we just turned up the TV! The location was great for access to Schonefeld airport (25 mins by S-bahn with a train running every 30 mins) and for the city centre by U-bahn, although you could easily walk there. The U2 line takes quite a long route around the city so it's better to walk to Stadmitte, enjoy the scenery and join the metro from there. The breakfast at the hotel was 15 euros which we found a little steep so I would recommend going to the Alex cafe/bar at the base of the TV Tower where for 5 euros you can have their huge buffet breakfast, served until midday. I would also recommend the Discover Berlin Walking tour which starts at 10.30am outside the Haagen Dazs at the next station along beginning with H Markt. Sorry, I cannot remember the name!! You can just turn up and pay 10 euros for a fantastic four-hour tour of Berlin. I think the hotel is great: great location, great views and great staff and would certainly go back.

<Content>Great value We stayed at the Park Inn for three nights on the 34th floor and were very happy with the accomodation and service for the price. Comfortable beds, great view (as good as the TV tower and free), super convenient. You can walk to many of the main attractions and there's an S-bahn / U-bahn / overland train station just steps from the hotel (Alexanderplatz). Transport-wise, you couldn't do better. We opted not to pay 15 euros for breakfast, bought pastries at the station instead.Would not recommend this hotel if you are travelling with someone you're not intimate with. Toilet and shower separated by a lightly-frosted glass barrier that does not reach ceiling or floor. In short, there is no visual or auditory privacy...Lots of construction in the area right now, but noise was not a problem.

<Content>Excellent!!! I was a little dubious about this hotel after reading some of the reviews but I took a chance due to our flight getting in a little late. It is an ideally located hotel as we got off great airport express to Alexanderplatz, came out the station at the foot of the hotel. Reception staff smiley and helpfull, okay the room was small but spotless, well comfy beds, great view across berlin and breakfast well and truly fed us. For 拢168 quid two adults three nights B and B you cannot be robbed! I saw the other hotels as we went on an excellent Bike tour with fat tire bike tours an excellent way to see the sights and meet new people, the other hotels not wanting to dis them looked very run down and trading on a name ie hilton and raddison! overall a great hotel.

<Content>Good hotel, excellent operating base for exploring Berlin The hotel has a very strategic location, Alexander Platz is a central hub of the Berlin public transport network. From Tegel Airport, bus TXL (every 10 minutes) takes you straight to the hotel. The hotel is easy to spot being one of the tallest buildings around. Ok, Alexander Platz is undergoing a major reconstruction but that is to be expected as Berlin is one big building site at the moment.The view from our room (26th floor) was spectacular. We could see most of the historic landmarks. The room was clean and modern. Just make sure you go with someone you know well as the bathrooms are not particularly private with all that glass!! The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful.Excellent breakfast buffet. Evening meals are good, and not overly priced.The hotel's sauna (costs 5 Euro) is well designed with friendly staff.

<Content>weekend away Booked a birthday weekend away for my other half at the Park Inn. First time in Berlin for us. Flew by Easijet and then took the Airport Express train to Alexanderplatz. The hotel was easy to spot being one of the tallest buildings around. Ok, Berlin is a building site at the moment but that is to be expected. The view from our room (23rd floor) was spectacular. We could see most of the historic landmarks. The room was clean and modern. The staff in the hotel were friendly, helpful and mostly local. This hotel is so central to all the historic sites. The TV tower is a must (just have lunch in the revolving restaurant). Most sites are witin walking distance. The Berliners were polite, friendly and accommodating. Even the young youths at the railway station (who were wearing hooded tops!) were most helpful in giving us directions!! I will definitely go back. Just make sure you go with someone you know well as the bathrooms are not particularly private with all that glass!! We had a 25 hr delay on the journey home but we met some fantastic people and turned it into a positive experience!!

<Content>A disappointing experience I booked a city break through Brendan Vacations and was placed at the Park Inn. I was very disappointed in the area as of November 2005. The building was surrounded on three sides by construction and graffitti were plentiful. Some of the buildings across the street from the hotel looked like housing projects. The area is one of urban blight. Even a city guide book concedes that the square in in redevelopment. At present, this poorly lit area isn't safe for a single woman. There were few places to go in the evening. The money spent on taxis could have purchased a room at the beautiful Radisson SAS, which is down the street but out of the Park Place square. Brendan was of no help in offering candid information on the area or in arranging for an alternative location. I would not recommend this hotel. The lobby is full of smoke. Moreover, there was only one computer in the business center, which I had to clean with wet wipes myself. The television featured promotions of pornography, which I had no interest in seeing.

<Content>Reasonable hotel, watch for floods I have stayed at the Park Inn about 5 times in the last few years. It is a giant hotel with small rooms (I have only stayed in single rooms). The bedroom and bathroom are really all one room, and on two of my stays the shower stall flooded about half the room. This seems to be a common problem, and I overheard some others complaining about the same thing as I was checking in on my recent trip. While the rooms lack charm and are small, they are generally clean. They have always had toiletries and a hair-dryer, sometimes a pants press, and never a coffee maker or clock or anything else. I have always found the staff to be helpful. On the upper floors, the views are great. I stay in the Park Inn for business in the Hackescher Markt part of Berlin, and it is very convenient for that location. The reason I choose this hotel over others in the area is for the gym. At the price of the Park Inn, it is the only hotel in the area that I can find that has any kind of excercise equipment. In case you're interested, it has two treadmills, an elliptical, and an upright bike in a small windowless room.

<Content>Best/Most Covenient Place To Stay in Berlin Have just returned from a 5 day stay in Berlin which we spent at the Park Inn.The hotel is a huge 37 storey high building(casino on 37th floor).My wife and i found it to be just perfect for exploring the city and easily walked from Alexanderplatz to the Brandenburg Gate/Reichstag/Freidrichstrasse and Unten Den Linden.If walking isnt your thing public transport is both cheap and convenient in the city whether it be bus U-Bahn or S-Bahn.The Hotel itself we found to be very good with friendly staff and an excellent concierge.The rooms (we where on 35th floor) are very nice with excellent views out over the city. The way the rooms are laid out is unusual as the shower and toilet whilst ensuite are housed in a wet area near the door to the room and screened off with tasteful glass partitions.Very good use of space in fact.You have all the usual things in your room including a mini bar(prices the same as hotel bar prices).On the third floor of the hotel is an excellent sauna and fitness centre(costs 5 euros).The hotel restaurant is on 2nd floor and you can choose to eat either a la carte or better yet in our experience go for the buffet which is excellent value at 17 euros per person for a 3 course meal (all you can eat).At the moment the hotel has a lot of building work going on outside it(new shopping complex being built between it and the railway station).the hotel itself is also having an exterior facelift to an all smoked glass exterior.Whilst this may sound a lot to put up with it wasnt.We werent disturbed by any noise during our stay at all.All in all we would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Berlin.

<Content>When in Berlin chose the Park Inn, it's so easy Having flown into Schonefeld as a Berlin virgin with easyJet I was concerned as to whether the Park Inn was the right location. My fears evaporated when I stepped off the s-bahn after the 30 minute journey from the airport. The hotel is the perfect location for travellers new to the city or there for a long weekend. The staff are friendly and rooms clean and functional. A hearty breakfast sets you up for a day of trips. Our room on the 26th floor looked west across the city with views of the tooth pick, Mitte, Reichstag and Sony Center. The hotel is within easy reach of Museum island and Mitte and we meandered to the Brandenburg Gate within 45 minutes. The bars and cafe/restaurants at Hackescher Markt are no distance and well recommended. All in all we had nothing bad to say about this hotel or its location. Excellent.

<Content>Great place to stay Stayed at the Park Inn for 5 days in August 2005. Great hotel, excellent breakfast with anything you could want. Good buffet evening meal too, everything you can eat at 17 euros- but would also recommend the Alex restaurant just adjacent to rear entrance of hotel - good food and friendly staff, we got 25% discount on our third dinner there. Reception staff were fine, bar staff very friendly, and also shop staff - they made a special effort to get the English version of the Berlin 1939-45 tour book I asked for by the next day.Room (on 15th floor) was OK - a bit small but with comfortable beds. Strange though to have bath/shower/washbasin with just a curtain round them, toilet was separate with a proper door.A lot of building work in the area, but we were not disturbed by any noise. And we had a fantastic view of Berlin!Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel I just came back from Berlin. The Park Inn Alexander Platz is a great hotel. The room was large, we had a great view from the 30th floor. The shower is amazing. The only downer is the location, lets face it, Alexander Platz had seen better days and better crowd. I would definetively go back.

<Content>Great Hotel Newly remodeled. Easy location to find. Very close proximity to the subway and the historical downtown of Berlin. Great buffet style restaurant located within the hotel with lots of food to choose from. Ask for a room up high facing the west - it will be worth the view.

<Content>Don't need a map to find it! Recently stayed there as part of a group of 21 blokes on a stag trip. Very convenient location to explore the eastern side of the city. Rooms are functional and business-like, with amazing views over the city (I was on the 16th foor).Breakfast was typical European fare; not the best I've experienced because of the vast numbers of people the hotel caters for, but a good range and perfectly adequate enough to start the day.Thoroughly recommend it for large groups needing a city base because of its 24hr access. The best feature was the fact that wherever you are in Berlin you can see the hotel; especially important at the end of a big night out!

<Content>Loved the hotel We stayed at the Alexanderplatz Hotel in Berlin for three nights in March 05, It did not look great from the outside, but the rooms and hotel was great on the inside.We asked for a room with a view, and we sure did get one on the 26th floor,facing the TV tower. The room itself was very modern, the bed very comfortable and the Shower.....well just Brilliant. The restuaraunt was not too bad, and the staff were helpful too.Definately recommend this hotel, not too bad of a location, we did manage to walk to the near by attractions and there was a taxi rank outside the hotel. The hotel was excellent value for money!

<Content>great stay Stayed at the Park Inn during February 2005, had a fantastic time.Hotel room was really nice it was on the 31st floor with incredible views, its also in a great position within walking distance of Brandenburg gate, Checkpoint Charlie etc.Berlin is an amazing city, covered in snow when we were there, lots to see and do. Would have no hesitation in staying at the Park Inn if I were to return to Berlin.

<Content>Save yourself!!!!! 3/3/05 Please read this ! Just got back. The worst hotel I have stayed at in 27 years.The reception staff are rude, aggressive and disinterested in any comments you may have. The rooms were a good size, but its like being in the boiler room of an ocean steamer. The beds were so saggy they nearly touched the floor once you had got on them, the pillows were like wafers.It claims to be a four star hotel, think again, no tea or coffee making facilities, no ironing board, no bathrobes, no in room toiletries, nor local information or hotel information can be found in the room. To obtain room service I was transfered 4 times to different hotel departments. The only good thing was the bar staff in the hotel lobby, they were kind, polite and friendly. Are you listening Park Inn? Put them on the reception desk, to replace the miserable and arrogant people you have there now. Dont waste your hard earned money on these people. Just to clarify, we had an upgraded Business Class room. Save yourselves!!!!!

<Content>An excellent choice We have just spent 3 nights at this excellent and well located, hotel. The room on the 34th floor was excellent: clean, modern, well-equipped and comfortable with no air conditioning noise. Good in-room coffee making facilities were provided. Food in the hotel (breakfasts and evening buffet) were very good indeed with a wide choice. All staff were friendly and helpful.When booking we had no idea how well placed it was - right next to the metro and on the 100 and 200 bus lines that go right through to the main tourist spots (get a Welcome Card or other travel card and they are then free to use).

<Content>Very Berlin and Very Good We stayed here for six nights in early February, in a double room on the 35th floor. With such great views orientating ourselves in Berlin was easy - Berlin is extremely flat, with few such lookouts, so this really was a boon. The location is excellent, with great access to trains, buses, and trams, and just five minutes walk to some hip cafes, bars, and interesting shops in the Scheunenviertel district. One block north you can catch the 240 bus to Friedrichshain, taking you on a meandering trip through some of Eastern Berlin in the throes of rapid redevelopment. The train station is a hub for several lines, so you can investigate East and West Berlin with equal ease. The bus from Tegel airport stops 50 metres from the hotel door, and given the size of the building you certainly will not miss your stop! There is a department store, including a foodhall, just across the plaza, and slightly further on, a large and cheap internet cafe. The bed was very comfortable, the shower good, and the decor inoffensive - the ceilings were GDR era low, but not oppressive. The area is perfectly safe, but gritty, in the way most of the former East - frankly, we would far prefer to stay here than in the anonymous luxury of a West Berlin hotel, and would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are on a budget.

<Content>Recommended! We stayed here in Dec 2005. The hotel was great value, a very accessible location (especially for Schoneberg Airport/Ryanair flights) had wonderful views (we asked for a view and got a corner room on the 20th floor), well cleaned every day and all the staff were very helpful. We loved the window into the shower from the bedroom! We didn't use the restaurant (too much else to try in 4 days) and would therefore have liked tea/coffee facilities but that's a small gripe. We recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We stopped at the Park INN hotel in December, ready for the christmas markets. We booked this hotel on-line using the Berlin tourist baord, which was very helpfull. The rooms were of a high standard with clean linen and a modern approach to hotels. The staff were more than helpful and very freindly. We would recommended this hotel to anyone as it is centrally located for all the sites. Anyone who requires a top class hotel at a good price in Berlin should stay at the Park INN.

<Content>Excellent hotel and great for sight seeing We stayed at the Park Inn during September 2004. A bit nervous after reading some of the reviews. We had never been to Berlin before but the hotel was very easy to find due to the huge sign on the top! Our room was fantastic. We had a corner room and looked out to the TV tower on one side and great views of Berlin out the other. Room had a flat screen plasma tv in it, newly fitted bathroom with separate WC and the best hotel bed that I have slept in. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast in the morning was excellent - no complaints there at all. If you plan to do any sightseeing in Berlin then this is a great place to stay. Tram and bus stops within a couple of minutes walk of the hotel. There are numerous great sights to see within the immediate vicinity and we were really pleased that we didn't pick one of the hotels over in the west side of Berlin. I would recommend staying here to anybody. I can only assume that not all of the rooms have been done up as some of the reviews that have been written about the Park Inn are almost like they are for a different hotel altogether!

<Content>very good we`ve just came back from berlin and stayed at the park inn.it has been just refurbished so it looks very modern and clean.we`ve stayed on the 32nd floor and the view are amazing,the room are perfect, the bathroom is very modern and you have a room for the wc, one for the shower and the sink is in the bedroom. you do not have a lot of privacy but if you know each other it`s fine. we did not have any problem with flooding shower. You can have breakfast on the 2nd floor and it is very good, lots and lots of food and drinks.Berlin centre is big and there is a lot to see everywhere..the position of this hotel is in the centre you can easily move around with buses or metro. December is a cold month to go but it is also one of the best, xmas decoration,lights and xmas market everywhere..if you love xmas this is perfect..it makes the city so beautiful! we would definitely go back !

<Content>no color, no taste If you're in Berlin for business, then it's OK I guess. Very asseptic hotel with so-called modern rooms, not very much to my taste. Felt as if I were staying in a big factory... In the room, you have two side openings for the shower and the WC with NO DOORS !! If you share the room, make sure you know the person well. And this was a superior room. The smell from the WC and the shower was not welcome. The furnishing was very poor and tasteless. The breakfast was OK, with lots of choice, but too crowded. The hotel is in a very good location, close to the train station and other city attractions.

<Content>Poor bathroom We had no major issues with the hotel itself but the major problem with the room was the 鈥榖athroom鈥?鈥?or the lack of it. The layout of two cubicles (one shower, one WC) and a sink in the room undoubtedly saves space and looks modern but creates a few problems. You had better be very friendly with your room-mate as the toilet and shower are practically next to the bed and there is no privacy at all. Our open plan shower over-ran into the room causing a flood each time it was used 鈥?not unusual to have a flooded bathroom floor in a hotel but when this is also your bedroom floor you have a bit of a problem. We were on the 32nd floor of the hotel and had a great view over the old east side of the city. The hotel can be seen for miles around so finding it is no problem.The immediate location of the hotel on Alexanderplatz is convenient to access Berlin鈥檚 excellent but sometimes confusing transport systems. The TXL airport bus will get you to and from the airport for 4 Euros (remember to buy and validate your ticket as we were asked for them by plain clothed inspectors). There are a few nice shops, a Burger King and a large department store only a few steps from the hotel but you might find a longer journey is required to get a nice meal. Overall the location is too far away from the main sights and shopping areas of Berlin which are mainly in the old west side.

<Content>Excellent weekend break hotel We stayed for 4 days during the latter part of October and found the hotel exceeded expectations. Friendly, helpful staff together with a very nice room added to the enjoyment of a great weekend in a fantastic city. No complaints at all, I would recommend it. If you want to get the best out of a few days in Berlin take the 'New Berlin' walking tour (twice a day) leaving from outside Starbucks near the Brandenburg gate. Fantastic introduction to the city - it made our weekend.
