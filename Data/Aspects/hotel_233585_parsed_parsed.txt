<Content>Nice hotel, good value  We stayed for two nights between Christmas and New Year in one of the Comfort level double bed rooms. On arrival the staff were friendly and throughout our stay they were always helpful. The room itself was clean, a decent size, by Parisienne standards, and looked like it had recently been refreshed/decorated. The facilities inside the room were good including a mini-bar service, flat screen T.V. and modern/new shower unit. The only things worthy of critical comment are pretty minimal, however so that others are aware: if you stay in rooms at the end of a corridor you need to know where the light switch is, to illuminate the area in front of your door, otherwise it can be quite difficult to see the handle and unlock the door. Once you've found the light ouside the door for the first time it's no problem from then on. There are some areas with suspended panels for the celing and when you open/close a door the pressure can sometimes cause these to move and they can startle you a little. Finally, like many older buildings you can hear most every noise in the rooms around you. This is just the way things are in older built apartments  hotels and simply cannot be avoided. So, minor criticisms aside, overall we liked this hotel, it has a good location and is near the Metro and Rue Cler market/cafe areas, where there are several excellent little bistro's and retaurants. We would happily stay again.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed in a confort room at the Duquesne for 3 nights in December 08. The room (no 34) had twin beds, a sofa, sufficient storage space and a WC separate from the bathroom. The hotel has recently been refurbished and is spotlessly clean. The beds were very comfortable and the double glazing keeps out traffic noise from the busy road outside. We had a great view of the Eiffel Tower when we leaned out of the window.There is a small bar and a PC for guests' use in the lobby , as well as a seating area with newspapers.Didn't try the breakfast, but there are several cafes nearby which we used instead. The hotel is also in a good location for restaurants, as well as being near the Eiffel Tower, Rodin Museum, Invalides and Musee d'Orsay.Would definitely stay at the Duquesne again,

<Content>Great hotel, great location This is a lovely little hotel. 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower, 2 minutes walk from picking up the Open Tour Bus at Les Invalides. All the staff are very friendly and welcoming. We chose superior rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower and neither of us were disappointed. We were both very comfortable and slept well. Despite being on a main road, not a sound is heard through the heavy balcony windows. Breakfast is fine and for Paris good value. I would recommend getting down early though as there is less choice later on. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>An Honest Review Hotel Duquesne Eiffel is a small hotel rated at 3 stars. Comparing to other hotels of similar class, the room size is a bit small but very clean. The furnishings are new, tasteful and comfortable. They have free Internet access which is a plus. However, their elevator is small and made a jerking motion everytime it stops at a floor. After using it several times, we got the hang of it. Location is very good since it is near a Metro station and some notable spots like Rue de Cler, and the Eiffel Tower. Area also felt very safe.Glitch we experienced during our stay was that the hotel staff who checked us in did not give us a complete orientation. Finding our room was a bit difficult since the hallways were dark. The motion sensitive lights in the hallways on our floor did not always work. Also, staff did not tell us on how to turn on the lights in our room. We were supposed to insert the card key in the light switch to turn on the power. Then our safe did not have a key and we were given the option to leave our valuables in the front desk. Not that we did not appreciate the effort by Julie. Thanks to her we were able to go around the city without worrying about the safety of our travel documents, etc. Jessica was equally helpful in giving tips on which sights to see and also provided logistics on how to get to those places. Even the guy who checked us in was helpful in providing us hot drinking water late at night for my grandmother's tea. Probably he just needs more training on how to entertain guests. Lastly, breakfast could use more variety. They served eggs and ham everyday. Maybe they can mix it up with bacon and sunny side up some other days.Overall, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would therefore recmommend it.

<Content>Good, clean hotel, well located We booked this hotel for a weekend. The positive Tripadvisor reviews are largely correct. Our room was one of the smallest and cheapest and on the first floor but, nevertheless, comfortable, clean, quiet and nicely decorated. Everything was small but functional. Our bathroom was clean and modern. Some of the reviews found the breakfast not so good. Personally, I found the choice fine and varied. There were friendly breakfast ladies ready to whip up our favorite brunch before we took to the pavements. In addition, there was plenty of the usual croissants, baguette, cereals etc., even though we arrived late. Not a lot to improve, really a good hotel. The only flaws I could find was that the ventillation was a little noisy and there was not fire escape plan on the back of the door:

<Content>Beautiful view My boyfriend and I planned a trip to Paris and booked this hotel after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. After booking the hotel on the hotel website, I sent an email requesting a room with a view. I received a response stating that it could not be guaranteed. We arrived at the hotel 1-2 hours before check in, but luckily our room was ready for us. We were put in a wonderful room on the fifth floor in the corner. Could nto have asked for a more beautiful view of the eiffel tower - the balcony was amazing. We were lucky to have received one of the rooms with a view, and I don't know if this was due to our request or because the hotel was not full. The room was very quiet and clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice. Receptionists were very helpful and spoke English very well. Our only complaint-which we did not actually complain to management about-was that one day we came back to the hotel to find that both of our contact lens case were missing. I assume that the cleaner would not steal these, so my guess is that she just swept them into the trash without regard for whether they were temporary or not. Besides that, no complaints!

<Content>Great Hotel, Prime Location My daughter and I stayed here for six nights and had a great experience with this hotel:Rooms - Spotless!Hotel Staff - Very helpful and caring.Location - You can walk to any attraction / museum from this hotel.Food - There are hundreds of places to eat within a 5 minute walk from the hotel.WiFi - Free in the lobby. We Skyped and video chatted home every night.The front desk will book any tour you like for no additional fee and they will arrange for a ride back to the airport if needed. Some of the reviews comment on the small size of the rooms. Think about it, who goes to Paris to sit in their hotel room? We showered and we slept. The rest of the time we were out touring, eating, shopping and drinking wine.

<Content>Roaches? We booked this hotel because of the high ratings on Trip Advisor. While it did live up to what many people have written about in terms of the recent remodeling, our big problems was probable tiny roaches! On our first night, we accidently turned the fan/air conditioning (?) on, and we later noticed bugs that appeared to be tiny roaches on the ceiling and one later on the bathroom floor -- for a total of 5-6. The second night, we left the fan off and the window cracked open, and no bugs...We also requested the rooms on the 4th and 5th floor mentioned in previous reviews, but they couldn't guarantee it. We ended up getting a 2nd floor room (224?), which had a nice view of the Eiffel Tower when we leaned out the window, but not like the others.The hotel is in a great location, as people mentioned -- a 10-15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower, 5 minute walk from the Ecole Militaire metro stop, and 7 minutes from Rue Cler which has great places to eat. But, the night we had difficulty sleeping because we were afraid the bugs would fall on us kind of outweighed the positives.

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed at the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel for four nights in October 2008. We booked our rooms almost a year ago and requested #55  #56 based upon previous reviews. Although the hotel staff clearly indicated a specific room could not be guaranteed, we were fortunate to have our requests granted.We were not disappointed with the rooms or the fabulous views of the Eiffel Tower, Invalides  Sacre Couer. The rooms we stayed in were recently updated so everything appeared new  spotless. People have mentioned the lack of alarm clocks, however, we utilized wake-up calls and had no complaints with this service.The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks from the metro and easy walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, Rue Cler  dozens of great restaurants. If you enjoy taking the bus, there are several options on the same street as the hotel.The staff at the Duquesne are very helpful and friendly, everyone we encountered spoke English (thank you Jessica and Estelle!). We will return!

<Content>A very nice place to call home in Paris.. Winding up a positive 8-day stay. Here's how this place paid off:-- Quiet rooms! Paris can be noisy, but not here. If you need 2 rooms ask for 17 and 18, end units so no shared walls with others and you can create a mini-suite by locking an outside hallway door.-- Rooms recently redone, clean and well appointed. We found the beds comfy, nice bedding, a good night's rest through the jetlag.-- Helpful, hard-working front desk. Estelle and Julie are formidable one-two punch, proactive on problem solving, fast online with reservations, etc., better English than one would find in Paris, Tx.-- Location, location, loc... you get the point. 3-minute walk to Metro, 5-minute to Napoleon's mausoleum, Invalides, 10-minutes Rodin museum, 15-minutes to Eiffel Tower. Best of all, just off Rue Clare 5 minutes to stunning fromagerie Marie Anne Cantin, another 30 seconds to equally awesome boulangerie Pain d'Epis, both Top 10 Paris ratings. Gives you Paris' best meal under 10 Euros if you bring it back to the room.-- A word about the 7th. Pleasant and very safe, but for slamming nightlife you'll need to Metro elsewhere. Some nice cafes and parks adjacent, but this is not the spot for clubbing.-- And full disclosure asterisk. As I sit here typing, about the only downside that comes to mind is that rooms can run small for a standard, as does the bathroom.

<Content>Nice hotel This is a very well maintained property in good location near the Eiffel Tower and very close to the Metro station for exploring Paris. The rooms are very small but spotless, cosy feel and v comfortable bed.The hotel is very expensive for what it is but that seems to be the norm for the City as a whole. Free internet access in the lobby for hotel guests which is a very nice feature. We did not sample breakfast as we did not feel it was worth 鈧?2pp when there were cheaper alternatives within very close walking distance in the many cafes etc.One seemingly insignificant grips, but irritating nonetheless, is the total lack of any English channels on the in room TV, not even by PPV. If you do not speak French you will go bonkers if you have to spend any long spells relaxing in your room. Very strange considering one would assume this property would attract many international visitors and to not even have a basic news channel to watch is frustrating (let alone Hollywood movies badly overdubbed).Minor issues aside, we would recommend the Duquesne for first time visitors to Paris, it's in a good neighbourhood with decent accessibility to everywhere. If returning we would probably stay elsewhere but that's taking nothing away from this very nice hotel.The staff were generally friendly although (just a tip) when your guests are checking out in the early morning and request a taxi, it's not good etiquette to send them out onto the cold dark streets to hail down a cab to try save some call out charges. Good intention perhaps, but we nearly missed our connecting airport coach transfer (hardly worth the stress for 鈧?).There was also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which we found strange but there was a chargeable minibar if one was so inclined.

We booked our room 9 months in advance and when we checked in, the room we originally requested was just what we got!! Our stay was for 6 nights and we could not have been more pleased with every aspect of the hotel and staff. Great location too! We will be back!!! Thank you.

<Content>Awesome Hotel We stayed here for 2 separate stints in our Europe trip.1st part:Arrived early afternoon at Hotel Duquesne and they told us that we didn't have room for 1 night out of 3 nights, and that the booked us a room at the Hotel Splendid down the street. We stupidly agreed to this arrangement not knowing that Splendid wasn't so splendid. the only redeeming part was that we had a view of the Eiffel Tower from our hotel window. But after getting our room at Duquesne the next day (they took our bags for us), we realized that Duquesne was so much nicer. We didnt' have a view of the Tower, but the bed, bathroom and room was so much nicer. Breakfast was covered for us, because of their mishap, which was great. Eggs, ham, good coffee, etc.2nd part:came back to Hotel Duquesne after a couple more cities in Europe and it felt like home instantly. They gave us a room on the 4th floor with a perfect view of the Eiffel. If we go back I'll definitely request that room.Great location, 7 minute run to the Eiffel Tower, right by some good brasseries/cafes, metro, clean rooms, good breakfast, pleasant service, decent price. When i go back to Paris I'll definitely book here again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I booked this hotel through a friend's recommendation, it is only rated as a 3 star, but I would definitely say it was nearer a 4 star. The staff were really friendly. The rooms were really nice and the location was perfect. It is only a short walk from the Eiffel Tower and the metro station is just down the road, although we didn't take the metro as we like to walk alot. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so cannot comment on that. All I can say is this hotel made our visit very enjoyable.

<Content>Perfect for Paris! I was very excited about staying in this hotel, for starters, it was one of the only ones in our price range without cheap old furniture, two it was being renovated, three the eiffel tower being sooo close!We arrived around 10pm, checkin was quick and easy, however lift is quite small as expected! So one person at a time when up with their luggage. We were in a room known as La Sorbonne. It was a very nice triple room, with a seperate toilet, and two windows. The beds are incredibly comfortable! Considering you will be walking around all day they are the best to just relax in. I've read many reviews about the breakfast not being good. well my family LOVED the breakfast. For 12 Euro, you got croissants, bread, canned fruit, scramble eggs, bacon, pastries etc. 12 Euro sounds like a lot, but on wkends the bakery next door is not open and it's about 2 blocks till you get to a cafe for breakfast and you're looking to pay 8Euro for tea/coffee, croissant and bread. Where as at the hotel you get a semi cooked breakfast and you can have as much as you like. Maids in the breakfast room dont speak much english but they are very friendly and helpful. As far as food in the area goes, there were VERY few restaurants. Especially family style ones. Sure they had a few restaurants but with interesting menu choices, i know this is france, but you could have some trouble finding food. We found a very nice lebanese restaurant that served mixed grills which were so good and although their menu is not in english the friendly elderly man is more then willing to translate. Unfortunately i can't remember the name of the place but its next to a restaurant called Pizza Tina's. Anothe place we ate at, it was ok. Location wise, its a residential, quiet street, close to the L'open Invalides stop about 3-5min walk. The Eiffel tower is around a 15-20min walk. Front desk staff were very helpful, specially Lucie who organised us euro disney passes, l'open passes, metro advice etc, however always ask to book a taxi in advance, never listen if they say you dont need to book one an hour ahead. As we had a show at 7 and were waiting and waiting for a taxi, as we were told we wouldnt have to wait and there was no need to ring ahead. Insist on ringing ahead!!

<Content>Best Bed EVER! We stayed at the Duquesne for 5 nights to start off our European honeymoon. The staff were very courteous at the front desk and showed us to the room. Everything in the hotel is small. The lobby is small, the elevator is tiny and the hallways are tight but that's Paris for you. The Room: The room was TINY!!! It was room 10 and it was basically a bed with about 6 inches on either side. The bathroom was tiny as well as only one person could stand at it at a time. There was no real storage in the hotel room either but that being said, it was the most comfortable bed ever and we slept well into the first morning there. The next day we requested an upgrade and were immediately shown a deluxe room that was still small by North American standards but was much more appropriate. The Staff: For the most part we were very pleased with them. They all spoke good english and were able to help us with any problem. They were having a computer problem while we were there so our upgrade took some time but as we ended up with what we wanted, we arent' going to complain.The Location: Great location, close to metro and the Eiffel tower. No complaints there.Food: The breakfast there is not included and at 11 euros, I would suggest grabbing a croissant or baguette at the patisserie on up the road. The thai place next door is indeed really good.All in all, while it was not the nicest hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon, it was a very comfortable stay and we would recommend it, although only the upgraded room. We also stayed at the Plaza Tour Eiffel which has a higher trip advisor rating and I would stay in the Duquesne over it.

<Content>Amazing hotel We have just returned from our western european vacation. I frequently travelled in France and I found the perfect hotel in Paris this summer. It was a fantastic stay. The staff (especially Estelle, Lucie, Julie) and the perfect rooms make our last 4 days in Paris so good that we want to come back as soon as possible to the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel. It was beyond our expectations and I speak of experiences(lot of travelling). It is wonderful to come back after a long day of walking, visiting, shopping and almost feel at home. This is what is Duquesne Eifel Hotel. Bravo et merci!

<Content>Excellent Choice My wife, teenaged son  I stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel for four nights in the beginning of July and couldn't have asked for a better hotel. We had booked a triple room (with a view of the Eiffel Tower if possible) and were given separate adjoining rooms, one with a view out the window if you open it and look to the right. The rooms, not large but adequate, were recently renovated to a very high standard and had very comfortable beds. The weather was fairly warm for a couple of the days we stayed and the air conditioning was a great relief after a full day of walking and touring. The rooms were very quiet as other reviewers had mentioned because of the new windows. The staff was very helpful at the desk and the cleaning staff do an outstanding job.It was our first (and definitely not last) trip to Paris and the location was perfect for going to the Eiffel Tower, Napolean's Tomb (really worthwhile) and excellent restaurants. The Metro is great for getting around anywhere and the station is a five minute walk. Paris is a truly great city and our stay at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel made it all the better. I do not hesitate to recommend staying here.

<Content>Tr猫s Bien The hotel's location is virtually unbeatable. From the balcony on the fifth floor we could directly look at tour Eiffel. All major sights are in walking distance and there is a Metro station 5 min away at Place de l'Ecole Militaire. The hotel was very clean and the staff extremely helpful, the guy at the front desk had some very decent tips about where to go and where the tourist traps are. Paris as a whole was a very pleasant city to explore. I am German and my wife is American and we discovered only friendliness and world openness in this amazing city. Next time we are in Paris, we will certainly stay at the Duquesne Eiffel again.

<Content>It's a great as everyone says! It's everything we hoped it would be! I don't have much to add to everyone else's positive review except that I wholeheartedly agree. This is a wonderful European hotel. Having travelled all over Europe, this is one of my favorites.With it's charming rooms, comfy beds, good air conditioning, reasonably priced minibars, and helpful/quirky english speaking staff, this is a particularly good choice for Americans. Some of the rooms are quite small, and you'll surely get a chuckle from the elevator, but that's Europe. And if your lucky enough to get a view..... oh my do they have them!!!! The staff can be a teensy bit touchy if you try to request a view, but just understand they don't really charge extra for the views specifically which means everyone wants it and not everyone can have it... just ask nicely and be patient. We didn't think the breakfast was all that spectacular but there are many alternative choices in the area and it's optional. Some fresh fruit (not out of a can) would have been nice as part of the breakfast...All in all, an excellent choice.

<Content>Au revoir et 脿 bient么t The location of this hotel is just perfect for everything. Eiffel tower and river Seine are in few minutes of walk. Hotel rooms are small, as they usually are in Paris, but very clean and nice. Spotless, I would say. Thank you for cleaning it up every day. Very nice decor. Nice little Patisseries and Boulangeries around the hotel to have breakfast or coffee break. We highly recommend this hotel for its location, exellent service and recently renovated rooms. We had wonderful holiday with my husband, and will come back in Paris and to this carming little hotel. We will not want to stay anywere else when coming back. Great value for the money. Merci.Nina and Kimmo, Finland

<Content>Safe, clean, affordable, well located, welcoming and stylish Wow - where to start? It is an excellent hotel, and the best value hotel I have used in Paris. I've been visiting Paris for 20 years and this is the best hotel (but not the most expensie) I've stayed in. Excellent location in a pleasant, quiet but very central area. Close to metro, but you can walk to many places in central Paris from the hotel. You can also stock up on mineral water, fruit, bread etc in shops nearby. The hotel is very stylish, in fact I'd say it is sophisticated - I got the impression that someone with an interior design background has been involved in this or they've paid a lot to get a good professional designer in. The room I stayed in was very nicely decorated and furnished - in fact better than most 4 star hotels I have stayed in. Everything was perfect, including the choice of paint colour on the woodwork and the inspired striped carpet! The lighting was unusually good - with all the lights on it was bright enough for me to read by, I'm really sick of dismal rooms when you turn the lights on full and you still can't read. Reception staff spoke fluent English, were efficient, friendly, and more approachable and helpful than I have found before in a Paris hotel. The breakfast serving staff were great also - good English, friendly, helpful. I'm not one for asking a lot of questions of reception staff, but I noticed some other English speaking guests doing so and the receptionist was really helping with advice, hints etc. Both check-in and check-out were rapid.The reason I booked here and not another place? Fire safety. I have a thing about it, and, being English, despair of why such an advanced country as France doesn't have the same standards we insist on in hotels in the UK. I only book Paris hotels if there are smoke detectors, which rules a lot of them out! And there are mains-wired detectors, and alarms, in the public areas - so I felt safe. But there didn't seem to be a smoke detector or alarm in my room. I was disappointed about this - I had read on some website (maybe not the hotel one, but one of the many that carry details about hotels) that there were smoke detectors or alarms in each room. If there was a detector or alarm in my room I could not find it. However, I would stay again - it's well built, and as well as the public areas coverage there was a sturdy fire door to segregate the bit of corridor my room was in from the rest of the corridor, and so I felt entirely safe. (PS I wish reviewers on tripadvisor would comment on this feature - a couple of years ago I stayed in a very positively reviewed Paris Hotel that I thought was a death-trap, with no smoke detectors or alarms - and yet there were dozens of people who'd written how nice the receptionists were! Hotels like this one, that invest in safety, should be acknowledged for this). Good quality flat screen tv with reasonable range of channels. A great view of the Eiffel Tower, shimmering and glittering. On a reasonably busy road but not too bad, and the double (or is it triple?) glazing highly effective. Good plumbing, in fact very good - easy to get the temperature balance right, and a proper shower screen (which you don't always get in Paris). I stay in hotels quite a lot, and this one was unusually clean. There is not even a hint of limescale build-up anywhere in the bathroom, and no dust. You get the impression that someone obsessive about quality is involved in running this hotel. Attention to detail is everywhere. I didn't use it, but there was a laptop with internet access and checking it briefly it seemed to be working okay. Oh, and whilst it's a newspaper I abhor and never buy because it attacks my home city (Liverpool), the English newspaper The Guardian was stocked. Nice for those English liberals, public servants and Liverpool-haters out there. Bed comfortable - I prefer a firm mattress and found it ok, not as hard as I like at home, but a good hard hotel firm. If I stay somewehre with a soft mattress I usualy end up sleeping on the floor, but no such problem here. I slept very well. Noise between rooms was a bit of a mystery to me so hard to judge after just one stay of just one night. Generally I think it's very good indeed - for an old building excellent. However, the doors close noisily and someone staying in a room close to me came back late and seemed to open and close the door a lot......the hall lights (movement activated?) may have confused them, I don't know. It woke me up. But no noise of neighbouring bathrooms (which is common in old converstions) or of TVs, which makes me think the sound insulation is good. I think if you are noise-phobic (as I am, as well as being fire-phobic and rudeness-phobic) you will probably get on well with this hotel. What can be improved? The quality of breakfast was acceptable but a bit disappointing for the price (12 euro) despite the lovely staff. Coffee in particular was a let-down - murky and just quite not good enough. I mainly stay in English hotels, where the quality of coffee has come on hugely in recent years, and sadly Paris hotels (this one is not alone) aren't quite there with coffee at the moment. Choice of food very limited. Just not quite good enough for the money. Okay, don't be put off, it's not a deal-breaker, but I think it could be improved. Served in a lovely stone room. The minibar prices are not at all good! 2.50 for a packet of crisps!!!!!!!!!! (chips to Americans). I know all hotels charge a lot for minibars, but with the pound-exchange rate being so bad, it just hurt as I arrived hungry and raided the mini-bar! Lots of little shops nearby, so don't make my mistake! So there are two things that I think might be improved, but obviously everything comes at a price, and the price for the room was excellent, so I won't complain too loudly. At last I have found a hotel in Paris I really like, and feel comfortable and safe in that doesn't cost a fortune! Whoever is repsonsible for all this, well done and thank you.

<Content>Great with a 4 year old! We loved being so close to the Eiffel Tower. We had 2 nights in Paris with our 4 year old son and just wanted to be near a place he'd hopefully remember. The hotel was very comfortable and we had a corner room on the second floor that was a nice size, We had booked a double superior room and made sure that the reception knew we were traveling with a four year old. I was expecting a folding bed in the room but found that there was a port a crib instead (like a long pack-n-play). I was concerned that it would be too small but our son just fit in. Since it was directly in front of the window where you could see the Eiffel Tower, and because he was so tired, he had no trouble sleeping there. Neither did we, the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was terrific and separate toilet were great for our stay. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Our room was not available when we got in around 11am but she told us to return around 12:30 or 1:30. We were able to walk directly to the Eiffel Tower - 10 to 15 minutes - and go directly up. It was fabulous and when we returned the room was ready and we were able to take a nap. Unfortunately, we had a problem with the airport shuttle. It was easy arranging it and finding it. We paid 51 euros for 3 people and gave the driver 60 Euro. While we were taking a nap, reception called and said the shuttle company said we only paid 40 Euro. While they eventually said that they would let it drop, it was not a great experience. Otherwise, the hotel was very nice with a good location.

<Content>Exceeded our expectations We booked this hotel after reading reviews from the Trip Advisor website, especially from families. We stayed with a three year old and a 7 month old in a cot as well as seven pieces of luggage, so although we were a bit cramped, that was largely due to our circumstances. The room was just beautiful with a very comfy bed indeed. Everything was spotless and although we werent considered as being in a room with a 'view' when we opened our window and looked out to the right, there was the Tower in all its glory - a very special added benefit! We've stayed in several hotels in Paris over the years and rate this as the best one yet.All the staff are VERY accommodating, VERY friendly and helpful especially with children, from reception to the lovely lady who gave me hot water for the baby every morning. The location is second to none, around the corner from Rue Cler and walking distance for a picnic on the lawn under the Tower.I cant recommend this hotel enough although would almost like to keep it my little secret so it isnt booked out the next time I want to go there! With so many super-small and average yet expensive rooms in Paris, anyone deciding to stay there is making the right decision!

<Content>Great Location, Price and Service! We stayed for only two nights and we knew we had to make every moment count. The location was perfect for this. We walked almost everywhere and when we needed to motivate our 9 year old we jumped on the subway (Metro). The room was very comfortable and large for european standards. The staff was welcoming and helpful. We came to Paris via the Eurostar and you can easily jump on the subway from Gard du Nord to the hotel. Again, great location, price and service. We would definitley stay here again!

<Content>Very nice hotel Hotel was very, very good. We (sister, daughter and myself) booked a triple, hoping we would be assigned the room with the view of the Eiffel Tower, as others have stated in their reviews, but we were not. Instead we were assigned two connecting rooms. They were very nice, the beds were soooo comfortable. Subway was close. Lucie was great. Asked for help from one of the night front desk men and he didn't seem too interested in helping us find an address. Different man the next night looked at me like I had three heads when I asked him to dispose of a broken suitcase for us. Other than that everything was great. Would definitely stay here again. Restaurant nearby that Lucie recommended, E Vin 7, was excellent. Mentioned that the hotel sent you over and they gave us a free glass of wine.

<Content>My Home Away From Home I just completed an 11 night stay at this hotel (business and vacation mixed.) Having been to Paris three times previously, I have decided that nowhere could be better than the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel in the 7th Arr. (neighborhood area). I read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and decided this time on the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel--and I didn't go wrong! It is a charming hotel located across from the Ecole Militaire and about a block from Les Invalides in a beautiful area of boulevards, trees, and lovely cafes. Cross the boulevard, and walk directly to the Champs du Mars, the gorgeous park in which sits the Eiffel Tower! Just two blocks from the hotel is the Rue Cler market street (think chocolate, wine, flowers). Julie, the hotel's manager is a dream to work with. She helped me make the reservation directly with the hotel (and didn't get frustrated at all when my travel dates had to change). All of the staff are fluent in English and were most helpful in making reservations, taxi services, and offering directions. As an addicted-to-ice American, I even had that available from the lower-level kitchen! My room was lovely, and large compared to other places I have stayed in Paris. Of course, I was most fortunate to have a room on the 5th floor with a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower, glittering at night like a diamond pendant hanging from the sky. The hotel has recently undergone a decor change (from most online photos). The subtle tones of ecru, plum, green, and burgundy are most relaxing after a long day of working, walking, and sight seeing. The rooms are cleaned daily and everything in my room and bath was always spotless! Breakfast at the hotel is a bargain, particularly with a large pot of coffee, juice, eggs, and all of the wonderful pastries of Paris. Convenient to the hotel is the metro stop---the easiest and fastest way to get around Paris. From my metro I could travel with no difficulty to the area of the Louvre, Grand Boulevards, the Marais, Latin Quarter, and the outer areas of Paris. If you are going to Paris, make sure not to overlook the Hotel Duquesne. Although listed as a 3 star hotel, I give this darling spot a 5 star rating in every way!

<Content>My favorite hotel in Paris Having trawled many websites looking for the perfect hotel for our silver wedding anniversary celebrations we happened upon Duquesne Eiffel Paris. We booked a Superior room for 5 nights and had a fantastic stay. Lucie was very helpful and the room was spotless 鈥?they were just renovated. We enjoyed the balcony and, an added bonus, the subway station was just near the hotel so travelling in Paris was amazingly. Altogether great accommodation in a wonderful location.

<Content>Great Stay My wife and I stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel for 4 nights in May 2008. The staff is very friendly, spoke multiple languages, and seemed willing to help with just about anything. The rooms are clean, well maintained, and decent size for Paris. The staff alone would make this a good choice, but we also loved the location. It is not a party area, but easy walking distance to the tower, and Nap's tomb. There are also cafes, restaurants, and markets in easy walking distance. The double decker bus stop is 2 minutes away, and cabs regularly stop in front of the hotel. In conclusion, great hotel, great city, great people...we would definitely go again.

<Content>Good Choice This was a very nice boutique hotel. Although our room was very small, it was very comfortable and quiet. Great location for the Eiffel Tower the Metro and bistros. We had one of the best meals from a restaurant called Romantique Cafe located 3 blocks from the hotel and also recommended by the hotel. The breakfast was good (excellent coffee) for 11 euros -sounds expensive, but when you are paying $6 euros for coffee and a small croissant in the brasserie $11 isn't so bad for a full breakfast. The two ladies that serve in the breakfast room were just sweet, and the hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. We will be going back to Paris and hopefully the Duquesne will be available for our next stay.

<Content>What A View! ROOM 55 for my 55th Birthday! I contacted the hotel directly  was pleasantly surprised with the quick response to my reservation  later for airport taxi information. LUCY was charming  oh so helpful with our requests for a nice resturant, a taxi to the pier, airport, or how far was this or that. The hotel was recently renovated  is taorable  clean. We had a view of the E Tower not only from the bed, but the small bathtub. Nice little touches like maps, shoe cleaner machine, free internet access  a small bar in lobby which opens in the evening.. The outside tables  chairs were relaxing both day  evening, We walked just about everywhere but Sacred Heart Basillica - far right bank. Quiet safe neighorhood, with a few cafes nearby. E Tower 10-12 minutes, Rodin museum 10 mins, Napoleon's tomb 5 mins, dO'rsay museum 25 mins, Louvre museum 35 mins, Seine River 15 mins to dock where boats leave for tour of the city which is especially beautiful at night. Only needed to use Metro once. Don't miss Monet's WALLS of Water Lilies in the de l'Orangerie museun on the border of the beautiful Tuileries Garden which is in front of the Louvre. Monet's pond, gardens  house (Giverny) is worth the trip.- 50 miles north of Paris. If you can't fit it in -on the right bank is the Marmottan-Claude Monet museum. It has many of Monet's work. The most beautiful stained glass was in Saint Chapelle - not to be missed. We couldn't have found a sweeter hotel in a better spot. Why stay in a big city hotel when this boutique hotel has so much to offer? I searched for hours on the internet for a romantic hotel  we couldn't have been more pleased.The mangement reads these reviews  answers  addresses any problems - that says a lot. We will be telling ANYONE we know going to Paris to book at Hotel Duquesne and to say Hi to LUCY for us!  The Johnsons Long Island, New York

<Content>Perfect location We had a great stay at your hotel in part due to your excellent staff. Estelle was very helpful as she assisted in booking reservations for dinner and to a local spa (which was fabulous by the way) as well as providing directions when needed...Merci Beaucoup, Estelle! The hotel is in a great location...very safe to return to at night. We enjoyed our stay and would return for another trip to Paris. Thank you.

<Content>Excellent Location, Helpful, Friendly Staff Stayed at the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel for 3 nights in May 2008.Very efficient check-in by helpful, English speaking staff. Found all staff over the duration of our stay to be very friendly and only too willing to assist. Hotel is about 200 metres from Ecole Militaire Metro station with good connections to CDG Airport.As you would expect, the bedrooms are not huge but they are well-appointed and very clean. Free internet access in the lounge and a small bar.Very convenient location, as the name implies it is only 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and 5 from Les Invalides with Napoleon's Tomb. If, like us, you are looking for a comfortable base in a nice area for a few days, I would certainly recommend this hotel. Plenty restaurants within a 5 minute walk and lots of bars. Little or no traffic noise during the night even though we had a room which overlooked the main street.Found Paris to be more expensive than previous visits due to the Euro exchange rate. Still a wonderful place to visit with a multitude of things to see and do. Beware of con artists pretending to have just found a large gold ring beside you and willing to give it to you for a few euros - watched a few of them try this well-rehearsed routine with unsuspecting tourists.

<Content>TOTALLY UNORGANIZED At first we were impressed by the location (quiet avenue, walking distance from the Eiffel Tower) and the fact that the rooms had been recently renovated and everything was super clean.But later the true quality of this hotel was revealed. First, the air conditioning was not working properly, so the 2 rooms we had were a hot as a sauna. The very friendly but absolutely incompetent girl at the desk simply apologized but did not provide any kind of solution. We were basically told to grin and bear it, as it was a holiday in Paris and there was no staff to fix it. Changing rooms was not a possibility either. Later on the day, we asked for an iron, which of course was not available in the room. My husband was sent to a steamy room in the basement and had to iron his shirt himself, as again, there was no staff/laundry service available. The last straw was when, having tickets for the Opera, we asked Reception to book a taxi for us with an hour in advance. The girl said that it was not necessary to book it that early, as 10 minutes was enough. Of course, the taxi she called was over 15 minutes late, so we started to get worried and went out to the street to get one ourselves. Guess what? When we are sitting inside the car, already running late and risking missing the show we had booked months in advance, she ran outside to the street, opened the door, and demanded us to get off the car immediately as she had already called a taxi for us and we could not cancel it. We replied it was her own fault as she had evidently called it too late, but she was mad and demanded the taxi driver to stop. Just then the other taxi arrived, and we were forced to get in it. By the time we got there, we barely had time to get to our seats a minute before it started. We were so stressed and shocked that the whole evening was ruined. Oh, and did I mention that the transfer she booked for us to pick us from the airport was ALSO 20 minutes late? To sum up, the administration of the hotel is completely unreliable, so if you decide to stay there, be prepared to book all your services independently and deal with the insane girl at the front desk. After the taxi incident she was SO rude that we were actually happy to leave Paris.

<Content>What a waste of time! I was really impressed with the reviews and recommendations for this hotel so quickly put it in my top 3 to look into. I was after a balcony and view so decided to contact the hotel directly to make an enquiry. I explained very clearly that we require a room with balcony and view and were wanting this confirmed before we made the booking, as we were going to enquire with many hotels until we got what we were after. I advised I would not book if I could not have this. We were happy to ask around as not going to Paris until August 08.So, after their reply with what they could offer for our dates, we kept up the communication and booked a room- only to be informed once we booked and paid a booking fee, that the rooms we were after were all gone!!!! Oh but you can have another nice one that is not what you want....typical dodgy hotel tricks. I know hotels do it, cos most people will take what they are given but I had one requirement so not good enough for me!I was really disappointed with this hotels service and I sent a couple of emails asking why I was not told in the first place that they did not have any rooms available with my requirements, but they avoided the question, just advising they are limited and what we can have etc.So I have sent a final reply to them  requested it be passed to the manager but unsurprisingly, now that I have cancelled the booking I have not heard a peep from them...All other replies came back within 1/2 a day and now its been 3 or so days without a word. Since I am not going to be giving them any more money I guess they just dont care what I think, I am just one chump in many. Be very careful when you have specific requirements...make sure you get a straight answer from them or you might get the broom closet.The fact that they do not have a room for us is fine, I understand they have a limited number. Thats why I asked first! What really annoys me is that they should have been honest in their reply to my enquiry. I was very clear that we needed this confirmed before booking and they pretty much just tricked us into booking. Not what I call good service at all. I will never look at staying here again simply due to the appalling service. And its not just one staff member, my initial query was answered my the Manager Julie herself. I am sure its a nice hotel and I would have liked to see that, instead I was mucked around by an incompetent, dishonest hotel business.What makes me laugh (now) is that after wasting 4 days in correspondence with this I hotel, I enquired with Hotel Les Jardins d'Eiffel...not expecting much after this experience as I was very annoyed with the whole thing, packing a sad n all that. But they were friendly, helpful and honest in what they could offer. So I now have my perfect hotel room for my anniversary, with a balcony and view of the Eiffel tower- just at a different hotel! I will of course let everyone know if it worked out....

<Content>Room double booked! Rigid  On arrival at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel I was welcomed with information that my room booked double booked. The Duquesne Eiffel had arranged another hotel in the area to take us, the Hotel Splendid, which was OK but not my hotel of choice.The option of staying one night, at the Splendid, and the remainder back at the Duquesne Eiffel or staying at the splendid for the entire stay was offered.I suggested that as compensation for the error made by the Duquesne Eiffel that they pay for the night at the Splendid and that I would then stay for the reaminder of the time with them; A fair and reasonable request (where the Splendid, the Duquesne Eiffel and myself benefit equally) I thought!This suggestion was meet by a unyieldng and, in my oppinion, some what incomprehensible no! Why the Duquesne Eiffel would rather pass my entire custom to the Splendid, a competitor, rather than reimburse me for my inconvenience astounded me.I therefore did not stay at the Duquesne Eiffel! Prefering to stay with the Splendid who were very welcoming.The only compensation offered was free breakfast which, if the Splendid is anything to go by, would be the bare essentials continetal for 11 euros; not what I would call value for money!

<Content>Immaculate and great location! My fiance and I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights from the 18th April in an inside double room. We had high expectations based on the other reviews, and I'm glad to say we were in no way disappointed. Professional, attentive and friendly staff in reception who are a credit to the hotel. Room was immaculate, modern and although was on the small side it had everything we needed and more (mini-bar, flat screen tv and a very comfy bed). Great location with only a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and a couple of minutes to the Ecole Militaire metro station. Thai restaurant next door was very good and some good pavement bars beside the metro station where we enjoyed several late night bottles of wine. Would recommend this hotel to my friends and would definitely go back. (Would book a superior upgraded room to try and get a view of the Eiffel Tower twinkling at night, although this cannot be guaranteed). Rooms on the top floor have a balcony! Suggestion = some background music in the reception area/bar would be nice to listen to when having a drink. Everything else was PERFECT.P.S (Experienced some rather rude and arrogant staff in other french restaurants - one waiter argued that I wouldn't need a side order of fries with my dinner . I am a big eating tiny woman!! Another refused to let us sit at an unreserved outside table where we could both see the Eiffel Tower because it was a table for 4 people. This was at 11pm and the place was half empty!!)

<Content>Very nice Hotel in a good location My daughter and I spent three nights in Paris and decided on the Duquesne Eiffel based on the reviews that I read on Trip Advisor. We were able to take the RER/Metro from CDG airport to the Ecole Militaire metro station in about an hour. There are quite a few restaurants, shops and sidewalk cafes within walking distance of the hotel.The hotel itself is in very nice condition and may have been recently renovated. The rooms, while small by American standards are modern and very comfortable. The street outside was pretty noisy, but the windows were very effectively soundproofed.

<Content>Great Hotel!! My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Duquesne during our stay in Paris. We originally booked our stay there because of the reviews we read on tripadvisor.com and because it was so close to the sites in the Invalides area. The hotel was very clean and all of the front desk were extremely polite and helpful. The floor our room was on had some renovations but there was nothing in the way and the room we stayed in was beautifully renovated. We had a magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower and even though hotel rooms in Paris are quite small the room we had was quite large. The room had a very comfortable Queen size bed, small desk, spacious closet, mini bar, in room safe and detached bathroom with a full tub/shower. The hotel is quite close to some great restaurants, cafes, many scenic sites including the Eiffel Tower and close to the Metro also. There is breakfast served in the morning for an additional fee but we always ate at a cafe near by. The rates were very reasonable and this is one Hotel I would stay at again!! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Paris.

<Content>A room with a view Getting a nice hotel in a big European city at a price you can afford can be a problem. The Duquesne (pronounce it Ducain or the taxi drivers wont understand you) was recommended by friends so we knew it would be fine. We were not disappointed and like most of the reviewers here we would highly commend the staff. Yes the rooms are small - that's the compromise. For a similar price in other European cities you would be lucky to get the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms and the peaceful, spacious location. The avenues around the hotel are wide and the streets are populated but not crowded, so you feel safe walking home at night.We didn't bother with breakfast in the hotel as there are nice bakeries, cafes and brasseries nearby and it was fun to check them out each morning - these are all cheaper than the hotel too.We ate some fantastic evening meals in Paris but I'll just mention the best one locally here - Le P'tit Troquet, 28 rue de l'Exposition. It only has about 6 or 7 tables and is like sitting in an antiques shop. At 32 Euros for 3 courses we thought it was great value for such quality. English is spoken and we felt it was a nice discreet French experience. There are livelier places - the hotel recommends No 7 de vins for some reason, but we found their food bland, mostly cold, and more expensive - though the staff were welcoming and friendly.The mini bar back at the Duquesne is good value as these things go. And a nice half bottle of wine rounds the evening off well. Enjoy Paris!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Near the Eiffel Tower This is the 3rd year we have gone to this hotel and the location is perfect and the neighborhood is safe and local. Julie Palisse from the hotel each year has made the stay special as has the rest of the staff. Very homey and it just has be remodeled. I would rather stay here than any other place in Paris.

<Content>Would love to go back There is not one negative thing to report about this hotel, which is not exactly a common experience. The location is excellent - within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower and near lovely cafes and shopping. The room was newly updated and beautiful, sparkling clean, everything worked perfectly, and the beds were very comfortable. The room was substantially more spacious than one we paid the same price for in London. The breakfast tasted very good. But what really makes this property shine is the staff. I don't think I've ever encountered an entire staff that is as gracious and helpful as at the Duquesne Eiffel. From the time we checked in until we checked out, and even during the reservation process, we were dazzled by the desk and breakfast room staff. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat if I had the opportunity, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>A fabulous hotel: the perfect base for the perfect holiday. I have just returned from a fabulous stay at this lovely hotel. I took my Mum to Paris to celebrate her 80th birthday, and found this gem of a hotel after hours of internet searching. It really did live up to all the best reviews. Although the hotel is being refurbished at the moment, which meant that the corridors were in the process of being decorated, we were fortunate to be in a newly refurbished room, and everything was immaculate. Very tasteful decor,everything spotlessly clean, and comfortable beds and pillows. The room was big enough and had great wardrobe space and an immaculate bathroom with a great shower and boiling hot water. It took us a long time to work out how to open the mini bar but it was fun trying! We were incredibly lucky to get room 55 with twin beds as I had requested - I draw the line at sharing a double with my mum! The views from 55 are really breathtaking - the tower is so much more impressive by night, and Les Invalides is equally stunning. We could even see Sacre Coeurs in the distance! Obviously not all the rooms can offer this view but it's only a 15 minute walk to get to the real thing and it's a lovely walk too. The location of the hotel is fantastic - metro stations close by and easy to walk to Musee Rodin, Les Invalides and of course to the Tower and River. We also walked to the D'Orsay and across to the Place de La Concorde.The staff at this hotel were brilliant. All spoke perfect English and were so helpful, planning metro routes and offering advice. We would recommend the dinner cruise on the Bateau Parisiennes - at 95 euros it wasn't cheap, but we were treated like royaly, the food was delicious and there was more wine than we could drink, along with great music and the breathtaking views of all the sights along the river. It was a spectacular end to our four day break, and my Mum loved every minute. We recommend the Thai restaurant adjacent to the hotel, and the Italian just round the corner.I can't imagine how anyone could be disappointed by this hotel, and although the view is a bonus, it's still worth visiting because of the lovely decor, comfort, friendly staff and fantastic location. Next time I'll be taking my husband and hopefully leaving the kids at home...

When we needed to place to stay during a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to Paris, I defaulted to this hotel without really considering any other.Coincidentally, we got the same room, #21.While the rooms are indeed small, one must understand that one's in Paris, not Pittsburgh. It's one of the most visited (read: expensive) cities in the world. For the money we spent, I think we received great value. Here's why (and my more general comments apply to both visits):ALL of the staff were friendly, helpful, and thoughtful. The front desk staff, notably Eric, couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. When we arrived early, via the Thalys, he not only got us into an available room, but provided us with coffee, juice, and croissants to raise our energy level. In the evening, he'd greet us and offer a glass of wine or an espresso. Our room, while small, was quite comfortable. We heard no street noise thru the window, and either no guest was inconsiderate or the rooms' soundproofing is excellent .Yes, as one reviewer mentioned, the room's decor was in need of an update; the hotel owner, however, is in the process of completely renovating the entire hotel. Evidently, the upper floors' rooms have been completed and the lower floors and lobby are next in line.The room and bathroom were very clean, as was the rest of the hotel.Beds were comfortable, even to a man with a bad back and arthritic hip, both of which were aggravated by walking the length and breadth of the city.I cannot comment on the breakfast (other than the snack we were offered). With so many wonderful bakeries, cafes, and markets nearby, why eat in the hotel?Additionally, the neighborhood in which the hotel is located is excellent. It's quiet, safe, and relatively non-touristy. The hotel is a short walk to the Metro, and to some of the most lovely streets, IMHO, in Paris. We've decided that it's become our Paris hotel. Now, I've just gotta get another weekend scheduled!

<Content>Lovely holiday We stayed for 4 nights and then travelled to the Loire Valley for 3 nights and returned here for 6 more nights with 5 rooms booked for 11 of us. The staff were extremely helpful and kind. The location is good - walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, Napoleon's Tomb. Anywhere in Paris central should be fine as the metro is excellent with stations everywhere if you don't want to walk (unlike Rome!). This area is fairly quiet but has all the necessary markets, patisseries, etc you need within 2 min walk. The sight of the Eiffel Tower out the window every day was magic. You need to have a room number ending in 5 or 6 (preferably 5 as this is the corner) to see it. Do not have a first floor room as the building is lit up at night and the lights shine into the room, no matter how much you fiddle with the curtains! Other floors didn't seem to have this problem. Rooms ending in 4 or 5 have the toilet separate to the bathroom which was very useful. Breakfast is downstairs in the basement so no natural light or view. We ate at local cafes every morning once we got used to just having a croissant or tartine with coffee. Paul's Patisserie chain is excellent - good value, cheap, nice atmosphere. We found it easier to have a good size lunch in a restaurant and then just bread, ham, cheese and wine in our room most nights. Rooms were very clean. We would definitely book this hotel again.

<Content>Great location with B We stayed at this hotel for a weekend in Paris and really enjoyed it. The location is fantastic. It is in the Invalides area, walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and Champs Elysees. It's also very close to 2 subway stops that connects you easily to the rest of the city. The staff is friendly and the rooms are cozy and quaint. For a 3-star Paris hotel, it was exceptional compared to other places we have stayed in. The room and bathroom was very new and very clean. The room itself was a comfortable size (again, relative to most Paris hotels we've seen). The breakfast is simple but good (croissants, eggs, yogurt, fruits, meats, and great coffee). It was a great find and we will absolutely go back to it the next time we are in Paris.

<Content>Disappointed This was a hotel choice for a conference I attended in July, so I stayed primarily for the convenience to the conference site. We stayed for over a week and I likely would not stay here again. I feel a bit sheepish writing this review, especially after seeing so many positive ones, but I still think it's important to report about my experiences. Although the front desk staff were certainly pleasant, it鈥檚 affordable, convenient, and the typical size for a European hotel of this quality (as others have stated), it鈥檚 the 鈥渓ittle鈥?things that I noticed that influenced my impression the most (perhaps I noticed them more since I was there for quite a while). Here are just some of my observations 鈥?closet shelving askew (couldn鈥檛 put anything on one of the shelves), shower flooded the floor and toilet with each use, bathroom window could not open fully due to a pipe in the way, dried wax adhered to the carpeting next to the bed (stepped on it every day), wallpaper peeling off the wall in some corners, the light in the hallway outside of our room was dangling by a wire  the lobby doorway leading to the stairs was propped open with a balled-up washcloth. We were in a room on the floor just above the restaurant, and suffered the noise of their cleaning for closing every evening. One day we took a seat on the outdoor chairs and I thought I would write some postcards 鈥?I pulled out a bottle of water I purchased earlier and as I took my first sip, a hotel employee came outside and told me that I needed to enjoy my beverage inside or to please put the beverage away. Of course, if I purchased the beverage from the hotel, I could certainly enjoy it outside. He explained that the hotel was trying to prevent non-hotel guests from walking up and using the tables/chairs as eating areas. I absolutely appreciate the hotel wanting to preserve their property for their guests, but I can hardly believe that sipping from a water bottle would encourage the general populus to enjoy a hearty meal on the hotel doorstep! No wonder I never once saw other hotel guests enjoying the outdoor seating the entire length of my stay. Although we noticed a small bar area in the lobby, he didn鈥檛 offer to sell us a drink 鈥?had he, we would have enjoyed a nice mid-day cocktail. In fact, we were not given any information about the bar during our stay (I did not see a menu in the lobby nor any literature at the front desk or in our room) and it never appeared open for business.For me, a good hotel experience is discovering more than what you expect, not less. If you鈥檙e looking for a Paris hotel for a longish summer stay where attention is paid to the 鈥渓ittle鈥?things, I would not recommend this hotel 鈥?there are so many more options.Lastly, I find it a bit odd that the hotel management responds to almost all of these reviews. TripAdvisor is intended to be a forum for the traveler, and it is surprising that this hotel鈥檚 management monitors every comment 鈥?atypical for this site. Having carefully reviewed our hotel options before booking this hotel, I expected that management would pay as much if not more attention to the little details at the hotel as it does to monitoring this site.

<Content>friendly staff, clean rooms  Just returned from a weekend stay with the girlfriend, really enjoyed ourselves. The whole trip was completely hassle free. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpfull, our room was well spaced and spotless clean and in a good location. We also had a fantastic view of the tower. I can't imagine there's too many three star hotels out there that measure up to this standard - highly recommended!!

<Content>Great location Myself and a friend stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel for 3 nights in November. We had a wonderful trip. We arrived at 10pm in the middle of a massive downpour. The receptionist was joking with us and it lightened our moods. He made a reservation for us at a lovely little Italian restaurant a 5 minute walk away, and we were very happy with this, as we would never have found it on our own. The hotel was kept very clean at all times and the decor is lovely, but I believe they are currently redecorating. We stayed in a twin room called Madeleine; the rooms all seem to be named after areas of Paris. It was a small but perfectly adequate room, the beds were very narrow but I enjoyed a perfect sleep every night. The bathroom was perfect, there was a separate toilet, which was good when there are 2 staying in the room, however a wash hand basin in the toilet room would have been useful. We had a view of the Eiffel Tower from the room, which was fabulous, especially when it sparkles for 10 minutes every hour on the hour. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, but enjoyed it along our way out every morning and there were many lovely places to choose from. The drinks in the mini bar were cheap compared to most hotels I have stayed in and compared to the prices in cafes and restaurants around the city. The metro station at Ecole Militaire is very close by, but we found the hotel was very well located for exploring on foot. The Eiffel Tower is very near by and from there, many other sights are within easy walking distance. We even walked back from the Latin quarter late one night and we felt very safe. I would recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great place to stay We loved our stay at this hotel. It was chosen entirely off the reviews posted here which were spot on. (No, it's not the Ritz but it has everything we needed and more at a price that wasn't too bad.) Our visit was during the transportation strike, but we just walked a lot. There is also a water taxi near the Eiffel Tower that helped out. If there wasn't a strike, this hotel is located near the Metro and multiple bus stops. Many attractions are an easy walk. Also close was Rue Cler, a cobbled pedestrian street with shops/markets selling pastry, flowers, fruits, veggies, merchandise. This was one of our favorite places in Paris (a true cultural experience) and so close to our hotel. Also close were several places to eat; and yes, many menus had English sub-titles. (We learned a few things from the French: take your time eating, enjoy the company, watch the world around you, and relax.) We also found if you know even a few phrases in French, it is very helpful. Buy a Rick Steves' book for help on this. The bathroom of this hotel was very nice given all I've read about hotels in Europe. We had a great view of the Eiffel Tower from our balcony! You've got to see this at night! You'll remember it forever. It was November when we went, so I might suggest a room with a view and no balcony would be fine given the weather. While touring, check out the booksellers along the river starting near the Latin Quarter (also there are great music cafes in this area). Paris was everything we expected it to be and more. This hotel helped make our trip. We'll go back to both as soon as we can!

<Content>Friendly hotel in a fantastic location We booked the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel for a wedding anniversary long weekend. Having realised the transport strike was in full swing we thought this might put a downer on our trip but it wasn't a problem at all. We got the bus from CDG airport to the Arc de Triumph (13 euros each) and with a half decent map we walked the rest of the way which took about 25mins and was very easy.On arrival at the hotel we were given our key to room 46, a superior room, and some local information, mini bar pricelist etc. The room was pleasantly decorated in lemon and blue with french windows that opened inward to reveal a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower. The bathroom was spotles with a 3/4 bath and great shower. Good hairdryer too which is quite unusual for hotels. There was also a french window in the bathroom too. The double bed was very comfortable and the heating was very good too, which was a god send because on the sat and sun the weather was very very cold. There were some markings on the wallpaper particularly where the cases would go but overall the room was very clean and tidy and not too small either.Beer in Paris is very expensive. Bottles are 25cl and in the bars cost around 拢3.50gbp and around double for 50cl. Heineken seems to be the popular brand. The prices in the hotel mini bar were probably as cheap as u would find, 25cl bottle of Heineken being around 拢2 a bottle. We didnt eat breakfast in the hotel, We did try the breakfast at the Ecole Militere brasserie down the street which consisted of orange juice, large coffee, french bread and either fried egg with cold ham or scrambled eggs. The cost was around 8 euros. There are lots of cafes and restaurants around the area. We ate at the champ de mars which was very good. There is a great hot food stall, next to the carousel by the Eiffel tower. The hot dogs and fries are delicious.Paris is very easy to get around. All the streets are well signposted and you can literally walk anywhere, weather permitting. The ecole militere metro is a couple of minutes walk down the road if you want to take the tube.All in all we had a lovely time. Paris is a lovely city with lots to offer, and the staff at the hotel Duquesne Eiffel are very helpful and friendly, and for a 3* property, pre refurbishment, i rate it highly. I will definately be returning to both Paris and the Duquesne Eiffel as soon as i can

<Content>Disappointed After having read the reviews on TripAdvisor, we booked a 4-night stay at Hotel Duquesne. There are certainly positives to the hotel:friendly staff, clean bathrooms, fantastic view (from our room - 55, I believe), quiet rooms However, the room was certainly quite worn. Uncomfortable bed, old bedding (with a small holes in the sheets), torn wallpaper, stained carpeting, etc. It is good to read that they will be upgrading the rooms...

<Content>Friendly and well located Easy to find hotel near to metro stop. Staff are friendly and helpful and speak good English. Big, comfy sofas in reception/bar area with selection of newspapers. Had a room looking over local rooftops which was quiet and the bathroom had its own exterior window making a pleasant change.Tried some local cafes for breakfast but actually found the hotel one better - wider choice of food for a reasonable price. Only down side was the room was adjacent to the lift shaft and there were associated creaking noises every time the lift was in use.

<Content>Wonderful trip Spent a long weekend at this lovely hotel, (our 5th trip in 12 months!) We took my son as a birthday treat. We had room 35 which is a triple room on the third floor and wow!! what a view of the Eiffel tower. At night it was quite breathtaking when lit up. Agree with all previous comments left, that the hotel is in a wonderful location and the staff are so very friendly. We didnt need to bother them at all because everything was perfect for us.The italian restraunt they reccomend just around the corner was amazing and the room was spacious enough  spotless. Highly reccommend this hotel  we are planning to return very soon.

<Content>Great location, value and staff We had a group of 11 staying at the Duquesne for three nights. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and while the rooms are small, hey... it's an old building and if we had wanted spacious, cheap hotel rooms we would have gone to Vegas.Mostly the area was superb, really close to all services, restaurants, metro. We could see the Eiffel tower out the window of the room, easy strolling distance. A great buffet breakfast in the basement which had been saved from a cave like feeling by good lighting and recent upgrades. If you are going to Paris to see Paris, rather than vegetate in a hotel room, the Duquesne is a great choice and reasonably priced.We also stayed one night at the HOtel Splendid, just down the block since we got in a day earlier than expected. The Duquesne staff were nice enough to get us the reservation. The Splendid is not really very splendid... smaller and more tired rooms, needs an update like the Duquesene.

<Content>I Love Paris ............ My wife and I recently spent 6 nights in the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel. We knew that the rooms were small and a little tired from others reviews posted on this site, and this is definitely the case, however the Hotel is in a fabulous location close to Eiffel Tower, Invalides and there are a couple of Metro Stations within easy walking distance. There are also heaps of really good restaurants close by, including a great Thai place right next door.The staff in both the reception area and breakfast room were pleasant and friendly. The ladies on reception were very helpful in terms of providing directions to laundromat, shops etc. and suggesting eating places in the area.I can highly recommend the DE hotel to anyone wanting to stay in or near the 7th e, and will definitely be staying there again, when next we visit the '2nd most beautiful city in the world'. (remember we live in Sydney, Australia)

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Service We stayed at the Duqesne Eiffel for 4 nights-August 30-Sept 3. The hotel is very cute, with a nice outdoor seating area where you can enjoy a drink at the end of a hard day of sighseeing. I am very surprised to hear that other guests found the staff rude--if anything, we found that they went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. One night, I asked the night manager for a couple plastic cups so my husband and I could enjoy a bottle of champagne. He shook his head and disappeared--only to return with champagne flutes and an ice bucket. That's service!The rooms are small, but you're staying in Paris--a major city crammed with centuries-old buildings--there's not a lot of space. The Duquesne is within walking distance of the Tour Eiffel, which is why we chose to stay there. We took many nighttime walks to watch the tower glow and flicker. We'd stay there again.

<Content>not what I thought My husband  I were in Paris the end of September for a week. We were really disappointed with the accomodations for what we paid. Our room was teeny tiny  the tv only worked occasionaly. (not that that is really important but its nice to be able to wind down at the end of the day) The hotel staff was anything but helpful. Everytime we asked them a question, we only got shoulder shrugs. We ran into a few other couples who had even bigger issues than what we experienced. Bottom line, I would NEVER stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel; Great Staff  Anything I say about this hotel does not do it justice! We went to paris for part of our European honeymoon and chose the Duquesne hotel based on the reviews from tripadvisor! We booked from September 4th to 9th! Since they knew it was our honeymoon they gave us the best room in the hotel! What a view! Full view of la tour Eiffel; Les Invalides and Sacre-Coeur! Honestly we were left speechless! I could honestly say it is everything I thought Paris would be and more! We did not stay for breakfast at the hotel, but we saw the restaurant in the lower level and it was so pretty! Like a wine cellar! We found the staff to be amazing! So helpful and always willing to offer their advice! Thank you to all the staff at Duquesne for making it a wonderful experience! We will see you again hopefully on our one year anniversary!

<Content>Good Booked directly with the hotel, and had no problem at all.We had a reasonably early check in being late morning, and the room was ready. We were on the 5th floor and had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was great. The rooms are small, anc probably a little tired looking, but it was fine, but you are not in Paris for the room, but for the tourism, and the hotel is in a great place for that. very central to everything, and with a number of cafe's within a stones throw.Booked an evening dinner cruise through the hotel, and we couldn't have been any happier with it, absolutely fantastic.Had no problem with the staff, they all seemed freindly enough to me.If i had one gripe, i think that the rooms are over priced, but that's just me!!!!!!

<Content>Great find in super location As part of our honymoon in late September my wife and I stayed in the Exclusive Duquesne Eiffel for one night. We had no problems locating the hotel as its close to the Metro station and on a fairly busy road. Noise however is no problem at all, we had a superior room with views of the Eiffel tower facing the road and were not disturbed at all. The staff at the hotel are knowledgable and helpful and I would reccommend this hotel to anyone looking at staying in Paris for a few days. My only negative coment would be that the rooms may be a bit small, but thats not unusual for rooms in Paris hotels.

<Content>Great staff, pleasant hotel I stayed here in July - it was one of the nominated hotels for a conference I attended nearby. Great choice! I had a back room which was nicely decorated with good furniture and in good condition.The staff were endlessly patient, charming and extremely helpful. I witnessed a couple of encounters with demanding guests which were handled with aplomb and courtesy [I would've been showing them the door after 10 minutes, but the lovely receptionist kept her cool].I had moved to the Duquesne from a more expensive hotel in the Marais and thought the Duquesne was better value. Other reviews are right - the area is elegant with plenty of cafes, restaurants and food shops close by. It offered a calmer contrast to the Marais, but both areas had a lot to offer.

<Content>Can't say enough good things about Duquesne Eiffel I cannot say enough good things about this hotel and the staff. We just got back from our trip. We found this hotel on tripadvisor.com, and the experience was great. Amandine, Julie and Estelle (and their other team mates) were very helpful (and are still being helpful even though we have already checked out.. more on that later)As this was a wedding anniversary trip, we were very happy to stay at the Duquesne Eiffel.. we stayed in 2 different rooms, #54 and #35 and the view was super.. My birthday was on 8/31, and we were given #35, with the fabulous view of the sparkling eiffel tower, for our last night in Paris. What a super birthday present and way to end our trip to Europe! How many people can really say they had a view of the Eiffel tower? From my first email to our departure, the team at Duquesne Eiffel were very helpful, and thankfully communicated in English very easily (all I had was some junior high school french to rely on!) We stayed a total of 4 nights, and checked out to travel to Belgium for a few days in the middle of the week, and we were able to leave some of our luggage at the hotel, which helped us immensely to be able to travel easier on the trains to Brussels and Brugge, and back to Paris.The location of the hotel is by far the best, in terms of convenience to the metro stop (L'Ecole Militaire), Rue Cler, the Supermarche, as well as the Eiffel tower and museums like the Rodin, Musee D'Orsay and Invalides Militaire (Napoleon's tomb). The neighborhood was very safe as well and there were never any concerns about safety, even late at night.The rooms were very clean and neat. Thank you to the cleaning staff!Amandine also helped us book the Eiffel tower dinner/cruise on the Seine/show at the Lido which was the perfect combination of things to do while in Paris (not to mention a perfect birthday celebration!). That package encompassed 3 of the many things we wanted to do while in Paris.And I can't forget to mention that the hotel also helped by booking the YELLOW van to pick us up at CDG to bring us to the hotel. We received very clear directions on what we needed to do, once we landed in Paris, to ensure we met the driver (needed to pick up any phone and dial the toll free number BEFORE we went to baggage claim.. The man on the other end spoke english, who then told us what door to meet him at). I had been nervous about this procedure, as I couldn't understand how we would be able to make a call, without putting in any coins or using a telephone card, but it worked very easily.Last but not least, Estelle has been helping us contact Thalys, the high speed train to/from Brussels, to see if they found a print of Brugge we inadvertently left behind on the train, when we arrived back in Paris. Thalys hasn't been very responsive to her messages yet, but we are very appreciative of her efforts on our behalf. We are hoping for the best. We gave her our email address as we were checking out the following morning to head back to the States and she said she was going to keep trying to see if she can get some answers for us. This just shows us that the staff at Duquesne Eiffel are truly customer service - oriented.We highly recommend this hotel because of its location, and staff and cannot wait to stay again when we are visiting Paris (and hopefully it is sooner than a 20th wedding anniversary!) Thank you, thank you, thank you...

<Content>Ok hotel but didn't live up to the reviews! My husband and I decided to book this hotel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. A few days before we were due to arrive we received an e-mail from the hotel saying they had double booked and our booking would be moved to another hotel. Since the other hotel suggested was one we had looked at but decided against and since if we had booked the other hotel at the outset it would have been cheaper we contacted the Duquesne and they agreed to honour our booking. Our room was minute and dark as it looked onto an internal space (although this did mean it was quiet) and not quite as clean as I would have liked. That said the location was good and we had a lovely stay in Paris but I would hesitate to go back to the Duqesne.

<Content>Duquesne Eiffel Hotel We had a WONDERFUL time at the Dusquesne Eiffel Hotel. The staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful! They gave us great directions and recommendations! I could not compliment the staff enough! They were just wonderful!! The hotel is in a nice neighborhood - very safe at night. The metro is just down the street. The rooms were small but comfortable. The bathrooms were very nice. The a/c worked great! We even had a view of the Eiffel tower. I would stay here again!

<Content>Just Fantastic!!! This was my second visit to the Duquesne and I would return the next time as well. Perfect location, wonderful staff, everything one would wish for in a small Paris hotel. Estelle and Julie were as delightful as ever, and it was a great week in Paris. I would advise anyone looking for a small hotel with a wonderful Paris location, try the Duquesne. It was terrific!!

<Content>July Visit to Duquesne Eiffel Hotel WOW! A terrific hotel. We selected this hotel through trip Adviser and everything was as expected. Excellent hotel staff (Estelle  Judi) helped us find restaurants and hooked us up with metro weekly passes. Location is spectacular. Owned and operated by French personnel, this hotel is a great value!

<Content>Sweet Little Place Nice, comfortable, warm 3 star hotel near Ecole Militiare and Rue Cler. Easy to get to - just a block and a half from a metro stop. But far away enough from the busy streets to be relaxed and quiet. Older building with a small lobby with sofa's and a small bar. Old style spiraling staircase and very small elevator. Front desk staff speaks multiple languages and were fairly knowledgeable.Rooms small, but not claustrophobic. Warm colors, my wife and I were in a room with yellows and blues; our sons with reds and yellows. Closets quite small. Bathrooms nice - modern fixtures and hair blower. Windows kept out the street noise and mattresses comfortable. Breakfast buffet in basement worth the price - 11 euro I think. Coffee, eggs, bread, cheese, yogurt, cereal, etc.Neighborhood close to Eiffel Tower. Rue Cler blocks have fabulous shops - bread, cheese, and pastry shops plus several cafes. Larger corner cafes have the street scene. Nearby small restaurants - wonderful.No hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Duquesne in May and booked about 7 months prior. We booked our Superior room knowing that receiving a view of the Eiffel Tower depended on availability. I believe the hotel's website states this and the online company I booked through mentioned the Superior Room has a view of Invalides OR the Eiffel Tower. I'm not sure why a lot of reviewers are complaining about not receiving views of the Eiffel Tower when there was no guarantee. I was lucky and did receive a view of the Eiffel Tower. If I stood at the very left part of my balcony I had a fabulous full view. The hotel was fine and what I expected in an old French building... tiny rooms and a tiny elevator (the two of us barely fit with 2 suitecase.) Everything was clean and the hotel was quite. The locations is nice, near 2 metro stops. The staff was pleasant and spoke English very well.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location Ours was a large party--adults and grown children on holiday, booking 6 rooms. We found the hotel to be exactly as billed on websites. Staff and owner fluent in English, very gracious and accomodating. Rooms are average Parisien (i.e. small) but well appointed, and bathrooms clean and modern. Dual pain windows shut out street noise nicely, and most rooms have nice views. Cafe tables in front a treat, and perhaps unique in Paris. We avoided the expensive (and too filling) breakfast--plenty of cafe alternatives in the neighborhood. Metro station Ecole Militaire a 5 min walk. Consider this a safe bet for moderate priced English friendly hotel.

<Content>Minor Grievances My dream was to visit Paris. For my honeymoon, my husband and I decided to go to Paris for 5 nights and Greece for two weeks. I decided to start my search for a hotel through Trip advisory. Even though this hotel was only a 3 star hotel, we decided that the reviews were too great to pass it up. I definitely wanted a superior room with a view of the Eiffel Tower. My french is not the greatest so a asked a dear friend who is Parisian to call the hotel and find out how we can be guaranteed a room with a view from the bedroom. She called and we followed their instructions when booking our hotel. The reception assured us if we asked for a certain room in our booking, it would be given to us because we were booking 8 months in advance. Even after the hotel was booked, our friend called the hotel to confirm we received a room with a view. You can imagine our surprise when we did not receive this room. When we went down to the front desk their answer was that we must have misunderstood them when we booked and a room with a view is not guaranteed. I don鈥檛 understand how one Parisian cannot understand another, there is no language barrier. Other than the view, the room was o.k. and the area was great. Most of the staff was helpful, yet if you have a complaint, do not expect much, there is a complete attitude change. I would recommend this hotel if it is just a family visiting Paris, but if it is a romantic getaway I would try somewhere else.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We stayed at the Hotel Duquesne from June 8-16, 2007 and we couldn't have been happier. Julie, Amandine, Allain and the rest of the staff were so friendly and helpful. The superior room we booked (Room 44) was very spacious, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed opening up the wonderful french door-style windows and gazing out at the Eiffel Tower from our room. We also enjoyed sitting at the cafe tables outside the hotel watching the ET sparkle every evening. We changed our money at the hotel for a good rate and no fee. The staff booked tours and airport shuttle for us, answered every question we had and the large bathroom with tub and shower as well as fresh towels and face cloths each day were a luxury that not all European hotels provide. Wifi internet worked smoothly on my laptop and they also have a computer in the lobby for patrons to use. Many cafes, restaurants (Thai nextdoor was excellent!), boulangeries, Shopi grocery store, fruit stands, Invalides gardens (perfect place to eat strawberry tarts and eclairs chocolat for breakfast in the mornings) are all within a couple of blocks from the hotel. We also enjoyed the breakfast downstairs in a lovely setting and even tho some commented that it was expensive, it was far and above your usual continental breakfast since they served buffet style scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, all types of breads, croissants, pastries, jams, yogurt, cereals, coffee, tea, juices, et. We will definitely return and stay at this hotel again! (soon hopefully!)

<Content>Duquesne not as perfect as people say. Average hotel We stayed at the Duquesne from May 29- June 1st. Hotel is close to everything. Excellent shops and cafes near by.Staff are helpful and speak perfect english. We booked a superior room ( 54 ). Strong smell of cigs in the room and it makes made extremely ill.Room was small but that didnt matter to us. Walls are paper thin. A/C didnt work for us. My wife complained about the coils in the bed sticking her in the back. I am not sure if I would visit this hotel again. Alot of nice hotels in the same neighborhood. Breakfast was good but expensive (11 euros per person ). Head to a cafe in the neighborhood. Internet is available in the lobby for 9 euros per hour. Pros: Location is perfect, area, close to everything,and staffCons:Price,small rooms,odour in the room,I picked this hotel for 2 reasons location and the fact that Hotel management checks and responds to feedback provided on tripadvisor.Comments: book room 55. On the corner and great view of Eiffel tower, Eiffel Tower is about 20-25 min walk.Metro

<Content>It was all a bunch of lies. Superior does NOT mean a guranteed view! If you're picking this hotel, because you want to see the tower out your window, DON'T! We were so excited about staying at this hotel based on the reviews. We'd seen the candid visitor photos where you can see the eiffel tower from the window of your room. IF you booked a superior room. So, we made sure to book 2 superior rooms, so that my husband and I, as well as grandma and the kids could both have a spectacular view of the tower from our room. We booked months in advance. But apparently, booking early doesn't get you any consideration. Imagine our incredible disappointment when we arrived to find that the room for Grandma and the kids #35 did have a good view of the tower, but the room that they put me and my husband in , #54, did NOT have a view of the tower. When I went downstairs, to ask to be moved to the room that they'd advertised, the clerk slammed things around, and informend me that yes, the room WAS a superior room. I just had to GO OUT ON MY BALCONY, and look way around to the right, and then I could see it. First, if you're at all afraid of heights, there's no way you're going out on that balcony. Second, you can't stay out there, it's far to narrow. The hotel staff was COMLETELY unconcerned that the romantic evening they'd advertised was in fact a lie. In fact, there are only 3 rooms in the hotel with a view of the tower out your window as they advertise, but many more than that with NO view of the tower out your window that they classify as SUPERIOR. So, if you think that you're going to get one of the good ones for certain just because you book a superior room, DON'T COUNT ON IT! You're really paying for a CHANCE that you get a room with a real view of the tower. Also, if you do stay at this hotel, the breakfast room is like an oven. I'd eat somewhere else.

<Content>my favorite quartier and hotel I have stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel at least 5 times in the past 7-8 years and just enjoy staying there. The location is to my mind, perfect - the Rodin Museum, Ecole Militaire and of course the view of the Eiffel tower. The rooms are very well decorated, if a bit small, the bath tubs are deep and shower strong, and best of all there is air conditioning. What I also like is the location in the proximity of the Rue Cler Market, with all the lovely stalls with fruits, veggies, and meats and the restaurants many of which are patronised by French people. With the Metro stop nearby you can get to anywhere very quickly. There is a bus that you can get near the hotel that goes along Rue St. Dominique and gets you to other areas of Paris.

<Content>Great location Quiet location but close to metro, Eiffel Tower (great view from my room on 5th floor), Les Invalides and the spectacular Rodin museum and gardens. Fair choice of restaurants, we loved Le Vauban (in Place Vauban) 36 euro for 3 courses, kir, wine and coffee.

<Content>Good hotel in good area I stayed in this hotel last night and it is in a very good area. So you don't need to worry to walk out at a late time. Nice restaurants in the area, we ate as Pasco and it was very nice french food. The Eiffel tower is only walking distance.I had a superior room with bath tube and the bath was spotless. The room has to seperate beds and a flat tv at the wall. I gave it 4 *s because the only point I have to mention is that the rooms are very small and to stay longer than only 1 or 2 nights, it would not be enough space for me personally. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. But it is not cheap, we payed 161 鈧?without braekfast.

<Content>Wow!!! Great Stay. My wife and I were on our honeymoon and we stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel for three nights starting on April 24th. The staff is really friendly and helpful and speak perfect english. The room we had (35) was excellent and had a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower. I'd have to say that the best thing about this hotel is the location. The area is really safe both in the day time and late at night. We would defintley stay at this hotel next time we visit paris.

<Content>Perfect spot to enjoy Paris in the spring Nicely renovated hotel in a prime location right by the Eiffel, with bars, restaurants and shops all just seconds away. Staff are superb and very helpful, and pour a generous glass of vin blanc - perfect at the end of a busy day sightseeing. Rooms are small but very comfortable and bright with all amenities you need. We only had two days but the location meant we could easily see everything on our hotlist. I would definitely return if staying in Paris again.

<Content>Charming hotel close to the Eiffel My partner and I stayed at this charming hotel in April 2007 and were completely won over by all aspects of its hospitality. First of all, the location is ideal as it is close to the Ecole Militaire Metro (in the 7th arrondisement) with many wonderful cafes nearby for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Les Invalides (Napoleon's tomb) is practically a stone's throw away. The rooms themselves are quite spacious for a Paris hotel as I've stayed in places in Paris before that were slightly bigger than a kitchen drawer. The rooms look as if they've been recently renovated with marble/granite bathroom countertops that are nicely cleaned everyday. There is a good breakfast - I particulary appreciated the fresh fruit - and all the amenities one could expect in a hotel (i.e. soap, lotion, dryer, internet, etc). Above all, however, I must single out the staff who were all exceptional. Muhammed, Amandine, Estelle and the cleaning and wait staff were a delight to deal with and they went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. (How Parisians get their reputation for being snotty, I'll never know, but I'm guessing it has as much to do with the visitor as with the way the French respond to certain attitudes). The cherry on the cake, of course, was the view of the Eiffel Tower from our rom with its glorious shimmering lights at night. I think you have to have a corner room to see it; so, ask for rooms 25, 35 or 45. This is a gem of a place and I wholly recommend it to anyone visiting Paris in the near future.

<Content>Worth every penny We stayed in this hotel last December (2006) and found it to be a lovely clean hotel that was pretty much central to everything. There was a metro stop just up the road which gave us access to the whole city and a supermarket to buy food and drink. The hotel staff were especially helpful and spoke excellant english which was useful as my french is pretty rusty. Would definitely go to this hotel if i was staying in Paris in the future. Very good value for money

<Content>Great Hotel! We have stayed at Duquesne hotel in March after reading so many reviews. We are so happy with our decision. Although we couldn't get the room 55,56 or 45 and our room 57 was smaller than what everyone say about 55 or 45, we could see the Eiffel Tower from the balcony (you really have to lean to the left though). What we loved was the staff. They're always so kind and helpful. My husband got sick on Saturday night but the staff quickly found the doctor who could speak English and sent us to him. That helped us a lot!The location of the hotel was quite good. I even walked to Orsey Museum which took me about 20min but it was a nice walk. The supermarket near the station was very convenient. We bought some snack, water, cheese etc. We'll stay there again and will request the room 55 or 45 next time!!

<Content>Ridiculous view! I felt like I could reach right out and grab the Eiffel Tower, it was the first thing I saw in the morning and the last thing twinkling as I fell asleep. The room was small, but almost spacious compared to other European hotel rooms I've stayed in. The staff was so sweet and helpful and housekeeping was quick and thorough. I will sing the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel's name as loud and far as I can!

<Content>Wonderful view, cute room We stayed in room 55, and had a magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower. The room was quite roomy by European standards, and clean as a whistle. The plasma screen TV was also a nice touch. I was quite impressed by this hotel. I wish I had booked it for my return trip to Paris instead of just one night. I highly recommend it as a splurge.

<Content>Very friendly staff This hotel is very well located near the Eiffel Tower. In common with many hotels in Paris the rooms are small and room 12 was smaller than most in this hotel but for 1 person mainly using it to sleep in it was OK. The room itself is starting to look a little tired but the bathroom is newly refurbished and has all you need and was spotless. The hotel staff were very welcoming and were happy to speak French to me and equally happy to converse in perfect English. I noted they helped other people find restaurants and would call for them free of charge to make bookings. There is a night porter and so staying out late is not a problem. The hotel does not offer many facilities but as a central base to stay it offered a fair deal for the money. I did not try the breakfast.

<Content>Excellent........ This hotel was one of the best finds of our trip! We booked a comfort room, which had a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The location was terrific.....we were able to walk everywhere from there. The service was excellent.....all the front desk people were extremely helpful and friendly.The rooms were small, which we were expecting, but very clean. The bathroom was a good size . There were a few tiles that could use replacing/regrouting, but was very clean otherwise.We are staying again this year in Sept and bringing relatives, so I can only hope it will still live up to our expectations and the excellent standards from last year.

<Content>good clean friendly Average size rooms for europe (will seem small for US standard rooms) but clean and comfortable. We had two rooms both were nice. The bathrooms was very clean all new tile; one had a tub/shower, the one a shower. Our rooms didn't have the view, but faced inside and were quite. I found the front desk to be very helpful with suggestions. There are a couple brasseries close by. Only a couple hundred meters to the Ecole metro. Easy walk to the Eiffel tower, Invalides or other sites in area. I have no problem recommending this hotel if you are looking for a place in this area for a couple nights in Paris.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I stayed at this hotel with my gf last week and we loved it. We stayed in room 56 and had the greatest view of the Eiffel Tower. Room was very cozy and the bed was comfortable. Bathroom was good size and had all the necessary amenities including a hair dryer which my gf was very relieved to discover. We had no problem checking into our room when we arrived early. Staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying there on my next visit to Paris.

<Content>Awesome view of the Eiffel! Date: December 26, 2006We stayed at Hotel Duquesne for 3 nights. It was very nice and clean. The staff spoke fluent English and were extremely helpful in giving us directions and recommendations. Our rooms were corner rooms 35 and 45 (superior and triple) with a great view of the Eiffel Tower at night. The hotel was in close proximity to the Ecole Militaire metro station and within 15 minutes walk from the Eiffel. The hotel is very reasonably priced and we would recommend it. We will definitely return to the hotel whenever in Paris.

<Content>This is a gem! After weeks of looking online for hotels in Paris, I have to say I was rather dishartened. We wanted a good quality, three star hotel in a good location, but most hotels seemed either very expensive (in most cases overpriced, I'm sure) or just poor in quality. Because we were quite late with our booking as well, finding a good one (I was very careful to read reviews on all possible places) seemed pretty much impossible-- that is until my boyfriend stumbled upon Duquesne Eiffel. We both had a good feeling about the place, based on reviews in particular, and we were definitely not disappointed! First of all, the LOCATION IS GREAT. I cannot emphasize this enough. It is close to the Eiffel Tower and a stone's throw away from Napoleon's tomb (hotel des Invalides) right next to the military academy. 5 minutes away is the metro station and along the way a wonderful little bakery and a couple of restaurants. While it is so close to two of the main tourist attractions in Paris, its still a very quiet, nice and safe area. With the metro you can get anywhere in within minutes and even walking to the Louvre is possible! As we arrived we were greeted by a polite young receptionist and she quickly confirmed out booking, filled in the paperwork and gave us our key. The room was on the third floor (there's only 5, its very cosy and nice, clean and charming) and we were absolutely thrilled when we got in, saw the room and especially our view! Now, the room was small, but for a weekend trip this shouldnt be a problem unless you are fussy about space. It was nicely decorated (blue and yellow), everything was good quality and clean and the overall feeling was very charming and French! The bathroom was a very positive surprise because it had a big window and a bathtub, all very modern and tastefully done (nice bathtub and new showerhead). And now to the view- from both windows (room and bathroom) we had a view of the Eiffel Tower! This, I imagine even in Paris, is by no means standard and I'm sure many people pay a lot more than we did to have it! It was so gorgeous at night (although the cynical Parisians apparently disagree ;) and an incredible perk for an already positive experience. We stayed for 3 days and have no complaints at all. We didnt have the breakfast though (which seems expensive-- its much nicer to go to a local bakery, I think), but all and all service was excellent (cleaning and receptionists) and our check-out was very quick and professionally handled. We both loved Paris and a big part of this was thanks to our very positive experience at the Duquesne. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL for anyone looking for a charming, private and conveniently located medium-range hotel- in fact, I'm sure it beats many hotels with more stars and fancier addresses- that's how good I thought it was!

<Content>Great hotel in a fantastic location Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. We booked a superior room and the view was definitely worth the extra money. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the corner rooms (ie those ending in 5) have the best views of the Eiffel Tower and are relatively spacious by Paris standards. Our room (45) was spottlessly clean and nicely decorated. The nearest metro stop (Ecole Militaire) is a short walk away and provides easy access to all of the major tourist sites.Breakfast was quite expensive at 11 euros each so we opted to take it at one of the local cafes for half the price.Overall the Duquesne Eiffel hotel represents excellent value for money and I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Duquesne for 3 days in early October and we had a wonderful time. We opened the door to our corner room on the 1st floor and the room was spotless with a clear view of the Eiffel Tower. We arrived after midnight and the guy at the front desk was very welcoming. His English was ok but he had said that breakfast was included in our price. Apparently it wasn't since at check out, we noticed breakfast was tacked on to our final amount. And at quite a hefty price too. That was the only issue though. Not sure on the size of the other rooms, but the corner rooms are generously sized (ask for a room that ends with a 5 which are the corner rooms). The shower/sink is separate from the toilet, but both were very clean. The Metro is just 2 blocks away (Ecole Militaire stop) and there are a couple cafes along the street. There is quite a bit of street/traffic noise during the day, but the windows actually do a great job in minimizing it. We had a hard time finding the street upon arrival so make sure you have good directions, perhaps from the hotel. Overall, had an excellent stay at the Duquesne.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed here for a weekend in a superior room, though it was on 1st floor, so we could see the Eiffel tower if we crooked our heads to see it between the trees. The room was not large (but not so small that we would feel cramped in it), it was actually OK for Paris, and everything in the room was functioning well (heating, lights, mini-fridge, etc). The toilet was separate from shower with sink, which was a bit strange. Staff were friendly, and spoke English. The area was also very nice. If you've been in Paris before, and just want a nice area calm area to stay in, I would definitely recomemnd this hotel.

<Content>They had no room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Myself and my boyfriend have only recently returned from weekend break in Paris. We booked the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel as it had such good reviews on trip advisors and as it was our first visit to Paris we thought it was a safe bet. Unfortunately this hotel was the only downfall of the weekend. When we arrived to book in we were told that a regular customer had decided to stay an extra night and that they had no room for us even though we had booked on line months before our trip. The hotel found us a room in a nearby hotel which we stayed in for our first night of the trip but then the next morning we had to check out of this hotel and head back to the Duquesne Eiffel hotel to check in, not an ideal situation. Another couple staying in the hotel the same weekend had a similar problem, they had a room but it was not the room they had booked. The hotel itself is quite nice, the staff are very friendly, the rooms are nice and the location is good too. When checking out of the hotel I paid by credit card, I then noticed a week later that the hotel had taken a further payment from my credit card, they never contacted me to say they were making a further deduction or give an explanation for the deduction. I'm currently waiting for them to come back to me on this! Over all I was very disappointed with this hotel and I wouldn't stay there again!!!!

<Content>First visit to Paris Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel - the rooms were spotless and the staff helpful and friendly. Although a little out of the centre we were able to walk to the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower and the Metro is only two blocks away. Would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Perfectly acceptable, after gaining entry.. I was recently in Paris for a conference and stayed for five nights at this charming hotel not far from the Eiffel Tower and les Invalides. The service was extremely friendly and consistent. Breakfasts were solid and the location was good for some tourist things, although not fantastic for others (most nearby dining was tourist oriented and there wasn't much access to authentic local happenings). The only problem - and it was considerable - was my room key/door. After my first night, my key stopped working. The staff were most accommodating, although it became quite annoying to have to ask someone to be let into my room each and every time I needed to enter it. Also, I had some security concerns as a result of this as no one ever asked for ID before opening my door. Of course, this could be because they had excellent memories, but I'm skeptical. So, after one decent night, I had four questionable others. I'd recommend this to someone who wants to stay near the tower, but don't stay in room 11.

<Content>Very good hotel with a few minor hiccups The staff at this hotel are lovely. They were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a few hiccups during our stay which they smoothed out with a smile as quickly as possible. (Some issues with the room key, and also our reservation was mistakenly taken down for one night rather than two.) They were also helpful with restaurant reservations, metro directions, etc.We stayed in two 'superior' rooms at 180 euro per night. The first was pretty basic but acceptable - certainly nothing overtly super about it - clean to a reasonable standard but not to, say, 5 star standard. There were some scuff marks on the walls, slight peeling, etc, but the room did appear to have recieved care, just to be a little bit aging. The second was room 56, with a little balcony and a stunning view of the Eiffel Tower from the desk and from the bed. This room was much preferred! I'd ask for it by number if I stayed here again. The rooms are average European hotel sized, which Americans will find relatively small. This being Paris, you won't spend time in the room anyway.For our purposes, the location left a bit to be desired - however, we are a bit of a party couple in our late 20s and we like to be able to walk to nightlife. On the other hand, it's a 5 minute walk to the Metro and the hotel is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. It was also quite easy to take a taxi back to the hotel provided one can remember how to say '23 Ave Duquesne' in French at the end of a night out!If I were looking for a peaceful relatively inexpensive hotel in Paris I'd definitely stay here again. I'd send my parents here, for example. But next time we come we will probably try to stay somewhere with a bit more street life. PS -I'd have to say the Rue Cler is our least favorite place in Paris by a wide margin. It's full of tourists from Ohio talking loudly in English and generally being annoying. No wonder people have a hard time in Paris when they act like that!

<Content>Loved view  My husband and I booked this charming hotel following all the positive tripadvisor reviews. We made a right decision.We stayed in two different rooms: Room #25 for the first 4 nights, and in Room #56 for another 2 nights after coming back from our overnight trip to MSM/ San Malo. Both chambles were worth the rate -- cleaned everyday, hot nice shower always.Room #25 (on the second floor): Only the top 1/3 of the Tower Eiffel was seen, but the room was quite spacious for Paris standard -- two opened suites cases, no problem. Shower w/ bathtub, separate bathroom. Room #56 (on the top floor): Marvelous view of the Tower Eiffel through the window/ from the balcony, especially when lighted up at night. It even twinkled every hour, at 9, 10 11 and 12 midnight, which perfectly highlighted our stay in Paris. Though the room and bed were rather small, we fitted OK, but may not be such a recommendation for larger people. Shower w/ bathtub, bathroom in the same room. Service: All the staffs were always so pleasant. People at the reception spoke very good English and helped us finding our way getting around Paris, they were always quite busy helping out people. We also liked breakfast in our room, nice caf茅 and kind ladies who brought the plate with nice smile. Food (dinner): Our No.1 recommendation is 7 me Sud, 10 minutes from the hotel, on the Mont Piquet Ave, always packed with locals and tourists. Try their 20 euros course menu. I had Foie Gras as entr茅e, Dug Fillet as main plate, and candied pear w/ vanilla ice cream as dessert. The best a la carte was Escargot (in Takoyaki plate). Had two red wine (full-size bottle), and it was 85 euros.Mariko, Japan

<Content>Completely exceeded expectations We made a decision in July to go to Paris in September. Hotels recommended by friends were booked, but the Dusquene Eiffel was available. The great Trip Advisor reviews clinched it. The only room type available online was the comfort double, but the attentive staff responded with the offer of an upgrade to a superior room. Based on reviews, I chanced requesting Room 55, and it was available for four of the five nights we wanted. The fifth night was in room 25. The room and the hotel were wonderful. All rooms ending in 5 are corner rooms with views of the Eiffel Tower through french doors. Room 55 at the top of the hotel has the best view and a two-sided balcony from which you also can see Sacre Coeur and Les Invalides. The star attraction, of course, is the Eiffel Tower. At night, it sparkles in your window on the hour with the lights installed for the Millennium celebration. Magical, and surely one of the best views in all of Paris. Room 56 next door is smaller but also has direct views of the Tower from the bed. It would be nice if the hotel would put flower boxes and a couple of small chairs and a little table on the balcony. That would make it perfection.The hotel staff is everything the reviews say and more. They are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and cheerful and will gladly suggest and make reservations at restaurants and even provide a computer-generated map to them. Even though we had been to Paris before, we really appreciated the advice of the staff. Special kudos to Amanda and Pritti.As others have said, Rue Cler is just a couple of blocks away behind the Ecole Militare Metro stop. This is a great place for coffee and a pain du chocolat in the morning though your table mates may be Americans armed with Rick Steve's Paris guide. There are wonderful cheese and chocolate shops and a nice patisserie. At the Ecole Militare Metro stop there is a small supermarket with a good selection of wine, fruit and staples.Use the Metro and invest in the Paris Visite pass, which is good for one to five days of unlimited public transit rides and discounts to some museums and attractions. Buy them at the Metro stations.We like mussels and went to one of the many Lyon de Bruxelles restaurants. It's a chain, but if moules are your passion, they are good and reasonably priced here. The nicest restaurant experience of the trip was at Fermette Marbeuf (5 Avenue Marbeuf). Its domed ceiling and tile work were enchanting and the food was superb. There's a 30 Euro fixed-price menu that is well worth selecting. We embellished it a bit, added wine and coffee and the tab was only 101 Euro, service included, for a special night of elegant service and wonderful cuisine.All in all, a lovely time at a lovely hotel with a lovely staff and a lovely view. A few reviewers seemed disenchanted with their rooms, but they seemed unused to the size of European hotel rooms and the prevalence of glass half-doors on showers. True, some of the rooms at Dusquene Eiffel are small and more basic, but if you can plan a little request room 55 or any of the corner rooms ending in 5. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>average hotel Loved Paris but not the hotel . My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. We had the standard double room since ttheir superior rooms were all booked out. So, no view of Eiffel Tower from room. Good location with easy access to the metro Room was small. Less than a 10x10 sq ft. Our bed was 2 twins pushed together which gets uncomfortable at times. However, room's window is soundproof. Blocks out all the street noises. A/C in the room didn't work but that didn't bother us since weather was cool the whole time we were there. Bathroom was small with peeling paint . Bathroom floor floods everytime either one of us take a shower due to it's half shower door. Tub size is standing room for one person. Hard to move around without bumping into the wall. Room does have LCD tv with CNN and BBC channels plus free porn channel after midnite. Overall, this is a good value hotel for the budget conscious travellers since it's located in the 7th district and within walking distance of Eiffel Tower. Wonderful front desk staff. Always courteous, friendly and made us feel welcome.

<Content>Perfect Paris This hotel was fantastic. I went in August and booked online so I got a superior room for half the usual price. I had room 45 which has an amazing view of the eiffel tower. I booked this hotel because of the good ratings on this site. I was not disappointed at all. The receptionists were really wonderful with perfect english. They were more than willing to help people figure out the metro or anything else. One found a really cheap eurostar ticket back to london for me.I was travelling this part of my trip alone and I felt that the hotel was in a really safe upscale part of town. It was quiet, especially in August as little retailers take their vacation, but I was able to walk to the Latin quarter easily. The closest metro is about 2 blocks. The hotel itself was really cute with a nice decor. Air conditioning was great and the room sizes were more than adequate. I really have nothing negative to say about this hotel and recommend it to anyone except maybe a group of young people looking to party.

<Content>Great Paris Hotel Stayed 4 nights at the hotel, receptionist spoke great english which was a huge relief and really helpful. Room was modern and well appointed. LCD TV, spotless bathroom, close to Eiffel Tower and good eating spots close by.They had a breakfast room but speaking to others probably better to eat elsewhere as 11 Euros a bit dear for their breakfast offering. Hotel well appointed and would return.

<Content>A must stay! We have just returned from our stay at the Duquesne Eiffel. I knew from reading the reviews the hotel would be a good three star hotel but I didnt expect the hotel to be a three star hotel with four star service...---and the view. You must stay in either room 55 or 56, the view is incredible. We stayed in room 55 and were extremely impressed by the view of the Eiffel Tower from our two balconies! The location is perfect, just five minutes by train or taxi to the Eiffel tower... 10 minutes to the Louvre...Staff at this hotel speaks fluent English and is very patient with you, if you choose to practice your French! My husband and I fell in love with this hotel and have made it our preferred location when in Paris. This hotel is an absolute must!

<Content>Duquesne-tastic! We stayed at the Duquesne hotel for three nights in early August. Really liked the hotel - in a superb location near the eiffel tower. Staff were really friendly and helpful - they also spoke excellent english which, while embarrassing as our French is so awful was really helpful. We arrived really early and got checked in straight away which was a bonus. Room was very clean and well equipped with safe, lcd tv and mini bar and a fabulous view of the Eiffel tower (if you hung out the window!!). Only criticism was the room was very small and quite hard for us to move around - the reason i didn't give this 5 stars.The inclusive Breakfast did the job and coffee was top quality - just what you need for packed sightseeing days in Paris. Everything you need is close by - metro, open top bus tower, some good restaurants - would particularly recommend Le Fontaine de Mars. The bar in the hotel was very cheap and you can sit outside with a view of the Eiffel tower and a reasonably priced drink - a rariety in Paris!The area is not the busiest and you feel a wee bit out of the heart of things but after a busy day it's no bad thing Great hotel that was ideal for our holiday!

<Content>Greatest hotel in Paris! We stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel hotel in late July, and it is the best hotel! The staff are extremely helpful...willing to give you directions anywhere and mark out the spot on a new map (they'll give you a new one for each destination!) Close to the Eiffel tower, and many bus/metro stops around. We arrived very early at the hotel, and they had our room ready with 20 minutes (after traveling all night- we were so thankful to have a room so early in the morning.) I'd recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a great hotel in Paris...

<Content>Tres chic! My husband, my son and I spent a long weekend in Paris, staying at the Hotel Duquesne. We had spent a lot of time looking for a good, reasonably priced hotel, close enough to some of the major attractions. We were not disappointed. Our room had a fantastic view of the Eiffel tower, and was walking distance from the Rue Cler, with its marvellous restaurants. The Metro was also just a quick stroll away, and the Ecole Militaire and the Hotel les Invalides within spitting distance. The staff were friendly and helpful (even offering to post postcards to family abroad for us). They also had valuable advice on what to see and where to go. The only part of our stay we didn't enjoy, was leaving. Other than having to say goodbye to gorgeous Paris, we forgot one bag (containing our house keys!) at the hotel, and had some difficulty in retrieving it, as the hotel wasn't happy to package and forward it to us. Other than that, we were pleased with the value for money this hotel represented. We'll be back!

<Content>Magnifique I am sitting in the reception of this charming hotel, waiting to go to the airport. What a brilliant time to write this review.Paris:  It has been a very hot five days. I usually visit paris in autumn, so summer was a bit of a shock. It is very hot and very busy. However, this means there is more to do. More street entertainment, longer evening hours to relax with a glass of wine in an outdoor terrace and more people to meet. The area around the hotel is perfect. You can easily visit the eiffel tower, military school or invalides as the encircle the hotel. 5 mins walk takes you to some lovely restaurants with great service ( La terrace is excellent) and food and the metro ecole militaire. I also highly recommend the haircdressers next door to the left. I got a great cut, friendly conversation and a pleasant experience.The area is also very safe at night and the hotel has 24hr reception.Hotel: On our first night we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who gave us all the information we could need and also gave us a safety warning about venturing onto the champs elysees whilst france played the quarter finals. The hotel has 5 floors, and 58 rooms. The lift to the floors is very very small, just enough for 2 people and small bags. We stayed in room 58, which was very small and had a view of the back of buildings. However, this hotel is listed at 150 euros a night, and we paid much less then this through midashotels[--]. Therefore, we had a lovely hotel in a great location with a ok room. The TV was LCD, the bathroom marble, the room cleaned every day with fresh towels and the option of breakfast in bed.The breakfast is 11 euros each, and there is some nice patisseries or supermarches nearby to get a croissant cheaper. However, our fantastic price also included brekkie. You simply went doen each morning or rang for a continental tray to be brought to the room, with no extra charge. It has a croissant, pain au raison, pain au chocolat, bread, butter, jams, honey, and orange juice. Bliss! The bathroom, despite being marble would be very difficult for anyone with poor mobility or a larger disposition as the space to get into the shower is tight, high and narrow. The room is air conditioned to perfection, an absolute MUST in Paris in summer.In summary, I highly reccommend paris as a destination, but especially stay in this hotel. Its cool, quiet and safe. I have stayed in much noisier areas and not liked it. The 7th arrondisement is perfect.

<Content>Great location - great hotel My friend and I stayed here for five days in April and thought it was an ideal location. It is within walking distance of many sites. We booked through the internet but asked for an Eiffel Tower view when we checked in and got it. The staff was really helpful, the rooms were great - small, but clean. I would pass on the hotel breakfast and go out to the cafes and bakeries which are cheaper and better. Would absolutely return to this hotel!

<Content>Great unpretentious hotel We just returned from a ten day trip to Paris to celebrate my daughter's graduation from high school. There were five of us: two parents, one 14-year-old boy, and two jubilant 18 year -olds. We rented an apartment in the 7th arrond. but could not stay the last two nights as it was already rented, so we booked the Duquense Eiffel as it was close by. The first thing I noticed about the hotel was how friendly and helpful the staff was---everyone at the desk spoke English and were very patient with our questions. When we first arrived, the desk person asked if we would like to see several of the rooms in order to make our own choice. Then, she made sure that she could book two rooms side by side so we could keep track of the 18 year-olds (!). The rooms are not posh, by any means, but they are decorated nicely and the bathrooms are above average for a small hotel. We stayed in a triple (with our son) and the girls had the other twin room. The triple was a tight fit, especially with open luggage, but it all worked our well. The TV was fine, and we watched the World Cup tournament on a couple of nights. Two best features about the hotel: 1) when the windows are closed, you cannot hear a sound outside! This is a miracle in noisy Paris and was much better than the apartment we rented. We all slept deeply and well. 2) when we left the room for the day, we left our clothes strewn about, but when we returned everything had been folded nicely into our bags, the beds were made, and the room tidied. It was great! Finally, we did not have a direct view of the Eiffel Tower, but if we stood and looked sideways out the window, there was the symbol of Paris, all lit up like an upside down bubbly champagne flute. Magical!I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is not seeking something fancy or luxurious, just a great, nice, quiet, solid hotel with a superb staff.

<Content>Couldn't have been more perfect! Just back from a 5-night stay at this lovely hotel in the heart of Paris. I booked it because of all the positive reviews on this site, and it definitely exceeded all my expectations. From the beautiful blue and yellow decor of our cozy room to the spotless and comfortable bathroom with the great view of the twinkling lights of la tour Eiffel--the hotel was just right.The location is very convenient with two metro stations within a two-block walk and lots of boulangeries where we got yummy things for breakfast. There is also a supermarket one block away for buying picnic supplies.The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and were fluent in at least three languages other than French.We will definitely be going back!Tip: For a great dinner within walking distance try 7me Sud on Rue Grennell.

<Content>It's pronounced "Du-Cain" All the previous reviews were right on! This place was great. Quiet, comfortable, very clean, and the staff, specifically, Pretty, were extremely helpful. We booked a superior room in advance, and were not disappointed, on the first floor, room #15, with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. If you are late for breakfast, you will not get any ham ;-) The windows to the street had great sound supression which really kept out the street noise...Great water pressure in the shower, with consistent temperature.Now onto 4 great tips, and under-the-radar secrets, which made our trip quite memorable: 1) La Terrace, a local restaurant, 2 blocks north of the hotel, on the corner of Duquesne and Ecole Militare...which is where the nearest metro stop is. This brasserie provided great meals for either lunch or dinner. 2) Le Zimmer, our favorite restaruant, with the most amazing Chateaux Briand ever! We went two nights in a row. On the right bank just across from the Latin Quarter, it is conveniently located on the north east corner of La Place de Chatalet, again right across from the metro. They even had a non-smoking section. 3) An evening concert at Saint Chapelle. Look for the flyers or posters outside of the entrance gate. Purchase your tickets early in the day for the evening concert. Our experience was a 6 piece orchestra ensemble, with a wonderful opera singer, performing Vivaldi, only amplified by the accousitcs of a 400 year old church. Nearly everyone was brought to tears. It was one of our highlights for sure! 4) All inclusive metro/all-access day pass to Versailles. These tickets must be purchased at the RER station (appox. 21 Euro), and will give you priority entrance, avoiding the huge crowds waiting to get in. We also highly recommend the guided tour, which tours areas which can't be seen on the audio tour. After very long days, it was always a pleasure coming back to the Du-Cain!

<Content>lovely hotel Hi,I stayed in the hotel over easter 2006 for 4 days and I must say I was very pleased with it. The room was on the 3rd floor and we could see the Eiffel tower. The entire room was very clean and nice. Service was great and we had a nice athmosphere. The neighboorhood is nice and safe. And you can reach every attraction within minutes by metro or even by foot. I definitely recommend this hotel. If you want to spend a few nice days in Paris with your loved one this is definitely a good choice. We payed 100 euros/night for the double (breakfast excluded), which is a reasonable price for Paris. I give it 4 stars only because I'm sure that there are nicer hotels in Paris...but of course these hotels are 5 star hotels which are much more expensive.

<Content>Great Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and found it good. It was exactly what we paid for, clean accomodation and the dtaff were very friendly, the girl at reception was very helpful and helped us choose restaurants to eat in, wouldnt recommend this hotel for young 20's like us as the area was very quite and we didnt find any bars or anything around! to get taxis down to the lively latin quarter was much too expensive...it was very near the eiffel tower which was great and the bus stop is beside it. I would recommend this hotel as it is very clean and the room is good, small but it has everything you need!

<Content>Charming hotel, just be sure and get a room with a view. Excellent service, friendly staff. Not all rooms have a view of the Eiffel Tower - ours didn't - so be sure to request it. The room was VERY small, but well maintained. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms renovated. Enjoyed the neighborhood and felt very safe walking alone from the Metro to the hotel in the evening. Excellent buffet breakfast. Originally we were on the 5th floor and the room was very smokey smelling, but we changed rooms without any problems. We would return to this hotel and/or neighborhood again. I would rate this hotel slightly above average yet less than above average. Check out the open air market under the Metro at La Motte Picquet Grennelle (one metro stop away or an easy walk). It's only twice a week but what an experience.

<Content>Cosy, but beware the sound-proofing! Booked this after reading lots of positive reviews on this site. It is a very clean, cosy Hotel and the staff are indeed very helpful and friendly. Room was small, but adequate (we booked a superior double). Only negative points were the poor sound-proofing between rooms, you can hear your neighbours using the toilet as well as other activities which go on until the early hours! Bed was extremely firm so much so that I woke on the first morning with what felt like a trapped nerve in my arm. Nevertheless, all that said it is ideal for a weekend break. Try the Tourville along the road for nice clubby type venue for drinks/eats.

<Content>Excellent Location for a Romantic break. Stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel Hotel for a weekend break for Valentines 2004 and 2005.This hotel is in such a great location, Just a stones throw away from the Eiffel Tower and such a romantic view can be seen from our bedroom. The hotel staff are helpful and very polite and the buffet breakfast is a great way to start the day.

<Content>So Courteous First things first, the location of this hotel couldn't be more perfect. 5 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower! Perfect metro line 2 blocks away! We stayed at this hotel for 1 week and I must say the employees were so king and courteous that we actually missed them when we returned.They went out of their way to pack my luggage I forgot at the hotel lobby and kept me informed about it until it was shipped to me. They really took care of our luggage like it was their own.When we go back to Paris, hopefully soon, we will definitely stay at the Duequesne Eiffel Hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, great location. We've just returned from a stay at this hotel and had to add our opinion that it was pretty much perfect. Every single member of staff were friendly. The breakfast in a little cellar type thing had a much bigger choice than we expected. The Eiffel Tower is a very leisurely twenty minute stroll away, and the Ecole Militaire Metro station is five minutes away and gives rapid accesss to all the rest of the sites. The local area is very safe with plenty of reasonably priced eating places. Finally, our room was very clean and the bathroom had an excellent shower. Yes, okay, the room that we had was very small and had no view to speak of, but what, you've come to Paris to sit in your hotel room!? Choose this hotel and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Excellent value for money Star ratings on French hotels are possible as accurate as the metro in Paris during strikes. That's why sites like this are priceless. I have stayed in four-star hotels in Paris that in my taste only should have two and certainly have paid more than the double doing so. This three star hotel could be a four-star.I stayed in a comfort double room on the 5th floor. Newly renovated, very fresh bathroom and with a balcony with a partial view of the Eiffel Tower (for full view go for the superior rooms) and Les Invalides. Yes the room is not enormous, but I have never found the need to put up a tent next to the bed. The staff was extremely nice and helpful and all spoke very good English (nice staff in Paris hotels is not something your spoiled with). In terms of location this is a great area. Not too touristy, a little posh and close to everything. I booked through Hotelclub and got a really attractive price.

<Content>Good location and excellent value for money We had one of the larger front rooms which was airconditioned and large enough for 2 adults and a five year old. The room was immaculate with seperate toilet and bathrooms (not all rooms have this, it's just a quirk of the floor layout). Two full size french windows overlooked the street below. Street noise was acceptable and only got a bit much during morning and afternoon peaks. Breakfast was adequate but a bit on the slow side, depending on which staff were on. Overall, the staff were very friendly and helpful.Location is very good, 15 mins walk from the Eiffel tower, 5 mins walk from Metro station and loads of good restaurants and cafes. Can recommend Bistro B on Avenue Bosquet for the best fillet steak I've ever eaten.

<Content>Perfect Hotel for an Affordable Price..... We stayed at the Duquesne Eiffel hotel for one week and loved it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only criticism was the room service. They didn't adequately replenish towels, cups and some of the basics. But other than that it was a great little quaint location. NO PETS ALLOWED IN THIS HOTEL...Good affordable local restaurants...In walking distances of Invalides, the Effiel, Musee de la Marine, Palais de Chaillot, local shops and the metro. If you're American do not expect big rooms, their rooms are very small even by economy hotels standard in the States. Enjoy Paris wherever you decide to stay.

<Content>Just OK My family stayed at the Duquesne for 4 nights - we used 3 rooms on the 4th floor. I am really torn as to my review of this small hotel. On the one hand, the place was extremely clean and in a great location. Close to the Eiffel Tour and des Invalides - many small cafes and markets. We enjoyed walking around the hotel neighborhood very much. The desk staff spoke English well and was helpful with directions, taxis and advise. BUT - I found the rooms very small with horrible, shabby sheets and towels. Twice we had to request towels and even toilet paper! The maids rarely replenished items like plastic cups, wash clothes and the honor bar. Also - the hotel is poor on service. We gave them a small amount of laundry that was promised back to us by 8pm. At 10pm we called the front desk to inquire and were told that we would have to come down and get it ourselves. I know this is a small 3 star hotel - and perhaps we expected too much - but I will try to step up to a better service hotel in the future.

<Content>Nice hotel in Paris for the right price I spent 3 nights, with two rooms, at the Duequesne Eiffel. The location of the hotel is excellent - close to metro, Invilades, Eiffel Tower. There are many local bistros, sidewalk cafes within a 2-3 block radius. The area was safe and walking the neighborhood at midnight did not seem uncomfortable at all. Pricing was in the $200/night range which I found very reasonable in Paris. The smaller of the two rooms is SMALL. The larger of the two rooms was adequate and typical for a large city hotel. The hotel was spotlessly clean, in excellent state of repair. The front desk spoke English, was always helpful and added to the pleasure of staying here. If you don't want to drop a fortune on lodging in Paris, this is genuinely a nice hotel to park for a few days.

<Content>loved the french people been back home four days. we had a fab time in paris, it was our first time. hotel DUQUESNE EIFFEL was brilliant. we booked a superior room could not have been better positioned. room 35, it had two windows, one to the main road the other faced the eiffel tower. WOH,what a site on a night time all lit up and sparkling. the rooms where very comfortable with a king size bed, tv,mini bar (which at first thought was expensive but then realised all paris was) all of the drinks in the mini bar was well known brands. the bathroom  toilets were very clean, lovely white towels every day. the only thing i would pick on (and this is really being picky) there was no tea  coffee facilites in the room this would have made it perfect. in there defense i did e-mail them and ask this and was informed i could ask for hot water at any time.there is one other thing, when we arrived i asked which one of the 2 rooms i booked was the non smoking room, the receptionist said smoke in either room. if i had gotten a room which people had been smoking in this would have ruined my holiday i think the management of the duquesne eiffel need to put this problem right or there is no point in advertising non smoking rooms. this apart we had a fab time and would definently go back to this hotel.

<Content>Everything was perfect The Duquesne was a perfect place for us. The view was spectacular, rooms comfortable/clean, breakfast (complete with eggs, ham, cereals and assorted pastries) more than expected. The front desk was kind and helpful, especially for a lost suitcase. This trip was for my daughter's sixteenth birthday and she loved it. Only two blocks to metro and five minutes walk to Eiffel Tower.
