<Content>It's all good This hostal is on a small square, less than five minutes walk from the Plaza Major and Puerto del Sol. Many of the rooms face the square and have little balconies. There are lots of restaurants available in the area.We've actually stayed here three times, twice in 2006 and again this year. At every visit the staff has been pleasant and very helpful. We've always spoken in Spanish, so I don't know if English is an option. Our rooms have been clean, attractively decorated, and large by European standards. Even in a room facing the square we haven't noticed any problems with noise. When we went in person to make reservations for this last visit the hostal had a sign on the door that they were completely booked for the night. The sign was up again on the night we stayed too, so reservations are probably a good idea.

<Content>Nice hostal My boyfriend and I stayed at this hostal for 1 night. It was clean and we got a nice balcony. They did not have our reservation when we got there but the were very accomodating when I showed them my copy. It was clean and the showers were great for Europe.

<Content>Great value Ok so its not the Ritz but for 鈧?6 you get a spotless, secure, compact room with ensuite shower. Its even got some basic aircon. Location is superb on a little square next to Mayor, handy for Sol and Chueca etc. In Madrid you're either asleep or out on the streets - you really don't need more than this for a few days. Bring some earplugs if you want to siesta though.

<Content>Inexpensive, Clean and Perfect Location We loved this hotel. It is minimal as far as service, of course ($55E) but very clean, safe and comfortable. The previous post said most of what I would have to say-- loved the free wifi and internet etc. Rooms were small but not tiny. The little balcony/window looks out over a nice little square that is busy but pretty quiet. There is an elevator (this hostal is on the 3rd floor of the building) and you need a key for both the exterior building door and the hostal main door... there was always someone on at the desk when we came in. We were actually fairly near the reception (referring to previous post about noise from reception) and I was worried when we got to the room... but it did not end up being a problem. We ran the air conditioning all night, so perhaps that helped to drown out any sounds... It is probably just really room-specific. We would absolutely stay here for the ideal location and price. However, we weren't looking for much more than a comfortable bed and bathroom.

<Content>Great location! Hostal Cruz Sol is my favorite place to stay in Madrid! I have been studying in Spain for several summers and I always stay here the night or two before my flight back home. This year, my husband traveled with me and he loved the hotel, too!The rooms are small by North American standards, but they are clean and have good views.The hotel website does NOT mention that they have free wi-fi for guests! And, there is a computer in the lobby that any guest can use between 10 am and 10 pm. Another bonus, all rooms have Air conditiioning...a plus for the Madrid summers!

<Content>Great Location My husband and I stayed 5 nights at this hotel at the end of April . What I like the most is the location. It is very close to the metro station (2 blocks) and within walking distance to the main attractions. The price is also very good (we paid 55 euros per night). The room was small but very clean, with a hairdryer, safe and a TV. There is a computer with free internet in the lobby. You can use it anytime until 10:00 p.m. There was only one problem. Our room was located just in front of the reception. We were very tired the first night so we decided to go to bed early (11:00 pm). That is when our nightmare begun. The reception is located next to the main entrance (which have a VERY HEAVY door) and there is a vending machine right in front of it (next to our room). People where coming in and out of the hostal until very late (3:00 a.m) and you could hear them slamming the main door everytime. The phone from the reception did not stop ringing and you could hear it so clearly that it would make you believe it was the phone located in your room. You could also hear people walking (some of them laughing, singing, conversing, etc, etc) to the vending machine to get a coffee or an snack at 2:00 o'clock in the morning. I am not talking about the noises coming from the street, which were nothing compared to the noises inside the hostal. It was a terrible night and I am not a light sleeper.The next day we talked to the people in the reception and after begging, literally begging for one hour we got them to move us to another room in the first floor. This room was bigger, the TV was not hanging from the ceiling and it was nicer. Problem solved. You could still hear some noices coming from the street and from other guests in the hostal but nothing that would prevent you from falling asleep. The rest of the trip was great, so my suggestion would be: PLEASE try to avoid the room located in front of the reception or very close to it. Make the reservation directly with them and specify that....otherwise you will end with a headache.

<Content>Brilliant hotel. My girlfriend and I spent two nights at this hotel and we thought it was absolutely fab. The location is great, the rooms are super clean and at 55 euros per night, it was a pearler of a deal. The hostal was only 30 seconds away from Plaza Mayor, 1 minute away from Sol metro stop and 3 minutes away from El Corte Ingles (department store and supermarket). If we go back to Madrid again, this will definitely stay there again. PS - Skip Barcelona. Madrid is far far better.

<Content>In the heart of the movida If you don't wanna spend too much and visit Madrid easily, this is a great choice. This hostal is splitted between first and third floor of a very central building, right in the streets of the movida, but not so noisy. Essential and very clean rooms with private and functional bathroom for just 28 euro per person in a double, with TV and air conditioning. There's no breakfast but there are many bars all around the streets. Also there are lots of restaurants in the nearby. It is about 4-5 mins walking from the nearest undergound station (Sol) which thakes about 30 mins to reach the airport, with 2 changes. I'd surely return here again. The staff only speaks Spanish but it seemed nice.

<Content>Fantastic location! My husband and I recently stayed here for 5 nights in mid-April for a great rate of 60 euros per night. The hotel is very centrally located near Puerta del Sol and a few minutes鈥?walk from the Sol Metro station. Another reviewer鈥檚 directions were perfect for locating the hotel from that point. The hotel faces Plaza de Santa Cruz and is located on the third floor. There is a tiny lift that will take you up to the hotel.The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. We spoke primarily in Spanish, which was easier than conversing in English. There is a vending machine and free internet access in the lobby. The first night we were put into a triple when we booked a double room. The next day we were told we had to move to a double, Room 317. The room had a safe, a hairdryer, a phone, a flat screen TV that received only Spanish stations, an armoire, and a small desk and chair. This room was smaller than the triple, as expected, but had a great view overlooking the plaza. The trouble was the nightly noise from the people, musicians, buses and taxis circling the plaza made it almost impossible for me to sleep, even with the doors closed and the shutters drawn. So if you are light sleeper, ask for another room. The bathroom was standard for European hotel rooms, had great water pressure, and an abundance of hot water.If you plan to leave early on check out day, the management would prefer you settle the bill the evening before since the lobby desk isn鈥檛 manned until 9am each morning.If you are looking for a great location and a great price, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Varies On the plus side - good location and very cheap.On the downside - poky rooms and bathrooms, rude staff.Our first impressions of this hotel were not good as the front door was locked and no one would answer the door bell. We finally got in as someone else was coming out but had a similar experience up on the third floor (up the stairs - lift didn't seem to work). Again, door was locked and it took a while for someone to answer. When she answered she hardly spoke any English, didn't really want to try and told us we would have to move rooms on our third night.Room was OK considering the cost but nothing special and very small. When we moved room however it was completely different, which led us to think that there was considerable variation between rooms which I have also noticed from other reviews.Overall, if you are looking for somewhere cheap in a good location then it isn't bad but just be prepared for a bit of a hassle getting in.

<Content>Great location, not so great staff The hostal is very centrally located and the rooms are clean but can vary a lot in size. I reserved directly with the hostel by email (in Spanish) two months in advance and confirmed my booking two weeks before going, specifying that I would like a room with a view of the square. However, we were put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal, overlooking the road that was being dug up. Although they said the next day we could move rooms, they changed their minds after we had spent 30 mins packing all our things away in the morning, which was rather annoying. Overall, it was good value though and the location made it worthwhile.

<Content>A Very Good Choice! Stayed there for four nights in december/2007. The hostal is clean, with bathroom inside the room and located a few meters from the Plaza Mayor, so from there you can go to all interesting places in Madrid. The rates are fair!

<Content>Great value  We stayed here for 3 nights early this month. The rate was only 55 euros per night which is really a great value. What we liked most is the location of the hostel - just 3 mins walk to Plaza Sol and the Sol metro station. Also, only 2-3 mins walk to Plaza Mayor. Many traditional / well-known restaurants nearby, including the famous one - Botin. The room is clean and with everything we need. The whole hostel is also very clean and we always saw the maids tidying up rooms and cleaning the floors.There's a safety box in the room. It charges 1 euro each time you lock the box.However, also some short-falls during our stay:- it was quite cold in Madrid this month, the heating of the room was not very stable (we cannot control it)- the hostal is located on the 3rd floor of the buidling. However, the lift was in very old style (need to be operated manually) and not always working. It'll be a problem if you're carrying big suitcases.In general, these shortfalls are very minor points. With such great value and location, we'd recommend it to budgeted travellers to Madrid.

<Content>Okay place Great value considering the location, air conditioning in the room and private bathroom. The rooms were very clean which were cleaned everyday but the mattress and pillow were pretty uncomfortable. But it's hard to complain considering we only paid 50 euro/night. When I booked the room, I had asked for a queen size bed for 2 people but got 2 double size bed instead which worked out quite well since our room was fairly large. I peeked into some of the rooms being cleaned and they looked really small so we were quite happy to get a fairly good size room.Museo de Jamon is just around the corner which is great for breakfast. Lots of tapas bars  restaurants in the area.

<Content>Very Good Value Excellent value, excellent location. We stayed in three different rooms in the 'Student Residence' section (one floor up). The first two rooms were airy and had good views of the street, very clean and comfortable. The third however was extremely cramped and the walls were paper thin. It also didn't smell great. It was at the end of the long corridor to the right. Just ask to see your room, and ask if there are alternatives if you don't like it. Perhaps others have not checked in yet and you can swap.

<Content>Overall, great value. 鈧?0 a night in a major capital city will inevitably have some minuses, but overall this was a terrific place for the money. The plusses, apart from the price, were the location, cleanliness, good bathroom and comfortable beds. The minuses were the size of the room (306, which was tiny, bedroom space about 10' by 8'6, two single beds with about 2' between them) and the thinnest most non-absorbent towels in the world. The cafe to the right of the entrance doors as you look at them serves a very cheap and fresh breakfast and the staff are pleasant. The previous reviewer who questioned the rating given to this place must bear in mind the price paid. Of course there are better places in Madrid, but for the budget traveller, this is a winner. For those who like such things, the red open-top tourist bus (Madrid Vision) was good value, and cheaper if you book online before you go. The previously mentioned scary lift was working fine, but still scary.

<Content>a great choice! Not much to add to the other reviews really. For the price (student discount available with any university card), this is much better than we would imagine in terms of the size and quality of the rooms. We stayed in the 'student residence' which was not 'studenty' at all. The location at that price in a capital city is amazing - smack bang in the centre of Old Madrid (we never needed the metro). Staff are friendly and there is nothing we would change. And no, in terms of luxury this isn't the 10th best hotel in Madrid - but in terms of meeting (or exceeding) the expectations of guests (and we're talking less than 拢40 a night here) I can well believe it's the 10th best amongst users of tripadvisor.

<Content>Great place I stayed at the Hostal Cruz Sol for 33 nights while taking classes at the University. I have nothing to say but good things about this hostal. The location is perfect, the room was very clean, comfortable, the bathroom newly renovated. I liked the tile floors, always kept spotless. The air conditioning was quiet. As noisy as the street could be, once you closed the window, it was quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it. Good weekly rate too.

<Content>get a grip A bit of perspective - the 10th best hotel in madrid?? An average pension, no more, no less. A central location - good if you want to hang out with the rest of the tourists in plaza mejor. Clean rooms, but basic, lift was not working when I was there. Nothing to make it stand out above any other pension anywhere else in the world.

<Content>Perfect Location and Price! We very much enjoyed our stay here. Our room was not big and decorated with some lovely lavender and pink themes, but it was cleanand modern inside and the staff was quite friendly.Other than the price, the best thing about this hotel is its location. It is right by the Sol metro. Yes, the walk is about 10 minutes from the metro stop up a little hill on a side street, but we didn't find ourselves (30s and fit) strained a bit, but rather enjoyed the ambience of the Plaza and looking out the balcony to see all the people going by. It was surpisingly quiet and nice.Great value!

<Content>Helpful staff, Great for the money At 50 Euro a night (2 Euro discount for students), this centrally located little gem is a steal! It's not the Ritz -- however, the facilities are clean and comfortable and everything you need is readily available. Our shower head broke during our stay, and after informing the staff, it was promptly replaced with a new one. There is also a coffee vending machine down the hall, which is a nice treat, especially for budget travelers who like to eat breakfast in-room before sightseeing for the day. The hostal staff also were kind enough to watch over our backpacks on the day we checked out so that we didn't have to lug them around before our evening train. Hostals are the way to go if you're trying to save money -- I recommend Hostal Cruz Sol!

<Content>Great value for money. Absolutely recommend this place. Its central location is absolutely a plus. Just about anything is a stone's throw away. The room is clean and practical. Bathroom amenities are adequate and somewhat beyond my expectation. It's got double-glazed windows which work great in keeping out intrusive noisefrom side streets especially at night time. 52 Euros per night for this place is one of the best deals in the city, I believe. The room is small. The bathroom is a little too small. Inroom TV is also too small. The rooms are on the 1st and 3rd floor of the building. If you get a room on the 1st floor, it's alright. But if you get a room on the 3rd floor, sometimes you may have trouble usingan elevator.

<Content>Excellent value for money We stayed here over Easter weekend as part of a stag party. We booked 3 triples rooms and all were above average. They were clean had plenty of room, a TV and an e-suite shower room. The only slight downside was the en-suites were quite small but were adequate for the purpose of taking a showerThe location is superb and right next to Plaza Mayor.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Can't beat the location You can not beat the location... near both Plaza Mayor and Puerta de Sol. My room was quiet, albeit small. When I am travelling, I look for simple, clean, safe places that are centrally located (and with hot water). This place meet my needs very well.

<Content>Great location  I stayed here for a couple of days last week.Rooms are small, as some other reviewers said before, but basically if you need a clean place to sleep while you tour the city during the day, this is your place to stay. The location can麓t be better, right next to Plaza Mayor and in one of the most beautiful squares of the city. Make sure you get a room that looks into the square, in front of the Santa Cruz Palace (now the Ministry of Foreign Affairs).The price is also great ... I dont think you can find in Madrid places like this with such a price. Finally, if you have concerns about safety... it麓s 100% safe.

<Content>Great location and good price only We stayed in Hostal Cruz Sol for 3 nights in late January 2007. For 52 euros a night for 2 adults, this was a bargain. The location is right near Plaza Mayor ( the main Plaza in Madrid - and the tourist information is in the square ). The actual hostal reception is located on the 3rd floor and we arrived around midnight. This place is family run, and none of the staff spoke english ( which is fine by us, but getting a new battery for the remote control was difficult and we didn't persist). They have many rooms, but it appears they actually own ( or maybe rented out ) rooms on the 1st floor ( which is labelled Student Accomodation ). The place is clean - clearly renovated in the last 2 years. Entry is with a keyless card. The room itself is small, with two single beds joined together, a small table, and a clothing cabinet which contains a safe ( which you must pay 1 euro per open/shut ). It was very clean. No tea/coffee facilties. The bathroom is small again, with a shower ( no bath ). There is no place to put your bath accessories when showering, and the plumbing was very slow. Hairdryer provided.Of note: they do not clean the rooms each day - just make sure you keep the place clean yourself.On the whole - this is budget accomodation in a great location, and you basically get what you pay for.

<Content>Perfect Madrid Accommodation My friend and I stayed at Cruz Sol in July after having made an internet booking months in advance. When our flight was delayed and we arrived at the hostal at 2am, we were welcomed in and shown to our room which was exactly as stated on their website. The rooms were clean and secure with extra conveniences such as a hair dryer, safe, patio and a decent sized bathroom. Very central location with fabulous bars and restaurants nearby. Very affordable accommodation -would recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Best value we found in Europe Clean, comfortable room with a locker (safe) and a tiny balcony. The elevator was useless but we got so used to walking that we didnt mind the few flights of stairs.Right behind Plaza Mayor and one block to Plaza del Sol right in the heart of Madrid. No breakfast but plenty of places to eat all around. They have a dispensing machine for early morning coffee.One thing I don't get - why do they forget to install a shelf for soap and shampoo in the shower/bath?For location, cleanliness and value - I highly recommend this hostal.Enjoy Madrid and don't forget to drink Horchata and eat a Napoleanita pastry.

<Content>Loved it! New and super clean! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 1 night and we both were very pleasantly surprised by how new and clean the room was. We think it must've been recently renovated. There was a nice double-paned French doors that opened onto the street below. Nice view and the street noise was completely blocked out once the doors were closed. Very friendly service, and even if their English wasn't perfect, they always tried to understand our needs and meet them. We'd stay here again and recommend them, a great value and location!

<Content>Location, Air-Con, Value GREAT location near Sol and Plaza Mayor - also convienient to my favourite place in Madrid the Museo del Jamon for breakfast and the city tour buses which stop on Sol. The level of English (or German or French) was basically zero but we managed. Tight elevator. (Evil) air con worked and was sadly necessary in July. Vending machine with drinks in lobby. Good Shower pressure - although the wall bracket didn't hold it so you have a one-handed shower. Tight rooms but you're paying for location, and not too much at that. We'd stay again.

<Content>Great Value! This is one of the nicest hostals I've been in my life. I'd say it looks like a hotel in many aspects. The rooms are clean (they seem to have been renovated a short while ago) and you have TV, phone, hairdryer, etc. The Hostal has coffe machines, vending machines and even free internet service in your room (minus the PC, of course). It is located two blocks from the Metro Station and the Plaza Mayor, so you are basically in the middle of everything. I was there to save some money on a business trip and It was easiest to go from there to my meetings than staying in some other expensive hotels in other areas of Madrid.Staff is very helpful and they know their role. Only couple of details: the bathroom is kind of small; if you are size L or larger, you will have a hard time getting on the shower. And there is no much place to put your things so if you have a lot of suitcases you'll have a hard time finding a place to put them

<Content>Excellent location. Clean and cheap. We stayed at Hostal Cruz Sol in 3 nights in January 2006. The room was small, but clean and very cheap. The location is great. We will recommend it, and we will definitely stay there again if we ever come back to Madrid. But don't eat on Plaza Mayor. We eat our first breakfast in a caf茅 on Plaza Mayor. It was expensive and the service was not good. For dinner I would recommend Restaurant Colonia del Sacramento on Plaza del Comandante Las Morenas 3.

<Content>Cute and Cozy For a hostal, this place was pretty nice. The rooms are very clean, the place is in a great location, close to the metro in a quieter plaza, and pretty much anywhere in the city was pretty accessible. I have no complaints for the place, maybe the only downside would be the homeless people that sleep in the plaza if you are coming home late at night and by yourself, but other than that, it was great.

<Content>A Great Little Gem This is a great little hostal situated on the 3rd floor of this building with a lift.The rooms are clean and bright and great value for money.The location of this is excellent and only a 5 miniute walk from the Metro station if you exit at the Mayor side.The staff are helpful and most speak English.I booked a single room and although it was small i had a double bed and balcony.Small bathroom with shower but more than suitable.The only drawback to staying here is i found the walls of the room paper thin and could hear the people talking in the next room so earplugs are a must!! Also my room was on the rightside of the building (303) and several Homeless people were there every day-night outside my room drinking  shouting.Although this didnt put me off staying here again it could put most off trying to sleep.NB,Reception is not manned 24hrs.

<Content>Don't bother. I booked our room directly with the Hostal in August, and had confirmation - After travelling for 8 hours to get there we found they had no reservation for us this weekend (October!) - and they were full. They did nothing to help us find anywhere else.Would not go here for love nor money again - we ended up staying at the Hostal La Magdalena just off the Plaza Mayor which was far superior and the staff were incredibly helpful

<Content>Perfect place to stay in Madrid on a budget I would definitely recommend this little hostal to anyone travelling on a budget to Madrid. Or not on such a tight budget. I mean I would have to have a lot more money to stay at a place other than the Cruz del Sol.Everything that you can ask for this kind of money is there. I cannot describe why it felt like this. The only adjectives I can find are 鈥渘ice鈥? and 鈥渃lean鈥? But the whole hostal somehow feels right.You even get a TV and a safe in the room, though try not to put anything you need every day in the safe, it costs you an Euro to close it again every time. Also don鈥檛 forget to buy a MadridCard, especially if you are travelling with kids. It gives you free entries to almost all the museums, the hop-on hop-off tour bus and more. Also when the kids get tired you can recover the price of your card with a day鈥檚 visit to the zoo and the theme park. 鈥淭uristic abono鈥?for the Metro and a MadridCard, and you are set to go and explore Madrid with hardly any further expenses except for food. Maybe they should pack some sandwiches with the Madridcard package?For food though make sure that you don鈥檛 arrive home too tired, and do try to walk further than the zocalo for your dinner. Many restaurants there work on the principle, that they will never see you again anyway. Or we just had bad luck twice. The place is great for people watching both Madrile帽os and tourists, and it鈥檚 close to the hotel, but better arrive full and have a dessert or coffee instead of eating there. Also don鈥檛 miss the sunday morning here if you, as a kid ever started to collect anything. You will see the people who never gave up even when they became grandparents!Stay at this perfect little budget hotel, and enjoy Madrid, she鈥檚 beautiful!

<Content>Beware We had booked to stay at the Hostal Cruz Sol (confirmation number given, deposit paid etc) so to our horror, after climbing the stairs at the end of a long journey we were told they had no rooms for us!! We were very disappointed as we chose this accomodation through the reviews on trip advisor. We had alternative accomodation sorted out for us by the Hostal Cruz Sol but I don't think it was in the same league. So beware fellow travellers - the reason for the 'overbooking' was reneovation works. The hostal was centrally located and would have been ideal. It was so close to the Plaza mayor, Plaza Sol and within walking distance of all tourist sights. If you get to stay there, enjoy it. Madrid was great.....!

<Content>Nice, clean and good value I spent two nights in June at this hostel and was extremely satisfied. It is located in the old part of Madrid near the Plaza Mayor. Despite the dilapidated entrace (now under renovation), rooms are very clean and all come with bathroom, TV and hairdrier. They are decorated in typical Mediterranean warm orange/lemon colours with plain courtains. Beds are hard and comfortable. They have double glazing, but still are a bit noisy (I put my earplugs and managed to get a sound sleep). The atmosphere is not great, but receptionists are efficient. Besides, it has two friendly coffeee shops near the entrance where you can have the typical chocolate con churros. I paid 37 euros for a single - good value for this area of town. I can highly recommend it.
