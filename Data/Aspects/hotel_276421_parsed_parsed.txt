<Content>DON'T STAY HEAR!!!! We stayed at the IFA Villas Bavaro in punta cana. Don't stay there ever! They had no activities for you to do. Most of the hotels in Punta Cana they have dance lessons, games at the pool, Spanish lessons, things like that. This hotel had none of that. The only thing they offered was water polo and water arobics and that was only once a day. Not to mention that the food was more for the for the European Countries. You could find something you liked that usually was the pasta. I just don't fell this hotel wants any americans to stay at this place. I did write the company it's self but I have yet to hear anything from them. PLEASE WE HAVE STAYED AT ALOT OF RESORTS IN PUNTA CANA, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE NOT HEAR!!!!!

<Content>IFA Villas Bavaro is a Dream!! We traveled to the Dominican Republic from July 15 - 21. Well, actually the 16 - 21 because Tropical Storm Fay caused us to have to fly back to the US from Puerto Rico and then back the following morning, but that is another story. Once we got to the resort and walked in, it was fabulous. We were a group of four in our mid-twenties without children, and it was awesome!We asked to stay by the middle pool which was the most popular place, and it worked out really well. We ate the breakfast buffet, which was loaded with fresh pineapple, very thick bacon and eggs made to order. Oh, and the fresh Dominican coffee was perfect. The afternoon was spent at the swim-up bar with Domingo, who was very generous with the Brahma beer, which I must say beats Anheuser-Busch anyday. And if you do not want beer, grab a Cuba Libre (rum and coke). They are good too.You see staff bring parrots and monkeys by the pool daily for photo opportunities. Be careful of how far you go down the beach to the bar. There is one bar at IFA that is close to the beach, and that is it. We found a bar that we thought was IFA, and we accidentally spent about two hours there and had a tab when we left. It was still reasonable though, and we laughed at our mistake.If you like cigars and souvenirs, the market on the beach is great. You can save some money there. I was warned about fake dry cigars from the market, but I thought they all looked to be high quality, and I always keep cigars around; plus, there is rum, necklaces, t-shirts, coffee, etc. here to buy. The more you buy from one vendor, the bigger the discount. Everything is negotiable, and you do get haggled. Prepare your No, thank you before you go in. Some vendors are very nice though and allow you to browse haggle-free. Of course, we usually bought from these guys.This is a wonderful place if you do not demand five stars and the greatest of luxuries. And there were many children there, so it is definitely family-friendly. I feel like we got more than we paid for. It was a great place to relax and enjoy some of the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. They do not have much of a snack bar at night; this is a problem. Also, dinner reservations were a problem. All we could get reserved for four were two ten o'clock dinners. You can try to get in without reservations, but this is not guaranteed. There are of course two buffets, but they close at nine. So, plan your dinners, or you may find yourself starving at midnight if you miss the buffet. I believe you can actually still get pizza and burgers from the open-air pizzeria close to the main pool, but this is what I usually had for lunch everyday because you could go there in swim attire. Plus, the pizza is about the best I have ever had, and the burgers too.Use sunscreen! Lots of it! I actually did not get burned, even in August, just a little red. But, it was because I was smart about the sunscreen. We came prepared with bug spray too, but we actually did not see one mosquito, not sure what all the hype is about.This is a very European place. I found it an interesting challenge to try to meet and make friends with many people from other places and met some of the coolest people. There were a couple of other groups from the states, but Americans are the minority. I just tried to soak it all in and enjoy it. And I did.The nightly entertainment on the beach is good here too. We did not pay to go out to the nightclubs because there was free booze and good nightlife at the resort. If I could have changed anything, it would have been to stay at least 10 days. I was so jealous of the Europeans there on their month-long holiday when we were there six days.Definitely bring singles for tipping. It really helps out. We brought $130 for 6 days, but we spent a lot of time at the bar. My wife brought toys and good makeup to leave for our maids and their children. They were very appreciative and gave our room special attention.As far as excursions, we were told we had to meet with someone from who we booked our vacation through (USAirways) about excursions. I felt we could trust this guy and what he was selling. We were told by him not to book through others but I am sure they are fine too. We went on the snorkeling/stingray shark swim/booze cruise. Yes, it was one excursion of about five hours. It was well worth it for our group. We had a blast getting to swim with nerf sharks and stingray and then to snorkel in the reef. What a beautiful place!!I would love to go back here. We loved it. It is not a five-star resort, but it had some wonderful staff, food and fun.

<Content>Very good value resort - just turn the music down! Very good value resort 鈥?just turn the music down!Stayed for 2 weeks end of July. A lovely stress free and relaxing holiday AccommodationWe were in a main apartment block close to centre of resort. Pleasant short stroll to all facilities including beach. Guests in villas at top end of resort would have a fair walk and perhaps feel a little out of the action. However there is a hotel courtesy bus. Room spacious and comfortable. Excellent shower. Air conditioning faulty in our room (didn鈥檛 cool enough). Complained but wasn鈥檛 fixed while we were there. Frosted glass around shower and toilet offers limited privacy but not a major problem for close family and good friends! Only one room key activated at a time so don鈥檛 bother asking for a second. Be aware the room towels are all taken away from you about 9am and not returned until 6pm. This is an irritating nuisance but we simply hid one towel from the maid so we could use it during the day.Watch out if you have young children using the TV. There is explicit porn freely broadcast all day. ReceptionWe checked in at night so didn鈥檛 have a queue. The reception staff I met spoke English OK. A tiny bit of Spanish is helpful. Easiest way to change large dollar bills is to ask a porter. Book the a la carte restaurants at the Information desk at the right of reception.PoolsThree very nice pools plus a Jacuzzi pool area. Very high standard of cleanliness. The main pool near reception has a swim up bar. Reasonable number of loungers. Only thing that really grated was the loud music that blared out most of the day. Mainly Salsa but sometimes heavy drum beat Garage/House dance music. Not suitable for an afternoon sunbathe snooze. Music at the smaller pool was slightly less intrusive. Tthe upper pool was quiet. FoodI thought the all-inclusive buffet was perfectly adequate. There was a wide choice of food at each meal and it also included a choice of freshly prepared dishes cooked at the grill. The service was generally excellent. Waiters attentive and constantly clearing used glasses and plates. The food needs to be covered and protected from birds flying in. Also there was no escape from salsa music played constantly even during breakfast.In addition to the buffets there are three a la carte restaurants for evening meals. You need to reserve tables for these and they book up fast. Also you are supposed to dress up a little and men should wear long trousers. There is a Caribbean theme restaurant 鈥淐aribe鈥? Food and service excellent. Wine list available at supplementary charge.The Japanese theme restaurant 鈥淏ambu鈥?is particularly pleasant. The Mexican theme restaurant 鈥淛alisco鈥?has a la carte deserts but a buffet for main courses. EntertainmentThere is surprisingly little publicity advertising for the in-house entertainment . On the beach in the morning there is a Salsa/Merengue class and aerobics in the sea. At 9pm there is a nightly show on the beach stage. The dancing show is colourful and energetic but the comedy show night has laborious, predictable sketches in Spanish. We didn鈥檛 go on any excursions because the weather was very hot and we didn鈥檛 want to be stuck on a bus or boat for hours. Also the party boats seemed a bit rowdy for my taste but would probably be great fun for the 18-30 gang.We went to the nearby shopping centre and had a pleasant Tapas lunch but overall the shopping centre is largely deserted and dull.BeachAbsolutely stunning beautiful beach. Swept clear of sea grass every morning. Easy snorkling with fair number fish close to shore (in left side roped off swimming area). Plenty of loungers and limited shade from palm trees. Guests have I hour free use of some sea sport equipment each day. Eg snorkel, windsurfer and pedalo. Pleasant to stroll along the beach to take a look at neighbouring resorts. However the security guards are on the lookout if you try to sneak in without the correct coloured wristband.  BarsGenerally the bar staff were friendly and efficient. There was a fair range of cocktails made with local spirits. Branded spirits could be ordered at extra charge but I never really thought it necessary. The nicest bar is the 鈥淐af茅 Dominicano鈥?close to restaurants. The drinks are served nicely in real glasses while sitting in a very comfortable open lounge. Overall impressionThis was our first Caribbean all-inclusive holiday so I admit I have limited experience to compare. I realise other resorts may be better and more luxurious, however in my opinion I thought the Villas Bavaro was an excellent choice. The weather while we were there was superb. The staff were generally excellent. The standard of cleanliness around the resort was extremely high. Take plenty of small US Dollar bills for tips. I needn鈥檛 have bothered getting Dom. Rep. Pesos because everything is priced in Dollars. Many people don鈥檛 bother with anti malarials here because mosquitos are few in this resort. I only got bitten when I lay on the grass in the shade.There were a few niggles that could be improved with little effort if the management wanted. eg. Reduce the music to a less intrusive level, replace clean towels immediately, protect the buffet from birds and don鈥檛 soak the pathways in the evening. However overall this was a thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable holiday. I would certainly recommend this resort

<Content>should not be in an english travel brochure We went to this hotel with high expectations but come away very dissatisfide.The check in desk staff where unpleasant to say the least,the room was at the back of the kitchen no view at all,the chamber maids did not clean our room till after 6 oclock,the meals had no variety at all, catered for dominicans and south americans too much,theres at lot of building work going on at the moment,but looking on the bright side that should be finished in few years time,noise on the beach from building work,helicopters,speed boats,water taxis etc etc.There was a couple of good things to say about the hotel, the rooms are a good size and well thought out ,the grounds are nice 3 nice pools,{the sun beds are bolted down so you cannot move into the shade},and one really nice barman called Kelvin, apart from that they need to retrain there staff in hospitality

<Content>A wonderful place! Me, hubby and teenager were at the IFA Villas Bavaro two weeks ago (end of July). We flew American and were treated very nice. We then quickly made it thru the airport to our Turintor Tour Bus. So far so good. (We were armed w. our CVS pharmaceuticals)The Lobby was very pretty. The Lobby and walkway throughout the entire resort paved w. stone. We exit lobby on the opposite side past the main pool to get to our room (3104). This room was not in the villa section (we booked 6 mos ago) it was centrally located next to everything. It was a very pretty room. (We visited the villas section via trolly several times - it is the furthest section from beach but trolly goes back every 7 minutes and it is also quieter there. You'll also get to see some turkeys and peacocks there.It took us about a week to get over our depression of being back into our nice Long Island environment. Everyone at the resort was very nice, polite and warm towards us. I wanted my daughter to experience the countryside so were took a truck safari w. Jonathan (tour guy spoke several languages) . We soared up the mountain, ate sugarcane, swam in the river, went to the beach, rode horses, etc.. This is a must do in D. R.The buffets at the resort were very nice, good food everywhere. I really hope the spirit of the dominicans continue to be a happy and loving one. When we were at the breakfast buffet we would be seated, waited calmly for our coffee, then ran to get our goodies. I noticed a few tourist that felt the waiters should hop faster - please pray for these empty people. One of us had too many pina coladas (they have mixed drinks all over this resort). Please remember, too many pina coladas can cause you to sound like an orchestra in the bathroom!When we were at the pool for lunch we ate at the Pizza place (they also have chicken nuggets  french fries). When we were at the beach they had burgers, hot dog, chicken, rice and beans, salad, fruits galore, wonderful. We also went to the three ala cartes - just book two mornings before you want to go. Caribe restaurant was the best.. The dominican coffee place was a nice place to sit in the evenings. There's also a place to internet and call back home w. reasonable rates (next to coffee place and small shops)There are buses to casino and Palma Real Mall. Mall is small and a little high end. If you want a bargain go towards the beach on the right and the flea market there has alot of fun jewelry, coffee and beachwear. This was fun.Only made it to the show at night once. We were alway too tired. We had a great time and want to go back! Never got to use my pharmaceutical products. If you have any questions feel free to email me alquinones@optonline.net

<Content>You Get What You Pay For We booked our stay thru USAir Vacations, which gave us the best pkg price. I searched enough ahead of time and was happy with the price we paid for four of us. We brought our son 37 and grandson 14, so we needed two rooms. Normally we pay for two close to what we paid for four, so when my husband would comment that something wasn't par, I would remind him that you get what you pay for. Overall rooms were very adequate. We stayed in the center of the resort, the closest building to the reception desk. Which put us near or central to everything, the pool with the swimup bar was in front of our building, the pizza bar a little further up, the main buffet building for breakfast was to the left of our bldg. We were close enough to the beach that it was a nice walk through another section with a small pool and a second buffet bldg. used for breakfast and lunch. the spa and exercise bldg. is directly across from that bldg. then a little further down the path to the beach. All the activity was at the beach including all night entertainment. We walked down two nights in a row, but most of the shows are in spanish and we know very little.I was really glad that I had read reviews before going because I read that they take your towels early and don't bring them back til late...true, also no washcloths ever. So I brought washcloths and hand towels. Also no clocks in the rooms, I brought clocks.Take lots nof sunscreen, we used spf 30 and only my husband got burned, but it wasn't bad, we just kept loading it on. Casme home with tans.Food wasn't wonderful, the same pretty much everyday. Japanese restaurant was very good but not air conditioned. The Caribe restaurant was good and it was air conditioned. We didn't go to the Mexican restaurant since my husband doesn't care for spicy food and I had read a review that it wasn't so good.One thing that I do want to mention is that most of the reviews complained about the reception desk being slow, not nice etc., so we were prepared to encounter the worst. We were so pleasantly surprised and caught off guard by our check-in . A young gentleman by the name of Julio was so friendly and jovial and spoke very good English (which was a big concern from reviews). One other thing that I thought might be helpful to know is that there are 3 sections to the resort. I'm not sure which was built first, but we stayed in the middle and we were very happy with the accomodations from that section. The section furtherest from thebeach, seems like it's another resort on it's own. It appeared quiter and was really pretty lit up at night. That side is where the ala carte restaurants are. Liquor is bottom shelf and if you want a name brand it will cost you around 7 or 8 US dollars.Hopefully this helps,just remember you get what you pay for.One more note, there's not much else to do besides lay by the pool and eat. Activities at the beach are okay but not much as far as night unless you go into Punta Cana.

<Content>Hospitable. Indulgent. Wonderful. What are all these complainers yapping about? Armed with some deep TripAdvisor reading about this place, two of us jetted off to Punta Cana. Checked in on a Sunday, checked out on a Wednesday.BOOKING: I researched places based on our budget and found IFA VB among those listed on Expedia/Travelocity/Hotels/etc. I *almost* booked through one of those, until, on a whim, I checked the resort's website to see about availablity. Turned out, the dates we wanted fell inside a promotional window, so we got a 30% discount by booking directly through the website. Yes, 30%. Hooray.Check-in  Checkout were unremarkable. Hello, we're here...here's your key, slap on the wrist band, off you go. Checkout was similar. OK, we're leaving, snip off the wrist band, here's your taxi. Ciao! (Taxi to/from the airport is 28 dollars each way  takes 20 minutes.)Property in general: Spotless...and by 'spotless', I mean, without a spot. New-looking stones  tiles. Manicured landscaping. Fountains. Flowers. Chickens  baby ducks strut around. Zero trash, zero dirt, zero stains, zero cigarette butts or gum wrappers. Cleaning  maintenence staff swarm all over the place and it shows. White-glove inspection ready. Nice.Room: We stayed in 4226. Room showed every indication of a very recent renovation. Smelled of fresh paint, new floor tile, fixtures were smart and modern. Other reviewers who pointed out the frosted-glass WC door were correct. It is what it is. 2 double beds, sheets and pillows were adequate, but then again I have no trouble sleeping anywhere, so I'm no help there. My main nit-picky pet peeve when I travel, though, is hotel showers. I usually just quietly tolerate the weak, lukewarm hotel granny stream, but not here. The shower is a heavy-duty blaster with no shortage of hot water. The shower is also newly renovated, with natural stone and glass bricks and gel/shampoo dispensers. Nice. TV/fridge/safe/towels...zero issues. Yes, your room key is needed for electricity  air conditioning, and all of that is shut off when you leave the room. Other reviewers who found that hard to comprehend need to pause for a moment and consider how smart a system that is. And the room cools off nicely again in minutes, not hours, after returning.The beach is three minutes by foot, down a coconut tree-lined path. Plenty of beach chairs. Plenty of elbow room. The sand is powdery sugar and the water is clear with some grass that neither smells nor sticks. Swimming area is roped-off, smartly so, since there's a near-constant parade of waverunners, small motorboats, and Caribbean Festival party catamarans buzzing to and fro. Non-motorized water sports are provided by a commercial agency on the IFA beach. I got a snorkel/mask/flippers by plunking down a deposit which was returned when I brought the gear back. You can also sign out their kayaks, sailboats, windsurfboards, and bodyboards, all for free. Uniformed security officers patrol the beach, to keep aggressive vendors away. We were approached by a couple of the My friend, my friend types, but I've always been pretty good at making those people go away. Not dangerous, just annoying. The bazaar next to the beach has all the requisite t-shirts and painted gourds and souvenir bric-a-brac. Grill on the beach deals up burgers and hot dogs, bar has pina coladas and cold beer on tap. I'm getting nostalgic just picturing it.Back to the resort: the pools are all unique and lovely. Main pool in sight of the reception is a kid's playground...if your kid likes a swim-up bar! Shooting fountains and water-soccer nets. And did I mention the swim-up bar? (I truly hope people were leaving the pool to take care of certain drinking-related personal functions.) Another pool, outside the reception, in the villas area, is quieter, more sedate. And at the tip of the resort property, furthest from the beach, is a jacuzzi bar, with four separate jacuzzis. There's a couple little shops on the property, a beachwear  art store, a pharmacy, souvenirs, and an internet center that charges 3 bucks for a half-hour online. The cafe/bar just outside reception is a perfect place to have one of a myriad mixed cocktails (with or without alcohol) and relax under fans on enormous comfortable chairs. That was our favorite spot. We did not take any outside excursions, and we did not attend the evening shows/performances.Food: here's where I depart from many reviewers of this place: there is NOTHING WRONG with the buffets/restaurants here. The offerings at the buffet, especially at breakfast, were astounding. I usually don't pound a huge breakfast, but I went nuts on the breads and cheeses and yoghurt and fresh fruit. Lunch  dinner featured varieties of pasta, a chef manning the grill with steaks, calimari, pork chops, veal, chicken, local dishes like goat and unusual fish, salads and breads and juices and desserts and soups and excellent coffee. The water is purified and perfectly fine to drink, the buffet seating is uncrowded, the hours are generous, and the staff is cheerful and helpful. Seriously, if you're accustomed to finer dining than this, you should vacation at a far, far more posh place than this resort, Your Highness. You can reserve a table at one of two specialty restaurants, one Mexican, and one Asian themed. We ate at the Mexican place one night, it's a buffet as well. Excellent food, and an unhurried, pleasant change of scenery from the buffet.Other guests: Vast majority of guests were Spanish-speaking. The rest were Europeans, mosty Eastern, according to my ear for languages. Polish  Russian. Much French, German, Dutch also spoken. We encountered almost zero native English speakers. However, language barrier with staff is non-existent.Wrapping it up here, we left IFA VB stunned that we got such a value. A deep discount, a gorgeous and impressively clean resort, a beautiful and comfortable room, ample and excellent meals, helpful staff (but not pushy or disagreeable), postcard beach, sparkling pools, plenty to do if so inclined, plenty to NOT do if so inclined. We chose the latter. We sat on the sand, we walked miles of beach, we got comically sunburned, and now we're back home with awesome memories.

<Content>awesome hotel my sister and i went to ifa villas to lay on the beach and swim. it was the best place i could of picked. dont listen to the other reviews of this place. they are all wrong. its been totally renovated and perfect. beautiful white sand beaches w/ reddish pink flecks, 100 ft tall palm trees, clear turquoise water. the food was pretty good. loved their breakfast buffet. you can get by there knowing a little spanish. toppless beach. shopping on beach, can barter w/ them. disco that goes til 3 am. their rum is so good there. i suggest the pina coladas. food and drinks whenever u want them. they have an awesome japanese and seafood restaurant that u need reservations for. the japanese was the best. the sun is hot so bring sunblock. i give this place 5 stars! will go back.

<Content>Fantastic Value My best friend and I went to the IFA Bavaro Villas from 6/12-6/16 and we loved it. I read all the reviews before going, and I can't really say that any of the complaints were a problem with us. The rooms were better than we expected, the resort was beautiful, and the beach was within walking distance...must closer than we expected. I think the people who are disappointed must have had different expections, but for $113 a night for two people all inclusive...that is a fantastic deal for what we received. The food wasn't amazing, but I enjoyed it. The people were very nice to us. It definitely helped that I knew a little Spanish...I think many people who were rating this resort negatively must forget that they are in another country...their native language is Spanish and their culture is not to be necessarily speedy at getting things done :-). That is just one of those things you have to be sensitive to when staying at an especially inexpensive resort in another country. We didn't do any of the optional excursions because we were more focused on being lazy, but other people indicated that they had fun. If you are looking for a luxury resort with everything catered to, then I wouldn't recommend this resort...but if you are like me and on limited funds and want a great value....I definitely would stay at the IFA!

<Content>Learning to relax..... Went down by myself, (as a single female) to relax and visit friends who moved there. Just remember a Dominican minute can take a 1/2 hour....The front desk registration went well enough, one person (Maximo) needs to be nicer to the guests, I found him rude and demeaning. .Dinner reservations can be made starting in the morning, opposite the reception desk, you must make them in person - we ate at the Japanese and the Caribe, both were nice. The buffet food was good, the wait staff works hard, just remember you are in an island situation, the buffet is open so you can admire the scenery, birds will make every attempt to steal food to enjoy...(remember,you are in a island setting...)Make sure you get an extra card for the room, the electricity runs only when the card is in the holder - no electricity means the air conditioning goes off...The only negative I have is the housekeeping staff - I always tip at the beginning and each day..even tho it's an all inclusve. Used towels will be collected early - 9am the days I was there, fresh towels were returned late 6pm one day! - also, they will leave the doors/windows open while mopping the floor, inviting all the mosquitos in to feast. They don't have wash cloths, so bring your own if it's important to you - they do have dispensers for gel/shampoo/conditioner in the shower area in the section I was in Rm 4414-- bottled water was supplied and they happily gave me extra's.Internet cafe was good 30 minutes/3.00 American. The tv in the room did not have any shows in englist except for the China business news.. Tehy will charge you to get shows that you and the kids can watch...I felt very safe in the area, lots of security were visable. always checking to make sure only guests were using the facilities.Marketplace on the beach you need to haggle, they expect it and no one pays the first offer... I did well by finding out what prices was offered and walking away, the next guy would beat the offer....Just because it's an all inclusive PLEASE...remember...you don't have to start drinking as soon as you wake up - I did see some people who thought is was appropriate to take over one pool and make it uncomfortable for others. Thankfully there are 3 pools and a jacuzzi area - wish I realised that from the beginning I would have gone to the jacuzzi area earlier. The spa was totally relaxing

<Content>Save your money.....go elsewhere...terrible resort!!!! Very, Very disappointed with this resort. This was our fourth trip to the Dominican and we have loved it everytime.....except this time. This resort was a 2-star at best. First the good: the rooms were very nice. The a la carte restaurants were nice. That's about it. Now the bad: With the exception of the Cafe Dominicana bar, the drinks at the resort were horrible. Oh, they have top shelf liquor, but it's not all inclusive. You must pay $7.00 per SHOT (not per drink) for any top shelf liquor. So, for a Long Island Ice Tea, you're looking at over $30 for the drink! The bars were very ill-equipped. You have to repeatedly ask for ice in your drinks, and one bartender told me the reason there were never any limes at the bar was because they were too expensive. Also, unless you ask for alcohol in your drink, you don't get any!! Unless the drink is on their menu, they don't know how to make it. For example, I ordered a martini (which I had to pay $7.00 for), and they didn't know how to make it. How much more basic than a martini can you get?? My daughter's air conditioner in her room did not work, so she was finally moved after 2 days...to another room with an inoperable air conditioner! After 4 days and much complaining, the air conditioner was finally fixed.  I speak a fair amount of spanish, but I was surprised at how little English staff members speak. I can't even imagine someone going there who speaks no spanish....they'd be lost. There is a large local contingent always present at the resort. The resort is located right next to a suburban residential area of private apartments/townhouses. ALL the residents have access to the resort, so it gets very crowded. As mentioned earlier, the a la carte restaurants were ok. The central buffet was not.....the same food every single day...no variety. Same with the pizza snack bar, and the same with the beach snack bar. Whatever you do, don't order a hamburger...it doesn't taste like any beef I've ever had before. The animation team was a joke. They too were very predictable....same thing every day....stretching and volleyball. That, coupled with EXTREMELY LOUD music blaring on the beach (and I might add, many of the same songs over and over and over again....enough already). And speaking of the beach, there are NO umbrellas of ANY KIND on the beach. Every other resort in the Dominican has thatch-roofed umbrellas for those not wanting to stay in the sun all day.......not this place.  If one had never been to the Dominican before, or to an all-inclusive before, one might think this is a nice place. But believe me, spend a few more dollars and go elsewhere. We have previously stayed the the Grand Oasis Resort, and the Sunscape Resort (coincidentally, located right next to each other). We had a wonderful time at both resorts and would highly recommend them over this place. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

<Content>Okay This was our second time at the IFA Bavaro. May 9-16. 2 Yrs ago my husband and I stayed and we had the best time. Had NO complaints about the resort. We brought a family of 4 w/ us this time. It was there first time in the Dominican and picked IFA for there first trip. WOW! The resort has changed so much (for the good and the bad). I'm not one to complain about resorts. We have been to the D.R. 4 times and never once have I complained. This trip I had a few issues. Did not let it ruin my vacation. The check in was a breeze. Our travel agent booked us an ocean view room but we didn't get them. It was okay because I really don't hang out in my room much. We requested to be close to the beach. We did get rooms close to the beach. When we got to our room, it was so hot in the room. Well, the A/C was not working. I went to the front desk. They sent someone up to look at the a/c. Nothing was done. They ended up by coming 2 times and nothing was done. I know they like money. With my little Spanish, asked him to fix the a/c and gave him 10.00us. Let me tell you the A/C worked PERFECT the whole week. He was very happy and so were my husband and I. The family we traveled w/ had no problems w/ there room. I noticed if you take your room key w/ you lights and a/c turn off. I brought an old credit card but it didn't work. I spotted a maid w/ my little Spanish she set me up w/ an extra key again few bucks helps and everyone is happy.  I thought the food was horrible. They closed the main buffet the week we arrived. I booked the Mexican and Oriental a la carte. My husband was so sick from the Mexican. It was our 2nd day and he was sick the rest of the trip. He didn't let it ruin his trip. Just had to be real close to a bathroom and drank tons of H2O. WE loved the Caribe and Oriental. Tried to avoid the buffet. Was very disappointed w/ the selection of food. Breakfast was okay. I really liked the Pizza bar. We ate lots of pizza and fries. We did enjoy the beach grill.   The beach was wonderful. Plenty of chairs and shade. The staff was on the beach at 10:00am w/ plenty of music. My husband drove the little speed boats w/ the locals. Was going to book w/ Scubacaribe but gave my husband the run around. My husband and I booked massages on the beach through the Spa. WOW! They did a great job. The family that came w/ us had 2 young ladies whom wanted there hair braided. There were 2 locals whom walk the beach giving prices to have hair braided. On one of the last days the 2 young ladies went and had there hair braided w/ Mona. They walked down the beach to a little hut. Once they were done and paid the amount they requested. Mona was hassling them to pay her. Telling them they had paid her boss and they needed to pay her. Mona would not let up following them to the resort. Finally Mona stopped and returned to her hut. Be careful if you have your hair braided. Go to the Spa to have it done. Safer..We spent a couple of days by the main pool. With my husband not feeling all that great we stayed close to our room and the bathroom. The pool has changed and looks beautiful. It was very clean. The swim up bar was great and Miguel was fantastic. He has GREAT customer service skill. He enjoys his job. We brought him a nice bag full of gifts for him and his family. I do have to share w/ you that the locals check in for the weekend and are very rude. My husband and I were going back to our room after being by the pool all day. I noticed a local w/ his small child hanging out at the pool. I looked again and the child had his bathing suit pulled down and he was peeing in the pool. I made a comment and the local (dad) said it's okay My husband and I noticed that there was a change in staff. We thought the staff was great. Amazing how many hours they work per day. Our room was always clean and fridge was stock w/ plenty of soda, water and beer. We put out gifts and money every day for our maid. The rooms have changed from 2 yrs ago. I thought the rooms were very nice and bigger. The only complaint was when I did want to watch a little T.V. there were no English channels. My husband did catch a Red Sox game one night in Spanish. He was too sick to join us for dinner, he was very happy to be able to catch a baseball game. Would not return to the IFA but would return to the Dominican and stay at a different resort..

<Content>So-So The hotel was beautiful. There are 3 pools and so many bars. We stayed right outside the main pool area with the pool bar. The room was great except for issues with ants in the toilet and sink area. We complained about it several times, however nothing was done about it. Another issue was that the cleaning maids came to pick up every single towel in the hotel room at 8am. No towels were given back to us until 5pm. The presented a problem if we woke up late or needed to go to the bathroom. The toilet and shower areas are a little see through..however it wasn't a big deal. There are no channels in English, so if you are looking to watch some tv since there is nothing else to do in the evening, then good luck with that. The food was the biggest issue. We went to the Mexican restaurant the first night, and the food smelled spoiled. It must have been sitting out for hours. I ordered a drink and that was warm. Never went there again! We did go to the oriental place, and loved their food..and continued to go there every single night of our trip since the other food in the hotel was horrible. At the buffets, there was flies in the dressings, and at one point we saw a bird just sitting there and snacking on the food, and no one did anything about it. The water was good, since no one got sick from it. We ended up having the same meal every day: bread for breakfast (with water), pizza and fries (with soda), and oriental food (with other drinks). The service of the hotel was overall pretty good. People barely spoke English but we were able to get around pretty easily. The beaches were gorgeous, but get ready for ScubaCaribe to hassle you for money. They come up to you at every possible moment for you to sign up with them to do activities. If you are interested in that, that's great, but we were there just to lay on the beach and relax and when people are constantly hassling you, it's annoying. We did venture out to the other beaches during the day, and guys hassled us there, as well. We were 3 young women, but still be careful when venturing off your resort. Never do it at night, and stay in groups. There is a market and also internet cafe where you can go on the internet for a reasonable price and also make calls to America if needed. The hotel also had buses that allowed you to go to the casino and shopping center. We didn't want to venture on that since we weren't interested in either, but both a good option if getting bored on the resort. Some things to always bring: lots of sunscreen, bug spray (my friend got 35 bug bites within the first couple days we were there), something to do in the evening to keep yourself entertained. They do provide bottled water in the refrigerators in the room. There is a downside about that because electricity only works when your room key is inserted in a slot when you are in your room. You only get one room key so when you leave the room with that key, everything turns off - all lights, air conditioning, and refrigerator. We did get a safe key for a reasonable price, as well. Overall, I wouldn't come back to this hotel, because of the food. The only things to do at this resort was eat/drink and lay on the beach...and if you are left with only one option, you are gonna end up baking in the sun starving to death. I would def try another resort after talking to other people at the airport and hearing about their food options.

<Content>Relaxing Vaca! My friend and I stayed at this resort from 5/3/08 to 5/8/08, I would return to Punta Cana but try a different resort. Apparently it was a long weekend in the countries so it was mobbed around this time, check your calendars or do some research before you book! We were pleased with our stay but it does get a little boring at night because there really is no entertainment- it's more of a relaxing get some drinks and walk around type of resort! Our check in was a disaster, the front desk was very unorganized and rude. There is no check in line or anything so it's basically bombard the front desk until someone sees you. Our room wasn't ready for about an hour b/c housekeeping was a little slow. I would recommend checking in on a Thursday or Friday b/c the weekend was mobbed..... Check out wasn't a problem. Get an extra key to your room, they only give you one at check in! We didn't use the safe in the room we were both a little uneasy with leaving money while we were out. The resort and the grounds were gorgeous, very clean! Our room was average nothing special which was fine for us girls! The only problem was the shower ceiling was leaking when someone upstairs was taking a shower... The tv only gets 2 american channels if you want to nap or just hang out in your room, bring an ipod or a portable DVD with some movies if you get tired of being outside! The beach was amazing the water is crystal blue and the sand was so fine and white- loved that part! Bring SPF 50 or higher b/c you will burn it's a strong kind of sun out that way!!! The workers offer Aerobics and yoga which was very entertaining! All of the workers were nice on the resort always saying hi! The restaurants were very hard to find, we ended up finding them b/c we walked around one day. There is Japanese, Carribean and Mexican located in the Cafe Domenico they are small restaurants so make reservations quick it gets filled up fast! The buffet was alright you get sick of the same foods everyday but it was fine for us! Pikalo Pizzeria was the best they served pizza and burgers up until 10p if you were hungry or in the mood to snack! The waiters try their hardest to entertain you which was pretty funny but they were really nice! We had great massages, those women worked hard to please us which was very nice! I totally recommend taking a morning or afternoon to go- that was well worth it! There is no shopping unless you take a bus off the resort, we didn't do that seeing that this was our first time in that country. The local stores on the resort were fine for us! The resort offers different things to do at night by taking a bus off the resort for Casino, swimming with the dolphins, excursions and snorkeling however we just went there to relax.... It was a good, relaxing time we definitely needed a break from everyday life but I would try a different resort next time. Oh and bring bug spray and spray those legs I got chewed alive at night! Pack very light your in your bathing suit all day and at night it's a little muggy so sundresses and tanks are the way to go!!! Hope this helped a little....

<Content>Awesome Beach, Nice Resort, Subpar Food Three of us stayed at IFA Villas Bavaro May 8-15, 2008. We were in our early twenties and booked the trip through a travel agent several months in advance. The resort overall was very well-maintained, most buildings looked new, pools were nice, and a few construction projects were ongoing.Our room was located near the main lobby and main pool area, so the pool and buffet was a short walk from the room. I would suggest asking to stay in this area of the resort, as the villas area is pretty far from the actual beach and the shuttle service to the beach would have to be used. I think if our room had been located elsewhere, we may have left with an unfavorable impression of the resort. The beach was a short walk through the resort, along tiled pathways. The beach was awesome, however, my only complaint would be that the resort is located in a central area that involves a number of water sport activities... so alot of boats are hovering a few yards away from the beach and a small roped off buoyed area is designated as the swimming area for guests. The room was very well kept and clean. However, there is little privacy with the bathroom and shower. The toilet is located behind a thin, almost see-through glass door as soon as you enter the room. The shower has one wall that is made of square bubble glass blocks that are somewhat see-through, if only silhouette. This isn't a huge deal, just a heads up. The only drawback with the room is that the air conditioning is operated by using the room keycard. Only one key is provided per room. When you remove the key and leave the room, the electricity and air conditioning to the room stops. It took several hours for our room to recool after it had been closed most of the day.The biggest complaint of our stay would be the food at the buffet. The food is hardly seasoned, very bland, and has little taste one might expect of certain dishes. We found eating at the pizza bar (which also serves chicken tenders and fries) to be our safeguard. The reservation-based restaurants are nice and serve better food..however..the mexican themed restaurant is basically a glorified buffet. There is a market located near the beach where prices are very negotiable. If they ask 35 dollars for something, chances are..if you stick around long enough and give a counter offer you can leave with the goods for five or ten dollars. However, I would recommend only buying cigars or jewelery, and buy the small souvenirs and paintings at the airport because the prices are the same or less at the airport on your way out.We would go back to this resort for the price we paid. Security was great at the resort. If a basic dominican vacation is what you are looking for, and have a strong stomach that can handle the food... this resort may be for you. **One disclaimer: Americans should know ahead of time that there is an obvious anti-american slant among hotel employees and vendors at the market. Be prepared at the nightly shows for chinese people to be made fun of, and jabs made at americans...of course only in spanish. When we asked a vendor about not liking americans, the issue seemed to be the war in Iraq.

<Content>Will Return!!! I just got back from my honeymoon, and we loved this resort! It was worth every penny! The pools are huge, and not over crowded, the loud music was great, but they also had a smaller pool that was quiet and very shaded if you just want to chill. I did water aerobics with Alex everyday at noon. The room was absolutely beautiful! We also paid for a couples full body massage on the beach only 80 dollars for both that lasted a hour! The beach looks just like the pictures, white sand beaches and blue green transparent water. It was gorgeous! We hung out alot at the Gri-Gri (which is the swimup bar) Miguel the bartender was spectacular! Great personality! Everyone working for this resort were some of the nicest people i have ever met. Our travel agent told us not to tip, that it was included in our price. But you fall in love with these employees, so we tipped everyone, and I think it made such a difference. not alot, just a dollar here or a dollar there. The shops on the resort are great, we came back with lots of souvinirs. Do not pay full price for anything, they are willing to come off the price some. I do not speak any spanish, and had it not been for my husband, I would have not understood anyone. This is the only downfall, is that everyone there speaks spanish. So atleast know some if you are going. They try to communicate in english, but it is very difficult. So just refresh yourself on your spanish before going.Also, I have a verizon phone, and it didnt work there at all. The operators kept asking for our credit card number when we would try to make collect call. I had been told not to trust anyone outside of the resort, so we never gave it to them. So make sure and take a calling card. Or there is a internet room on the resort that is 3 dollars for 30 minutes (which is ample amount of time to send a email).Our only complaint (which was not the resorts fault in anyway) was that our travel agent hooked us up with coco tours to transport us from the airport to resort, and resort to airport. They were AWFUL! Not reliable at all. At first, we couldnt find them when we got off the plane, it took like 45 minutes of dragging our bags around before locating them. Then our representative at the resort didnt show up to meet with us to schedule our ride home. We called, and called, and she wouldnt return our phone calls. Then finally on the last day she answered and scheduled our ride for 1pm. a hour after checkout.....so we sat outside and waited, and then when they finally pulled up at 1:45 said there was only room for 2 people, so there was a argument between everyone waiting on their ride. When I go back, the only thing different is I will tell my travel agent not to book me with coco tours. I will go with someone like expedia instead. It was for sure the nicest trip and nicest price trip I have ever been on. Most beautiful resort i have ever seen.Oh and I took bug spray and never had to use it! I kept hearing, the mosquitos were so bad. I never saw the first one. Hope this helps!

<Content>Would never return !! Stayed here for one week and couldnt wait to get back to England, it was a Caribbean version of Pontins, infact i have had better holidays at pontins than here. They seem to put all the english customers at the back end of the resort which is a good 15 minutes from the main eating areas and 20 mins from the beach, pathways not lit up very well at night and only one security man for the whole complex. The rooms in the brochure and on the net looked nothing like our little chalet room that was beyond basic. The restaurants had birds pecking at the food and we saw several cockroaches helping themselves to the buffet. We have been to the dominican lots of times and this as to be the worst complex ever. The beach was amazing and plenty of sun loungers but that was the only thing nice about this holiday. I wouldnt def never go back.

<Content>Best Vacation Absolute Best Vacation ever. Booked our vacation online. Never spoke to an actual person. Hotel employees were courteous and attentive. Some language barrier, but with only limited spanish on our part, we did fine. Tips are appreciated and remembered. These employees are working 12 hour days sometimes 6-7 days a week. They might have an off day, but a smile and a tip makes their work days better. Check in was a breeze. I recommend arriving on an off day (not a Saturday) as there were only us (girls trip - 2 moms, 2 daughters) and one other couple checking in on the day we arrived. We arrived at the hotel at 11:15 AM and even though they say check in is at 3:00 PM, we had our room and was settled by 12:15. Rooms were clean. Beach is a short but beautiful walk. Wasn't sure what to expect with all the reviews prior, but was very pleasantly surprised. Caution on the open air markets. Vendors are very pushy. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. Only drawback is the shopping center they have on site. Lots of empty stores, must still be under construction. For us, this was not a problem as we weren't there for shopping. The pizzeria was the best. Give Addison  Frankie a smile, they are the best.

<Content>Great Holiday, Low Cost Ifa Villas Bavaro was a wonderfull week in paradise ! The Hotel was beautifull and the staff were all very pleasent and friendly. This was my family's first vacation to Punta Cana and we plan to return to Ifa Villas next year but will go for two weeks insted of one. Ifa's beach area was beautiful and located on either side of our beach were flea markets where bartering for treasures to bring home was fun and an experience that we won't soon forget.Anna who works at the pizza bar located at the central pool , was a very lovley women who took a shinning to my 6 yr. old son and blew kisses to him every day and made sure that he had all the ice cream (with unbrella's) that he could eat.We enjoyed the kids show with all the children up on stage dancing, and singing.The buffets were good but didn't offer to much variety, when in doubt have the made to order pasta, my children's favorite!Over all we didn't want to leave when the week was up, we miss the sun and sand already and can't wait to return next year!

<Content>NOT RECOMENDED Unless you speak fluent spanish dont stay here. We experiencedproblems with our air conditioner and no one could fix it becausethey couldn't understant what we were saying at the front desk!We finally got our room changed to another one finally after freaking out. where we found the T.V. didnt work and the furniturehad no cusions. The rooms were disasterous and infested with cockroaches, crickets, and little centipede creatures but after what we went through with front desk we gave up complaining as it gets you no where there. There was a gigantic spider the size of a Trantula in the hallway out side our room not a nice experience seeing that.The drinks there are terrible one type of beer, no bottled beer or any type of hard liqure I have ever heard of. Bacardi or anything like that $7 a drink considered Premium!Food was good and service there was pretty good. Thank Godbecause with out that this Hotel is a true expensive Joke!

<Content>should have been rated 2 star hotal not 4 When we made our initial reservations with hotels.com for the IFAL Villas Resort Well our journey to the IFA Villas Bavaro Resort we had reserved two rooms due to the fact that we had 5 travelers. A day later the 5th traveler dropped out and we no longer needed the 2nd room. We called hotels.com and requested that we change our reservation to one room with four people in it. They said we shouldn鈥檛 cancel our reservation but they would call the hotel and tell them we would have a fourth member attending and told us it would be an extra $74 a night. We called the hotel looking for a shuttle service from the airport but they didn鈥檛 provide one, thus made it confusing when departing the airport.  Once we finally arrived to the hotel we embarked a mayhem of people standing around the entire hotel counter trying to do a series of requests all at the SAME TIME WITH THE SAME HOTEL RECEPTIONIST. Once the receptionist attended my family she did not understand that we had a fourth member with us. She kept telling me no problem and handing me three of the hotel wristbands and three towel cards and two door openers. I kept explaining to her no we have a fourth person in both English and in Spanish. FINALLY she understood that the fourth person was with us and then sent me to yet another person. I waited in that line again to then be told that the rate is $88 a night per extra person. I told them that hotels.com had spoken to a Jon Carlos Tieba and that he told us that it would be $74. The receptionist then proceeded to tell me that person didn鈥檛 even work there. Then he was about to ring up all four people and told me the charge would be $770. He thought we were paying for all four people. That made me furious to realize that we had paid SO MUCH more than we should have but we didn鈥檛 really have a choice. So I said we have already paid for the three people and just need the fourth person. We took the $88 a night coming up to an additional $70 for the week than it should have been. It took over an hour and a forty-five minutes to check in and another fifteen minutes to get to our room. Upon getting to our room we only had two room keys. One room key was needed to keep in a holder to keep the electricity on and the air conditioner running. Two keys for the four people in the room because a tremendous hassle. It became an even more hassle when fellow room neighbors began kicking on doors for 5minutes at a time to be let into their hotel room between the hours of 2AM and 5:30AM. We never were able to sleep well during our stay due to the banging on the doors to be let in. The size of our rooms were crammed. The beds were extremely small for two people, the shower and bathrooms were open and visible to anyone walking around in the room leaving absolutely no privacy to any of us. The bathroom was extremely small. On Wednesday morning I discovered a cricket in our room and was able to catch it and discard it. By the night time we discovered a spider as large as my hand crawling in the corner of our room. We quickly called the front desk and they said they would send someone over immediately. About fifteen minutes later someone showed up and bug fogged the area the spider was in and finally caught it. Later that night we found a water cockroach. From that moment on we were unable to sleep properly in the hotel room because we were so stressed out by the bug infestation. This made our stay extremely stressful because we were unable to change rooms due to the fact that the hotel was already fully booked. On a side note the hotel guest information never aided us with any tourism information, we didn鈥檛 even know where anything in the hotel was and never was able to make reservations to the restaurants on their property. This was extremely disappointing because we had to find things on our own and if I hadn鈥檛 researched a snorkeling excursion prior to departing the USA I would have never known about it. On our last full day at the hotel I ate breakfast like normal. By 1pm I began to feel horrendous pains in my stomach. An hour later I began vomiting. My family members went to the front desk to notify them of the food poisoning and they acted completely non-sympathetic and non-responsive as if it was not their problem. By 8pm that night it had turned into convulsive vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously. By midnight I was unable to bear the sickness and sharp pains any further and required emergency medical attention. The doctor arrived to our hotel room and proceeded to check my symptoms and gave me two IV injections and five other medications. She requested that I go to the hospital and that the hospital would be able to cancel my flight. I didn鈥檛 want to be stuck in a 3rd world hospital so I refused to go to the ER in the Dominican. This sickness due to the hotels poisoned food caused us to incur a $294 doctor bill. In conclusion the service received at this hotel was horrendous. It was not a vacation but rather a sleepless, non-relaxing, and remembered with horrible food poisoning experience.

<Content>Your experience is what you make it - ours was great Having read many reviews before this trip and several others since I returned, I thought I should add my input. I always find it odd that people can have such different experiences-many at complete ends of the spectrum from paradise to never again. My explanation is simply that it will be what you make of it - for us, it was great.There are no doubt a few areas to improve and I will start with these. First, it is true that some of that staff may not be the most friendly. We found this to be the case more so with the entertainment staff. We also found in fact, that the entertainment was a little boring - rather than be cultural, or domincan in nature it was Western and with the exception of a few, not all that talented.Second, some of the food can get a little tiresome. There is not a huge variety at all times. The food is good but again, you may start to feel like you are eating the same thing over and over, particularly at breakfast.Third, the pools do not have much shade. While the beach is great and covered by many big palm trees, the pools have little if any shade as the trees are small or non existant. Finally, we found the rooms in the villas to be a bit stuffy. The bathrooms have no windows and the windows in the main area either did not or could not be opened as anyone walking by would see in.In the end however, these problems are fairly minor. From the beginning, we found the experience very good, even great. The resort is absolutely beautiful and the people very warm. The staff at the front desk may have been a little too business like at first, but given that we arrived at the end of a long day with an entire bus load of others guests, that suited us fine. A tip for those who complain about not being told about this or that - ASK! We knew about check out, safes, breakfast the next day, got a ride to our room and we did some research before leaving. When we got our room, there was an error - we booked village but got villas. This was a good thing actually. If you are on a true vacation and dont mind walking through pools, cafes, nice landscaped areas and just enjoy the scenery, the the villas are great (it was about a 15 min walk to the beach for us - room in the high 1000's)We also noticed right away there was no air conditioning in our room. I have read complaints about this already but I dont understand how - we asked for it to be fixed and a technician showed up that same day. In fact, it would have been fixed earlier but when he showed up the first time, we misunderstood each other and we somehow told him it was ok . This brings us to the next issue people talk about - that the staff do not speak English. We found many workers that did speak English and when we ran into difficulty, we sought out our English speakers for help. Plus, its amazing how far a few hours of Spanish can take you - after all, we are visiting a Spanish speaking country, maybe we should work harder to communicate with them.As for the food, I have already said how some of it may get a little bland after a while, but Im sure the same can be said of any resort (as has been my experience). The food was fresh, there was certainly sufficient quantity and always some good juices and fruits. We tried 2 of the 3 reservation style restaurants and found these quite good. It is true that you need to reserve ahead but not the 3 days ahead we were first told about. We reserved the same day - again, you just have to be flexible. As for the other guests, I have to say the resort was fairly quiet. Even if it was not, I dont see how anyone could fault the resort for loud and drunken guests (there are security guards around and so I don't believe any of this activity would last long anyways). When you do encounter a loud drunk, I suggest you do what we did - shrug it off, laugh at him and consider free entertainment - it is, after all, March break at an all inclusive, and therefore somewhat expected. This is just luck of the draw and having been at the resort during peak March break time, I give them credit for keeping things quiet.All in all, I think the resort was well worth visiting. It is a great place to relax and is beautiful. There are a number of different areas on the resort, all of which offer something a little different. From Jacuzzis to pools to the beach and from cafes and restaurants to nice shadded areas in the trees away from everyone, you are surely able to relax. If you want to venture off the resort, there are a number of excursions to choose from and Higuey is not far and Santo Domingo, the capital, is about 4 hours away.Get to know the people. Take the time to talk to the staff and you will see, they are friendly, like talking to you and will treat you right. If you invest a little in meeting people and discovering new things, you will surely be rewarded.

<Content>Would never go there again I did not have an enjoyable stay....at all. Yes there were some good things, but overall it was not the relaxing, fun vacation I was hoping for.The beach is great. The hotel nice and renovated...mostly, except the part where we had our rooms. The pools were good, but one was quite dirty. There is a nice coffee bar, one grose Caribbean restaurant, a good pizzeria, Mexican restaurant, and Asian restaurant. Unfortunately you have book quite in advance to get in. The buffet is pretty horrible, breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you are a tea drinker like me make sure you bring your own because they do not have any regular tea, the coffee on the other hand is really good. The drinks are not good, plain sugar. We tried to adjust them a bit, but most of the time it was very difficult to get any limes. The service was awful, except for a few people. Sometimes it felt like they were doing you a huge favor by doing anything for you and you get the feeling they really would rather be somewhere else. I think this was mostly the reason I had a bad time. If you think the service in Mexico is bad well think again. It is actually pretty good compared to the carelessness of the Dominicans. I thought I was being picky, but we heard similar things from other people within our hotel and travelers from different hotels.We arrived at around 8pm. Checking in was somewhat easy, but no one pointed us in the right direction of the room. So we wondered around for a bit until it turned out there was a whole other section of the hotel. We finally got a ride to our room, it turns out our whole ceiling is leaking and there is a huge puddle in the middle of the room, the bed spread is somewhat dirty. So we get another room, this one even farther than the last from the beach, pool, food etc. Of course the room has 2 beds instead of one king size. Sorry no other rooms available! The bathroom looks a bit old and the shower head barely works. After we settle in it turns you need a key for the safe, why they can't tell you this when you check in, I don't know. Also the window doesn't lock. They inform us the window will be fixed. And on the second day it still isn't, but that's a whole other story. There is an ice bucket, but getting ice from the bartender is difficult, of course there isn't an ice machine around. I hurt my foot and needed a wheelchair for a day, to get it was very difficult. Money exchange...yes they will gladly take your dollars for Dominican pesos, but to change it back is a challenge. Better expect to spend it all while you're there. They also have a habit of playing very loud music by the pool and beach with a very bad sound system and a sometimes skipping CD. If you like to get out of the resort there isn't much to see. We rented a car and were willing to see anything worth seeing and people just do not want to inform you of anything. We also went on a tour of which we did not get the appropriate info from the person who sold it to us.

<Content>Very Mixed Review We decided we were desperately in need of some time in the sun so we booked a trip on Tuesday afternoon to leave on Wednesday morning. This was the ONLY place we could find. I made the reservation without looking at this site first and then panicked because the reviews were pretty mixed. I actually canceled with the agent before deciding to go ahead and risk it.My review is mixed, as well.The resort is very nice. The pools are pretty, the landscaping is nice, the buffets are nice (we didn't go to any of the restaurants because we have a 13 month old). The beach is great. The sand is soft and powdery and our daughter loved it. Something about the composition of the sand makes it cool all day long - no burning the bottoms of your feet.Our room was nice to look at but, as mentioned in most reviews, the a/c did not work. The fan blew, but no cold air came out. This made is really, really hard to sleep. We tried opening the window, but between the disco, the restaurant, and the drunk people yelling and vomiting, the noise made it difficult to sleep. It's too bad, because the evening temps and the breeze were really lovely.The food was okay. Breakfast was pretty dismal. Exactly the same every day - and nothing very good. If you wanted eggs (or omelet), they cooked them until they became something nowhere near approximating an egg. Thank goodness for yogurt (and they had some excellent chocolate croissants).People really didn鈥檛 seem to care about what you did or did not want. No one asked if you wanted a drink. When you finally flagged someone down and asked, you may or may not have gotten it a half hour later. English is not spoken, but that鈥檚 really not a big deal. My husband and I think this is because there were probably only about 10-15% of us there that spoke English. At least half the people there were French.The processing in and out at the airport is very efficient but in the airport there was nowhere to sit, lines for food were really, really long and there was only one board to look at to check your flight status. Of course, when you did check it, the information was wrong鈥?Poor (no) communication regarding flight status. I think the airport just isn鈥檛 keeping up with the amount of traffic.Bottom line:ROOMS; nice, but a/c did not work in ours or any of the people we talked to.FOOD; mediocre. BEACH; wonderful 鈥?but there鈥檚 only one bathroom for a long, long shoreline. POOLS; very nice. Also nice that there are three to choose from, depending on the noise/activity level you wantSERVICE; not great. PUNTA CANA AIRPORT; - madnessAlthough the weather was gorgeous, the beach was really nice, and the pools were lovely we will not return because we felt the service was not good, the food was mediocre and the airport was madness. We鈥檒l stick with Mexico and family-centered resorts.

<Content>Mixed review! We stayed at this resort from Feb. 17 until the 24. There was a group of 7 of us. We requested a building closest to the beach which they graciously accommodated for us! One major problem - our room had no air conditioning!!! They said they fixed it but it wasn't fixed (this was on our 4th day there). They moved us to the Villas which couldn't be farther from the rest of our group. The room was filthy - I guess I shouldn't complain, though, at least we weren't melting at night! We went from 2 double beds (very comfortable by the way) and nice pillows to 1 hard bed with pillows that seemed to be filled with popcorn! We rented the safe and kept our valuables (and a traveling companion's) in there. Someone actually found our safe key and stole $100! There was nothing the resort could do (of course they went through the motions and basically wasted my husband's time!). The beach - was awesome! Lots of lounge chairs and activities to do! Para-sailing was fun!! Food and drinks were close. We loved the pizza place. We loved the bars and the people working there were very pleasant. I liked the variety of entertainment on the main stage. We just wished there were other things to do at night (ie. karaokee). The food was so-so but there was a nice variety. We took the safari trip (all day) and had a blast! Be careful though, they will tell you that you get to make your own cigars (but you don't - they stop so you can buy some) and that you get to visit a school (which you don't - you drive by a couple, but you don't stop). All in all it was a lot of fun!

<Content>paradise found this hotel is underrated. The service was excellent, the staff friendly and accommodating. The largest beach area by far!!!! the rooms were clean, large and totally updated. My daughter and I (27  54) were treated like royalty. Definetly have the photografers (Riccot was amazing) do a portfolio for you. The food was good and they had everything you could possible ask for. We had no problems and no complaints whatsoever! We felt so save we slept on the beach one night.........the beach was cleaned every day, definetly the cleanest beach around. We are already planning our next trip and it will be to this same hotel.

<Content>Excellent customer service by friendly skilled people We have just returned from a week at the IFA Bavaro villas. The resort is terrific and we have never experienced such an efficient, friendly  excellent service before. It was so lovely that this get-back-in shape trip turned into a quality stay, full of learnings about the Dominican Republic. The climate was fantastic, the staff always welcomed us with a smile, and it was 100% possible to retreat away from the crowd if we wanted to. Excellent restaurants, high variery of food, rich  local decoration, respect of nature, cleanlyness of the whole resort, possibility to access to various activities (excursions, diving, spa, fitness, etc).We stayed in a villa close to a 4-baths open air jacuzzi, a lounge bar  enjoyed uncredible choice at breakfast served by smily  efficient people. International, local  diet food are all available there.The pools  clean white sandy beach are lovely. Our friends appreciated the kinder-garden for their children . 1 towels per person and per day.The Spa is very peaceful with hammam, sauna, fitness center  beauty/massage treatments upon request.Restaurants are all great (Buffet, Japanese, Caraibbean, Mexican, Beach grill). We paid 1000鈧?for an all inclusive week including intercontinental flight  airport transfer.. There were 2 double beds for the 2 of us. Decoration of rooms, lobbies  restaurants is simple, rich  made with beautiful local wood, ropes, stones  plants.Overall I would say this is one of top 10 hotels we have ever stayed in on holiday and I am extremely high maintenance!

<Content>You Get What You Pay FOR It took us 6 hours to check into our rooms, to find one of our (3) room was taken already. Front desk so unorganized, was pathetic. They did not speak English. If we are paying to stay at their resort they should speak our language. Some employees very rude. The food and alcohol was not good. The hot tubs were cold. Air condition didn't work, took 3 days to fix. No hair dryer - never did receive one. The resort is very pretty and the rooms were clean. The beach is beautiful. But an all-inclusive at IFA Bravaro isn't for the food and alcohol and customer service.

<Content>Has Potential But Not quite There Yet I have very mixed feelings about our stay at this resort. Some things were excellent - others not so. I think it's absolutely true - you get what you pay for so if you didn't pay for a 5 star resort you shouldn't expect a 5 star resort.We were originally booked to stay at the Allegro (now Sunscape) First Club resort. Due to overbooking - which seemed suspicious in of itself - we were moved to the IFA Villas Bavaro. Reviews on Tripadvisor seemed fairly similar before we left.We were a group of 5 staying in 2 rooms. On arrival, check-in was a bit disorganized - no lineups just a bunch of people crowded around a desk. So it can be a bit frustrating if a large group is ahead of you. I told the reservations that our reservation was 2 rooms. We were not given adjacent rooms - in fact they were not even close to each other. My initial room was 1224 - so far away that they have a golf cart tram to take you there. I would say walking it was 500m away from the main reception and another 300m or more to the beach. (They do have another shuttle to the beach although it's a nice walk there).On checking in to the room - no towels, no toilet paper. A phone call was made - it came 2 hours later. Luckily I had brought my own.The rooms I would say are 3* in quality. They have a nice 27 plasma TV with lots of channels (satellite) - including multilingual. Unfortunately some of the hotel channels kept showing graphic porn so if you are channel surfing it can be a bit annoying. There is no wi-fi in the rooms - they said there was DSL cable on the TV for Internet but when you call the front desk they say no. The only Internet is this small hut where you have to book time in advance ($1US for 30minutes) - 2 computers. I booked time everyday. But slots were always full. I usually booked the day before.There are no toiletries. No kleenex or tissue. There is a dispenser on the wall with 3 slots but only one of the slots is filled with a white liquid. Shampoo? Soap? The other room (my sister's) the dispenser was broken.The beds were fine - and I thought the shower was very nice. No bathtub.Housekeeping was variable. Sometimes they came in the morning, sometimes not until the evening. Towels are taken out separately in the morning and new ones are provided in the afternoon or early evening. So there are no towels in the room mid-day.On the second day we insisted on being moved to a closer room and were moved to room 1089 - much closer and this improved our enjoyment more.Air conditioning was hard to control but we were glad to have it - it could either be too cold if left on (even though there was a thermostat) or too hot if left on. Ceiling fan as well but rather noisy. No clockradio in the room so bring your own.Small fridge which is replenished with 2 medium sized bottles of bottled water daily.Ice bucket but never saw an ice machine while we were there. Small clothesline outside is a nice touch for your wet stuff - 2 patio chairs and a small table as well. Many people left stuff overnight. But my sister had a towel stolen and I actually had a towel taken (which was later returned) as well so leave out at your own risk.We tipped our housekeeper every day and at the end and it was much appreciated. The beach is very very nice and we walked to it. Lots of lounge chairs never a problem but we are morning people. Around the pool (3 gorgeous pools), the towel reservation system is working. Never bothered by people selling stuff I don't think they are allowed. Spa people gently approach you at times on walkways but not an issue at all. At the beach - lots of topless sunbathing.This resort is almost exclusively European. English is hardly spoken here and I would say it was primarily people from France, Italy, Germany, and Spain who were there our week. Some staff speak basic English but I would not try anything conversational. Some reception staff do not speak English.Drinks were super sweet and not premium alcohol. Pina colada comes out of a machine and was highly variable depending on where I got it. Sometimes it was like an ice drink, other times it was a warm drink, I thought the coffee bar/cafe served the best drinks and coffee. The food to me was the worst part of this resort and I like everything. Breakfast was fine. Entertaining omelette guy. It's hard to mess up breakfast. At the main restaurant they have a pasta bar and a grill area. We enjoyed that. But the food was just adequate. I would say at the level of a high school cafeteria. Or so. The most disappointing restaurant experiences were the a la carte restaurants. You must make reservations in advance. The Oriental restaurant is a beautiful room but portions were small and we could have eaten more afterwards. Some of the meat was tough. The Mexican restaurant is buffet style and reasonable in quality but a confusing layout creates two way buffet traffic and the grill seemed overwhelmed. The Caribe restaurant served beautiful looking food that tasted fine but our food was cold when it arrived. Another group went to the buffet after Caribe and said their meat was tough.I got a bit of travellers diarrhea towards the end of the week and my mother a mild case when she returned home.The gym is quite good - I was surprised. Weight machines - 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, 2 bikes, free weights, mats. Air conditioned. I didn't go into the spa but the entrance is the same as the gym and was very nice.I did water aerobics and stretching on the beach with the animation crew. The first couple days the stretching on the beach was excellent. The second day he handed over his duties to this girl who basically made things up as she went along (stretching each finger?) and quit after 20 minutes.Evening entertainment was hit and miss. My parents enjoyed the musical shows (which start at 10pm). There is one night where they do a Miss IFA Villas Bavaro contest with people from the audience that some might consider offensive - it includes having the women simulate lap dancing on a man from the crowd who is tied up. And although I had left by then, later on there was a racially insensitive skit involving asking one of the contestants to act like a Chinese person and given some props - being of Asian descent I am glad I was not there but my brother-in-law did speak to the manager the next day (nothing happened). I believe another review on tripadvisor alluded to this skit.Local calls are not free - we made four rather quick local calls and ended up paying $13US. We were told the rate before we made the calls but they have a very suspicious exchange rate and really you don't have much say unless you take out pesos which I would not recommend.Checkout was straightforward for us. Our pre-arranged airport transfer was no problem at all. However, a nice couple I met actually missed their flight because checkout took so long at the hotel. I didn't get the exact details - we had a brief conversation at the airport - but he was furious - and it seems like a large group was either checking out in front of them.The grounds of this resort are beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. In layout, In maintenance and in cleanliness. Just wonderful. This resort has the potential to make itself into a 4* or 5* resort if it upgrades the food and the rooms. I thought all the staff were wonderful, hard working and polite. (We tipped everywhere though - every meal, every drink , housekeeping - and we certainly didn't see much tipping going on)I would stay at this resort again if I knew that the rooms were upgraded and if I knew that the food had improved. If I were to return I wouldn't bother with the a la carte restaurants. (Note that they do have nicer rooms but we were told we would have to pay extra and that Sunscape/Allegro did not pay for us to be in those rooms.)

<Content>Do Not Order the Bloody Mary's We stayed at Bavaro Villas from February 10-17th 2008. This place is not worth it, and it was the cheapest resort we found. The food is terrible, no selection whatsoever at any of the buffets. And if you want to eat at one of the three real restaurants, you have to make a reservation three days in advance. No one told us that, of course, and we had to find that out ourselves on the third day of our 7 day trip. The Mexican restaurant had basically the same tasting food as the buffets, but the Carribean restaurant was very good. The bartenders pretty much all have the same bad attitudes, and those are the good ones. They pretty much all rolled their eyes every time we ordered a drink as if we were causing them some sort of hassle. I would say we tried to order Bloody Mary's 30 times, and maybe 10 percent of the bartenders would make them for us. Mind you, Bloody Mary's are on their menu, they just don't feel like opening two cans of tomato juice and putting in the hot sauce and the pepper etc. My girlfriend didn't feel safe ordering drinks by herself because this one bartender would hit on her and hold her hand like a creep. I read another review on this site and it was so close to what happened to us it was scary. One night it rained outside. And in our room. It started in the shower, then it started dripping on the beds, then in five or six spots on both beds, then it started to pool up on the floor. These floors are an ice-skating rink when they get wet. This all started at 7:30 one night. We went to the front desk once and they just wrote down our number on a Post-it note. An hour later, we went down again, another Post-it note. At about 9, we called and they said someone we be right up. At 10 we went down again, the guy said he would be right with us, and he didn't come back for the half hour we waited. At 11:30 a guy who spoke no English came to move us to another room. It would've taken us an hour to pack up all our stuff, so I just told him we wanted someone to mop the floor. At midnight a maid came to mop it up finally (I had to jump up and down in the puddle to convey what the problem was) but we still had soaking wet sheets to sleep on. And of course our Apple Vacations representative worked all of 45 minutes a day, Monday-Thursday. That did us no good considering this happened on Thursday night.

<Content>Clean, Good Entertainment, Front Desk Needs Serious Overhaul A member of our group said it best, The front desk is your first and last impression of a stay at a resort. Well put, and the one place on which the management of this resort needs to focus. Understaffed for certain and the attitude of the front desk personnel was indifferent and very slow, even on individual transactions. Since this resort serves travelers from many cultures and languages, the desk should staffed with multilingual personnel or have quick access to that resource to overcome language barriers, but was not the case. Our English was scarcely understood, or so it appeared, and they seemed care little about it. Check out was brutally frustrating, especially for those poor individuals who waited in a single line 20 vacationers departing for flights back home.Also, they should remove every last cock-a-doodledoing rooster from the premises. They are up well before the sun every day, which pretty much defeats the purpose of showing up for a little rest and relaxation.

<Content>Okay resort but horrible drinks We stayed at the IFA resort from Feb 9 thru 16th. First of all we were not supposed to stay there. We had booked through the Occidental First club and were supposed to stay at the Sunscape, formerly the Allegro. When arriving at the airport we were met by our Occidental rep telling us that we couldn't stay at the Sunscape, they had overbooked their rooms by 150 people and they no longer had a first club. They recently bought the Allegro. We were extremely disappointed and will be working with my vacation club manager. We paid money for our first club membeship and did not receive any of the amenities we paid for. We also brought 8 people with us on vacation to experience our club. Not the best move for Occidental. They should of moved us to the Grand Flamenco and put us in the Royal Club. the First Club through Allegro/Occidental vacation clubs are usually incredible and make your stay a 5 star stay. We were not at all happy about this change but were told unless we wanted to go back to the US, we had no choice. They also told us this resort was a 4 star resort. What makes it a 4 star must be the beach, because this was the best part of our stay. The beach is incredible, no complaints there.When we arrived our rooms were ready but they put us in the oldest part of the hotel, about a 10 minute walk just to the main lobby, about a 17 min walk to the beach. The first room was okay, it was clean but not a 4 star room. There are also roosters that wake you up starting at 5:00 am outside your room and do not stop. They need to get rid of the morning wake up calls. We ended up upgrading our room for an additional $15.00 per person per night. The other room was much closer to the main pool, beach, etc and was nicer. They do not provide wash cloths at this resort, only hand towels, very odd. You are only provided one key for your room. When you arrive to your room, your key opens the door and you have to put it into a slot in your room to turn on your lights and air conditioning unit. When you leave, you pull your key out thus shutting off the lights and air... odd. Nothing special about these rooms, they are clean, mostly white, but no pictures on the wall, we didn't have a cushion in our chair, a small fridge but with only water. We did encounter a large cockroach one evening, about 2 inches long, this was on a trip to the bathroom, they seem to come out in the dark, yikes!! We tipped the maid every day and I left her gifts every day. We did get a room full of flowers and towels made into hearts on Valentines day which was very nice. The food was good, plenty of choices at the buffet and the specialty restaurants were all very good. The drinks were horrible!! Again we are used to 5 star accommodations and top shelf alcohol but have stayed other places and have had good drinks. The mixers were sickly sweet. We stuck to beer. The wine wasn't great either. The front desk staff was not very accommodating but you need to be patient and nice. Yelling is not going to get you anyplace. The entertainment staff was great and they work so hard. Most of the shows in the evening were very good. We are used to different accommodations so I probably would not go back there again. There is a restaurant a short walk from the beach called the Jellyfish. You should make reservations. It was delicious. A lot of people in our party did get sick, so I'm not sure if this was due to the restaurant or the food at the resort. Once of our guests took Cipro which seemed to straighten out everything, so you might want to take that with you when you go.

<Content>We couldnt ask for a better girls vacation. FUN! My girlfriend and I stayed at IFA the last week of January鈥he resort is beautiful, there is some construction going on but the majority of it is complete, it definitely didn鈥檛 disrupt our stay. Animation: the team is great, from their various beach activites to the nightly entertainment- they never missed a beat! They joined anyone who was willing to go to the disco after the show (which is also a lot of fun by the way). They also suggested Club Mangoo, which was exceptional (we partied there a few nights)Food: was great, always something good to eat. The a la carte restaurants are excellent, especially the JapaneseBeach: spectacular! The water is crystal clear and the white sandy beaches are very comparable to the ones in VaraderoRooms: we didn鈥檛 stay in the villas (a little too far away from all the action). We stayed by the pool and it was prefect鈥lways clean and the staff is friendlySay hello to Henri and all the animation staff, they鈥檙e tons of fun! Excellent vacation, will be back again next year. Any questions, feel free to contact me.

<Content>Clean Resort, Poor Food IFA is a VERY clean  beautiful resort. The only reason why I would not reccommend this resort, is because of the poor food selections. The resort offers 2 huge buffets, 3 a la carte restaurants, a beach grill  pizza/burger hut. Lots of places to eat, but the exact same food, every day. Punta Cana is great, but I would not return to this particular resort, if you like a variety of food. On a good note, the beach was amazing! I highly reccommend the Outback Safari excursion. Eddie is the best tour guide!

<Content>Great time at the Villas My wife and I spent a wonderful week at this resort. The staff could not have been friendlier, and everyone was very eger to please. Guest services was very good, and everyone I spoke to spoke fluent English. The only minus were the beds, not very lush, much too firm. Our room was great, very close to the pool,  the Jacuzzi. Short walk to the dinning hall and restaurants. We took the hotel shuttle to the beach. Guest services took care of all my golfing reservations and transportation to and from three different courses. My wife enjoyed the spa very much and wished she could have spent more time there. The food was very good, we really enjoyed the Caribe restaurant. I would recommend this resort to anyone. Great bang for the buck. Not a five star, but a solid three and a half.

<Content>Review worth reading I am a Canadian who stayed at the resort from Jan. 19-26, 2008. I have never been to an all inclusive before but I have done alot of travelling in both North America and Europe. I read the mixed reviews on this site before I left and wasn't really sure what to expect. All I can say is WOW- alot of these reviews were way off. I had an EXCEPTIONAL time at the resort. I'd like to begin by saying that the construction in the Main Pool (which now includes a swim up bar) and the lobby are complete. There is still abit of construction on site but it does not affect tourists. The food was good, the staff were pleasant, the animation team was phenominal and the beach was GORGEOUS. Yes, there was a language barrier at times but you need to be patient with yourself and the staff as they are doing their best to accomodate you. In Canada, we wouldn't expect staff in our hotels to learn multiple languages to accomodate tourists, so people need to have the same courtesy when they are visiting other countries- you are on their territory therefore it is up to us to make the effort. I would recommend doing the free activities that the hotel has to offer- snorkelling, Kayaking, etc. but I'd also recommend spending the money on other activities such as Quading with extreme adventures to dominican villages, sugarcane fields, caves and other beaches. It is worth the money. I did travel with people who had been to all inclusives before and they said that this hotel was one of their top hotels that they have stayed at. I would definately stay at this hotel again. I hope this review is helpful to those who are interested in this hotel.

<Author>FatherDaughter
<Content>Challenging Trip!! Let me just start by saying that I have been to Punta Cana every year (sometimes twice a year) for the past 9 years so I have stayed at many hotels and generally know what to expect. With that being said, Ifa Bavaro was very different from other places. We sometimes felt that we landed in a twilight zone or a very bad tourist movie. Let's begin with the fact the upon checking in we realized that no one at the reception desk spoke much English, nor did we feel welcomed. We were told that our room would be ready in an hour so we walked around and ate lunch. An hour later we were told in 5 min and then 5 min again (they like the phrase 5min, and it may be the only one they know). Finally we went to inspect ourselves and saw that the room that was supposed to be ready in 5min was still occupied and was no where near ready for us. Some time later, they finally found us a room. No apologies for their mistake, even rude actually.So when finally get to the room and there is an issue with the toilet overflowing and it take 3 phonecalls and 2 hours for them to finally arrive to fix it. And this was only after we had to tell them that there was poop all over the floor...to get them to do things for you here, you have to use extreme measures. The room overall is nice, beds were a good size and were firm. However, the pillows were very strange and lumpy. There is a flat screen TV in the room which we thought was promising, until we realized the only channel that we had in English was CNN (we are now thoroughly versed in every presidential canditate's political campaign after watching only CNN for 7 days). The maid service was alright, except they would sneak in the room and take dirty towels before giving you clean ones, so for a few hours we had no towels at all! The food was OK, nothing fancy, but acceptable. I would highly recommend the Japanese restaurant, it was very good. Except they tell you about how booked they are but when you get to the place its half empty, not sure why that is. There is also a little pizza bar by the pool called Pikalo which was very good. Drinks were average as was the nightly enteratainment. The gym however is very advanced. Opens at 7am and closes in the evening. Equipment is new and up-to-date and there is air conditioning inside. I had a massage at the spa and although it was relaxing, it was not by any stretch of the imagination a deep tissue massage like it was supposed to be. Very few of the staff spoke any english at all and most of them just looked at you like you were crazy when you tried to ask them for something, which made it very difficult to communicate. The front desk people are especially difficult and they are the ones that you usually need to speak with the most. Very rude, did not care about customer service, possibly because 90% of the guests were French so English speaking guests did not seem to be their priority. The beach was absolutely amazing and luckily we had a room not too far away, 7-8min walk. The beach was the best part of the hotel by far. Overall, big travel agencies such as Apple Vacations and similar agencies should not sell this resort to Americans or English speaking Canadians, people will only come back disappointed. We have been to many other hotels and this one was simply below standards.We made the best of the situation and tried to just laugh everything off (it was ridiculously funny sometimes) but overall I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great time and highly recommended Vacation from Dec 27 '07 to Jan 3rd '08Had a great time, and would definately go back. Food is great and lots of buffets, restaurants, and snack bars. Beach hassle free and very very nice (white sands the whole deal). Staff were very friendly and extremely talented (especially for the nightly shows). I only speak english and did not have problems communicating with a little bit of patients. Did notice other guests being very rude to staff because they did not speak fluent english. Very disappointing to see the ignorance of some guests, since they are visitors to a Spanish speaking country.Recommend that you:1) Bring US currency from home (trust me)2) Visit with your travel rep when you arrive so see all there is to offer.3) Participate in resort activities, don't be shy, it's a blast.4) Have fun with the staff, they are very entertaining and friendly. Great resort, highly recommended, would definately go back.Guest from Vancouver, Canada

<Content>Watch It This was a 1 week vacation we had traveled with another couple that was staying for 2 weeks. The room that was given to us was unacceptable and faced the back of the resort which was at the time a dump and smelled like raw sewerage. Anything that dropped on the roof or birds on the roof we heard it all but once I had spoken to the manager he gave us a choice between 3 rooms and gave us the option on which one we wanted, we took a ground floor room 鈥渕uch better鈥? The food was good didn鈥檛 have a problem with it or the drinks although at the lobby bar if you wanted a drink a tip to the bartender was a must otherwise you鈥檇 be waiting a long time. As in most of the Caribbean Islands most of the hotels have ceramic floors be very careful as when it鈥檚 wet it is very slippery. My girlfriend had slipped and cracked her knee cap when this was brought to managements attention they tried to say that it was due to the rain however it had not rained it was due to the maintenance men watering the grass and not wiping the floors down we had to get her to the hospital after much arguing the resort offered to pay for her taxi.They had offered her and her husband a free weeks vacation (guess what when they decided to take them up on the offer no-one responded to there e-mail even going through the head office no responded). I understand now that the Resort is under new management but just because of this experience I would think twice before going back it was a cheap vacation so I guess I got what I paid for.

<Content>Do not go here!!!!! Went on this 8 day trip with my 20-y/o daughter. I certainly will not go again. Some things we experienced:*Front desk very slow..........long lines to check in. Desk clerks spoke almost NO English, and very difficult to get their attention. Finally got to our room, to find it was not in the area/room I paid for. Returned to desk..........again, in line for about an hour........to be finally told that they were overbooked, and there was nothing they could do. We returned to our room, and I called Travelocity (a $45 call).....the Travelocity rep tried to be helpful, even 3-waying us into a call with the desk manager. We went back to the desk, and as we approached, David the manager we had spoken with, ran out the back door. When we asked to speak with him, we were told that he was not there. Checked with them several times during the week about a room change, which never happened.*The room.............nasty. Smelled mildewed, not very clean. Bedspreads were dirty. Slate shower cracked, moldy-smelling, and had a huge leak out to the rest of the bathroom. Toilet had virtually no flushing pressure; our toilet clogged every day. We returned from a day at the beach once to find the toilet bowl full of poop (not ours!!). It, of course, didn't flush, and we waited for 3 hours (including several calls and a trip to the desk) for this to be remedied. There was a hole above the sink which leaked dirty water onto the sink area; a steady stream when it rained (showers at night). The closet was moldy, and leaked heavily during rains...enough to pour out into the room. The floor of the room was constantly wet. Difficult to get clean towels.*The food...........tiresome. There are two buffets, only one is open for all 3 meals.....and it is the SAME FOOD EVERY DAY!!!!!!!!!!! Neither my daughter or I eat seafood or red meat, so we were outta luck with lunches and dinners. Did eat a lot of fresh fruit, which we liked. There are 3 other choices for dinner: a Mexican buffet (lots of mystery meat), a Japanese restaurant, which was delicious, and a Caribbean-style, which was delicious. Other than that, there are 2 other options: a pizza place (ick...the flies), and an outdoor grill on the beach..........serving the same thing every day..........hamburgers and fries, occasionally lettuce and tomatoes. All eateries except the Caribbean one are outdoors, or at least unenclosed from the outside. Thus, birds and bugs visited the buffets.......... buffets are pretty much a free-for-all, with adults and children alike pawing through the food (literally...bare hands!), eating off the serving trays, breathing and coughing all over the food, serving utensils, etc. People's manners were quite appalling. We resorted to safe foods.....individual yogurts, bananas, oranges. The natives..........for the most part, very welcoming.....we found that tipping regularly was VERY appreciated, and provided excellent customer service. These people are so poor....they appreciate the tips, especially with US dollars! The animation staff was fun........amazingly these young people spoke 6 or 7 different languages!! They are very willing to involve visitors in dance lessons, exercise classes, or just conversation.The tourists............very, very few Americans. Mostly European tourists, and we met some folks from Russia, Canada. One thing that really grossed us out was the fact that nearly ALL the tourists smoked. It seemed we we constantly breathing in second-hand smoke. They seemed to have no etiquette or consideration with their smoking...........they'd blow smoke right at you, on the beach, or while eating. RUDE RUDE RUDE. Lots of cigarette butts in the beach sand (yuck). If you are a nonsmoker, this will definitely disgust you.The beach.............the water was gorgeous!! Clean, clear, and deliciously warm. You can see right down to the bottom, even in very deep water. There is no surf here because of the reef.Very enjoyable playing and swimming. The sand on the beach is so soft and fine...almost like confectioner's sugar. The workers work hard to keep the sand clean, but they just can't keep up with all the piggy people who feel they can use it as a dump. The beach is littered with lazy tourist's crap.........discarded plastic cups, styrofoam plates, empty cigarette packs, condom wrappers (!), and lots and lots of cigarette butts. One morning I laid my towel down on the chaise, only to find it smeared with fresh [-].I could go on, but I think you get the point.............If you are going to take the time and spend the money to go to Punta Cana, PLEASE cough up the extra $200-300 bucks and go to a decent hotel!!!!Lisa  Raechel

<Content>Very Pleased This is was my third time visiting this resort within the last year, and in honesty I can not say one thing wrong about this resort in any areas, and especially this past December when parts of the resort were under renovation. The staff alone is very friendly, also the management team is always available at all times of the day and night to make sure that the resort is running very smooth, as for the entertainment I can not complain about them because they take pride and joy in entertaining the guest at night at the outdoor theater with the shows that are performed. As for the food in all areas whether one decides to go the buffet or to the restaurants all is great. Finally the rooms themselves are well taken care of, by the cleaning staff. Keep up the good work.

<Content>No Habla Ingles! From 12/16-12/19 we stayed at IFA Villas Resort and Spa - the construction on the lobby meant we had to check in at the bar. Then, the ATM didn't work so we were without a penny.... dollars or Dominican Pesos and no one spoke enough english to tell us how to get to a bank... The people at the resort spoke almost NO English (they didn't even try) and when we attempted our Spanish they pretended not to understand. This is a far cry from a resort. Food was ok -- they put extra SALT in EVERYTHING... Beach was beautiful -- but hawkers harass you from the moment you sit down... Loved the country, would never stay at this hotel again...

<Content>Honeymoon My wife and I went to IFA Villas for our honeymoon and it was awesome. There were some children there with their parents, but it was still awesome. we were there for 7 nights and it was the perfect length of time. BRING SUNBLOCK. We brought 3 bottles and still ran out on our last day. I was pretty well burned on the way home. It was all inclusive but i suggest bringing like 10 dollars in singles a day to tip. The staff there is very eager to please and they only make about $1600 a year in American money!! so tip well and you will be rewarded with a wonderful vacation. If you have never traveled to the DR be aware that when you get off of the airplane you will be swarmed by taxi drivers. I would highly recommend that you arrange your ride to the hotel ahead of time. The trip to the hotel was a little scary as there driving is a little different from us in the states. Do not buy cigars or alcohol from the beach vendors. the cigars are dry and usually fake. I bought my wife a necklace they asked $80 American for it. I ended up paying $15. It was fun to bargain with the people. Leave the house keepers tips and gifts. We brought a bunch of snacks for the airplane so we would leave cookies and chips with a couple of dollars for the cleaning people. on our 2nd to last night they covered our bed in flower pedals and made our bed up beautifully. I made a friend with one bartender. I tipped him well. about $80 total for the week and he hooked us up. I will not say any more, because I do not want him to get into trouble. DO NOT STAY NEAR THE BEACH STAY IN THE VILLAS. if you are unhappy with your room tell them that you requested to be in the villas and they will relocate you if they can. If you don鈥檛 speak Spanish be prepared to use body language. some bartenders and hosts speak a little English but it is a challenge to get your point across. also be prepared to wait a little longer than you would in the states. you didn鈥檛 go on vacation to New York, take it easy your in the DR. Hope you enjoy your stay.

<Content>Loved it Almost Perfect in every way !! Well what can I can and where do I start:Myself and 2 friends booked this holiday kinda last min and did do some research (read a few mixed reviews etc on here) and so were somewhat apprehensive...........we needn't have been though.Villas:After our 20 min transfer from the airport we were checked in very speedy and taken to our villa via a golf buggy thing as it was dark when we arrived we didn't get to see the gardens until morning but the outside of the villas  inside were fine for us three girls. We did have two double beds which wasn't what we expected but not a problem we took it in turns to have a bed by ourselves. It was all clean and all lights aircon shower etc were working the only thing we did notice was there was only one socket so we had to take it in turns to use phone chargers/ipod chargers etc again not really an issue.The Grounds:The gardens/ pool areas /food areas and beach we all very clean and kept to a high standard. Everyday there were people cleaning/sweeping etc and they all did it with a smile on thier faces and a hola to the guests. There was some construction work being done while we were there but that was at the other end of the complex towards the beach and nowhere near the villas so no noise disturbance at all. The 2 pools that were in action were lovely and the one that wasn't in sue due to building work looked great too one it is finished.Food:Myself and my friends are all vegetarian and we never had any problem with finding something to eat ...we found the local dishes were the nicest and the omlettes for brekkie really set you up for the day..... try to order things in spanish the chefs /waiters really appreciate it and you get a speedier response / service. We ate at all three of the pre-bookable restaruants and all were excellent The Carbie (Carribean) was the nicest for us and then Bambo (Japanese) and then Mexican. You book these at customer services in reception area oposite the check in desk.Beach:Oh my god it was beautiful we will never forget the moment that we walked through the beach grill onto the pure white sand through the many palm trees to the clear blue waters what a sight !! The beach was very clean and you could walk for miles along it . We didn't get a lot of hassle which compared to some places i've been to was suprising.....just a friendly Hola and no thank you is all that is needed.Other:All the staff are very welcoming and friendly yes this place is manily for europeans and the language is mainly spainish which we didn't find a problem... the dominicans are so relaxed if they say 10 mins you can be sure it would be an hour but that's all the fun.I would reconmend this place for and RR holiday which is just what I needed and a week was not long enough in fact we are going to book the same time next year !!Saona Island is paradise and would reconmend to anyone book with godfrey who is based on the beach 拢35 each for all transport there catamaran to island  speadboat back with food and drinks bargain !! although get insect repelant with at least 50% DEET in it as the mozzies are big there !!One last note is that you have def got to go to the spa it's gorgeous the full massage was fab and a quarter of the price in the UK.Any questions just email me.Many thanks to Edward our cocktail waiter, Fontus our spa man, Rolando our photographer  the girls on the catamaran all made our holiday even better !!Please remember that the staff do not get paid a lot and tips are welcome but not asked for....... we noticed how rude some of the guests are to them which was very uncalled for they all do thier upmost to make you welcome, they are very eager to learn english and we all spent many hours teaching the staff new words and vice a versa .... try to learn some spainish as it goes a long way......me and my friend are even going to take evening classes !!

<Content>Did not want to come home We just got back from the best vacation ever. I highly recomend this resort. The rooms where very clean, great house keeping service. Make sure you stay in the Villas, which is the new section on the property. The food was awesome, we ate a la carte two nights, and the buffet anytime of the day was great also. All you can drink, from the moment you wake up to the moment you put your head to rest. The Animation crew are awseome, they have you laughing and participating in every activity they have. Make sure you look out for Happy Boy that's his name. He is a trip and 1/2. If you like to party, then don't miss the night club, great music, open from 11:30 to 3:00 a.m. To sum it all up, best vacation, great place to stay. I'll be back next year.

<Content>Will go back tomorrow This is my second trip to Punta Cana and to IFA Villas, my stay Jul 21st to Jul28th 07 was as pleasant as usual very relaxing with some off the resort activities to take care of the boredom some folks have alluded to. My family had a great time although we missed the larger of the three pools that is undergoing renovation.Sure there is construction going on but you get used to it and it does not bother anyone, the hotel provided music to damper any noise that might annoy the guests, the most you will hear is a few hammers doing their thing, you got to be a winger to complain about this?Some of us should book trips to Florida because the last time I looked Punta Cana is in the Dominican Republic and their native language is Spanish and we are visiting a sorveign country. During my stay I encountered many members of staff that spoke English and even embrassed my wife who was trying to tell the waiter her order in butchered Spanish when he delightfully told her he spoke English.During my stay I noticed that tipping went a long way, the second day I tipped the cleaning lady $10.00 my room was always in tip top condition extra towels and the fridge always stocked with extra sodas and water even bottles of beer left on top of the fridge.These folks work 12 days straight 12 to 16 hour days and get 3 days off,most of them live in Santo Domingo which is 4 hours away by bus. On the topic of Santo Domingo I took the one day tour into this beautiful city organised by Pierto Tours we drove through two major towns of Higuey and La Romana saw how the locals live then to the cave of the 3 eyes ,a cave that have 3 fresh water lakes at the bottom of coral entrenched walls. Then on to the residence of Christoper Columbus, walk the halls of this great man and see his bedroom. a tour of the first Cathedral of the Americas. What a sight this was! Lunch provided at a posh resaurant by the harbor.Please be aware that when shopping in down town Santo Domingo have your bargaining hat on do not buy at the first price it gets cheaper when you are leaving to go home on the bus.Do the party boat run by Kontiki Tours they take you out off the shore of Punta Cana and you have a great time dancing to the sounds of Regge and meregue then off to snorkeling.Captain your own two man speed boat down the entire coastline of Punta Cana taking in all the resorts along the way and then off to snorkeling this is run by Aquatic Tours/ Bavaro Splash.The food at the Resort was plentiful and delicious also the food at the Japanese and the Mexican was excellent but you must make reservations at guest services and what's the problem with wearing a pair of slacks or jeans?The nighty entertainment and disco was great and it was something to look forward to at night I spoke to one of my friends who was staying at a more fancy resort and he said he did not have nightly entertainment and his resort was too crowded.Pack your bags and visit this resort.

<Content>Don't Stay at this resort! From Washington, DC area visited the IFA Villas Bavaro Beach ResortDate: July 3-11, 2007We just returned from the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana. I would not recommend staying at the IFA Villas Bavaro Beach Resort, my reasons are as follows: a lot of the resort is under construction, which they fail to tell you, there is one entire pool not in service, they rennovating 3 or 4 buildings so you when you walk past you see the construction, not what you really want to see on your vacation. Two of the restruants that you have to sign up to eat at you MUST wear pants (if you didn't bring pants don't expect to get in.....oh but you can wear jeans......that doesn't make sense!), but a nice pair of shorts you can't wear........We saw guards walking around the beach with guns and outside the resort. Our room faced the beach which was a very nice view it's still a hike to the beach. Problems we ran into with our room: the air condition leaked all over the floor which they had to fix; the key to the safe got jammed, which they had to fix; the TV went out for 3 full days; found a big bug in the bathroom, bathtub paint peeling. The restruant that we could eat at the food was pretty good, the pizza bar was good .....we pretty much lived off of pizza and chicken nuggets. We couldn't wait to get home to eat American Food. We did try to leave early; however what we found out was that US Airways wanted to charge us over $1,000.00 to change our flights so we ended up staying the entire time. There are a lot of other nicer resorts to stay at..... pay the extra couple of hundred of dollars it's well worth it in the long run. Oh yea! You need to do the excursions as you will be board at the hotel they only really have a disco at night time, and bring your own booze the drinks are terrible.

<Content>Disappointed The hotel's staff and entertainment was wonderful. However, the stay was somewhat of a nightmare. To start, the third day there (after a long day at the pool) someone entered our room and left feces in the shower in particular the shower curtain. Not to mention, left a defecated towel left on the floor. When we reported the incident, the staff tried to accommodate us by transferring us to the Villas which was further away from most of the activities and smaller in size. We then asked for another room transfer which the room was less desirable. For instance, the tub was slightly rusted, some of bathroom tiles were loose, and the toilet moved along with us. In addition, the floor was slippery (and rather dangerous) because of the built up condensation.As far as the restaurants, the food was okay but make sure you take a lot of antidiarrhea medication such as Imodium. To top it all, the advertising pictures of the hotel are antiquated and were probably taken ten years ago. Overall, I would never recommendation this hotel!

<Content>Hotel Ifa was great, some reviewers are just such whingers! I wish to write an optomistic review of Hotel IFA villas to give hope to people who have booked to go there and may be apprehensive having read some of these reviews. I have just returned with my boyfriend and had a fantastic time, I really cannot fault the experience, just a few minor issues that did not affect my holiday at all.Accommodation - Better than expected, very spacious, excellent air-con, well-cleaned and maintained daily by maids. Sheets and towels changed, water replenished. Perfectly fine.Transfers/Rep - Transfers comfortable and punctual, no problems. Rep from Hola tours excellent, provided all info needed, gave us his mobile no, booked trip on our behalf.Staff - Excellent. Don't expect a lot of english speakers but these people are sooooo hard working and very efficient and attentive as well as friendly. We recieved fast service and in restaurants water for example was constantly being topped up.Food - Main buffet restaurant had excellent choice and variety including stuff cooked in front of you, other buffet closed, I think not yet busy enough to use. Pizzeria gorgeous as was beach grill. The a la carte restaurants were fantastic. Very posh and served food you'd pay a fortune for over here. The oriental was my favourite.Pool - Main pool under construction. Didn't bother us as there were two others plus the beach. The main pool looks as though it'll be fantastic when finished. There was building work around the pool but with the music it wasn't noticable, plus the builders finished relatively early. Animation crew not my thing but were not persistant in trying to get you to participate which was good.Beach - Gorgeous. The best part. Lovely sand and clear to blue sea. A surprising array of fish are in the shallow areas if you go snorkelling. Overall: We had a great week and I can't imagine we could have got much better from any other resort. Our excursion to Saona Island was brilliant, well worth doing, the place is pure paradise. I could easily have stayed here for 2 weeks relaxing holiday although a few excursions would have been in order to add variety. Would definitely recommend and think it would be worth returning in a year or so when the work has been completed.

<Content>We Got Broken In To..... We have just got back from IFAVillas bavero. We had a room overlooking the main pool. There was building work opposite us and they would turn up the music so loud to drown out the constant banging. The other pool was better near to the spa nice and quiet. We got burgled on our 3rd day from going home, the front door had been broken open, they stole 2 mobile phones and a digital camera. Luckily we had the safe with everything else in, but could not fit it all in. The hotel guest relations luckily took us to the police station thank god as they never spoke a word of English. After that we had to carry everything around with us, which is not ideal. The hotel is definitely not a 4 star more like 3. The position of the hotel is excellent it just needs a complete re-furb! The room is very basic and lots of things are loose or hanging off! When we first arrived the patio doors did not lock but they sorted that out straight away, also there was mould growing in the bathroom . The people are really friendly. If your looking for a cheap hotel than this is adequate just make sure you do not take any expensive items with you. If we had not been broken into we would have had a really good holiday. Just wanted to warn people before hand.

<Content>Good Value for R  I just came back June 19th from staying at this resort. I can't say I have any complaints but I also can't write a rave review. I would have to agree with the previous review entitled Just Ok. All reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt. I am well traveled and have had many different experiences in Latin America. I also read many of the reviews on this site about this resort, which are accurate.Check-in: No problem. My friend and I met up two other female friends and at check in we requested that we be placed near each other. This request was taken care of without any problemStaff: The staff is very accomodating though sometimes reluctant. I found that I got everything that I asked for--extra towels, help with lost luggage, iron, new hair dryer, shuttle ride, birthday cake and song for friend--I just had to ask! Nothing was offered. Other reviewers are correct, the staff's confidence in their english abilities is not great. Most people in the DR were VERY grateful that I spoke Spanish and I think that really helped us enjoy our time there. FoodI found the food enjoyable. I always found something I liked at the Buffets. I actually preferred the Buffets than the specialty restaurants because I could eat my fill. I'm a big eater and I like variety. I am also a picky eater that tries to keep kosher and is lactose intolerant so variety is key for me. At the breakfast buffet there is an egg station which I enjoyed very much. Though it is called an omelet station you can order your eggs anyway you want. I always had them scrambled with the omelet ingredients. Other guests would hold gesture with their hands how many eggs they wanted and the chef would gesture when it was time to flip so no need to know sunny side up or overeasy in Spanish! Also, all the items in the buffet have signs in different languages so you can figure out what the item is. Only complaint about breakfast: no real orange juice. I think they used Tang power drink for the juice.Dinner Buffet had a grilling station and a pasta station along with other typical food items (including goat meat!). Specialty restaurants include a Mexican, Asian and Carribean themed restaurant. The Mexican restaurant is really a buffet with fajitas and tacos. The Asican and Carribean restaurant only allowed you to order one appetizer, an entree and dessert. This is why I didn't enjoy those restaurants. The sushi I had at the Asian restaurant was disgusting. it was supposed to be a salmon, avocado and cucumber roll. The salmon was COOKEd and the outside was drenched in a weird sweet sauce. The Grouper that I ordered came out very rubbery and disgusting. Two people in my group really enjoyed their experience there however. The Caribean restaurant was ok, with my dietary restrictions I could only order the chicken kebabs which tasted oddly like KFC original recipe fried chicken. AFter each meal I was still hungry which made me long for the buffet. The Jalisco and Caribbean restaurants are AIR CONDITIONED. The buffet was sometimes intolerable in the heat. You will sweat a lot during dinner! While outside there is a nice breeze, the breeze is not felt inside the buffet and the warmth of all the food stations can make it quite hot inside!The Pikalo restaurant by the Pool is amazing. The pizza is very very good and I ate there quite often. The Pizza place also serves nachos, chicken nuggets, fries and hamburgers! There is a bar/grill at the beach which serves a buffet and grills hamburgers as well. The Beach bar is the ONLY bar that serves Presidente beer. Everywhere else serves Brahma beer.Drinks: I was very disappointed with the drinks. Due to the heat, it was impossible for the frozen drinks to remain frozen after being poured. Add warm rum and you get a slushie drink. Also every drink, and I mean every drink, aside from beer was incredibly sweet. I could not stomach having more than two drinks. The beer was filling and became warm very fast. So my desire to have a pleasant buzz most of the time were dashed. I enjoyed the service at the High Beach Bar and the Capitan. The Pool bar staff was NOT friendly EVER. The beach bartender was also very friendly.Pool. The reviewers are right. There is a lot of construction but it didn't affect my enjoyment. The music is very loud and mainly merengue/latin which got tiresome after awhile. The pool chairs are limited. I enjoyed the beach a lot more because of the scene and the breeze.Beach: There are plenty of beach chairs around. I never found it necessary to get up early and reserve a beach chair, though in some instances we had to scramble for chairs in the shade. We went so far as dragging chairs under small trees. It is VERY HOT in the sun even for a sunlover like me who lives in Miami. I was shocked at how much stronger the sun is than in Miami. I was also shocked at how many pale skinned people stayed in the sun despite being bright bright red.Activities: I was shocked to discover how much everything cost in the DR. At every chance, people ask you for money. We did the Saona Island tour. Long Bus trip, then speed boats to island, and catamaran back. It was very nice except for all the chances you were given to spend money. After a guilt trip about the DR economy by the tour guide you get off the bus and are swarmed by people trying to sell you things. You land on the island and immediately people are aggressively pursuing you to buy hand made necklaces, get a massage, or have your hair braided. Also there was a person making a video of the trip and tried to sell you the dvd afterwards. Lastly, you were offered a bottle of rum for 13 dollars that had your group's picture pasted on the bottle. EVERYTHING fun seemed to cost money. Of the included water sports: Kayak, windsurfing, and sailboats, you had to leave a $30 deposit. Parasailing is $35 per person for 10 minutes. A banana boat is $6per person for 10 minutes. Snorkeling is free only if you want to snorkel in the swimming area where there is nothing to see. You have to pay between $25 to $30 for a trip out to the reef or a shipwreck.The animation guys could get quite annoying. They would often harass my friends and I to do stretching with them. We just wanted to be alone and relax but they were aggressive of shouting at us with a microphone or following us around with a yoga mat. All the male staff are quite forward and will let you know (if you are) that you are pretty, ask about your boyfriend or husband, and tell you that they love you. Some of the Beach Animation guys danced suggestively in front of us.Fun find: There is a photo shack at the resort with professional photographers. They walk around the resort with a monkey or an iguana and take pictures. Later you can go and look for your picture and purchase it for $8. Alternatively you can arrange a private photo shoot and they take you to various locations, including the beach, to take pictures of you. My girlfriends and I had fun pretending to be contestants on America's Next Top Model and we had some very lovely pictures taken of us. We all even had the audacity to take topless photos (we covered ourselves with our arms). I look forward to looking at these pictures 30 years from now with nostalgia about my youth! We saw pictures of couples and kids that turned out very nice! The pics cost $5 if placed on a CD or $8 if printed. The photographer will give you a discount if you have over 100 photos (which we did have with 4 girls).SPA. The spa is very nice but the prices are very similar to U.S prices. I had an 80 minute massage and enjoyed the steam room and sauna. I also received the worst pedicure ever, but the staff were very friendly and the SPA facilities were top-notch.DISCO: Opens at 11:30. Most of the time my friends and I were too tired to stay up and go to the Disco, particularly since we couldn't get a buzz from the drinks to keep the party going. I went to the Disco twice. It is on the beach but there is a shuttle from the reception area that will take you to the beach and drop you off at the disco. The disco plays some club favorites but it is mostly latin music. There is no air conditioning so it gets hot very quickly. Not many guests go to the disco and I found that there were a lot of 18-24 year olds. Also, the staff liked to go there and dance with the pretty female guests. The Pasta Stations chef would not leave me alone at the disco. I politely refused to dance with them and then after many rejections he continued to stand next to me and smile creepily at me. I finally had to be rude and ask my friends to get pasta for me the rest of the time I was there! It was annoying. Clearly being polite and smiling is an indication that you welcome advances from the men in the DR. The Disco is also the only place you can get food at night. All the food places close after 10:30 or so. ROOMS:I like my room. I stayed right next to the High Beach Bar: Rm. 1126. It is far, but if we got lazy we would hop on the train (golf cart-like vehicle). The beds are VERY firm, but I like them that way. Other reviewers have compared the pillows to a sack of cotton balls but I didn't think they were bad. The hotel is inexplicably stingy with towels and I had a hard time asking for extra towels, but they did bring me more. The AC is very cold at night when you are sleeping and I found that it helped to put on socks and extra clothes at night. I happy to find there was a TV that had American TV channels like TNT and CNN. Not that I watched much TV but it was nice to do before falling asleep at night. We had no problem with the water pressure. You do not get any wash cloths which was a problem for a friend who used Bullfrog brand sunscreen that was SPF 45 and quite thick. So she felt she couldn't get clean with just soap on her hands. Bring washcloths if you need a good scrubbing while bathing.The fridge was stocked every other day with bottled water and nothing else. Except one day, frustrated by our inability to get a buzz, we splurged on three six dollar bottles of Presidente and brought them back to our room. They were that expensive because they were bought at the hotel's shop and were also quite large.Overall ambience:If you want to do nothing else but rest and relax then this is the place for you. I got a little antsy however and wished there was more to see and do. There are little markets on the beach outside the hotels but the vendors are quite aggressive and try to put jewelry on you. Nothing has a price tag on it because they wait to see how much you want to buy before they give you a price. I've been to a lot of Latin American countries so I didn't find anything worth bringing home with me. I also spent over a hundred dollars at the spa and $90 on an excursion and $125 for pictures from a photo shoot. After that, all I could afford was staying in the shade on the beach! Because I spoke spanish I befriended some staff members who looked out for us. There were many French tourists as well so I had the chance to also use my French! It was shocking how few Americans there were at the resort. I had a nice relaxing time, but after 5 days, I was ready to DO something.MISCELLANEOUS: I had a horrible experience with SPIRIT AIR. My luggage did not arrive until the next day. I recommend packing an extra bathing suit, coverup and a few toiletries in your carry-on should this happen to you. At least you can lounge at the beach sipping a cocktail while you wait for your bags!Bring Dollars or Euros. I was only able to use my debit card at the SPA and the Spa had a $100 minimum. There is an ATM at the hotel but it doles out pesos. You are given prices in dollars but the hotel will convert it for you so you can get the requisite pesos out of the machine. You can also use dollars for buying souvenirs and paying for excursions. It also never hurts to tip the staff a dollar or two for good service. It will ensure that you get preferential treatment the next time. Learn some key Spanish and French phrases. It helps!

<Content>Just ok!! This place is just ok, when we arrived we had no problem at the front desk, we were in the 3700 block of rooms which was ok. The room had 2 double beds after i emailed the hotel three times asking for a king bed, The room was ok the ac was very cold and the fridge was stocked up every other day. The only problem with the room is the beds are rock hard i think floor may have been softer. The hotel is a work in progress, the main pool is closed for work and looks like it may not be done for a while, and they are ripping down rooms in every section of the hotel. the middle pool is nice has a bar but you hear construction all day and the sound system at the pool had blown out speakers so the music sounds like crap.There was only one buffet open when we were there they advertise they have three of them. you could never find food there that was hot everything was just warm. the tree sit down restaurants were very good. the bard are great the Captain bar has a great staff they will take care of youAll in all we had a good time the place will be very nice when all the work is done i would just stay away from there until then.

<Content>Had a great time! I just got back from spending 6 days here with my boyfriend and we had a great time. We arrived earlier than check-in time on Sunday so we just hung out at the bar and drank. When we were given our room, it was very nice and clean. Spend the $3 a day to get a safe in your room. The buffets were good and rotated food daily. There was usually no wait and we could walk in and eat whenever we wanted. The grill on the beach had really yummy food as well. The Japanese and International restaurants were very good (the Mexican restaurant was closed). One pool was closed, but I didn't even know it was there until the 3rd day of our trip, so it wasn't that big of a deal. There are 2 others to choose from, plus the beach. The villas section is being re-done (along with the closed pool) so they are really trying to be competitive with other hotels. We stayed in the 4000 section and found it to be pretty well situated. It was about 5 minutes from the beach and 5 minutes to the pool/food. We recieved 2 huge bottles of water in our cooler that were replaced when we ran out. Our air conditioner did have a slight leak which made the floor under it a little wet, but I was not about to turn it off! It was fine for what we needed it for. The entertainment was good. They walk around the pool trying to get people to sign up for darts or horseshoes, etc. They put on a show at night that was a little cheesy, but I'm glad we saw it. I know a little Spanish but found that I didn't even need it because everyone there knew at least 3 other languages (including English) to give us directions or communicate with us. All in all, a great first all-inclusive for us. No complaints...wish I was still there. :)

<Content>worst vacation ever My family went last August and it was the worst vacation ever. The first thing is we arrived early in the morning so we could check in and got to the beach but they wouldn't let us check in until 3'o clock. The second thing is our room was pretty crappy. Our air conditioner never worked. The travel agent said that our room was ocean front. We had to walk about a mile from our hotel room to get to the beach

<Content>Awful Place Anyone planning on visiting this resort cancel now. We Came home !st june THANK GOD. They closed 1 pool and the main pool they are pulling appartments down around it. So much building work going on they have to turn music up full blast.Dont understand english at this placeRooms dirty, be warned maids take towels at 9am and dont get returned until night. We had to hide towels so we could have a shower before water ran out.Oh when it rains the place floods, we had to walk through knee high water to get to the restaurant, there is no other way round as even entrance to hotel floods. Then they will not allow you in the restaurtant because your wet. SPA was best part of the hotel, no one knows about it. You need to go out the main entrance and keep to your right, you will come to great cocktail bar, keep walking past that to top of villas and you will see the spa.Good luck to anyone going here, i wouldnt go back if it was FREE. Best of luck

<Content>Bad Experience Horrible check in experience. They did not have a room for us, so we were forced to pay for an extra night, even though we already pre-paid it. It took over an hour, just to check in! The staff did not speak any english, making it very hard to communicate. The wait staff was very rude, providing very slow, horrible service  always had their hand out for a tip. The room was in serious need of renovation. The shower head was falling out of the wall, when the people next to us were using their shower, we couldn't use ours, the bed was as hard as a rock. The ONLY good thing I can say about this place, was the beach!! Oh, PS: we got scabies!!!!!

<Content>So much fun going back!!! Just got back from my vaca with my best friend. we stayed May 26-June 2.It was sooo much fun so many things to do and sights to see.The people of the island and resort are so friendly and accomidating. The only thing you might want to know is that alot of people don't speak english, so brush up on spanish and a little french too. A lot of french visitors.the food was so delicious. there were three buffets (which were free) and two restaurants which you had to pay for. we didn't feel the need to go to them because of the large range of different food at the buffets.There were all together 6 bars on the resort.The drinks are pretty good. Just make sure you tell them to make them strong. they can be a little weak sometimes.The animation team was amazing!! we met a guy named benardo who was in charge of beach activities. He was soo cute!! but beware, all the men are huge flerters. especially if theres a chance for a fat tip.The beach is beautiful. the water is crystal clear. The only thing is that people walk around topless. even children. so if this is not your thing stay off the beach.while your there you must go on an excursion, we went on the aquatic tour where you drive speed boats down the coast line and go scuba diving. The fish are soo beautiful.all in all had a beautiful time. we are planning on going back in December.Just remember, it's your vacation, have fun and let loose!

<Content>Don't listen to the negative posts!! Myself my wife and two friends have just returned from IFA Villas, I was vary pre-trip because of the negative posts on this forum but as it turned out it was fantastic.The beach was excellent, the staff helpful, a great variety of bars and places to eat. food OK .What can I say we were chilled to the bone! our most relaxing holidat to date.Ok there were some minor issues that we could have complained out (our bathroom needed work) but as we were leaving it looks like a remodelling programme has started.So ignore the negative comments, who cares if there are birds in the buffet hall! it all adds to the experience.If you want 5 * go to the Marriott

<Content>Amazing time! Beautiful Place! Great People! Four of us, 2 guys and 2 girls, went to Punta Cana for the very first time and we all had a blast! We were there from May 17-24. I think that May was a perfect month to go because it wasn鈥檛 incredibly crowded.Did I hear someone ask about the beach? First of all, the sun is hotter there than I鈥檝e ever felt anywhere else. It鈥檚 humid as expected but fortunately there is a cool breeze that blows every now and then which is nice. The beach doesn鈥檛 have much of a selection of trees to hide behind but you鈥檒l find shade if you look hard enough. The sand was white and clean. The water was warm during the day and actually cooled just enough at night. It was nice to take a dip in the ocean at sunset. When going to the beach, you may want to park yourself close to the bar and restaurant. They don鈥檛 come to you for any orders. You have to go to them. The food at the beach is pretty good though! Everything鈥檚 grilled. And by the way, if you aren鈥檛 staying at the Ocean Village, it really is about a 5-10 minute walk to the beach. It鈥檚 a nice walk though. You鈥檒l never notice the distance. But if you really don鈥檛 want to walk, there is a beach shuttle that will bring you there. It鈥檚 parked right outside of the reception desk.As for mosquitoes and sand fleas鈥?I didn鈥檛 get one bite on me. I did apply some Repel with DEET when it was really humid at night. But for the most part, I wasn鈥檛 affected. I did see some people with bites around their ankles so just be aware that you may get bitten. I鈥檇 be more concerned with applying sunscreen, as the sun鈥檚 rays are intense.The main pool area was always crowded with people. Luckily, our room in the Villas had a balcony with the view of the pool. They play music for most of the day. And what a variety鈥?from Celine Dion鈥檚 鈥淢y Heart Will Go On鈥?to Antony Santos鈥?鈥淓l Chico Del Apartamento 512鈥? It was enjoyable nonetheless especially when the staff would dance with the patrons. The other pool next to the spa hardly had any people there. The bar was never full. The water is a bit deeper; 5 feet compared to waist deep in the main pool.The rooms were cozy. I didn鈥檛 mind that the drapes didn鈥檛 match the valance. The beds were firm. The pillows felt like they were filled cotton balls. We stayed awake most hours of the day and night so I fell asleep once I landed on my bed. The air conditioner blew out some incredibly cold air and if you turn on the ceiling fan as well, you鈥檒l wake up to an arctic winter. =) Cable television was hit and miss as was water pressure. There were a couple instances where water wasn鈥檛 available. It usually lasted only an hour or so. So just walk out the door and get a beer or Cuba Libre while you wait. Hot water was also a commodity. Take showers quickly because you may run out. You might also have to wait a couple minutes for water to heat up if you鈥檙e the first one in the shower. Once the water pressure is available, it comes out at you with a flurry. It鈥檚 actually quite amusing. Just talk to the person at the Front Desk or Guest Relations when you have a problem. The bathroom in general isn鈥檛 as bad as some other people have said. So what if there are really really tiny ants walking around with you. They don鈥檛 visit all the time and they鈥檙e so few. It also comes with a fully loaded shampoo, conditioner and soap dispenser. Also, an iron and ironing board aren鈥檛 included in the room, but you can always call and ask for one. They鈥檒l bring it right up to you. Why do you ask would I need an iron? The a la carte restaurants require men to wear collared shirts and pants to enter. Women don鈥檛 have a dress code.Mineral water is always there for you in the refrigerator. Leave a couple dollars a day on top of the refrigerator and you may get an extra bottle or two when you get back to your room.There were probably only a handful of us Americans at the resort. That really didn鈥檛 matter because everyone was very nice. Even though only one of us spoke Spanish well, they really made an effort to communicate with us as best as they could. Most bartenders and hosts speak English well.The animation crew was great. They work tirelessly and all hours of the day! You might see the same guy doing the workout session in the morning at the beach, a dance class by pool in the afternoon, and dancing on stage at the club in the middle of the night. It鈥檚 amazing how much they work and all with a smile. The staff works 12 consecutive days out of every 15 days. So please be nice to them as they work very hard to keep us happy.Know your hosts and hostesses by name. The same goes for your bartender and wait staff. They鈥檒l really appreciate it and you鈥檒l have a much more fun time there. They鈥檙e incredibly friendly and will do what they can to give you what you ask for. You鈥檒l be surprised how well they remember your drink and usual table.Aside from the one at the beach, there was only one buffet open while we were there. And only the International and Japanese restaurants were open as well. The other restaurants were being remodeled. It鈥檚 ok though because overall the buffet was the place to be. They do have a limited menu, as they almost always looked the same daily. However, there鈥檚 a grill and a pasta bar that you can go to for extra variety. They also have a wide assortment of fruit to choose from.The buffet only serves beer and refreshments. Juices are limited as well. The pool bar, the bar at the beach, and the Pikalo Pizzeria offer a full bar. The a la carte restaurants also offer everything. The international restaurant offers a wine list that you have to pay for. Most wines are Spanish or Chilean. But not a bad selection. I would defer from the house wine at the Japanese restaurant.The best bar had to be the Pikalo where they serve pizza. However, the music wasn鈥檛 much to be desired in the evening. Even after days of trying to convince them to play more lively music, they insist on trying to get you to sleep. I guess they鈥檙e telling you to take a nap because the disco starts at 11:30PM at the beach. The Pikalo closes at 10PM. However, the pool bar closes at midnight. The drinks aren鈥檛 very strong. But you should really try a shot of Mama Juana! It鈥檚 a local drink that you鈥檒l either love or hate. Or you may just acquire a taste for it like we did.By the way, it鈥檚 OK to use the competitor when going on excursions. They鈥檙e actually very friendly and they go out of their way to accommodate you on what you鈥檇 like to do and see. If you speak English only, let them know so that your driver that day will be aware of it.My advice鈥?come with an open mind. Eat and drink all you want. Don鈥檛 make small issues bigger than they seem. Enjoy your time outside of the room. Meet people because they鈥檙e very welcoming. You鈥檒l have a great time I鈥檓 sure!Hope this helped! Enjoy your time there!

<Content>Mixed Feelings Firstly this was booked as a last minute destination therefore cannot complain about the price.I have written and read reviews on this site before and it can take a long time get all the required details, therefore I will use bullet points so no trawling through many paragraphs.Location - Great, right next to the AltanticAccomodation - Pretty poor, outdated and not everything works, maintenance required almost constantly.Restaurant Staff - Very warm and accomodating, waiters sometimes go missing though.Bar Staff - Terrible, will only serve you if there are no Spanish speaking customers around. When they are the staff usually are talking to them and ignoring you.Entertainment Staff - Generally okay, the staff at the main pool have limitless energy and are about all day and night. Happy Boy is hilarious and Roberto loves himself.Entertainment Show Staff - Not bad although more could be done to involve non Spanish speaking audiences. They practice all day and put on a decent show at night.Reception Staff - Generally do not speak very good English but try hard.Food - Very good, better than many places I have been.Facilities - If all Restaurants had been open then I may be able to give a better review. As it was there were only three places open, the main buffet was very good and two A La carte , the Japanese was nothing like any Japanese food I have ever tasted, more like fast food and the Colonial, which was excellent. You have to book the A La carte at least a day in advance, the Colonial is definately worth it.Pools - There were three, the main pool which is very lively, a large quiet pool, which is very quiet and mainly deserted and a smaller quiet pool which is near the Sports Bar, which is a bit out of the way and where they provide Scuba lessons in 2 foot of water, this pool is ideal for children.Overall - This hotel appears to accomodate babies, children, young teens, 16-22 , 23-100. It really only has time for the 16-22 everything is geared for them. The male staff will try and chat up any female regardless of age, or the fact that her boyfriend/husband is at the bar/toilet/pool.Things to look out for - When you pass reception you will constantly be badgered to buy trips on various mechanical modes of transport, all day. American teenagers who apparently think it is okay to pour drinks and put out cigarettes in the main pool and generally make so much noise that you wonder if they have ever been allowed out on thier own before. On the beach there is plenty of things to do, just try and find a quiet spot with some shade away from the hoardes of sellers and hotel photographers, it is virtually impossible good luck. If you are in a 4000 numbered something room, be prepared to be awake until 3-4 am as the night club is on the beach and you are right next to it.

<Content>IFA Bavaro is Awesome!! First things first. The people on this site that are dogging this place are obviously people who think they get the luxury of taking home with them on vacation. Then stay at home! I traveled alone and had a blast. See subjects/comments below:FOOD: The buffets were decent and plentiful with various dishes,breads,desserts, and fruits/veggies to choose from so each time you could make up a good meal. The themed restaurants were awesome. My fav was the colonial with the beef filet and shripm salad to start. The pizza buffet was great by the main pool. DRINKS: One word: Mamajuana!! This is a herbal blend fused with rum and honey and you drink it as a shooter. Too many and you are toast in a hurry. The rum drinks were great too and they will mix anything of your liking up with it. TIP: Be nice and drop a $5 spot on the bartenders by the bar closest to your room or near the main pool bar (Gri-Gri) and you will get great service and drinks. Ask for your drinks Fuerte style (strong) and they will hook you up. And please, get friendly and chatty with the staff. The d.r. people are lots of fun and very nice!!ACTIVITIES: The animation staff gets involved in all kinds of interactive things with the guests. Get involved!! You are on vacation!! They are great. This happens everywhere from the pools to the beach. BEACHES: Been around and love how vast and wide the beach is. White sand, blue water, 100ft tall palm trees. Enough said??PEOPLE: I met folks from all over the world. Get busy with the spanish before you go. You just need to know some basics. If I had french and spanish in the bag, I'd have met many more girls as I was traveling as a single but soon had a huge group I was hanging with from all over the world and we stuck together like glue.ROOMS: Some issues but no big deal. A/C went out but was promply repaired. Drop a $5 spot onto your housekeeper the first morning and tell her you need plenty of bottled water (which is great water/natural spring and mineralized) and she will hook you up daily. All bad reviews take note: You are in DR not home!!

<Content>Descent Vacation for the Price This was my second time to Punta Cana and overall it wasn't a bad hotel. Sure, there were some problems; outdated rooms and limited selection at the buffet. Actually the biggest thing that bothered me was the limited number of Chairs on the beach and the VERY limited areas of shade... not good for a person who burns easily!The staff were very friendly, the drinks were good, and the entertainment was a blast (but you have to get involved!). Most of the clientele were french and spanish, so it's a nice relaxed european environment. My recomendations: Get to the beach early to get a chair and shade, take quick showers to avoid freezing, get a slice of pizza at the pizzaria (best pizza I've ever had), go on stage when they are looking for participants, and go with an open mind! It wasn't a bad hotel for the price.

<Content>Amazing resort for the value! Sorry this is a long review but we were very happy with the resort! We just got back on May 5, 2007 from the IFA Villas Bavaro and we were extremely surprised for the value! I can't say enough positive about it! When we booked it we were a little unsure being rated as a 3.5 star. However, when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. The place is HUGE. We have been to 4 and 4.5 star resorts in the past and this was by far comparable! Even with the language barrier (as English was difficult for many to understand and/or speak) we found ALL the staff to be amazing, pleasant, friendly, etc.! When we arrived at the airport, there were probably 5-6 if not more international flights that had just arrived so some time was spent waiting in an unorganized line get through their customs (which was painless). Then to baggage claim, again, quick and painless. The only truly negative issue with our trip was that our airline carrier (Sunwing) was horribly represented and we had to search for 5-10 minutes - lugging our own luggage at that - just to FIND our bus! There was no rep from Sunwing to greet us when we arrived at the airport (nor easily available at the resort) to guide us to the correct bus (which there were probably 50-100 or more and not lined up numerically). However, once we finally found it and were on it, the bus ride to the resort was nice and air conditioned. Oh, and don't be fooled if upon departure from the resort someone tells you the new depature section of the airport is airconditioned - it's not - it's just open with big ceiling fans.Check in at the IFA was quick and painless. Remember you are on Dominican time so 5 minutes can mean 15-30 (but by no means was that always the case), and you are on vacation so relax if things aren't as speedy as home. That's what vacations are for.We were upgraded from the Villas to next to the Ocean Village (directly in front of the Pizza Bar). The Villas are a fair but thoroughly enjoyable walk to the beach as we would walk to them at night. The walk is always enjoyable when you are usually sitting doing and relaxing most of the time. Our rooms, numbered 3425  3426, overlooked the back of the property which had a pond with ducks, birds, a small island  fountain. They were what we classed as a short jaunt to the beach (about 5-7 minutes) but we enjoyed every moment of it. And if you didn't want to walk, there was always the bus that would take you from the reception area to the beach about every 5-10 minutes. Although we didn't get to see the inside of the Villas, from the outside they were quaint and beautiful.The place is absolutely spotless! Groups of maids would scrub any andevery inch of the resort - if it wasn't sand, it was cleaned. The pool decks, loungers, public bathroom floors, walls, etc etc. were scrubbed each and every morning and the public bathrooms around the resort were constantly cleaned - maids were assigned to each one all day. The rooms too were well maintained. We had no problems - air conditioning worked great plus there was a ceiling fan if the air was too cold - go figure! Clean beds. All clean towels every day (however no face cloths but that's no big deal). Pillows were a bit to be desired (quite lumpy) but again, no big deal. We were able to sleep comfortably each night and it certainly wouldn't put a sour taste in our mouth about the place. No problem with noise.There were 4 pools of varying sizes that we saw and all were great. We spent all but one day on the beach. We had great weather every day - most days, if not all, felt like it was 100 degrees (very humid)! It rained a couple nights for about 5-10 minutes but nothing to ruin our stay. Remember you can't predict mother nature. Even the Dominicans say you just can't predict their weather. If you want to hit a market, there were two that we found near the resort. Once on the beach and facing the ocean there is one immediately to your right. The market is much larger than it looks from the beach. We suggest hitting the back of it first (just walk along a path to the farthest vendor then go in). The back booths contain mostly clothing and trinkets as the personnel there are MUCH less aggressive. The front of the market (facing the beach) is very aggressive with vendors selling jewelry, Mamajuana (a local drink), cigars, liquor, coffee, etc. The other market is about a 5-10 minuteswalk along the beach to the left. It too is much larger than it appears and they too are very aggressive. Barter hard! They far overprice everything. Cut price they give by at least 75%. Shop on the resort first to get a price idea as the market starts much much higher. Then you have to bargain hard to beat the price down. The harder you bargain, the much better you. When you walk away they bargain even harder. Don't be afraid to do it. We found most items onthe resort shops to be the same price that you had to barter for at the market! For excursions, parasailing, etc. we dealt with Renaldo Cheapy Cheapy(or Orlando - difficult to understand). He is a petit gentleman with a gotee who wears a small black floppy hat with the edges frayed and sat at a hut next to the market  beach grill on the beach. He was awesome to deal with and we recommend him. The food was good. In the buffets the breakfast didn't change up much each day but there was certainly plenty to choose from between buffet stuff or grilled items. If you got tired of the buffet for lunch, there was the pizza bar or the Rancho beach grill. The beach grill had great food for lunch - chicken nuggets, hamburgers, chickenburgers, fish, pasta, french fries, crepes, etc etc etc!. The pizzaria had awesome pizzas to pick at but beware of the heat pizza. We had no problems with food. Yes, selection didn't change a whole lot but again, plenty to choose from that you could change it up yourself.Entertainment staff worked from about 10am to midnight every day. Very active and entertaining. We went for total RR so didn't do any excursions.I could write more but my fingers are getting tired. All in all, we loved the resort and would certainly return to it if we had the opportunity. I haven't had time yet to download my pictures so unfortunately I have none attached.

<Content>not worth the money We just came back on May 4th, we were down there for a week and seemed to have more problems then anything. To start, the room sucks. The beds are hard and when you sleep is the time that the bugs seem to feast on you. The staff is not the best. IF you speak english they seem to not understand you one moment and then the next they know exactly what you are saying. There were plenty of children around which was not a problem, but the problem that I had were all of the topless women around, I just didnt feel that was appropriate. The food seem to make my boyfriend sick more then anything. After every meal he ate he seemed to be in the bathroom at least a couple of times for long periods of time. The only real nice thing about being down there was the beach, but that really had nothing to do with the resort. There was always someone coming up to you every moment you were not in your room trying to selling you something, even if you told them you had no money. To top our vacation off, the last morning we were there we allowed ourselves an hour and a half to get ready. I had just gotten into the shower and had shampoo in my hair when the power went out. When we called the front desk they said it would be back on in 30 minutes. As we sat on the bed waiting for it to come back on we watch a GIANT cockroach crawl up the wall from behind the mirror. Well an hour later with still no power we had to take water bottles from the maids closet so I could finsh washing my hair because we had to leave and there was still no power. I would spend the extra money to stay at a 5 star hotel. So to those of you who choose this hotel, I hope you have better luck then we did.

<Content>punta cana I was happy to have visited the dominican but think I would have had a better time if I had stayed somewhere else. Not many english speaking people at this hotel. In 1 week I met 4 people. restaurants are small so if u don't book days in advance you don't get in..buffet was good different stuff added everyday. When it rains the grounds flood. Beds are extremely hard and pillows if u call them that are extremely small. Towels are a hit or miss sometimes they don't leave any when cleaning your room and u have to call for them and of course they expect a tip for delivery. No wash cloths. Pools are somewhat dirty even though they were cleaning them every day. Lots of loud people at 530 heading to their room when disco closes. definately wakes you up. Over all though staff was friendly. Management always made them selves known in restaurants and continually checked for quality. Sometimes if u don't specify alcohol in your drink you most likely will receive a virgin drink. Spa was great had a massage,manicure and pedicure very accomadating and reasonably priced. The shops do try to overcharge you when converting pesos to dollars or dollars to pesos. don't bother going to la palmera mall only like13 stores open and overpriced. Hotel was cheaper. captain cooke's had the best drinks and coffee. I would save a few extra dollars and go to a better hotel.

<Content>Before you book, please read! We just got back from one week stay at the IFA. I read all the reviews and couldn't understand why some were great and some were not. Now I know. The hotel has an old section and a new section. The old section is on the beach side where we stayed in the 3000 block. The bathrooms were in bad shape.Bathtub was rusted, small ants were all over the vanity and the ceiling leaked when it rained. The furniture was in poor condition, the bed was hard, but wasn't bad. The pillows felt like they were stuffed with cotton balls. Our balcony faced construction and machines were making noise for half a week.Bring washcloths!!! Our refrig was defrosted and we were expected to clean up the water afterward. It was only stocked with water until the last day, then we got beer and soda. The food was okay, but better at other resorts. My husband was somewhat disappointed with the food. The 3 special restraunts were nothing special, Japanese was the best. The drinks were okay, they would make them strong if you wanted them. (And left them a tip.) Not many spoke english. But it is a spanish speaking country, so learn alittle spanish already.Grounds were beautiful. Beach was a little further walk than other resorts we have been at. But it was beautiful. Employees seemed friendly. Entertainment was weak, but the effort was great.Check in and out went fine. If you go make sure you book in the new section. It's very nice over there, but a further walk to beach. They run bus shuttles back and forth often.Overall I wouldn't recommend this resort. I have been to better and it wouldn't take much for them to update the rooms and buffets.Pools were in good condition and clean. We wouldn't go back unless we booked a room in the newer section on the street side.

<Content>Asi Asi If you've never been to an all inclusive, I'm sure you would find IFA more than adequate. However, having been to several other resorts in the past, I was a bit disappointed with IFA Villas. The ROOMS were outdated but OK. As warned beforehand by other TripAdvisors, water pressure not good and we had no shower one night (I used the outdoor shower by the beach). The resort is very large and it is a bit of a walk to the beach. DO get your towel on a lounge before 9:00, either by the pool or on the beach. FOOD was OK - not great; not enough variety on the buffets and disappointing salad bar (again, compared to others I've been to). DRINKS very weak and watered down. Five shots of tequila and barely a buzz (normally one would do me). Staff not very friendly with the exception of waiters/waitresses. Apparently the week we were there was spring break for Europeans - loud partying throughout the night and security would do nothing. Surprised to see many changing their clothes on the beach. Topless not unusual, but I've never seen this before. Despite this mostly negative review, I reiterate it's not that bad if you've never been to other resorts to compare it to. Would I go back? Probably not unless it was a really good deal.

<Content>IFA Villas and Village Punta Cana Just got back from 1 week at the IFA VILLAS Punta Cana. 3 couples went together and we got an easy upgrade to the Village area without even asking for it! The rating by Apple was a 3 but I would give it an upgrae to 4 1/2 apples. The rooms were above average, the landscaping was above average, the beach was excellent but lacking shades cabanas( I took an umbrella and 2 C clamps) and made my own shade. But really didn't use the seats often. The food was 1 of the best that I ever ate , and I been to Punta Cana 5 times now. The 3 special restaurants weren't the best I ever had, but the 3 buffets had a lot of varieties changing of some kind every seating. The staff was above average and I didn't have 1 complaint other that the Disco didn't change music varieties enough, too much Spanish and hardly any American. I couldn't stay up past midnight any ways. The pool music was above average and the beach music was very good too! Didn't take any tour other then the reef snorkling for 2 hrs for $20.00 was nice and we stopped off to see the shark and moray eels caged area also. The shops were the type you had to bargain for but since I was there 4 other times I knew all the angles and made great deals for myself and others. I usually too 75% off of 1st pricing then added more items and got great deals for around 60% off of starting prices. I don't know where the other reviews said the drinks were watered down because ours were very strong and if you just got shots they would knock you quickly. A few times depending on what bar you went (as there were 7 bars) they did do a few virgin drinks but I think it was just mistakes as the bartenders were very busy at all times. I would definitely recommend anyone to check out the deals at IFA VILLAS VILLAGE RESORT if size is not important to you, although this 1 was not too small but easiel to get around. I f money is not of a concern to you they this would not be the place for you! Costed us total: insurance, taxes, and all inclusive of $875. for 1 week where the larger resorts would cost you $1200-$1400. per person at this time of year. Hope I helped all! Wilddog

<Content>Great Vacation, Great Value, Great Atmosphere Non stop fun the whole time we were in the Dominican Republic. Eight of us went and everyone agreed the resort was great. The resort is a great deal. The rooms and grounds were very clean. The food was good and a lot of variety. We ate at all three ala carte restaurants. The Mexican and Japanese we're great. We didn't enjoy the International restaurant.The animation team is a blast. Out on the beach in the morning and midday (stretching, dance lessons, water aerobics). Around the pool in the afternoons and early evens (different contests daily). Great shows nightly. They finish off each night at the discotecha.Henri, Robert and Chocolate (animation team members) are all great. If you get a chance, talk with them. You will be laughing the whole time.The beach is beautiful. Powder white sand and some large coral rocks at the edges of the swimming area. The are all kinds of fish swimming around the rocks. Watch out though, the sun is very strong and you will burn easily. We went on two excursions. Shopping($20)- Visit two shopping areas, cigar factory and rum factory. It's about 4 hours and very fun. Bring some cash and get ready to barter.Saona Island($80)- This is a whole day excursion. Totally worth the $80. Start with an hour and a half bus ride. Long but our guide talked to us most of the trip about the Dominican Republic, their history and you get to see how they really live. Then we got onto catamarans and sailed another hour and a half out to the island. On the boat you get drinks brought to you, dance with staff or just relax on the hammocks. On the island they grill out a great lunch and have an open bar. Delicious food. Relaxing on the island is no problem. There are beach chairs and hammocks everywhere. We rode speed boats back to the port, stopping on some sand bars to swim and see star fish. They whole excursion is unbelievable. I would recommend this resort to anyone and will hopefully be going back next year. Anyone looking for a great time stay here.

<Content>Can not wait to get back there!!! I can't believe people 'poo-poo' this place. It was great! I was a little taken aback at the airport by the Dominican's curt nature at first but soon realized...I'M IN ANOTHER COUNTRY WITH A DIFFERENT CULTURE! Geez people, get real! If you don't want to experience how it's done elsewhere, stay at home! I recommend this place if you wantto relax OR party, you can do both. There were couples, singles and families when I was there and ALL seemed to be having a fabulous time! The hotel and rooms have their issues but the fun, the weather and the overall experiences far outweigh any flaw in the rooms (which, if you are vacationing like most people, you shouldn't be in very much anyway) or delayed drink service. My only regret is that I didn't stay longer.Please... always research where you are planning to travel and how the people live, work and behave in that country. If you want to eat with gold plated cutlery and have the locals kiss your feet, this is not the place for you. Go somewhere else and let the rest of us have a great time here!

<Content>Good Value for the money This Hotel is a good value for your dollar. The rooms are a little outdated but if you ask for a change they are very accommodating. The resort itself it Huge and has a vary nice beach and very nice pools. Plenty of places to eat and plenty of bars with great drinks. The resort is lively great animation team, entertainment everywhere and lively music. The nice touch is the bar in the villas section with Jacuzzi's around it for a nice relaxing afternoon. Surprisingly the Japanese restaurant was my favorite it was amazing they were really on point as far as Japanese food and decor I was really pleasantly suprised. Great service all around, and for the people complaining about Spanish speaking staff HELLO you are in a Spanish speaking country next time go to FLORIDA. As far as excursions go I will defiantly recommend cave fun it is an extreme sport excursion and defiantly not for kids or elderly. It is hard to find because only a few representatives offer it but it is defiantly worth going through the trouble of finding it. you drive about 2.5 to 3 hours but it is worth every minute of the drive upon arrival you are given breakfast fruit coffee and fresh juice and are geared up and introduced to the horses which take you on a 30 minute ride through the national park towards the cave. from that point on you hike through the national park for about 45 Dominican minute and you reach the cave. When you do reach the cave the only entrance point is a block hole that's about 60 feet deep and you have to be dropped on a line and little by little escort your self down in total darkness just with the little light on your helmet but the view is amazing. Then you get to explore the cave and it is Huge with beautiful lime stone droppings and beautiful under water streams that you get to swim through and at one point even dive and swim under the tunnel it is total amazing. When you finish exploring and hicking through the cave (about 2 hours) your horses are waiting to take you back to the ranch where you have an amazing Dominican lunch and a cold beer or soda. The excursion is the best I have ever done and I would recommend it to anyone the guides on it are wonderful and full of information. I will definatly be going back to visit Dominican Republick because it is a beautfiull country full of wonderfull culture and people.

<Content>Food was below par Look, I'm not here to complain too much. For the money it was o.k. But lets just say the food got really old really fast. Same stuff every meal time. don't expect to go home and tell your friends about it. The rooms were ok. Plenty of construction going on right now. The hotel staff working on the construction project had no problem starting work at 730 am. So if you're unlucky enough to get a room near a construction area. Well, too bad. You will be disturbed. Also anyone who is unfortunate enough to have a room near the stage where nightly performances are, well lets just say I wouldn't want to be you. It's loud and the rooms are very close to the stage. I was fortunate not to have any problems with noise. In general my room was fine. My travel companion wasn't so lucky. He got stuck in a room very far walking distance from me. Which was inconvenient to say the least. I don't think I would stay there again. If I did it again and was with a female companion. I would pay the extra money in the hopes of getting better rooms and much better food. The staff was nice and some of the chicks were really hot.

<Content>Average Hotel but still a lot of Fun My husband and I just got back from our 7 day vacation to Punta Cana (Feb. 16-23) and we stayed at The IFA Villas Bavaro Resort. At first we wondered what we go our selfs into when we walked into the resort.. because it looked so small...then we realized there was 3 parts to the resort and it actually is very big. Our room was average.. nothing fantastic. The pools were great for the most part and they had decent entertainment around the villas pool area. The beach was BEAUTIFUL! It was a little bit of a walk to the beach because the resort is big but definately worth the walk..thats where we spent most of our days. The food at the buffets are average..it took me a couple days to get use to because everything has a bit of an odd taste. But again not horrible. Dont even bother with the Mexican, Seafood, or Japenese restraunts.. they were horrible. All you get to drink is water there...we asked for soda or beer but never got it at any of those restraunts. The portions at these restraunt could probably not even fill up a 6 year old because they are so small. I just wouldn't bother wasting your time in those restaunts...And be sure if you decide to make reservations at any of those restraunts.. go at least 3-4 days a head of time to get a good reservation. Otherwise you may not even get a reservation or you wont be able to eat until 10pm at night. The only thing we really found horrible was probably only 3% of the vacationers and staff spoke english...we were so lonely and it got extremely fustrating not having most of the staff understand us. The employees spoke spanish and french mostly very very little english. We would recommend going with friends or family members to Punta Cana because if you think your going to meet english speaking people down there.... think again. We didnt meet someone who spoke english until our 2nd last day. So honestly that was the only thing really hard to deal with. Overall the hotel was ok/ average... if you get a good deal to stay here then its worth the money.

<Content>Very Nice Vacation Just got back from two weks at this resort. First of all, the cleaning staff are amongst the hardest working I have ever seen at an all-inclusive (I've been to four now). They are always sweeping, cleaning and maintaining the grounds. I stayed from Jan 25 to feb 08, 2007. My room was 1180, and it was very nice. I had no problems with the air conditioning, I did have a problem getting a remote for my tv the first couple of days, but after getting Jennifer (the AirTransat rep )involved, this was quickly fixed. The hot water was iffy from time to time, but when it did work it worked just great. The food was very good the first week, but after the staff turnover in the second week, it fell off just a tad. I didn't hear of anybody getting sick, and many told me they were eating the salads as well. The wait staff at the bars need more language training as a rule, but if you just show up with a smile, and Hola Amigo, you should do just fine. I personally don't like the beach animation stuff, and if you don't either, if you turn to your right when you get to the beach, and walk past the Barcelo wharf for about another ten minutes, there is a beautiful area that is open to all the resorts, that is hardly used at all, very quiet, the waves are a lot softer and the beach is a lot cleaner, I higly recommend this area for those wanting a little romance during their vacation. The beach at the resort is very, very busy. Lots of motorboats, and all other types of beach fun, for a cost of course. There are a lot of sales people at the beach all day long. They aren't very forceful at the resorts area, but if you go past the resort area, they tend to be more forceful and pesky. All in all I loved my stay, the AirTransat reps were very good. I would definetly go back again. Randy, London Ontario, Canada

<Content>Great! I will post this review under both the IFA Villas and IFA Village as they are part of the same resort complex.Overall this resort is above average and I would rate it a four out of five.My girlfreind and I (both 27) arrive on JAn 29 and stayed until Feb 5, 2007.Facilities:Upon arrival they put us in the Villas section, room 1089, I asked them if they could move us closer to the beach and they said they would have a room in the 4000 block on the 31st.THe VIllas section is quite a ways away from the beach. The higher your room number in the 1000 block the further away you are. Overall my room in the Villas section was a little run down compared to the room I was given later in the 4000 block. I the worst problems were the shower( no tub) was very low flow and took a long time for the water to turn hot. Also the refrigerator did not seem to cool very well even on high. The TV had no remote and the front door did not seem very secure. I would recommend everyone to rent a safe ( $3 dollars a day) The Villas overall wuold be good for someone who would prefere a quiet location pool site rather then a crowded beach. Or the foot traffic of the other more central pools.The main stage, 3 al cart restaurant , a pool bar and Captain lounge are all located in the Villas section. The 2 buffet restaurants are located in the other parts of the complex so they are bit of a walk to get to.On the January 31 we moved to our room in the 4000 block in the Oceans Village section (4036). The room overall was in much better shape the our other room in the Villas The biigest improvement was the flow of the shower. The TV had a remote and as we were on the third flow we had a balcony. We were now only a short walk from the beach.The beach was great but make sure you wake up early and put a towel on a chair. Many days we slept in and could not find an empty chair and had to go over the Barcelo section of beach.Find the stage and stay away from it if you prefer quite as they like to blast the music.I found the grounds were very well kept and secureFoodOverall the food was very good. You could aways get something to eat from 7 Am to 3AM. The buffets offer an abundance of different foods. They always have someone on the grill cooking something. My personal favorite was breakfast, the cook woould prepare an omelette for you from an assortment of ingredients for your selection. My only complaint would be that sometime the waiter or waitress would take too long to get my drink and I'd be finished eating by the time it arrived. I only ate at the International a la carte restaurant so I can not comment on the other two. Many days I would grab a slice of pizza from the snack bar beside the pool in the Village section.The disco (afterhours at the beach bar) was somewhat of a disappointment as it was not very well attended. But you can go there to grab a bite to eat up until 3AM. Staff and entertainmentOverall the staff were very freindly. I never had any problems getting a drink. Sometime I'd go up to the bar and be asked what I wanted by three different bartenders while the fourth was alreadty preparing my order. If you are sitting at a table the waitresses can take some time coming around so I would have to go to the bar to get another drink.( No big deal) The Animation team (entertainment) was very good and they try to keep you entertained. AtmosphereThe week I was there the resort was mostly attended by couples and European tourists (mostly French). Although I did see many different combinations, groups of women , groups of men, some families etc I would definitely go back again.

<Content>One of the best ever. We stayed my wife and me for 2 weeks. Jan 9 to 23rd.Beach is amazing. Resort one of the best we went.Animation Team amazing. We will go back again next year or before if we can. Clean resort, nice food a lot of animation.Do not read bad rating, try it for yourself and for the priceyou will not regret it. We have been going to many places in the carribean, Europe, Africa... and this was one of our best vacations.You can enjoy 3 hotels for the price of one. One very quiet the IFA VIllas, one with animation the IFA Village or the Ocean not far from the beach. The only problem is that you will hear the disco at nightif you stay at the Ocean.But you will get used to it. We went many times at The Disco very nice ambiance. Brand new SPA; GYM; Pizzeria and Ice Cream Parlor.A very nice  friendly place to stay. Any more infos you can contact me.jacobberdugo@canada.com

<Content>Good resort on a budget Four of us in our 30's stayed at this resort the week of January 21, 2007. I was a little sceptical since we paid very low price for our vacation and the resort is rated as 3 1/2 stars. The flight was good although a bit cramped, we flew Sunwing, and I would suggest to pay a little extra and have a pre-booked seat with a bit more leg room. Resort is very close to the airport, less than 15 minutes drive. Originally, we were booked into Villas part of the resort which is quite the way from the beach, and consists solely of bungalows. The resort was full but we slipped $15 to the girl at the reception desk and got rooms on the second floor in the Village part. Rooms are very clean and the maid service is immaculate. They did come to clean the rooms a bit early in the morning, before 9am, but if you hang 'do not disturb' sign on your door they will come back later. My only complaint in regards to the accomodation is that the walls seem to be paper thin. I could hear my friends talking in the room next to us.The food is great. There is a lot to choose from and everything is really tasty. Lots of fish, calamari, etc. Pasta grill is amazing, altough there is quite a line up every night but it's worth it. We usually ate breakfast and dinner at the main restaurant, and lunch at the beach grill. We visited the Mexican and Japanese a la carte restaurants, and I advise you to reserve your seats the moment you get to resort. We came back the next day and could only get the table at 10:30 at night. Mexican is buffet style, with excellent food, but Japanese restaurant is really out of this world. Amazing atmosphere and food to satisfy even someone who is not too keen on Japanese cuisine. Do not try red wine anywhere - it tastes like vinegar!! White wine is slightly better. The service at the restaurants is slow, to put it mildly. We would order a drink when we arrive for dinner, eat, and just when we were getting ready to leave the drinks would arrive. But this is a part of the deal - slow service seems to be expected in the Carribean. The bars were no better - the only decent one is 'El Capitain' adjecent to the Villas part of the Resort. Altough it's a good 10 minutes walk away from the beach it's definitely worth the walk if you want a decent coctail. Also, capuccino and espresso was only available at this bar, so that made it a bit hard for me as '3-cappucinos-per-day' person. You would see the machine on the other bars, however the staff would politely tell you it's broken and will be fixed tomorrow. That never materialised.The beach is absolutely gorgeous!! It's breathtaking, that's all I can say. There is no shade though, and you have to move your towel or lounge chair around every 15-20 minutes chasing a bit of shade from the palm trees. Get there early to secure your lounge chair, otherwise you would have to wait until late afternoon before one becomes available.All in all, this is an excellent resort for younger couples or singles. There is lots to do, lots of friendly people to meet, and even with a few shortcomings I would definitely go back and recommend this resort to friends.

<Content>Just great! Hi , We went my husband, my 2 girls 18 and 17 and i on the 30 th of December to the 13th of january. 2007 for 2 great weeks.. It was just superrrrrrr. First of all, i was like you, i read the commentaries, and i was not too anxious to go because there was a lot on negativity about this hotel. But, it was all the opposite. We really enjoyed our stay.We were at the ifa village. room 3114 garden view, superb. a lot of palmtrees Maybe the bath needed to be repeint, but it didn 't matter because we were not there very often.The food was great, We ate at the two buffets and to 3 three restaurants and the food was very good. We didn't get sick.A lot of French ,Germain and Canadians like us.. A lot of family. My two girls really enjoyed and will go back some day.The beach, oufffffffff so beautiful. I think it is the best one of all the hotels around and it's near everything. No problem with chairs and towels.The personnal was great. specially the bar tenders who were always smiling and laughing. We did two excursions, Jeep Country Adventure, very very nice, we learned a lot about the country and Saona Island, oufffffff very beautiful.We were with Sunwing airline and nothing went wrong.We were on time.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. If you really want a tipic Dominican not a Colonial one and where everyone talks to everybody. Don't hesitate to choose this hotel. A very good quality price. I would certainly go back ..............

<Content>Trip To Remember First off Awesome trip. Everybody was very helpful and made sure that we were happy. The bars were awesome amazing bartenders and very entertaining. The animation team was very involved at all times trying to get people involved in activities. We had amazing weather (jan.6-jan.13, 2007) couldn't have ask for better sunshine all the time. Food was good for the first couple of days and than we got sick of the same stuff (same as any resort though). The beach was beautiful lots of stuff to do could never say we were bored. We spent most of our time on the beach enjoying the sun as well as parasailing, snorkling and banana boating. This resort had a lot of couples, which suited me fine because i went with my boyfriend and another couple. Overall I was very impressed with my vacation and highly recommend this resort to anyone with a low budjet but looking for an awesome time.

<Content>loved the beach Me and my husband loved this resort.To start with yes, there is a little bit of a walk from some of the rooms to the beach,but you get a chance to take some great photos.The food isn't great in the buffet,the other three are good.try the steak in the international.The rooms are decent we had double beds.Housekeeping was good we left a 5 tip on the first day and didn't have to ask for anything else except extra pillows.The beach is sooo sweet we lived out there (i will include photos) my only complaint you have to leave a deposit to use the hotels water eq..We decided to go to the mall one day the cab ride was 70.00.I would advise people to share cab rides to cut down on the cost.The disco was fun on our second night there was a live band ,it's only on fridays.The entertainment was so-so.Sometimes you just wanna hear the waves ,music plays almost all the time it goes off at about 3am.Rain comes in intense showers but they only last about 15 minutes at a time.The drinks were a little watered down at 2 of the four bars.I think that we would go here again,there were a lot of kids ,a few were naked.Yes people were topless but you really do get use to it.I even got bold and went topless in the water.so for what we paid 1500.00 for 2 people for 8 days we had a ball.Be sure to try the snorkelling trip it's only 15.00 and it last for a hour.hope this helps.

<Content>Great! Just returned from a girls trip, this resort is great!!Don't listen to neg, reviews.rooms were very clean, bathroom could use a little upgrade.Beach is out of this world!!!Food was good . night shows were great also, dancers WOWStaff works hard, some spanish helpfull.There are 2 markets on the beach-on to the left and one to the right, be prepared to barter. Most people say 1/2 the price that they first say.You can book lots of water activities right at the beach, we booked with the guys down from the beach bar/disco.We did glass bottom boat, sun set tour, and parasailing.We booked a tour at the lobby -dune buggies to Queen's Ranchand from the ranch we took horses to Caves, our tour guy was Kenny Rogers -he was great, lots of laughs and singing.Just go and enjoy.

<Content>Dont listen to the whingers!! If you are looking for a caribbean holiday on a smaller budget then this is the way to do it!! Our family (me, hubby, 2 girls aged 11 and 8) had the perfect 1st taste of the caribbean!! The whole resort is great and the beach will take your breath away!!Fabulous place, rooms are superb. Cleaned daily to a high standard, we never had cause for complaint. The whole resort is spotless, staff cleaning up constantly from those who cannot even be bothered to put a plastic cup in the bin instead leaving them to blow around or left on the islands in the pool!! (small moan I know but then these same people are generally the ones who complain!) The food is great in all restaurants, plenty of choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Japanese is not very Japanese though! Only meal in 2 weeks we didn't enjoy. A couple of people had upset tummies but we put this down to the fact they were cleaning their teeth with tap water (a big NO NO!!) We, and several other families we met had no problems at all. Take LOTS of US dollars, it seems to be the currency they prefer. Peso's have little value. Resort shops are very expensive (if you have children and you need to-stock up with sweets and crisps before you go as there are no inclusive ice-creams) Some staff are rude-some are not-same anywhere in the world. Entertainment is repeated after the 1st week (think most go for 1 week!) Book trips, see some of the island, although fantastic, inclusive live can get boring......Definately give this place a go and make up your own mind!! The Victor Meldrew's are not always right you know!!

<Content>Had a great time Just back from a week All Inc at this hotel. The hotel itself was lovely. the Beach beautiful. 3 pools to choose from catering for all tastes eg. one with full entertainment for the more energetic, one quiet and relaxing, one just rather small!The evening entertainment was really aimed at the under 14 age group and there is limited tabled seating (only 3 tables which would give you a view of the stage the rest is just chairs in rows in front of the stage)- shame as even cheesey entertainment i can enjoy but would always want a table to put my drink on!The room was always clean. We liked the fact that the maid didn't arrive until early afternoon as this meant we didn't have to rush out in the mornings like you do in some hotels.Food - fine if you're there for just a week. Any longer than that and you may get bored. This isn't due to the lack of variety as there is plenty there, it's just that with so many cultures visiting there is often only a few things you would be prepared to eat yourself. I like to try foods from different cultures but very little actually appealed.No children around as far as we saw, age range seemed to be mainly 20-40.We didn't come across any rude staff, and when our air con unit started dripping the engineer appeared within 5 mins of phoning reception.Even tho the above may sound negative we still had a really good time as all we were after was a week relaxing in the sun which is exactly what we got. I'd definately recommend it if that's all your after.

<Author>CRAZEECAZZA
<Content>a GR8 time at IFA Bavaro - Essex, UK Visit 1 Aug to 14th Aug 2006 Life is what you make it !! - How can u not enjoy your hols - 2 families - with children aged 16,15,14 and 12 - 2 boys  2 girls. I think I speak for us all and say that we had a gr8 vacation at IFA Beach Villas.Rooms We were in the Villas section - which is the furthest away but they were really clean - didnt see a bug in our rooms for the whole 2 weeks. No mozzi bites either - but we did use Aftersun with insect repellent in it which was good. Beds comfortable - Air con fantastically cold - used to have it on really cold while out and turn it up to about 65/70 whilst we slept - which was comfortable - it would have been too cold to sleep - the air-con was that good. Maid service good - clean towels on our return every evening - beds made and room all cleaned with 2 bottles of water in our fridge every day and a flower left by the maid - all for a $1 tip in each room. By the way the walk to the beach - 12 mins stroll ( if u didnt stop at the Capitans Bar for a coffee or the Margarita for a Banana Mumma or a Cuba Libre in the middle pool bar.) The walk was beautiful through palm trees and flowers and a cheery hola and a smile from any staff u met along the way.PoolsThe one nearest us at the villas is the biggest, prettiest and probably the quietest with a lovely Margarita Bar in the middle.Great Banana Mummas, and Bloody Marys. Staff are smiley, sweet and friendly. El Capitan Bar does gr8 coffees and beers and is really relaxing. Middle Pool is livlier - gr8 Cocoloco party and we often stopped off on the way back from the beach in the evening for a last swim and a game of Volleyball with all nationalities in the pool. By the way there weren't many english people when we were there - but it was gr8 to meet people from all over the world - we met some lovely American people and Canadians - italians etc - our boys loved playing Volleyball with them all. Everyone just seemed to wanna have fun. we did a sort of bar crawl from villas to pool to bar to pool and off to the beach and the same on the return.BeachAbsolutely beautiful big, wide pure white sand nestled amongst hundreds of tall palm trees - they dont give much shade from the v hot tropical sun tho!!! The beach goes on for miles in either direction - did go for long walks down the beach and took a bottle of water with us. Entertainment on the beach in the morning - they didnt force u to join in - but it was gr8 fun having Merengue Lessons on the beach and water aerobics in the sea - cant do that in Essex. - hey join in now and again its a gr8 laugh. After a few activites - i got a bottle of water and took off down to a quiter part of the beach laid under a palm tree and read my book. Gr8 snorkelling just off the beach - better if you go out on a boat as lots of speed boats go up and down. Kids got canoes out - which was a bit like hard work - we hired a Hobby Cat out quite a few times for $20 for an hour ($100 deposit) that was great - sailed all the way down the beach. Walked down the beach for about 3 miles on a couple of days - it gets more and more deserted as you go past the AI hotels - its just paradise.WeatherReally hot, fantastic weather - always a breeze on the beach - found it too hot around the pools in the middle of the day - but be careful by the sea - u would never know how much you are burning. We hardly had any rain - one cloudy day but still real hot and a storm one afternoon which lasted about an hour and then the sun came out - liquid sunshine!! -FoodPlenty of it - we didn't get bored - thought the best buffet for breakfast was the one nearest the beach as it was so lovely to sit and look through the Coconut Grove towards the beach and sea and there was a lovely breeze there too. Manuel did wonderful made-to-order Omelettes whilst he sang and danced and smiled (or laughed ) as I tried to order in Espanol!!We tried all 3 Speciality Restaurants - staff were really polite and smiley - we thought the Caribe was the nicest - but they were all good. We did all have a touch of holiday tummy - none of us had to go to our beds - it didnt spoil the day - it only lasted no more than a day - just took a tablet of Immodium and were fine - probably just us adjusting to hot hot sun, lots of cocktails and fizzy drinks maybe a bit of jet-lag and of course a different diet.None of us were sick - there is a chemist on site which seems to sell everything and a 24 hour doctor - but hope u wont need them.By the way we all had ice in our drinks all the time. but we brushed our teeth in bottled water and drunk bottled water at all times. Us adults also had salad - I especially love my salad and ate it all the time.EntertainmentThis was mainly by the Villas Pool which consisted of Bingo early on in the evening - not our cup-of -tea - then fun and games which our kids thought George and his animation team were really funny. L8r they had Dancing Shows - the dancers are really fantastic - this did repeat on our 2nd week tho. We loved the music - and joined in the Club Dance on stage which happened at the end of every night's entertainment - The Latino - which you cant get out of your head - Im still playing it at home - we bought the CD and I just wish we were back there when I listen to it.TripsWe did the Speedboat/snorkelling trip - our boys loved driving the speedboats and the snorkelling was fantastic out on the reef. Our guide took some gr8 fotos of us under the sea whilst we were feeding the fish - lovely tropical coloured fish just eat right out of your fingers. they dont bite tho! Also did Katamaran Party trip - gr8 fun, rum, party and dancing - really funny guy on the boat - such a character.Beach Bar/ Beach DiscoLovely gr8 big bar and restaurant on beach - gr8 fries, lovely fruit and salads - garlic vegetables, burgers, salad snax etc on the beach in the daytime. Gr8 service from Ramone and Francisco - our men tipped them now and again and we were rewarded with great service - every time we looked up over came another beer or cocktail and a gr8 big Dominican Smile for us!!We did go to the Beach Disco on a few nights which didnt start till 11.30 - our 12 year old found it hard to stay up - but it was worth it - gr8 music - just makes u wanna get up and merengue! - how fantasic to dance under the moon and stars surrounded by palm trees and a breeze coming off the sea to cool you. What more could u want! I hope my review helps you - as before we came out I read some bad reviews as well as good which I felt was a bit off-putting but I can honestly say we had a fantastic time - It wasnt 5 star luxury - but we didnt pay for 5 star - it was great value for the 拢 or $ as the case may be.All in all we had a gr8 time - didnt want to go back to the Uk - couldve had another week. but then I always could! I would stay there again - but I feel you can never relive a gr8 time the same again and I like to visit other countries. This is my 4th trip to the Caribbean and I think the Dominicans are among the most friendly.TipWe took about $100 in $1 notes purely to tip them every now and again. I believe if you treat people with the respect they deserve - you get rewarded by their respect for you. Just give em a smile and an hola and hey u get a gr8 big cheery Dominican smile back I guaranteeJust have fun and make the most of this lovely island.

<Content>No, no, no! Do not go here. The food, service and accomodations are the worst of any resort I have visited. Really. I wouldnt bother writing a review if I didnt feel strongly about warning people. Find someplace else, the DR has beautiful scenery and they need tourists for the economy. Just research the resort you choose or use a trusted travel agent youve used before.

<Content>Wonderful holiday, we can't wait to go back. We had one week in August at this resort, and like many others I was very concerned when I read some of the reviews on this site. I am glad to say my worries were completely unfounded. Rooms - We were in the village section and our room was fine, AC worked very well, bathroom was fine, beds a little hard. We had ants one morning but this turned out to be because my husband had spilt a sweet drink over his bag, and this seemed to have attracted them. We asked for someone to come and get rid of them and they did (we also cleaned the bag) and we never saw any more.Food- I was pleasantly suprised with the food, after the negative reviews I pictured sharing the table with a flock of birds at every meal but this was certainly not the case. There was the occasional bird, I think twice during our stay, and the staff did get rid of them. There was plenty of variety, and the standard of food was fine. We also ate at all three of the restaurants which were all nice, in particular the Japanese.Beach - The beach was gorgeous, the sand is lovely and cool, and the sea is nice and warm. It was all kept very clean.Pools - Very nice pools, these were also kept very clean. You did need to get there early if you wanted a bed with shade, but if you are a hard core sunbather and are not bothered about the shade then you will not struggle at any time of day to get a lounger.Heat!! - I completely under-estimated the heat, it was incredibly hot. I now know why most people go earlier in the year. Both my daughter and I got burnt on the beach on day one, quite badly as well, I ended up covered in blisters. This was despite factor 30 sun protection being applied regularly. Please be wanred, it is lovely playing in the sea (especially when all the fish swim around your feet), but it takes no time at all to burn, and you don't realise until it is too late. Staff - All the staff we dealt with were polite and helpful, and they work incredibly hard. I think people just look for things to complain about sometimes, I witnessed people being rude to the staff and then complaining to anyone who would listen, unfortunately I think these are the people that then go and place very negative reviews trying to put others off. Thankfully we were not put off and had a fabulous holiday as a reuslt.

<Content>Excellent hotel for what you pay for My husband and I had to fly to Punta Cana at the last minute and stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and it was great!!! I've stayed at those so called 5 star hotels in punta cana and believe me the 5 stars doesn't compare to this 4 star hotel. Last year we traveled with the kids and stayed at Iberostar Punta Cana, supposedly 5 star, and when I compared the two, IFA is much better. Food is much better at IFA even though I didn't make reservations to the a la carte, I enjoyed the buffet restaurants specially at La Casona that was next to my villa. When you visit another country you want to get out of the ordinary and eat typical dishes from that country. La Casona had Mangu every morning, at lunch and dinner they tried to mix typical dishes with other continental dishes and the desserts were great specially the Flan which was my favorite. I am usually a picky eater, but here I went aboard eating everything--I wish I can bring the Cook with me to NY!!! I didn't experience any slowness in the service for getting my drinks at these restaurants--on the other hand my husband was already wined out for so much wine he had.Rooms' air conditioner was good although the first day was leaking, but got fixed before the night was over. I had a few issues with the hair dryer, but got it repaired and also I was missing the cord on the phone, which also was resolved. The rooms were clean and I never saw bugs.The pools and beaches are beautiful. I am not too crazy about salty water, but here I stayed in for almost an entire day.. The water was warm, crystal waters, clean and most of all WARM. Not like the beaches here in the US that are always cold. Beautiful scenery and spectacular views.Shows and night life were also great! We went to the disco close to the beach almost every night and had a great time. Great gym and spa. Gym is bigger than most hotels and with more equipment.Overall my stay was excellent and is like another person mentioned -- IT IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. Don't give an attitude if you don't want to get an attitude. :o)

<Content>Worst vacation we have Ever taken-Don't Go! I have travelled many times to the Caribbean and Mexico and have never encountered such a bad resort. The service, food, and accommodations were beyond terrible. About a half hour after we arrived, I was literally in tears because I felt so bad for my boyfriend that I had screwed up and chosen this place. I wasn't expecting the 4 Seasons, but come on...Some specifics:1. Upon check-in, we were told our room wasn't ready. OK, no big deal. An employee (I guess?) grabbed my suitcase and started walking away with it. Luckily, I speak enough Spanish to get by, (because NO ONE from beginning to end spoke any English or even made an attempt to be polite when I tried to speak their language.) The employee who was walking away with my suitcase said it would be $5 US for him to watch my bag until our room was ready. (He knew enough English to ask for my money). What reputable resort charges money to watch your bags???? I took my suitcase and walked away.2. While waiting for our room, my boyfriend and I went to the buffet to have some lunch. After a few bites of some kind of rancid meat and chewy vegetable, the tears began. Now, I am not a picky eater by any means. I love to try new things and will eat almost any type of food. THIS WAS INEDIBLE. There were also birds and flies landing on the food all week and no one seemed to notice. I literally ate a roll with butter for dinner on 2 or 3 nights (and the roll was bad).3. Our room- Disgusting. Full-sized sheets on king bed didn't cover mattress. Bitten by ants/flies (?) and was scratching all week. Door to balcony was broken. Holes in towels. Stains on everything. Imagine sleeping on a brick with a scratchy, ripped sheet partially covering it.4. 7 restaurants (???) The web site we used boasted 7 places to eat. There are 2 identical buffets (inedible above), but what they don't tell you is that you need to make reservations at the 3 real restaurants, which are only open for dinner. We had to wait in a long line to speak to the 1 employee who takes these reservations, to be told there were none available for the first 3 nights of our trip. I had to get in line every morning before 9:00 am to get a crack at a spot for the next night. We had 2 semi-edible meals (Japanese and Caribbean) the entire trip. 5. Room not cleaned until almost dinnertime (if at all). No new towels on 2 days. Tile floor stayed sandy  dirty all week.6. Need to pay extra to use the (rusty) safety deposit box!!! Didn't feel our valuables were safe and heard of theft from a couple. We ended up leaving our TV on and putting on the Do Not Disturb sign when we left the room to ease my mind a little.7. After 24 hours my boyfriend asked me if we could call the airline and have our flight moved up so we could leave early. We would rather have eaten McDonald's  been at home.8. Met 1 couple from the US. Most people were European and seemed nasty and rude to Americans. The US couple spent over $100 per meal to eat dinner at a place reachable by boat down the beach. We thought about it but didn't want to waste any more $ on the worst trip of our lives.9. Got 1 bottled water each on first day in room fridge. Had to reuse empty bottle  fill with tap (?) water in dispensers at buffet.10. Bar- Apparently all-inclusive means a 6-ounce plastic cup with warm, flat Dominican beer. No other beers or even cans/ bottles. There was one brand of local rum that made my boyfriend sick ( he can drink). I saw someone get a white wine one night (I had been told there was no wine, even after being nice, speaking Spanish,  tipping). Now, I'm no wine snob, we have a box of wine in our friedge, but this was undrinkable. I threw it out after a sip. 11. Had the runs most of the week (see food above).12. Nothing to do at night (a cheesy show of some kind, all in Spanish, and a disco that was basically a buffet floor after 11 pm). Too dangerous to leave the resort.So...I wish I had been smart enough to read this site before making my decision. It was a stupid call. Never use Jetaway Holidays or go to Villas Bavaro Beach. Would I have gone to the trouble of writing all this if it wasn't that bad??????????

<Content>It was lovely ! My friends and I stayed here from 1st - 15th May 2006. As it was a last minute booking, I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews on here. I had said to my friends that if it really was as bad as people said, I was going to change hotels !! We had abolsultely NO reason to do so, the place is really good. We arrived at the reception via taxi from Punta Cana airport (as we didn't want to wait for the coach with other drop off's before us, it only cost $25 for the 3 of us). We asked for a beach view room but were told that it was near to the disco and would be quite noisy at night - we didn't really believe them as we thought that they we just fobbing us off. Our rooms (we had 1 each) were in the village section and were fantastic, 1 had a view of the gardens and the other a view of the lake with ducks and other birds. They were very clean, with remote controlled tv, mini fridge (stocked daily with water) and a nice bathroom with plenty of towels provided. Our maid arrived around 9am each day, just when we were leaving for breakfast. One friend really didn't believe the guy on reception regarding the beach view rooms and opted to have one - glad I didn't !! We went back to her room one night for a night cap and the noise from the disco was really loud and made the patio window vibrate, nice and loud when we were in there mind ! but when I need sleep I like it to be quiet !The food was good in both the buffet restaurants but the one nearest the reception was the best. At breakfast there was an vast selction of food from toast and pastries to a separate grill chef cooking every which way with eggs. Lunch we either spent at the restaurant on the beach which served burgers, fries and chicken each day but we got a bit feb up with that as the week went on, then we started to get the shuttle bus (to hot and lazy for the 10min walk!) to go to the main restaurants. We went for dinner each evening at around 8pm and had no trouble at all getting a table. We tried the other restaurants too and they were also good, we usually booked them with customer services after breakfast about 2 days in advance and they had no trouble at all meeting our requests.The entertainment was not to my taste but the animation team did their best to arrange something for everyone. The disco was ok but they tended to play alot of salsa music but hey I'm on holiday!! They had numerous activities daily on the beach from dancing lessions, aqua aerobics to vollyball. Something for everyone (but try and get us girls off of our sunloungers).The beach was gorgeous, beautiful white sand and clear warm water, needless to say we spent all of our time there. The people were friendly and couldn't do enough for us, they always had a smile on their faces and made us feel very welcome. We made some great friends and had great times.There is only one thing I didn't like about this place and that was the photographers on the beach with animals, I wish people wouldn't let them take their pictures with them - but that is only my opinion.This place is well worth the price we paid, so much so, we are thinking about going again later this year. A holiday is what you make it, so relax and enjoy !!

<Content>We had a great family holiday We are an Irish Famly and we went on a wonderful holiday to the Dominican Republic April 9th to 24th 2006. We stayed at the IVA Villas, Bavaro Beach, Punta Cana and we were very happy with the village, accommodation, staff and proximity to the stunning beach. We enjoyed the holiday so much that we already want to go back next year. Our only complaint was that while booking this hotel we were told that there were tennis and basketball facilities and that all non-moterized sports were free with our package.My 3 children aged 18, 15 and 13 all love to play tennis. On our second day my children got into their tennis gear and got their racquets and were intending to go to the tennis court by themselves. I decided to go with them to watch them play and find out where the tennis courts were. Lucky I did! The so-called tennis courts were a 15 minute walk from the hotel. On the way we had to pass through a rough area where the builders were making comments to my daughters and when we finally found the courts they were on a totally abandoned piece of land in a dangerous-looking area with rubbish thrown around and the smell of urine. The courts were in a totally abandoned condition and I鈥檓 quite sure nobody had played tennis there for years. There was no sign of a Basketball courtMy children were very disappointed and so I went to complain and to ask if anything could be done as these facilities were specifically mentioned in the brochure. I spoke to my tour representative and she agreed with me that the facilities were bad but that they would be building new courts soon. I said that this was not good enough and that my children were expecting to play tennis every day and I asked if it would be possible to use the facilities at the next door hotel which was also used by our tour operator. She checked and said this was not possible. I then talked to the Hotel management who were equally unhelpful.We did not make a fuss as we were enjoying our holiday. We did try to use the windsurfers and the sailboats which were on our beach but were told that we had to pay for them. We could only use the canoes for free. As windsurfers and sailboats are non-motorized, according to the brochure they should have been free.For anyone travelling to this resort and wanting to use these facilities I suggest you check with your tour opeartor or the hotel directly to see if this situation has changed. The hotel should either take out all references to Tennis Courts, Basketball Courts and Free Non-Motorized Sport from thier brochure or provide these services using the facilities of a sister hotel until such time as new ones are built for the Ocean Village.I would like to stress however that we would go back to the same hotel, it was very good value for money, the facilities provided were clean and if you tipped the staff and practised your Spanish they were friendly. Just dont expect anything to be done in a hurry! We stayed in the villas closest to the stunning beach, which was very handy, but do not ask for these if you have trouble sleeping as the disco is nearby and very loud! We didnt mind this and our teenage girls were thrilled with the proximity of the evening entertainment. Security is very good there.We found the food to be good in general and quite good at the theme restaurants. We were careful with the drinking water and none of us got sick.If you fancy a tour outside the complex, contact Zereida at RH TOURS S.A in the town of Bavaro (Phone 552 1425). She is a lovely lady (she speaks perfect American) who will organise individual tours to where ever you want to go and was very helpful to us in finding our way by local bus to Santo Domingo City (a fab experience! try it)Be adventurous and travel outside the complex. We took the local busses, which cost nothing and are fun, the conductor travels along hanging out of the open doorway and the bus veers all over the road to avoid the potholes! (just like in Ireland!) He holds a huge wad of cash in his hand and shoves three or four into each double seat! That way you get to see the real people and of course the poverty, you need to be careful but we never felt threatened and our kids got an education. Most of the time we were the only white people on the bus. Santo Domingo the city is very run down but interesting, a bit like Havana in Cuba. Our busride there (4 hours) was fun if a bit hair-raising! they drive like lunatics! We saw tobacco fields, cocco plantations, cane sugar plantations and lovely colourful wooden houses along the way and stopped halfway at a roadside hut where everybody got off the bus for 20 minutes and had all sorts of fried stuff to eat! THE BEACH IS STUNNING! Go with a positive attitude and Enjoy it!

<Content>Fantastic ... We Can't Wait To Return ... Ex. Value for the $$$ Excellent value for the money spent. We just returned on Aug 13th 2006 from Punta Cana and the IFA Villas Bavaro resort. Our room (3608) was quite large with a king size bed, color TV w/remote, mini-fridge and a large balcony overlooking one of the 3 pools. The A/C was ice cold and the water pressure was always very good. They had a soap/shampoo/conditioner dispenser in the shower which was great and always full. Yes, you do need to bring your own washcloths (small inconvienence). Maid service was always prompt and we had no shortage of towels. The staff in general was first rate from the front desk and guest services to the many restaurants and bars they we enjoyed throughout the week. It was a short walk (7-8 mins) to the beach or you could take the shuttle bus if you wanted. The water was very clear and beautiful and the white sugar sand beaches just seemed to invite long walks. The food was fabulous at every meal. There were lots of choices and they were all very good. The seafood (Marlin, Snapper, Swordfish, Squid) was some of the best that I have ever eaten anywhere throughout the world. I could go on and on about the overall excellence of this resort and how special we were made to feel, but my advice to you is not to wait too long to visit or more people will have found out how great it is and the ratings will go up and the prices will surely follow. It is currently priced as a budget resort but it deserves a lot better. Don't let your travel agent talk you into spending more $$$ to upgrade your hotel. With the IFA Villas Bavaro it is not necessary. We can't wait to return and we hope that you have as great a vacation as we did. Maybe we will see there on our next trip.

<Content>I would go back again. As others have stated, I was very paranoid about the IFA Villas Bavaro AFTER I booked the trip. It wasn't until then that I came across Tripadvisor and I read a number of negative reviews of the resort. I stayed at IFA between the dates of August 7-11. Here is my review of the trip:Check In Service:When we arrived, There were about 15 people waiting to be checked in but only one person doing the checking in. This was very annoying because they did not have a system so others were being helped out of turn. It took maybe 30 minutes before we received the key to our room.The Room:Upon entering the room, I was very disappointed. There was a dead dried up bug stuck to the wall (it looked as if it had been there all summer). The headboard was attached to the wall but there was a huge space between the board and the mattress. The mattresses themslves looked 20 years old! I Being a germaphobe, I was afraid to sleep on it ( I sprayed lysol all over the bed!) The bathroom looked old, the tubs need to be replaced asap. The one consistent tip that I read about this hotel is the lack of washclothes, they did not lie! It is as if they don't exist there. After I saw the room, I went back to the front desk and asked if i could be changed to a different section of the hotel ( the village) I was told that I would be unable to move for two days because the hotel was booked. It was worth the wait so I did. After the change I was VERY pleased. The new room actually looked like a nice hotel room. No scary bugs or rusted tubs, it was very nice.The Food:There are two buffets on the resort. It wasn't as bad as other reviews. The menu basically stayed they same, but you could always find something to eat. The Service:The service was great. Everyone was polite and nice.The Beach:BEAUTIFUL!! Just be careful when you go to the market. The vendors are VERY aggressive!Conclusion:For $700, this was a very nice trip. It included airfare, hotel, food, and alcohol. I would definately return to the IFA resort, but I will NEVER stay in the VIllas. Only the Village or Ocean Village.

<Content>Great Vacation! We stayed from 7/17/06-7/24/06. As many others have written we were apprehensive about going due to the bad reviews. There were 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 teenagers.First, Do Not take traveler checks. They are very hard to exchange. Also, if you use credit cards they charge you a fee. US dollars are accepted everywhere.Next, the food. We never went hungry and no one got sick. There was always plenty of food to choose from. Remember, their trying to please many different nationalities. However, in the buffet resturaunt near the beach, birds fly in since there is no netting to keep them out. We did see some on the food a few times, but the workers shooed them away. We thought the food was better at the front buffet resturaunt near the lobby. As for the specialty resturaunts , the Mexican was good but it's still served buffet style, early seating is a bad time, it's way to hot! The Japanese we had reservations for but heard that it was not very good so we ended up not going. The Caribe was okay, it is the only air conditioned one and you were served by the staff, they were very friendly. When you get your room number make your reservations for those resturaunts right away. Beware of the milk in the carfe's which they use for the coffee in the am, more than once they poured my coffee then the milk and it was spoiled. The room, We had to wait about 2 hrs for our room since our flight was early. I packed our swim suits and a couple of towels in our carry on, while we waited the kids went swimming. We were in the Villas, the room could have used a little upgrading but I think we spent at the most 1 1/2 hrs a day in the room other than when we slept. We left our maid $2 a day and she always made sure we had plenty of towels and water to brush our teeth with. Our ac always worked. When we arrived in our room there was a broken window in the bathroom. We told our Apple Rep and they fixed it the same day. Once we had no water for a few hours but we were leaving for the pool anyway so it really didn't matter. The water was back on by the time we were getting ready for dinner. It is quite a walk from the villas to the beach but they always had a shuttle bus running. The nightly shows are near the villas and there is a bar over the pool which is nice. Make sure you take wash cloths, they do not give you any.The staff, all in all everyone was pleasant enough, there were a few times when we had to wait at the reception area, it was somewhat disorganized. The most unpleasant person we encountered was the lady who takes the reservations for the resturaunts. The beach, Wonderful. It is beautiful. The only drawback is there are no umbrellas. Invest in one the attaches to the lounge chair and take it with you if you can. We went para-sailing, awesome!I 'd have to say our overall experience was good. We met some wonderful people from the UK and plan to go again next year with them. Remember, it's what you make of it. If you want to find something wrong you will.

<Content>Great Vacation This vacation was a pleasant surprise. After reading the reviews prior to us leaving for this vacation I was a bit apprehensive/nervous. But after a day there I was at ease.We were there for one week at the end of July.The food was good, drinks were good, beach was nice, weather was extremely hot, but that is what we went for, service might have been a bit slow at times, but heck it was hot and very busy - I don't think I could have moved faster then they did. Patience....afterall, you are on vacation. Also, I believe if you treat the staff with respect, you will get respect - I found some of the guests pretty rhude - expecting too much. The only thing I found difficult was the lack of good English speaking staff, but in a way that made things a bit more fun - sorta like playing charades. Rooms could use some updating, but they were clean - and I would rather that then modern and dirty.Overall, for what we paid it was a great vacation - afterall it is rated a 3.5 star resort not a 5. Would I go back? Certainly, for the same price.

<Content>GREAT VACATION Our first,impression once we landed was it was going to be awful. This was a mother-daughter vac. So, it was very important to have activities for each of us. Somethings that we were both able to attend together. The service desk was very busy, but pleasant. Any questions we had the women behing the counter would try her best to answer and to accomodate us. We asked for a room close to the beach, and she right away changed our location. They could defintely improve the service with more employees. Than, we sat and started to ask about the dinner reservations at the rest. That was the hardest blow,a four day wait for a reservation, otherwise we hould have to eat at the buffet rest.I never encountered such a difficult time making reservations for even one rest. The place was getting to me,but it got better. The servers, the rest.manager and the server manager Alejandro, and Elvis were the kidest and nicest to us eaach and everytime we came in. We felt at home and like family. Their hospitality was top notch. Actually, i didn't want to leave anyone out, they were all exceptional. Than when it came to ask questions about some other things, Jasson was so interested in what i had to say. He always had a smile on his face and always so hepful... These people know the meaning of work and customer service. I would highly advice going here, everything was wonderful. The dancers, the shows,the activities, were to our liking..... We want to go back and visit out friends.....

<Content>Above average scenery, accomodations...Below average service Wife  I went 7/17/06-7/21/06 on a good ole' vacation. We are from South Carolina. Beach and blue ocean water are breathtaking. We parasailed and rented little speedboats and drove to a snorkeling pool. Very pleased with water sports. Food was what we expected and we even thought it was a little better than the 5 star resort where we honeymooned 2 years ago. Lodging was a little weak. It reminded us of a mountain chalet with the very high ceilings. Our view was of scaffolds, as the were doing something to the brick wall outside our room. But that was no real bother, we knew we got a deal on this trip and that everyting would not be perfect. My problem was with the service. There are 3 nice restaurants in this resort. We were told we just had to make reservations a day or so in advance. So we decided to be smart and book all at once on the first day...we BARELY got in one of them, never getting to eat in the other two. Said they were just too packed. The little girl working the Guest Services table was down right rude and I finally had to tell her that she should be more personable. Bartenders and waitresses had this weird little attitude that I think had a little bit of LAZY in it. Many times had to ask over and over for a sprite with dinner. Bartenders took their sweet time coming over to get drink order at pool bar and Captain's Bar. They were busy singing and dancing and basically being Joe Cool with each other and other guests that seemed of Latin decent...wouldn't make eye contact, acted like they couldn't understand me in English or Spanish (and my basic Spanish isn't bad at all) just what I consider very uncool. Especially considering that we are paying pretty decent $$$ for this trip!!! Had this uneasy feeling that Americanos were last on the list, so to speak. Spoke with others that rode the bus back to the airport with us that got the same vibe. It was weird. We have always done our tropical vacations in Mexico where you are generally made to feel very welcome and that is why I will spend my money there in the future. Would not recommend DR unless you are just ultra bored with your usual vacation spots. This was resort was considered 3 stars and I didn't realize that pertained to service, as well. Maybe it would be different at a nicer place in the DR???

<Content>Stay away from this place! I'm not one to slam a hotel or resort that I have been to, but this was the worst! I realy want to warn you. No airconditioning, or at least none that worked. We only had the fan on the ceiling that was wobbling and thought it might fall to the floor! We even had no water for half a day. There was some problem. We talked to a couple from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Kentucky and we all told each other of airconditioning problems and other things so we were far from alone by feeling this way. We all also felt like we were discriminated against for being Americans. None of us will be back here. I dont want to knock DR. the beaches are wonderfull and the water nice and warm. We just picked a awful hotel! Sometimes saving a buck realy isnt worth it! As far as all inclusive, ya, if you can get it out of them. We waited several times at the Captins bar to be waited on, once you make eye contact with the waitress, she turns around like she never saw you. My husband and I made a game out of it and gave her a dollar tip everytime she would finaly wait on us, (and there wasnt hardly anyone there) She would come and take our empty glasses and walk away without asking if we wanted anything else. At lunch and dinner, if you wanted a coke or sprite or house wine you had to specificly ask for it, they would never offer the choice, they only wanted to give you water. Water in your rooms was scarce too. They are supposed to supply you with 2 bottles of water a day in your refridgerator and we got only 3 total for the the 5 nights we were there. Oh, and dont bring any US dollars over 10.00 cuz they hate to give you change. Even the loby refused to make change for us from a 20.00 bill. So, if you do choose this place bring lots of 5.00 and 1.00's and maybe some 10.00's. The pools were nice. I only used the one near the villas and theater. We saw one good show put on and the rest were ok. The beach is beautiful and the food at the beach was by far the best. The buffets were ok, we found it hard to find something that we liked, but everyone has different taste. I went to the Mexican resturant and it was ok, but not what I would have expected. When I walked in there it was like an oven, hotter in there than outside! had choice of rices, salads and chicken tacos, fajitias and quesidias which by the way were all made the same, so who could tell! Very hard to get reservations. They wanted to give me 9pm reservations at one resturant, does any body realy eat that late?? Not me. Guess I should have held out some US dollars to get something decent cuz we found that by tipping at the buffets and the bars, you will get waited on and not ignored. We went snorkeling one day, it was a blast. On the Kontiki party boat. They picked us up from our hotel and spend a good part of the day snorkeling, drinking, dancing. We also went to the Maniti Park, it was ok, it was a day away from our hotel! I swam with the dolphins. They picked you up at your hotel too, on this open sided bus with music, the ride was fun too.Oh,one more thing, we had some little ants in our room which we could have lived with, until they started bitting the heck out of our bodies. We wouldnt know they were there till we felt a pinch then we found them and killed them. I just hope I didnt bring too many home in my luggage. That's all we'd need!

<Content>July 10th - 24th Nice place - but be careful with the food! Reception: On arrival, after a 14 hour journey (door to door) all you want to do is, book in, dump your stuff and jump in the pool. Well throughout the two weeks we were there we tried to avoid reception as they were a joke. 45 mins waiting to book in! 45 mins to get a hotel safe key!. They just seemed to ignore you! ask what you want and then go and serve someone else鈥?enough said!!The room:We were in the Villas, room 1109. The rooms were OK. The bath had seen better days (rusty) but we only showered so it didn鈥檛 bother us too much. It was clean, no bugs and the air con worked. The walk to the beech was nice and didn鈥檛 take to long, the grounds are well maintained and very pleasant. The villas were located near the best pool, the Margareta Bar, El Capitan鈥檚 Bar and the themed restaurants.The buffet restaurants:Well, what can I say! My wife and I were both sick after the first week and are still ill now!! (nearly two weeks later). My son fortunately stuck to chips, pancakes and pineapple for the two weeks although he did get an ear infection! The food was constantly covered in flies and the birds may as well have there own table 飦? Nearly everyone we spoke to had suffered one way or another. My wife and I were very selective about what we ait and were aware of the hygiene risks but we still got ill 鈥?so be very careful!! The menu was quite repetitive. The most enjoyable meals were at the beech bar where the burgers are cooked in front of you. My son had these every day and did not get ill. The themed restaurants:We had to book these 4 days in advance!! (A lot of people must have booked and didn鈥檛 turn up as they always seemed to be empty when we were there) Not really fair if your only there for a long weekend like many of the Americans. Mexican and Japanese were OK but didn鈥檛 like the Caribbean as I think this is where I might have got my bug!!Excursions:Booked Saona Island with Airtours rep Felix, was a great day out and what a beautiful Island! Highly recommended!! Booked Speed boats and snorkelling with Seaworld on the beech (in front of stalls) with Dominguez. We went twice it was that good! thanks to Nelson and Miguel. Paid $40 per person. When I told Felix 鈥?he went ballistic, I then had a standing argument with him as he wanted me to book with him @ $68 per person. What a nerve, what a knob!! Shop around there are some good deals. Also paid $95 to swim with Dolphins. It was OK you get about 20 mins in a group of about 20 (I think it鈥檚 a lot dearer in Florida). Went Marlin fishing 鈥?Don鈥檛 go if you get sea sick!!The Beech:Beautiful, probably a bit too much going on but still very nice.Nationalities:I know you get good and bad everywhere but some French nationals really let the side down. No consideration or respect of others in and around the pool and why is it only the French have to smoke in the pool and smoke at the buffet bar when getting there food!! Would I go again?I had a great time, like everyone else, its what you make it. But I wouldn鈥檛 stay at this hotel. Pay the extra and stay at a hotel where you can eat safely and not get ill! The Dominican is nice and so are the people.

<Content>IFA: (Incredibly False Advertisement) We thought we got a good deal when we got an All Inclusive package to this resort and only paid $545 per/person for 5days/4 nights. The package included, food  drinks, airfare, tips and taxes but what they forgot to include was CUSTOMER SERVICE, but thats just the start of it all.Food  Drinks? The food was edible if you dont mind flies and crows flying all over your plate and all over the buffet table. Drinks? If your lucky enough to get someone to come over to you or even acknowledge your presence, please be sure to order 3-4 drinks at a time, because you will be waiting 20-30 minutes between each drink. The swim up bar? It has a bar, but no liquor and no bartender. You can probably get can drink in the desert easier than you would at this resort.Rooms? The couple rooms (the rooms with the King size beds, fyi: #'s start with 10) are on the other side of the resort. The walk from your room to the beach was about 10- 15 minute walk in 100 degree weather. But the room itself, it was in OK condition, not impressive at all. The sheets dont get changed, the towel wrack (in our bathroom) was hangin off the wall, but then again maintence does not leave you any wash cloths (so pack your own!). If you do happen to go to IFA, before you settle in make sure your Air Conditioning is working. Two of our friends did NOT have A/C for 2 nights, complained to Front desk (for 2 full days) but got no service. It wasnt until they threatened to leave that there room was changed. The bottled water in the fridge is not new, they refill the bottles (with God only hope filtered water) but I highly doubt it since most of us got sick.Secuirty of your goods? Renting the safe ($3 a day), is definitely worth the money here. How is that of one of our friends lost his Ipod and phone charger, after he had the Do Not Disturb sign at the door the whole time we were there? Reservations at the Caribbean, Japenese  Mexican restaurant? In one word? Impossible. We tried to make reservations the day we got there and they were all booked. How do you offer a service and then not give everyone a fair chance at it.All in all, we would have been willing to over look, all these details, if the Customer Service was even close to decent, we did only pay $525 per person. However, maybe we are wrong, but we still expected some kind of customer service. If somebody would had even showed a sign that they cared, maybe our experience would have been at least average. But the bottom line is that anyone that we dealt with, treated us like we were bothering them and that they simply did not care. So in my opnion, save your money and go somewhere else, because the highlight of our trip was coming home.

<Content>OK but pay the extra for a better hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at the IFA for one week 13th July - 21st July. I am glad it was only a week as it did become a bit boring eating the same food and the entertainment was poor - v cheesy! We stayed in the Ocean section which did look a lot nicer than the villas section. The rooms were ok, but the bath was past its best and the fridge had rust marks which does not give a good first impression. The bed was comfy and the air con worked fine. No bugs in the room, just a small lizzard which my boyfriend said if i catch he would give me 拢20 (I caught it and I'm still waiting for the payout!)The pool by the villas is better. The pool by the ocean block looked like it needed a good clean. Someone stole our hotel beach towel so be warned or you will have to pay the $20 for each towel. The water aerobics was good fun.The staff are very slow and don't seem to comprehend the concept of next in the queue as many times I was next but the bar staff proceeded to serve another guest! Getting a drink in the buffet restaurant was hard work! So slow, so by the time you finished your meal, the drink stil hadn't arrived. We tried to book for the Japanese but it was full Book any reservations for the restaurants on your first day or you won't get in for the duration of your stay. We tried to book the Japanese after the lady doing the reservations made a mistake with the restaurant we wanted, but she refused to amend our booking to the Japanese, saying it was full and there was nothing she could do! V unhelpful.We didn't get upset stomachs, which was surprising as there were so many flies and birds on the food. The staff did not attempt to shoo away the birds. The buffets were surprisingly ok, but the same food day in and day out did become tedious. The pasta chef was good and it was nice to see something fresh cooked in front of you. I wore insect repellant and only got one bite. My boyfriend did not bother with the spray and did not get any! The table tennis ball was broken from the day we got there unitl the day we left, and the staff had no interest in replacing it. The grounds were lovely and the beach was nice too, although we stayed mostly at the pool as there were no parasols on the beach. They keep the public toliets execptionally clean and fresh smelling.All in all, it was good value for money but i recommend spending the extra and going for a 5* resort.

<Content>Good resort. Great Beach. Great Holiday. (It's what you make it!) We stayed for 2 weeks at IFA and we had a ball. My wife and I brought my wife's younger brother and sister with us. We stayed in the Villas and I was apprehensive having read some bad reviews of the vills. We stayed in 1139 at the villas and were well up at the back of the complex. It suited us fine as our nearest pool was the best pool in the complex with the margarita bar over it, and the el-captain bar beside it. The island itself is pretty big and the population generally live in poverty. Holiday resorts are first world pockets in a third world country. They are a proud and clean people though. I timed the walk from the beach to our villa and it was 8 minutes at a leisurly pace. There is a little bus that drives you around the complex but the walk is very pleasant through well tended gardens and absolutley safe.  Security is strong throughout the resorts in the Dominican Republic. We saw a security guard on the beach late one night who was armed. One night I couldn't sleep as a large electrical storm swept through and I watched the guards walk aropund the complex all night. I felt assured of my safety but concerned that the need for that security existed.  THE STAFF. Generally very pleasant. As this was a spanish speaking Island, I tried to learn some phrases which appeared to be appreciated by the staff. We left a dollar tip for our maid every day which is a good idea. Our room was generally sorted by mid afternoon and when we needed towels we got them. The reception staff seemed to be stressed at times, particularly when a large group of people were checking in or out. Customer service was very good and from here we booked our resteraunts (discussed Later). THE ROOM. The room was large and airy. Nice big variable speed fan in the centre of the room and great airconditioning. Ours was leaking badly when we arrived but within ten minutes a maintenance man had fixed the problem. TV is ok, a few channels we could understand but I didn't go to watch TV. Working fridge in the rooms. If you buy water anywhere, keep your bottles and fill them up at night from the bars or resteraunts. DO NOT use the tap water for brushing your teeth. Don't even let the shower water get in your mouth. We were very strict about this and none of us was sick. Bathrooms in the villa's could do with a big make over but again I'm not spending my holiday time in the bathroom (Hopefully)! Very few bugs. In our 2 week stay we had one cockroach in the bathroom which was easily dealt with. Don't leave your door open or to long as there are oportunist frogs and geckos, again easy dealt with. Throw a sheet over them and take them back out. No ants in the room but we kept the food in the rrom in the fridge.  THE FOOD. The food was alright. You could always find something to eat. They could vary the food a bit more but I always ate well. Service can be a little slow but there are so many people eating these buffets it must be hard to keep up.  We tried the Japanese resteraunt, It was alright. Wouldn't have gone back to it. We tried the Mexican resteraunt, it was alright. Wouldn't have gone back to it.  We didn't get to try the carribean resteraunt unfortunatley.Try them for yourself. If you don't like them go to the buffet and eat instead.  Watch the drinks, they are very generous and not watered down. It can sneak up on you and it's not to pleasant in that heat! THE BEACH Wow! Fantastic! Lovely palm tree beach. We walked up and down the beach past several other resorts and ours was by far the cleanest. Staff are out every morning lefting in the seaweed brought in. The resort staff try the best at entertaining on the beach through the day but if it's not your scene there is loads to do anyway. There are markets (discussed later). fishing tours, parascending, speedboats, a massive water slide, the list goes on and on. Bring your sun cream with you. It's very dear to buy and we used a lot of it. You can get burnt very easily on the beach without realising. Be aware that there are a lot of topless women at this resort beach and pool. THE POOL. We loved our pool at the villa's. Seemed to be the largest, deepest and often the most quiet. Went through quite a lot of inflatable balls as the shrubs around the pool are all thorny. At 7am the staff are out washing down the pool area and all the sunloungers which were all in working order. We had some money stole on our last day there. We suspect it was taken from our bag when we at the pool. Thankfully it wasn't much and at the end of our trip but it was very annoying. At this pool is the stage area for the evening entertainment. THE ENTERTAINMENT. Not the best but the do try very hard. Bingo is not my cup of tea! Lots of dancing extravaganzas and a stand up show once a week. The stand up show was simple, funny and somewhat adult orientated.  THE REPS. They are all around the reception area in the mornings. Our Rep was pleasant enough and contactable 24hrs a day but not very impressed when he knew we had bought excusions from another rep. He spoke his mind I respect that in a person but i also know he was annoyed because he lost out on the deal. Shop around and get the best deal. The two reps that we would recommend are Felix from MyTravel and Emmanuel from HotelBeds. Best to make you own mind up. THE BEACH MARKETS. These are good craic if you fancy haggling! Everybody is your friend, you can feel the love in this place (for your money)! These guys are kings at haggling and they know how to rip you off big time. If they make you an offer, counter it with at least half the price. They will haggle but stick to your guns. If they won't give in tell them you will look around and maybe call back later. They usually call you back and give in to your price. The guys selling rum will often share a drink with you to get in your good books. Fun but you can get cheap rum on some of the excusions. The jewelry is probably fake. They will give you a free necklace but we took them off a soon as we could because it probaly told the other market sellers that we were mugs! Go forth and Haggle! THE EXCURSIONS. We did a lot of excursions. We booked the speedboats on the beach. Four of got into a speed boat and our guides took another speed boat. We raked about in the sea which was great fun and they tied the boats up at a bouy and we snorkelled. The little sister was pretty scared but the guide held her hand throughout and the fish were just amazing. They would eat bread straight out of your hands! We went horseback riding for two hours (required six hours resting in pool before sitting down again!), at the ELPat Ranch. I thought my horse looked like it was about to die and we didn't really see eye to eye, so they gave me another one. We had a much better understanding, it went were it wanted and I hung on! Good fun but the hour riding would have been enough. We went on the dune buggy adventure which was great fun. Bring spare clothes with you cos you do get muddy. We stopped at a Dominican farm and drunk their coffee (Fantastic). The excursion lasted half a day but do be careful on the roads. There was an Italian couple who loved to swerve about despite being told not to by the guides. They very, very nearly swerved out infront of a bus that was overtaking them. The bus drivers reaction saved them.  We went to Saona Island which was to be an amazing desert island experience. It was a two hour coach ride stopping at a nice place where Apocolypse Now and Rambo II were filmed. then we got speed boats out to the island stopping a pools in the sea where it was waist deep and you could swim. On to the island which was abig let down. It was comercialised and tacky. We got a catamaran on the wasy back and as the sun was out we sat on the netting at the front to do some sun bathing. Nice...... Until the tropical storm hit us! The rain came down sideways and there was lighning around us. Being on a metal boat in the sea with lighting is not my idea of heaven. We all were shivering with the cold when we got back to the bus for our two hour journey home. Didn't like that excursion.  Deep sea fishing was an experience. We went about 11 miles out and i was so glad we took anti sickness tablets before we left cos once we got out past the reef it was 9 foot swells all the way. Four hours of being bobbed up and down, watching some others be violently ill over the side and we didn't catch a thing (well, 1 fish caught by an american who grabbed the rod every time something took a bite and didn't understand the concept of sharing!). Best excursion we did was called the Jurassic Safari. It was fantastic. I learnt more about the Domincan People and life in that one day than I learnt in the whole 2 weeks. They are a charity helping to raise money for the schools and some of the local families. These families allow you to see how they live as part of the trip. We drove up into the mountains and got on hoses again which were much healthier than the first. The forse riding is optional and lasts about 25 mins. On up into the mountains to their safari park and river where you can swim. Big buffet lunch and back down to see a 'safe' demonstration of the second most popular national sport....Cock fighting. (Didn't like that bit but I respect their culture and ways). We bought cheap rum on the way back home. $9 a bottle for 151 proof rum. Our guide was called Monchy and was very informative an entertaining. He workd 12 hour days, 24 in a row to get 6 days off!Did I enjoy my holiday? Absolutley. A holiday is what you make it. I listened to people who hated their trip and I felt that they would be hard people to please generally. If you want to moan you can always find something to moan about. If you want to have fun, it's there to be had!Would I go back? No, not to the Dominican Republic because I like to see different places and cultures. Not because I didn't like the island or the resort.Would I stay at an IFA resort again? Yes I would. Go Have fun and make up your own mind. Remember people love to complain but don't like to praise. A little praise goes a long way and is much more pleasurable.

<Content>just ok, but resort is beautiful when we arrivedat 10:30 they wouldnt let us check in until 3pm.we sat there sweatingwith no bathing with nothing to do.we were lucky if we got more than 1 bath towel. they do not supply any wash cloths.the service was really bad in the buffet resturants. it took 10 min. to get a coke.we only did one excursion. we paid $95 and went to dolphin island. the guy there i booked it through said this one was better than manita park. the only thing we did was swim to the middle w/them and pet them. that was it. i was only in the water for 20-25 min. is not worth it.the resort itself is beautiful. it is lined in palm trees. i would go back to punta cana again, just not to this resort. other people we talked to stayed at differnt ones, said there service was great.

<Content>beautiful but food made us sick The resort was 3 star the beach was wonderful we had shade or sun and beach chairs the beach is huge.we were in the 3700 bock of rooms good location not too close to disco it runs 1130- 3am a short walk to eat or play . The bed was hard and the food was not very good infact we both came home sick and are still haveing issuse 4 days later .  The food has many options my husband like the beach hut food.We did get reservation right after we checked in for the caribbian restuarant and the mexican I like both . the only one NOT buffe style caribbian. Over all the language barrier is easy enough to over come using pointing skills .

<Content>Had a great time despite the flaws! Never having stayed in an all-inclusive resort, I didn't know what to expect. Having read the very mixed reviews for this hotel, I was nervous about our trip to this hotel.The reviews that I read were very accurate and helpful, so if you need information, read them. My family of 5 was placed in two rooms in the Villas section(1095, 1089) of the resort which I was not thrilled about after reading some of the reviews, but we were told that the other sections of the hotel were booked and we would have to come back in order to change rooms.(I did end up checking out a room in the middle of the resort on Tuesday, it was nicer, but by then my family had settled into our rooms and was happy with them.) The room itself was adequate but needed work. A new tub/shower unit, mattresses/bed frame, and pillows(which we later referred to as the cotton ball pillows) would make quite a difference in the room. Otherwise it was very clean. Our A/C worked infrequently but was adequate, in my husband's room his A/C worked great. The Villas are very cute. Each 1story building had 10 rooms in it. The rooms have a front porch with chairs. The pathway to the Villas, I felt, gave the place some charm. The grounds were well groomed and had beautiful trees and plants everywhere. The pool by the Villas was the best of the three pools. It was the deepest and had a bar in it. The Villas were also close to the 3 a-la-carte restaurants which you should try each at least once(*You must reserve in advance, so do it your first day there!). They are also close to the nightly shows that are put on by the very busy animation team.  The food at the buffets was good. Our favorite meal was breakfast because you could have an omelette made to order. At the buffets there was always plenty to choose from, however, the food was repeated, but plentiful, how could you complain?! You could be as busy as you liked or as relaxed as you wanted to be. There were many activities offered daliy. The beach is gorgeous!!! There is plenty to do. We snorkeled, borrowing the equipment for one hour and leaving a deposit of $30 per person. We saw some fish and plants near the back part of the roped in swimming area. We didn't use the other equipment available. We went on the 1/2 day excursion to the Marinarium which involved snorkeling with nurse sharks and rays. It was very nice. *Bring plenty of sunscreen; we went through a bottle by mid-week. *Do not drink or brush your teeth with the tap water. There is filtered water available at the bars and restuarants to drink. The room refridgerator had 2 bottles of water in it, also which you can ask to have replaced. *Bring Imodium and tums for stomach/digestion issues. *If you like to snack between meals, bring your own, a can of Pringle chips cost $4 at the hotel store. *Learn some Spanish, bring a dictionary, and at least try to speak their language. It makes things a lot easier. *Some women are topless at the pools and on the beach(more so here), so if this kind of thing makes you uncomfortable, be aware.****Have fun, relax, and forget about the little things; enjoy your vacation!!!!! If you book with Apple Vacations read on.... After booking our trip a few months in advance the price of the trip came down as the trip date approached. We had been asked to purchase the ADVOC insurance at $70.00 per person($350 for my family) so we didn't purchase it because we felt that it was too costly with very little return value. We were mistaken because we did not realize that the discounted price only worked when you purchased insurance. Just F.Y.I if needed.

<Content>ok The Ifa Villas is made up of 3 hotels, all in one 'complex' using the same facilities. what it doesnt tell you in the brochures is that it is in the middle of a private residential area, so when you enter the main gates dont be suprised to see lots of houses all multi coloured. Check-in was slow as the people at reception hardly spoke english. When we did get our key, we were taken to our room which was 4133 near to the beach. It was a lovely room with a king size bed and nice view. we were lucky as others had a view of some buliding work going on- not major, just building a wall round the complex. we had not 1 bug or lizard in our room, nor any problems with the air con. The only thing was that the patio door did not lock, which is a bit worrying as you could climb from the main staircase onto our balcony. We were a 2 minute walk from the beach, which was absolutly fantastic. The waters were warm and fish swam right up the shore all multi-coloured and different shapes. Brilliant for snorkelling. The walk to the beach is not bad as some people make out. Yes you walk down a path, but its nice and you can find all the cocunuts on the floor. The food- Well the buffet was suprisingly really good. There were different things nearly every night, and the was a pasta dish chef, kebab/mussels/burgers chef. On a morning there was on omlet chef and a girl that made fresh milkshakes, like pineapple and melon. The waiters were VERY slow, if you asked them for a drink, you would not get it unless you kept on asking. There was a young man who was very quick so we gave him a tip and he looked after us from then on.The mexican restaurnat was fantastic. NOT spicy unless you choose spicy things.The japonise was nice- the teriaki chicken was gorgeous.The caribbean was the best. The steak was to die for. The room was air-conditioned and really nice. Well worth waiting for as you have to book theses restauants in advance and they do book up quick. There was not a lot of entertainment unless you like everything in foreign.no-one spoke good english, and so on a night we were drawn to the ping pong table in the old gym. But someone smashed the ball, and when we kept on asking for a new one, we kept getting the reply- on vancation!Not many english there at all, we were a bit shocked and dissapointed at first. Not a lot to do for kids, other than swim in the pools and use the internet.We did 2 trips, quad biking and catalina island. Quad BIking was good. They took us to a gorgeous beach with green and blue waters, but the Catalina Island was absolutly fantastic and definetly worth visiting. You book it on the beach were you get the banana boat etc, and its 85 dollars pp. leave at 7, 2hr bus journey to the boat, then 20mins to the island. They let you snorkell in the sea off the island, and it was fantastic, the reefs were amazing. Then you go onto the isalnd and can sunbathe, snorkell again, or shop at the shops.they provide a buffet luch and you are on the island for about 3hrs. The island is a protected nature reserve and so no-one lives on the island.Overall we are glad we went to the ifa villas but we were very bored by the end of the 2 weeks. we would go back to the dominican but not this hotel.

<Content>I won't go back ! The food was terrible ! They probably serve better food in Guantanimo Prison. Birds sat on the food trays on the buffet and the waiters never even tried to shoo them away .The meat was unchewable, breads were moldy. We all got sick stomachs. When we tried to make reservations at the other restaurants, we were told they were booked. but when we walked by them later, we looked inside and they had many empty tables. So we were relegated to eat with the birds at the two buffets all week. We were lucky enough to get a newer building(3700). They stuck most of the other Americans in the 1000 buildings, far away from the beach. They had many complaints about thier rooms, leaking toilets, water stopping mid shower, bugs, etc... The beach.... well , for one, the resort is not directly on the beach. you have to walk a sandy path or take a shuttle from the lobby. It had boats moored everywhere, and the water smelled of diesel fuel.and there were no sun shades on the beach. The pools were so-so , and if you were lucky enough to get a chaise lounge, you had to watch out for the Frenchies from tossing your towels and bags on the ground and stealing your chairs. Thats another thing all together, they are rude, crude, and you grow tired of them so fast. If the Dominican Republic wants American tourists, it needs to become more American friendly. Maybe a start would be to place more reps in the resorts, and Airports that speak English. We won't be back to Punta Cana. This was our third trip to Punta Cana , and our third different resort. They all seem to be the same.

<Content>A great resort, depending on what you want... My boyfriend and I, both 30 and professional, were seeking a quiet, romantic, beach paradise vacation to relax. We booked through Apple Vacations, and didn't have any problems with their services. I decided that we may want to do all inclusive to make things easier. We were not really happy being so stuck with the way things work with an all inclusive package, but some people may really like it. We realized afterwards how much more we would have liked to eat where we wanted or go where we wanted without having to pay extra for very expensive excursions or wait in long lines to make dinner reservations at one of the hotel's three restaurants. IFA has a large buffet (food isn't the greatest, but we always found something to eat) and they have 3 restaurants you have to make reservations to eat in usually 4 nights in advance! If you can, try to get as many nights as possible in the Carribean Restaurant-they have an amazing filet (Japanese and Mexican were so-so but better than the buffet). Regardless, we had never heard of Punta Cana before researching it on the internet and it looked beautiful from pictures. It is beautiful with blue green water, but some beaches were more beautiful and well-kept than others (we actually went to the beach next to us several mornings b/c it was nicer and bigger). Off the beach resorts, the local area is very poor and sad to see, especially when we come in with so much money compared. One thing that pleasantly surprised us was the grounds of the IFA hotel. It is a really beautiful place with 3 beautiful pools and a lot of trees/plant life. We had the chance to see another hotel next door (a 5 star) and yes, it was a bit nicer in areas, but we didn't really see much difference except price. There are people from all over the globe (German, French, Puerto Rican) staying at IFA and most workers spoke only Spanish. We brought our dictionary and that helped a ton to communicate with the staff. The nightly entertainment is not something to write home about. The staff tried hard and they are a very friendly group of young adults putting out a great deal of effort to entertain a large, diverse audience. 2 nights of that was enough for us. Also, very important at least during the time of season we went (mid June), bring bugspray!! We got many bites even with bugspay. Also, bring anything you may need. I needed glide dental floss b/c I got something stuck in my tooth (and only brought the cheap kind with me) and it was $12 US dollars!! Whoa! Also, know that the beaches and pool areas have many topless women of all ages and sizes, so if you are bringing little kids, make sure both you and them are aware (especially the American travelers!) All in all, we had a nice time, the weather was beautiful, and with 50 sunblock, we didn't burn, but got a great tan!

<Content>could be a lot better! well my family just got back from this resort. the resort it self is great, pools, beach, things to do all the time. the only issue is the rooms. when we got there we didnt have any water!...then when we did it was very little and it was very cold. the room had not light, extremely dim. the air conditioning was good. the beds were horrible and the pillows had to have been from 50 years ago...this is no exageration...come on, this place could at least invest in some pillows. any american looking to go hear i would highly advise not to stay in the villas. though this resort caters to all europeans and spanish people. talk about racism...thats them. the village we hear is very nice, closer to the beach and the swim up bar. that is were they put off them. they only give it to americans who have to complain everyday..we finally got offered to stay in the village our last day, that was after 5 days of complaining. the resort is seperated...villas go to americans...which are the worst ones to stay in, village to the spanish and the hotels part to the eurpoeans. If the room get way more updated and if they are changed this resort could be a 5 star. the rooms are what make it a 3 1/2 star. the food was ok...dont go to the mexican, its very hott in there, so hott that u cant enjoy ur food. the japanesse was very good, loved it. the buffets were ok...a lot of food to choose from but its different food that many would not want to try. we couldnt get in to the carib rest. we tried to book it our first day and they said they didnt have any opening until we left. we paid a lot of money to stay and they denied us to eat somewhere where we paid. they need to be more organized. the service was good. most of the employees are very friendly...always saying how and willing to help..hector the main guy helped us out a lot. the vacation was more stress than any i had ever been on, if it wasnt for the beach and the beautiful resort we would have left the first day.

<Content>For budget travelers only.... This resort is definitely for the budget traveler. Very few activitiies included in the all-inclusive. Yes, snorkeling is available free of charge but you can only snorkel in the roped off swimming areas. Free non-motorized sports activities...not sure what those were?!?! The one paddle boat at the resort looked like it had been stuck in the sand since the resort was built. Everything you do, you have to pay extra for unless you just prefer to lie on the beach or stay at the pool. Guests are told not to use the pool or beach after 7:30 because of heath risks. The resort adds chlorine to the water after that time. No game room or games to play except for Bocce ball. No darts, pool tables, or shuffle boards. As far as the food, my best advice would be to take plenty of your favorite snacks. My husband and I are not picky eaters but we struggled to find something appetizing every day. I was craving McDonalds by the time we left...didn't think I would ever say that lol. You pretty much have to plan your activities around the times food is served and there are no snacks. There are basically three main places to eat other than the a'la cart restaurants...the two buffets and the grill at the beach. One of the two buffets does not open for lunch and both buffet restaurants serve the same food so if you don't like what is served at one, it will do no good to walk to the other restaurant. The menus vary each day but very little. I survived mostly off of salads and bread. Both buffets have great breakfast. I had read that you had to stand in line to make reservations for the a'la cart restaurants. Not true...go to guest services in the lobby at any time and schedule all three at once. We ate at the mexican and Japanese. The mexican was not edible to us but the Japanese was good. We looked at the menu for the international and decided against making reservations. You cannot find anything to eat at the resort between 3:30 and 6, or after about 10. I didn't particularly care for the grill food at the beach but they have pretty good fries if they are hot. A lot of pork and beef were served but both were tough. Both my husband and I had mild stomach upset on and off all week. Be sure to take Pepto Bismol tablets. I read that advice before I left, and it really helped me. My husband, on the other hand, was determined to tough it out and he had a much harder time. We booked our travel through Vacation Express and wasn't given the option to book excursions at time of booking. We went snorkeling by the reef one day but we purchased that on the beach. The trip was much cheaper than what was offered by our tour rep. I would definitely recommend shopping around when you get to the resort. Be sure to take plenty of cash. Most places do not take credit cards and the ones that do tack on a hefty surcharge.When we booked our trip, we were mislead by the fact that there were three resorts. There are three AREAS of the one resort. We stayed in the Ocean Village section which was pretty close to the beach (within five mins.) This is not very far but after a few days you will get tired of the walk. The resort is very large so a good bit of walking is involved. The villas are much further away and you will have to take a trolley to get to the beach. They was some construction on a new spa/weight room near our room. It should be finished by the time you go as they were almost finished last week. There was no construction noise but we were awakened every morning by a large dog barking. I guess the dog was across the street from the resort. The annoyance was very small though.As far as bugs in the rooms, we did find one small roach but he probably came in from the outside or the hallway. There is a small gap beneath the door that he could have come through. The rooms were nice but not swept which is kinda gross if you walk bare-footed in the room. The floors of the room are tile which is nice but do need to be swept. If you do not speak spanish, I recommend taking a English/Spanish language conversion book because we had a very hard time communicating with staff in general. Very little English is spoken and it is frustrating for both parties. The resort will give you a towel card upon arrival. Be sure to guard your towels because you have to return the towels to get back your cards. If you don't, there is a $20 charge. We left ours in our bathroom one day and after housekeeping came, one disappeared. The beach towels are blue so could not have been taken by mistake. We reported it but the gentleman I spoke with insisted it must have blown away. He did not understand that the towels were in the bathroom, not balcony. He said it would be handled but nothing was ever done. We luckily found an extra by the pool. Also, room towels were picked up early in the morning and they were not brought back until late in the afternoon so you may want to bring extras or use your beach towels. You only get one towel and one hand towel per person. One morning, housekeeping took ours and my husband told the maid we needed them to shower. She said more in five minutes. We got them around 6 that night. You may want to try to iron your clothes before you go if possible. Irons are available but must be limited. We had to request one three times before it was delivered. We were told we could only use it one hour so I busted my butt trying to finish ironing everything so I would not have to request the iron again. The iron was still in the room six hours later. There are very few people there from the U.S. and most do not speak English. I was actually surprised by the overall rudeness in general from others. I thought it was just us, but I have noticed others on this forum complaining as well. For example, if a large group was walking down the sidewalk, they would not move to one side. This happened repeatedly. Also, we were looked over several times by the bartenders that would wait on people that were tipping heavily. We noticed frustration from other people waiting for drinks as well and some would just walk off. This is supposed to be all-inclusive and the bar is the only area to get any kind of drinks including soft drinks. I think tipping is important but not EVERY time you go to the bar. Also, the last morning we were there, there was a line at the omelet station and we had been waiting patiently and a lady walked right up to the front of the line and skipped everyone. The chef proceeded to take her order without even noticing what she had done. By that point I had reached boiling point and told him she was supposed to be a the END of the line. She did not even acknowledge the fact of what she had done. The main pool is busy with kids. There is no supervision. We saw young kids climbing up the rocks in the center of the pool and pushing each other and jumping off. We kept thinking that was an accident and lawsuit waiting to happen. We saw kids playing with emergency life preservers and wondered, Where are the parents? Later, we saw the parents playing on them. Go figure?!?! One day we saw two kids approximately 10 years old fighting in the pool. One had another in a head-lock and was pounding his face with his fist. Resort guests had to break them up...not sure where the parents were. Also, I hope you don't mind women topless. This was at all the pools and the beach. I would not feel comfortable taking my kids there. But then again, that's my personal preference....it may not bother others. Overall, we would not go back to this resort. The grounds and beach are beautiful but I would think you could get that from most resorts in Punta Cana.

<Content>Loved This Place, But things to know This Hotel, and resort were amazing!!! At first leaving the country for the first time we (my friends and i were scared) This resort is nothing to be scared of. They are all very friendly people and will make sure nothing will happen to you. Even though my friends air was broken in the one room and the next morning had a water fall the man came out and fixed it right away. The only only thing that you should know down their is that you will want extra money to do different activities that are not included such as the excursions. WEATHER is soooo beautiful. It was amazing walking to the beach on a very hotttt day and the sand was still cool. The food their messed with our stomachs for the first couple of days, but you just have to adjust, and it was still good 9exspecially pasta). This is a place i would love to go again, but maybe stay at a different resort, although feel so safe and secure makes me only want to travel here. Their is so much to see and when we finally got around to seeing the whole resort it is very!!! BIG!!!. Everwhere you walk is pool, bar, pool, bar....FOOD! it was great!I wont spoil all the news, because then it wont be fun for you, i thought figuring it out our own was fun. O bring a spanish book if you only know little spanish, we forgot ours and although it was frusterating, it was just fun going back and forth. You'll HAVE TO GO to SEE! HAVE FUN were sun block and since i was told over and over and over i need to say it DONT DRINK THE WATER.... but dont worry they have bottled water, and the water they serve and the food is all purified water. BOOK IT! YOULL HAVE THE BEST TIME AND MEMORIES!!!!!

<Content>great value great value, the hotel was somewhat simple and the food was plentiful. the beach was gorgeous and the pools were all very nice. people were friendly but with the exception of a few service workers none were able to communicate in English. I got the feeling that Americans were not appreciated as they catered more to the Europeans. However we did meet several American couples and we all seemed to have a good time. I will say the cusomer service rep in the Lobby (Jasson) was very helpful and more than friendly. he is a real asset to the IFA Bavaro.

<Content>Do not go to IFA Villas Bavaro We just returned back from IFA resort. We went there with the baby 15 months old. He ended up in th emergency room with high fewer,stomach infection and some kind of bacteria in his stomach, so be very carefull with the food what you eat there. All of us also had diarreah.The food selection was very poor and not clean. Birds and flyies very picking over food.Remember it is only 3 star resort, so if you have extra $200 stay at some other resort.We are never going back to that resort.The walk to the beach is very far.But there are some good things. The weather was really good and the beach was beautiful.

<Content>Had a great time!!!!! This resort was great for the money. The pools were great and the beach was amazing. People complain about the walk to the beach but it's really not that bad. You have to be real lazy and picky to complain about the walk. Do take advantage of the excursions offered at the lobby of the hotel (we got great deals..look for patricia). We swam with the dolphins..(not at manati park) at dolphin island and thats in the ocean not a pool. We also did the carribean festival. you get snorkle by the coral reef,swim with nurse sharks and sting rays.  The food was also good. We felt that the buffet was the best because we had more options. We ate at the mexican once and at the caribe once. They were both O.K. but not a big deal. It seemed almost impossible to get a reservation at the caribe because everyone thought it was the best,however,we thought it was all a hype. Not a big deal. So if you miss the chance to get a reservation there don't stress. You won't be missing out on much. The room was also good. we didn't get a king size bed but that was because they didn't have any available when we got there. They offered to change our room the next day as soon as one became available but we choose to stay in the the double bed room. it was close to the pool and the food..lol  Overall we had an amazing time and would recomend the resort and the trip to anyone.

<Content>We loved the IFA Villas Barvaro We returned from the IFA Villas Bavaro on May 8, 2006. We were on our Honeymoon and got upgraded to the 3000 building. The staff was very plesent. The food was great (big selection to choose from at the buffets). If you can make reservations for the Japaneese restrauant and International restrauant go for it. We thought that they were the better than the Mexican! We do suggest that you take your own wash cloths. We never had any. All that we got were hand towels. This hotel is very much what you pay for for a 3 apple. We had mixed reviews after reading some of these postings and were expecting the worst. When we arrived everything was beautiful! We plan to go back next year for our 1 year anniversary.

<Content>Not A Bad Deal For The Price Overall not a bad resort. Having read all of the other ratings before we went, I must say most had some merit. As with any trip, and or place you can find good or bad, its all what you make of things that count. With that out of the way here's our view; not a bad resort for the price, but still only just good, 3 star, by Canadian standards.Lots of food, drink, clean, friendly staff etc etc. We would not mind telling others to go there, but if you do, make sure you stay in the villas, by the main pool best, we stayed in the ocean villas, and had a very nice room, king bed, super clean. Stay away from the rooms, they are in an older part of the resort, and are a bit run down, not to mention, way out of the way, far from the bars, pool, and beach.What else to say, well the beach venders, are aggressive, and this island is not a place to wonder off by yourselfs, but you are safe, if you stay in the normal, areas, and shopping centres, as recomended by your tour reps. Nice beaches, some great tours, and lots of sun and sand. We would go back to Punta Cana again, but would pick another resort, and spend more money. Again it was welll worth what we paid,and it was one of the nicest trips. Having been to many islands ie Grand Cayman, Cuba , etc, this island is a good buy for the money, and a lot of fun. So with that all said, enjoy your vacation there, don;t sweat the little things and enjoy yourselfs, lifes too short not too.PL

<Content>Try a week and see what you think We just spent 2 weeks at this hotel. This was our first time to this hotel but our 6th time to the Dominican. Needless to say, we were not expecting 5 stars like in the big USA cities. I felt that the rooms were average Dominican rooms- needed some updating, but safe and secure. They put bottled water in your room fridg and you can refill them at the bar. At most other resorts we have been at the room fridg had beer and soda. You have to rent the room safe that is located in the closet- for 2 weeks it was around 26 US dollars. There are no face cloths so bring your own. They do have hair dryers to use in the room. There is a nice balcony for each room. Towels are given out each day for pool use- you just have to present your towel card at the booth and you will get new towels. The room was in the 4000 block building and our friends were in the 3000 block-this actually turned out to be a good spot. The Villas are on the other side of the hotel that can be divided into 3 sections. If you are in the villas section, you will have a little walk to the beach or can catch the Beach Bus that travels constantly back and forth. The 3000 and 4000 block is in between the first noisy, younger people, party crowd pool and the quieter, older but fun second pool. There is a very nice pool in the Villas section (probably the nicest one). There are bars in each section. The service is very slow at the bars unless you make quick friends with one of the staff members - tip well. Doris was wonderful at the Lobby Bar near the second quieter pool. The food was average-not great-not terrible. They have to accomodate for a huge population and vast cultures so I think that they do o.k. They have 3 restaurants that you can make reservations at- Mexican, Japanese and Caribe. There is also a restaurant on the beach side. They don't have a welcome packet if you go like we did through Expedia, but if you travel with a group- Apple, Sunquest, etc. they have an orientation. We took the plunge and had our photo's done by Jose' in the photo shop near the big pool. He was wonderful. He takes you and family out and takes digital photo's all over the complex including the beach-you can have as many dress changes as you want, couples or singles, it is totally up to you. My husband and I were amazed at how wonderful they turned out. He will put as many as you want on a CD for $5 a photo or even print some out for $8. each. We selected 25 pictures on the CD. This is well worth looking into. Just note that at this time he did not take credit cards. Overall the resort is o.k. There is not a lot to do unless you go off the resort except sunbath (which is what we wanted to do), or water sports off the beach. Give it a try for a week and see what you think. The beach has changed since the last time we were in Dominican. They had a storm and now there is more seaweed than before. They do what they can to clean up. It's the Dominican- you go there for the weather and relaxation-if you want total luxury than stay in the US or pay a huge amount of money to stay at a palace resort. We ended up paying around $800.per person, per week- all inclusive-airfare, hotel, food, drinks. We will go back to Dominican and try yet another resort to see how they all compare. Satisfied with 2 weeks of Sun and relaxation!!!

<Content>Much better than expected - a lovely resort We鈥檝e just got back from 2 weeks at IFA Villas Bavaro. We booked this, then got a bit worried by the mixed reviews! We鈥檙e quite experienced travellers staying in both top-end and also more budget places of all types. Overall rate the IFA resort very highly and as one of the most relaxing holidays for a long time, in excellent surroundings.First impressions of our room (1045), one of the many single-storey villas on the inland side of the complex, weren鈥檛 too positive. It was spacious but quite dark and furniture/bathroom basic and dated, and would no doubt disappoint some people. However it had all essentials and everything was clean, comfortable and the daily maid service was friendly and we quickly settled in. All rooms have nice small terraces, free cable TV showing local and some US channels, and a safe to store valuables (daily charge 2 USD). While the 鈥榁illas鈥?part of the resort was mostly peaceful those rooms nearest the stage area got a bit of noise from about 8pm to midnight, although we were fine with it. We were impressed by the immaculate grounds and overall peaceful feel of the place. The walk from the Villas area to the beach took about 15 minutes through lovely well-maintained gardens and seemed wheelchair friendly throughout. Along the way you pass various bars, restaurants, shops, activity areas There鈥檚 a free hotel 鈥渂us鈥?to the beach, but seemed unnecessary for most -it takes a small road round the edge of the complex 鈥?the main area of the resort mostly car free. The beach itself is excellent, fine white sand and palm trees. The 鈥淚FA section鈥?is spacious, clean and easy to find quiet areas well away from the organised activities. There are only a few areas with good shade so have to be lucky - or early - to get these but you can also move sun-beds under the shade of the many palm trees. The warm clean sea is sheltered by a reef about 500 meters out and there鈥檚 free use of kayaks, small sailing dinghies (an hour at a time, needs security deposit between 30-100USD depending on what you use). You can pay to hire bigger sailboats or for other activities (diving/parasailing etc). There are quite a lot of speed-boats, powered hangliders etc but it didn鈥檛 spoil the very relaxing feel of the beach for us.The two main buffet restaurants have a nice atmosphere and always had a wide range of things on offer (including some local dishes), with quality from average to quite good, and though nothing spectacular, we enjoyed the experience - a good range of fresh fruit was always on offer. We tried three of the speciality restaurants 鈥?鈥渋nteresting鈥?interpretations of Mexican and Japanese food but still fun. We were alcohol-free so cant comment on the booze 鈥?there was no real juice on offer, mostly sugary squash, but this was offset by the endless, mostly excellent fresh fruit. The beach restaurant bar does a good lunchtime meal with quite good choice in a good setting and chance for a make your own burger/hot dog binge alongside healthier options. The staff were mostly friendly and attentive. Other guests (seemed mostly an equal mix of US, Canadian, British, German, French Spanish) seemed good-natured and we didn鈥檛 see any rowdiness.鈥?what we saw of the evening entertainment seemed OK if a bit samey, merengue dancing, competitions etc Overall we thought it was great and really liked the relaxed feel of an all inclusive - minimal decision making in a very attractive setting. We did travel out independently to Santo Domingo - and beyond - as well as doing one of the 鈥減ackaged鈥?excursions and this added a lot to the experience. Weather was excellent.

<Content>A good place for the budget Stayed at this resort end of February '06. We usually stay at time-shares so all-inclusive resort was a change. These are very insulated environments. It is important to remember we are guests in another country. The manegement was professional and efficiently dealt with inappropriate behaviors. Guests were expected to wear shirts  shoes in the dining areas although the beach bar was more relaxed. Specialty restaurants had to be reserved a day ahead. Standing in the line to get a seating was a great way to meet other people. We enjoyed the food at all the dining areas. Children were accepted but did not run wild. We found all the staff friendly and tried to make your visit enjoyable. The dive-shop (Neptuno) was very good. They offer a resort course and dives for different skills. They were very thorough and we would recommend them for any divers. The evening entertaiment area was very close to some guest rooms. Some might avoid this accomodation.The beach was a short, pleasant walk from the main areas.Above average for the price.

<Content>What Beach?  We are world travelers and this is the WORST hotel we have stayed in, ever!! It was advertised as oceanfront property, 3 Apples. A resounding rock beat permeated everywhere; the ceiling in our room had huge spidery cracks that extended in every direction from the ceiling fan; we had to take a BUS to the beach; the food was HORRIBLE; the people were rude. We transferred to Secrets Excellence after one hour in the place, and had the time of our life. Also, a note for mobility impaired travelers--DON'T GO TO PUNTA CANA. I had to sit on the ground at the airport for 15 minutes disembarking and embarking waiting for a wheelchair i ordered 5 months in advance; they took our special seats away with no regard for US Aviation rules. We registered a complaint with US Aviation; case is pending.

<Content>The spirit of the Dominican This resort is typical Dominican style i.e no frills, no hurry.If you want luxury up your budget and look at some of the other superb hotels in Bavaro.We were on a tight post Christmas budget but in urgent need of sunshine and 2 weeks at the IFA didn't break the bank. I was a bit nervous having read the mixed reviews but bit the bullet and will share my findings with you....THE ACCOMODATIONWe stayed in the villas(rm 1025) and it was ok but quite hard work for 2 weeks. The pillows were well ready for the skip and I was convinced that I had a water bed the mattress was so wobbly! The lighting is not good for us girls and I dare say it must have looked like Coco the clown had arrived with the dodgy makeup! Towels were generally ok. Maids did a good job. Rooms in need of a bit of cheering up but were tolerable.THE FOODNot brilliant but always able to cobble something together at the buffet all be it a chip buttie! A lot of traditional foods served at all times. There are not enough staff in the buffets and often there was a bit of a wait for a table or a cup of coffee (only available with breakfast). The al a carte restaraunts required booking a day ahead. Bookings were supposed to be from 4pm but the line was huge by 3pm and all the best slots taken by those lucky enough to be near the front. This system needs reviewing. I can recommend the Mexican but didn't bother with the japanese or caribe.THE DRINKSThere are 4 bars and a beach bar. Most drinks served via worlitzer and were very flat and sugery. There is a good cocktail list and I think we tried most drinks with varying degrees of success! None of the bars have enough seating and folk ended up sprawled on sunbeds sipping their marguaritas - not so far to fall I guess as I disagree with previous reviews saying the drinks are watered down!That said if you get tipsy you are lucky as the service can be very slow depending upon the bar staff on duty. On the whole pleasant and friendly with limited English though the girls in particular try very hard to communicate.You are issued with 2 water bottles on arrival and these can be filled up from tanks at the bars. A dollar to the maid ensures extra bottles are placed in your fridge every few days.THE GUESTS AND POOLSPredominantly French/Canadian/American/German. Many of whom may not have grasped the principle of a relaxing holiday and were up and silly o'clock putting towels on sunbeds. very tempting to collect them up at 6am and put them in a pile especially since many of their owners did not appear until well into the afternoon by which time the more leisurely travellers were covered in grass stains and sweat as the few beds with parasols were taken. This behaviour needs addressing at not only this but all resorts where it is allowed to happen. The pools themselves - 1. Known as the quiet pool as there is no animation. However, come lunchtime the nighttime entertainment crew are out practicing their routines and its like Sunday Night at The Palladium!. A bit annoying at times. The music at the pool is, I'm sure, some form of torture as the same half dozen tracks are played over and over. Take your ipod! 2. The Big pool fun and games most of the day with the animation team. Lots of kids and lilos - got the picture..?3. The Little pool Tiny - about 20 sunbeds booked by the time the sun comes up. very close to the restaraunt so don't pick this one unless you are happy for people to gawp at you over their omelette!THE BEACHLovely but smallish and very popular.Get down there very early if you want a sunbed. There is a bar and a restaraunt so you need not go up to the main resort if you are cosy i.e managed to bag a sunbed!There is a fair sized shopping area but get your bargaining head on and know how much you are prepared to pay. The guys are very persistant.WHAT ELSEThe Jellyfish Restaraunt is on the beach right next door to the IFA and is fab. Friendy and welcoming place serving great value seafood.Excellent service, cool trance muscic, wonderful deck area to look out to sea. Give it a visit or you will be missing out on a treat away from the buffet and sugery drinks!WOULD I STAY AT THE IFA AGAIN?With a restricted budget yes but would try to save a bit harder or sting a rich relative for the extra money to stay at a slightly more up market hotel.If you like Butlins, you will like the IFA.Accept it for what it is and have a great time.

<Content>paradise and value for money Paradise and value for money....we travelled to Bavarro and stayed in IFA villas resort.The accomodation ..we were in block 11 which is basic but clean and was a good 15 mins walk from the beach but was lovely and quiet.The food...loads of it..6 restaurants ..3 buffet and a mexican, international and japenese but you had to book the day before for the non buffet ones, booking starts at 4pm but my advice is to be there at least at 3.30 ( certain nationalities started queuing at 3!!)The pasta chef in the buffet was great!The beach ..idyllic..pure white sand and palm trees. We went on the tropical storm cattamaran..great entertainment..good fun, food and plenty of cuba libre ! We would definetely return...we only paid 拢630 each for 2 weeks all inclusive and didn't actually need to spend any money at all, only on tips and the tropical storm trip....

<Content>vacation 2006 Second time at IFAHotel bavaro beach punta cana, lots of good inprovements in 4 years, if you like to walk + get exercise this is the resort for you. awhole lot cleaner than 4 years ago, all the way around bathroom were excellant grounds always clean no visable garbage like 4 years ago. Last vacation there i got very sick + ended up in a nice hospital in Higuey, service there was very good but not what you need to be doing on vacation. The al la cart really could need some improving, food was cool always + often we didn,t get what we had ordered, once at the bambo we had started to eat + the waiter noticed his mastake + without a word to us come + took the plates away from us without one word that a mistake had been made + we waited a good while until something else was brought to us, the servers were more worried about providing us with warm towels to wipe our hands with + also reached over us to give items instead of from the side. the Mexician was about the best + also the one closest to the sea ,was extremely good. the buffets had lots to choise from + if you can,t find something good to eat you probely are a fussy eater, they were very nicely sat up. I have only one strong complaint the have a swim up bar with stools in the water, there was a bar tender that everyone just hated to approch for anything, even daily bottled water, he would tell you things weren,t on the menu that were as you could get these drinks anywhere else on the resort, a young lady said to me they liked to be at this pool but walked a small distanceto the bar by the la casona buffet to get there drink of their choice instead of trying to deal with this person, he seemed to be unhappy + miserable at all times + very intimidating he would not walk down + serve the people setting on the swim up stools, a real troubled person, i gave him a tip one day after we had argued over a drink i was able to get anywhere else on the resort + walked back to my lounge he yelled at me + threw the tip on the ground, a lady picked it up + layed it on the counter + she walked away also. In all the countrys we have vacationed in this is probely the only + worst embarrising thing I have ever incountered, There is a young man Jasson MOES he takes care of everything from lost kids to reservations to helping you make phone call to diffrent resorts, to smiling at you like you are his relative, + giving you the best hugs daily, this young man has so much potential for a upper management possition, he was the high light of the trip, he was always informed into all thing + was able to jod share + deal with lots at the same time + keep everyone needs meet Thank you Jasson for your wonderful hospitality into the ifa resort they are so lucky to have you + we sure hope they treat you well

<Content>A-Z EVERYTHING U NEED 2 NO My husband and I just returned from the Lopesan Villas. We stayed from the 12-16th of February. Honestly, we breathed a sigh of relief once we arrived. It wasn't as bad as we thought it may be. It was actually very nice. After reading the reviews we called ahead of time and requested a room by the ocean, they were so nice, they did it for us! However,below I will list everything you need to know by category-ufortuantly we will not return to this hotel! Pay the extra money and GO ENJOY yourself!Staff: Pleasant, accomodating. They do not speak English! Rooms: Well, O.K. they are not the best. If you get stuck with two double beds, go up immediatly and put your name on the list for the next available king bed. These rooms are much bigger and nicer! The rooms are the worst parts of the hotel. They are very clean, although they are also very old. They were do-able for a short vacation.Resturants: Well, when you check in they will give you a map of Hotel along with resturants. This leaves out VERY important stuff. It only lists three restaurants, two buffets and bech bar. First, DO NOT GO TO BEACH BAR. It was AWEFUL. Second, both buffets are O.K., but the food was only average at best. What they leave out are the three other resturants, Japonaise, Caribe and Mexican. These are much better than the buffets but you need to make reservations the day before! They say at 4-7, they actually start at 3, so get there early! Also, this part of the hotel is the nicest! The entertainment, two great bars and nice resturants make up this end of Hotel! Hang out over here in the evening! BARS: Well, we had warm beer and aweful drinks the entire trip! The frozen drinks were aweful! Rum comes out of a sprayer, and it must be watered down! The alcohol is AWEFUL! The drinks were AWEFUL! The best bar is the Captains Bar, very elegant looking, better srinks than anywhere else. Also, the only place to find cappacinos!Entertainment: Not so good.Pools: Very nice! However, keep in mind there really is no swim up bar in the one pool, and none in the rest of them. No one serves you drinks either. Beach: Beautiful!!!!!!!!!! Lots of topless people though!Shopping: If you walk to the right of the beach you see alot of shops, good deals!Now, FYI, I have been sick for two days. I went to Dr., and they say food poison. Sometimes, in resorts where they have buffets all the time, things just are not clean or are left out to long..This is the case at the Lopesan Villas. BE CAREFUL bring meds with you! Also, bring bug spray, at the resort it was $10.00! I got eaten up pretty bad!!! Also, bring a sweater at night it was a little chilly!Overall, spend the extra money and stay somewhere else!

<Content>Wouldn't Return We just returned from a two week stay at Ifa Villas Bavaros from Jan 26 to Feb 9th.We were at room 1211, 1210 and 1207. There were 7 of us and I know we won't go back. We flew sky service, which was fine. Tiny seats and no room but I guess that's normal. Check in went fine but once we told the lobby assistants our room number they acted like we were asking them to donate blood! Then we learned our rooms were like a 10 minute walk from the lobby which was still about 8 minutes from the beach. Thankfully they had a trolly, sort of like a golf cart with a trailor. They drive a little crazy but it saved us a lot of time. (It was however really noisy and would wake us up early in the morning and late at night when it would drive by). The rooms looked like something from a 1970's cheap motel. I was disappointed to open the frige and find two bottles of water and that's all. We were expecting a stocked mini fridge with pop, beer, etc...nope. We were then informed we had to keep our two bottles of water and refill them oursleves at the bars. When we lost them, after using them for 10 days, it was a real hassle to get them replaced. The service really wasn't very good at all. We often waited for 15 or more minutes for a drink at the buffets and the bars. Some staff were often rude! The food was, well, mostly okay. If you could get a reservation for one of the restaurants you were sitting pretty. The food was awesome and the service was exceptional but if you were stuck with the buffets, have fun!! I was really disappointed with the lack of fresh fruit juice. All the juice was really sugary and powder based. The beach was beautiful!!! The disco was fun, but always consistant. Also difficult to get a drink there. The swim up bar was a joke. You could sit there but unless you stood up on a stool and got their attention ( which is way harder than it sounds) you would get NO service. We went on the Saona Island day trip. DO THAT IT WAS AMAZING! We also went on the Caribbean Festival boat trip which was also fun. I wish I had more good to say. This resort calls itself a 4 star. Please don't be fooled!

<Content>Worst all-inclusive in Punta Cana I have never written a hotel review before but I feel I must this time. We are 2 middle aged couples who have been in Punta Cana 10 times in 9 different all-inclusive resorts. We went to IFA Villas Bavaro November 2005. I must say this is by far the worst hotel we have ever been there.The day we arrived the other couple had to get their room 3704 changed in the middle of the night because their air conditioning didn鈥檛 work. Because of the rush they left a full bottle of shampoo in the washroom. Next day they asked for it but it never appeared and nothing was done about it. We were assigned room 3703 on the ground floor. On the third day I woke up walking on the sewage of the rooms above because the sewer was blocked. They had to change us to a room on a second floor. Some other details about the rooms and accesses: Public walkways had the lights removed (I guess to save electricity), actually ripped right off the wall. You could see on the walls where they had been. Same thing in the balconies. Twice they put towels ripped in half in the bathroom; one half for each person. The pillows were very old and full of matted balls.In regards to the rest: Clean beach towels were never available.70% of the reclining chairs on the beach were broken.The gym was a joke.Non motorized sports were not free. They charged us US$15 for the use of a hobbie-cat for an hour. There are no pedal boats.The food was the worst we have ever had in the Dominican Republic: Juices are fake, marmalade and jam of the cheapest kind available in the country, same for all alcoholic beverages. Oil was un-edible, one day at breakfast the milk was sour.At the Caribean a-la-carte restaurant there was no regular wine available. If you wanted to drink wine with your dinner, you had to pay extra. The service at that restaurant was so lousy we stood up and left after 10 minutes.Buffet food was poor to say the least.All in all a hotel without love, without care for the customers. Please take notice that all 4 of us are South Americans, therefore it is not a matter of cultural differences. Also what I said at the beginning; we are comparing this so called 3 1/2 or 4 star hotel with 8 other all-inclusive hotels in the same area and with the same number of stars.Our advice is, no matter how cheap they offer this hotel to you, pick something else.

<Content>IFA Bavaro My friend and i stayed at this hotel from Feb 1st to Feb 5th. The walk to the beach is five minutes. There are 3 restaurants on site and four bars. I would recommend this hotel to: couples, families and senior citizens. This hotel offers a lot of pool activities and water sports. If you are however traveling on your own (not from an agency nor with a big group) make sure you keep busy b.c. it may get a little slow at times. My friend and I booked a day trip to Saona island, we left at 7am and got back at 7pm. If you like sailing this is a trip for you.We also went on a 2 hour snorkeling adventure, which included a speed boat racing-oh yeaaa- very fun. You have to pay for these out of your own pocket, we paid $120 ea for both but def. worth it :)You can buy these trips from representatives that hang out at the lobby/reception at the hotel. Look for Caramel, he was very nice to us and informative.Remember to bring: cash, there is an atm machine on site but it does not take for example american express, and it was out of service when we needed it the most. A waterproof camera, they sell them at the shop at the hotel but it will cost you $44!!! A dictionary maybe useful. We would def. return to Punta Cana.

<Content>Have an Open Mind!!! We got back late last night from a 4-day visit to this hotel. Here are our thoughts:I hate to admit it (don't want to sound like a spoiled-rotten tourist), but my first impression of the hotel was not the best. The grounds were good, but the room was very basic, even a little run-down. But the negatives stop right here.Honestly, we had a great time. If you're looking for something luxurious, this is not your stop. The whole focus here was the laid-back atmosphere. The entertainers were awesome; they did everything to make you feel right at home. They really were the best part of our stay.The beach was absolutely gorgeous, clean, and perfect.The food was good, and they tried to accommodate all sorts of nationalities (from French toast to mashed potatoes and salad for breakfast).There were very few people from the US, so if you've never been out of the country, you're in for a surprise. To us it was quite interesting getting a glimpse of all the different cultures, but you definitely need to have an open mind.All in all, we loved it, and would definitely go back and stay there again, now that we have our priorities in check and know what to expect.If you do decide to go, make sure to have a private session with the photographer at the beach. My husband and I did and we're still drooling over the pictures in the Caribbean sun.

<Content>great value and a fantastic beach We have just returned from a week long vacation at ifa villas bavaro and had a wonderfull time. Our supplier was Nolitours. The representative at the resort was very helpful in guiding us through the available tours that were being offered. We were in the ocean area of the resort. The other two areas of the resort are the village and the villas. Stay away from the villas if possible. It is a fifeteen minute walk to the beach. Nolitours and Airtransat vacations have a contract that guarantees that you will be located at the ocean or the village. Everything about this resort is excellent especially the beach which is breathtaking. The only thing that We found that was subpar was the quality of the evening entertainment. The entertainers work very hard but the shows seem inferior to some other resorts we have stayed at. Some of the negative reviews I have read about this reort must have come from some very pessimistic people because there is very little fact to their stories. My wife and I agree that this is a resort that we will visit again. We reccommend it highly for anyone looking for a great vacation.

<Content>Good value for money My boyfriend and I stayed at this resort 14th - 28th November 2005. On arrival we were rather disappointed as we were led to believe that this was 4 star accommodation as opposed to 3 star, but we couldn't really complain considering the price we paid, it was definitely good value.We stayed in the 3000 block near the pool. The room was basic but large and clean. We were initially a bit disappointed that our room was at the back, overlooking the gardens, but we later realised this wasn't such a bad thing because the rooms facing the pool must have been very noisy when the entertainment started.When we arrived we didn't hear another English voice for 2 days. The place was overrun with Germans! We did eventually meet other English/American/Canadian people but they were few and far between.The food in the buffet restaurants was ok as long as you got there early. We found some of the food to be lukewarm if we went for dinner after 9pm. Definitely book for the El Caribe restaurant as the food was delicious. Don't bother with the Japanese though. You can book for the following night between 9-11am at the desk behind the Lobby Bar.The entertainment was a bit lame - not our cup of tea. Some of the stuff made you cringe - it was like being at Butlins. Stay in the bars instead!!!El Capitan is a nice bar, as is the one over the far pool. Visited the nightclub on a couple of occasions and lets just say you need to have had a fair few beers before you go. If they are not playing cheesy 80's rubbish (e.g. I Will Survive) you have to contend with nothing but salsa music. It's ok in moderation but after an hour it starts to grate. We had a laugh though.The beach was gorgeous and we never had a problem findings sunbeds there, or round the pool.We went on a trip to La Palimera and Saona Island which was a great day out. We travelled there on catamaran and back on a speed boat. We also stopped for some fantastic snorkelling.Also went on the Outback Safari which was average. The guide was very knowledgeable and lunch was nice but we got thrown about so much on the truck, I banged my head twice. We went boogie boarding in the morning but the sea was so rough I spent more time sprawled in the sand with the board on top of me!! All in all the holiday was good value for money as we got a cancellation but I wouldn't pay full price to stay there.

<Content>Contact Wimpy For A Great Holiday. We travelled to ifa villas on 7th november wanting to see a bit of the countryside and not be confined to the hotel. If you want to make your holiday that little bit special contact Wim Goessens at ----- for the best trips on the island. He showed us things we never expected to see and took us to places we didnt know still existed in this day and age. Saona island is a must!!!!!The hotel itself was spotless, the maids cleaned every day, and the beach was brushed every morning at 6.30. When we went for breakfast an army of cleaners were cleaning the site and pool areas. This is the cleanest holiday site we have ever stayed in. Food was great and the staff even better. Get friendly with the bar staff and cleaners and remember to tip them. Bring plenty of doller bills for this reason. You will not be disappointed. We are returning again as soon as we can. ALAN  LESA, IRELAND.

<Content>Great surpise! We where a little unsure about what Ifa Villas was going to be like after reading some of the reviews on this site(I was a little worried!)But I can honestly say we enjoyed the hotel and its facilities and would recomend Ifa Villas.Here is what we tought:Rooms; Very clean and welcoming.Air con was excellent  TV had enough english speaking channels we  even found English football games live!! Bathroom was OK and we got fresh towels daily. We found the bed very comfy and always had a  good nights sleep. Food; We found the food was of better standard than what we had in the DomRep on our last visit. Both the buffet resturants had plenty  of choice,my partner is a fussy eater and always found something to eat!! We went to the Mexican resturant 3 times the al a carte twice and the beach  resturant twice, all where great. Over all we where very happy with the  food.Bars; We went to all the bars and found the  Capitan bar was our favorite. The pool bar where the entertainment is, is also good and livelier in the evening The entertainment was as it always is in  the Caribbean very colourful with lots of singing and dancing, and a bit of audience  partipication!!! Beach; The beach is lovely,pure white sand and clear blue sea.If you want a lounger get up early they are very hard to find after 10am!!Pools; We where at the pool near the stage and mexican resturant mainly.Most of the English are there if you want to be with them as most of the  guests seemed to be French, Italian and German!  Overall we had a very relaxing break and enjoyed the hotel.One complaint we do have is that we found the staff to be a bit misserable at times and not very helpful!The hotel changed ownership this year and you can tell a lot has been done to make it better than what it was like before, so reviews from earlier this year now have no meaning as it was owned by a different company then!R

<Content>Its cheap, but not worth the savings My boyfriend and I went to IFA for a week in mid-October. We are 28 and 30yrs old and both have travelled extensively and have lived abroad. I personally lived in India for 14mths and travelled through South East Asia, so I knew what to expect going to a poorer country. We normally do not do all-inclusive, resort-type vacations but have had a little experience with them. I've been to Cuba and Mexico as well so I was hoping my DR experience would match those wonderful trips. Unfortunatley, that was not the case this time. I would not recommend going to Punta Cana. Perhaps Puerto Plata would've been better for us, but we'll never know. Here are our thoughts from our trip - we hope it helps:RoomsRooms were adequate for a 3 star hotel. We stayed in the 3000 block of rooms, which is midway between the beach and the front lobby. We had water pressure issues 2 out of 7 days we were there (the water was turned off for hours at a time for 鈥渕aintenance鈥?. Air vents in all rooms are connected so you can smell the smoke from other people鈥檚 rooms, which was an annoyance for us non-smokers. There are no non-smoking rooms or blocks. The paint etc needs updating but not a big deal. Don鈥檛 expect beauty in the rooms.ServiceThe service was okay with some exceptions. If you tip you will get more attention and care but overall the service was alright. The staff definitely work hard. Tips are greatly appreciated.BeachThe beach was nice, white sand with warm, aquamarine blue water. Visibility in the ocean is poor for snorkeling etc. The beach chairs get uncomfortable after a while; the plastic hurts your back. There are a few chairs that are cushioned but unless you鈥檙e an early riser, they will most likely be taken before you get to the beach. There are no umbrellas for use so you have to find a spot under a palm tree. The animation team has sessions on the beach in the morning and afternoons and can be quite loud. They will try to recruit you to participate and can be annoying if you鈥檙e looking to just relax, read a book and listen to the ocean waves. They also play the same music every day.FoodBreakfast sucks. The quality of food is poor and it鈥檚 always the same. Lunch is good if you eat at the main restaurant by the reception. Don鈥檛 eat at the beach restaurant, its terrible.Dinner was hit and miss. At the main restaurant the food was generally good with variety each night. The Mexican restaurant has good and bad dishes, however make sure you鈥檙e comfortable with your partner cause you鈥檒l be sharing some very intimate (aka smelly!) moments with them afterwards. We were told to avoid the Japanese restaurant by some other people we talked to at the resort so we never tried it. The beach restaurant FOR DINNER was good. We went two nights in a row and other people we talked to about it were happy with it as well. It鈥檚 also lovely to sit by the ocean and feel the cool breeze while you eat (which also helps keep the mosquitoes away).Snacks were pretty much non-existent. We were told we could only get snacks during the day at the beach restaurant, but the 鈥榮nacks鈥?were actually the horrible lunch they offered there.One of us has a very sensitive stomach and other one doesn鈥檛. Both of us got diarrhea despite taking pepto bismol pills everyday and acidophilus pills before we went. We did not overeat and we did not drink alcohol so we were pretty cautious about our eating habits and drinking habits but were effected by the food regardless.AnimationThe animation team works very hard and after watching them you feel sympathy for what they鈥檙e doing. They basically work their ass off to get people to participate in their activities throughout the day but the problem is the activities aren鈥檛 our cup of tea. For some people, maybe with young children or people looking to be more outgoing, they might have enjoyed the animation team. But for us it was mostly embarrassing, cheesy, low-brow or annoying. However, we respect the animation team鈥檚 purpose, however we wish it was designated to one area of the resort. We felt we could not escape them because there was something going on wherever we went. There are three swimming pools and the beach and the animation staff were doing something at almost all of them. There was one pool where the animation team did not work at but it was the smallest pool and it had only three umbrellas, which were usually occupied.ToursWe went on one tour with a tour company called the Bavaro Runners, where we went to visit a sugar cane plantation, a family-owned coffee, cocoa and fruit farm, lunch and horseback riding on the beach. Overall, it was a great tour and a wonderful way to see some of the island culture. Our guide was personable and knowledgeable. However, if you are prone to motion sickness at all you should avoid doing any tours that involve a lot of driving. The main road from the airport to the resort is fine, but when we did the tour, we went off the main road a lot and it made one of us extremely ill. There are humungous pot holes everywhere. You can鈥檛 avoid them. There are better roads in India!When you book a tour, do it through your tour agency instead of buying it off of one of the independent guys working in the reception area because your tour agency will be insured in case you get into an accident. The tour agency will be happy to switch dates if you happen to be sick on the day of your scheduled tour and will have guides that speak English or whatever language you speak. We saw other groups doing the same tour as us but with guides speaking in their native language (French or Spanish).MiscExpect mosquitoes, especially if you鈥檙e going during the wet season, which we did. They can get into your room and bother you at night, if you鈥檙e finicky about these things. Wear repellant and they鈥檒l most likely leave you alone.Prices at the hotel stores are ridiculously over priced. Beware! At one store, they wanted to charge us $10USD for a small bag of chips and a chocolate bar. Also we were witness to a situation where another resort guest was purchasing a drink at one of the bars and the barman blatantly over charged him. We called him on it and then he returned some of the money, but he was not apologetic and it was still overpriced. We think that this must happen a lot since guests don鈥檛 know what the prices should be and are gullible. We think that the hotel should have price lists of the special drinks that have to be paid for.The sun is very intense so wear protective sun block even if it is overcast or cloudy.Beware of the guys in white shirts that say 鈥淩oyal鈥?on it because they will try to befriend you, then waste your time trying to sell you on a timeshare. The guys work on the resort so you will see them everywhere and they actually work for the resort. They鈥檙e aggressive and annoying. The resort also sets up a market by the main pool and the sellers are very aggressive. It was annoying because you feel like you鈥檙e just a walking dollar sign and can鈥檛 let your guard down to relax.Also the security guards can be creepy. They hit on one of us (the girl) blatantly. He was staring hard at me and then whispered that he thought I was 鈥渂eautiful鈥? while he was touching his genitals. Ick.Bring US dollars or use the ATM machine, which dispenses DR pesos. Canadian dollars are accepted reluctantly or not at all. You can however, exchange your cash at the hotel lobby but don't expect a great rate.I wish we could recommend this place, but unfortunately it was too disappointing.

<Content>Nice place- and a good bargain! We returned yesterday from this resort and we both had a wonderful vacation. We're a couple in our mid forties, and this was my 10th visit to an all inclusive resort in the DR. This is a very nice property for the money. I have to disagree with the previous review. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful at all times and they always returned a smile, regardless of if we were tipping or not. The food was good- and we never saw anything spoiled. As for the previous comments about the birds- unless you have a bird phobia- I can't imagine this being a problem. Anywhere you have an open air restaurant- a bird or two will be flying in occasionally for a snack. Upon check-in I requested a room close to the beach and we were placed in the Ocean Village section on the beach and even had an ocean view- which pleased us both. The room was clean and our beds were fine. There were only a few differences between this resort and some of the higher priced ones where we've stayed previously- for example- only water in the mini-fridge (no cokes and beers)- not a problem for us. No room service- again not a problem for us, as we never use it at resorts that have it. No waiters taking drink orders on the beach and bringing them to you- again no problem for us as the bar isn't too far to walk to. No coffee maker in the room- which would have been nice, but wasn't a problem. We loved that the resort never seemed too crowded and that we didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn to get a shady spot on that gorgeous beach. There were spots available at all times of day- at the beach or by the pools. We swam in 2 of the 3 pools and they were very pleasant. We dined at the Japanese and the Mexican restaurants and both enjoyed them, even though it's not the typical Japanese and Mexican food that we are used to! As for the vendors and time share people- they are only trying to make a living. All we did is say no, gracias in a polite and friendly manner- and we were never hasseled. Yes, when shopping the vendors will ask outlandishly high prices for the merchandise- but they always will come down to a fair price. Of course they want to make as much money as possible- but they don't ever expect someone to pay the initial asking price- kind of like a yard sale! Even though we only saw a few other guests from the US- we never felt uncomfortable or unable to communicate with the staff or the guests from other countries. Learning a little Spanish and German can be really helpful when visiting the DR! We only did one excursion this time and it was riding the quads-and it was a fun afternoon. We truly enjoyed our visit to Villas Bavaro and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property. I will definitely be returning to the DR again soon!!

<Content>Like chewing gum that quickly loses its flavor Good things about this resort: Beautiful Beach!Bad things about this resort: Oh.. where do i start...1. The beds were unbelievably uncomfortable... like sleeping on a brick with a sheet2. The food was sometimes spoiled.. menu was repetative3. The staff is not very friendly.. even after tipping with money and gifts we still barely got a smile out of them.4. They allow scam-artists to rent space and wander the resort. STAY AWAY FROM ROYAL HOLIDAY I cant stress that enough!!! They will lie to you to get you to buy their crap.5. The resort is poorly mapped and laid out, and the staff are not willing to help you find your way around. We found out the day before we left that we were only in 1/3 of the resort, since the other 2/3 werent on our lousy map.6. Be aware of hidden charges, and do NOT allow them to sell you upgrades... if you ask, they will do it for free.7. Do NOT go off the resort or go to any of the markets.. the merchants are CROOKS. They will try to sell you a few dollar store necklaces for hundreds of dollars.My husband and I will not go back there ever again. We were very disappointed.

<Content>sun sea and sand a perfect holiday !! we have been back from ifa villas for a week and wanna go back already, 10 of us travelled from the uk ranging from 14 to 60 years of age and every one loved it.We arrived in the evening and wanted to sleep of our jet lag but when we set of for breakfast we couldent belive our eyes it was so pretty and every one was friendly.The food was good not verry varried but you can always find something, in the mornings they cooked fresh omlets and eggs infrount of you, they also had a smothy bar which was nice. lunch times and diners there was a buffet, a grill section, pasta bar and salad bar which was nice much more varied in the evenings. You could also use 3 specialality reastrunts which was the mexican. japenese and l a carte we tried the mexican and japenesse and they were verry nice if you want to be waited on that is. you need to book these meals a day in advance but if they have space they will alway fit you in.The rooms were verry clean the bedding and towels were changed every day and the maid cleaned them well. the air con was lovely especaily as it was high 40s when we arrived!!!Entertainment was good be aware you might get pulled up to dance the maranga as i found out !!!! The beach disco was fun. There was also activitys going on during the day. every thursday at 4.30 they have a cocktail party you drink cocktails out of real coconuts there is a band there and every one gets up to dance. The animation team were great and verry friendly.There was a free bus down to the beech and if you are staying at the villas there was a shuttle bus that would take you to and from your rooms we named this the LAZY BUS it always seemed we was the only ones on it !!The beech is out of this worls just imagine clear blue sea and fine white sand scatered with tall palm trees trust me you have to see it to belive it. as you might of guessed we had a wonderfull time sooo dont all rush too book leave space for us!!!

<Content>Great Deal I read many reviews concerning Villas Bavaro and was a little hesitant to go, but the deal that was offered was all my wife and I could afford and so we prayed and gave it a shot.What a pleasant surprise!! The hotel is very nice. The food is good at all the restaurants and be sure to make reservations for the specialty restaurants if you want.The pools are nice. The beach is beautiful. The people are friendly. This was definitely more than we thought we would get for the price. The rooms are very plain but the air conditioning is ice cold (trust me you'll value it because Punta Cana is boiling hot). Don't worry about any birds or chickens walking around. They really aren't that big of a deal and don't bother anyone.We will be back.

<Content>Family of 10 - Laughter/Fun/Good Time Let me just state that we just returned from PUNTA CANA and the entire family ages 16-55 enjoyed the trip. Punta Cana was worth the money and value for a group of different personalities.Below are my suggestions if your're planning on staying at the IFA Villas Bavaro and what to do if your going to Punta Cana, DR.AIRPORT- Before you get off the plane, check yourself in the mirror and say HOLA they snap your picture for you to remember, (like going to an amusement park) you can purchase on your return. Driving to the resort the island is not a plush, green island but pulling up to the resort was nice.HOTEL- You check-in get a wrist band, and your set for food, beverages and shuttle services. The rooms were average,  don't forget your wash cloths they don't have those....only handtowels. The a-c worked great. This is not a 4 star resort, don't go looking for that. The hotel grounds reminded me of camp-like setting, but it's exactly as it looks in the brochures. The food wasn't great, but when your're hungry you'll eat what's given. I stuck to breads and pasta. The teenagers to french fries  chicken.ACTIVITIES- The Bavaro beach sand was wonderful, not the kind were you walk on and your feet are like hot potatoes...it's fine warm sand. The hotel offers water aerobics, line dancing, night movies at the bar  music around the main pool and beach. At 9 they have a show, at 11pm the beach party. However, it wasn't much to do between 6-11pm-- You have to wait for the party to get started. I also recommend booking your excursions before you get to Punta Cana. We had sooo much fun on the Outback Safari Tour, we learned soo much about the Dominican island from this day trip . I also sugggest the Party Boat- (Con Tiki??)... However, don't snorkel and drink rum punch, some of the group members got sick later on in the trip.. :)*(Funny, they were the only ones who snorkeled  dranked rum punch. UMMM!All in all, we had a great time, we all laughed so hard we will all remember something from that trip...it was great time of laughter, fun and a good vacation gettaway. I'm even thinking of learning Spanish so the next time if we return I can carry a conversation or two.

<Content>Fun, fun, fun.... We recently returned from IFA Bavaro Villas June 17, 2005 and had a wonderful time. We have traveled throughout various Caribbean Islands and to be honest after reading the reviews and the 3.5 star rating I was a little nervous. Much to my surprise it was much nicer, cleaner and the staff friendlier than at the 4 or 5 star resorts we have visited. CHECK-IN: Upon check-in you do have staff present who does speak the English language and will make every effort possible to accommodate your needs. Let me back up, there were 2 families traveling together for a total of 4 adults and 4 children. When we arrived we were put in two different villas. The villas are anywhere from 1100 - 4500. We were put in 4200 and 3100. We asked the staff if there was a possibility to stay closer and they put us next door to one another.FOOD: We never went hungry. When traveling with teenage children they tend to be very picky about what they eat. At the IFA that was not a problem. They offer a variety of food so that everyone can find what they are looking to eat that particular day. Please try the Dominica Restaurant located within the resort. You must make reservations 24 hours in advance. It is definately worth it. The Dominica is a restaurant that offers food selections that the people of Dominican Republic eat at their homes. Wonderful server in the Dominican Restaurant named Mildred. She makes those who visit the Dominican Restaurant feel like they are queen of the Dominican Republic. We loved the treatment we received so we ate there every other day. Hee Hee!! Mexican restaurant is also very good choice, however, mosquitos were present there. I guess those pesty bugs liked the Mexican aroma as well. My husband loved the Mexican restaurant. Once again, 24 hour notice. DRINKS: Bartenders can make anything your little heart desires. Most drinks when traveling with minor children are without liquor unless you as the adult request it. Must try the MAMA WANNA. Its a liquor for the MAN. I thought it much to strong for me, but you need to give it a little try. Your on vacation, why not!!!ACTIVITIES: Plenty of them. On the beach, at the pool located closest to the lobby and in the evening at the theatrical stage which is located behind the lobby and nearest the largest swimming pool. Yes there are 3 pools, 2 pretty large pools and one smaller one that is located in the 4000 block of rooms. The animation team there is superior to all other Caribbean resorts we have visited. You have to experience the fun with HAPPY BOY (that is his name on his name tag). He will have you laughing the night away!!SOUVENIERS: When you go to the beach, shops on both sides. BARGAIN!!! If they say $68, you say 5 and go from there. They will eventually give you a calculator and say give me a price. Be prepared to walk away in order to get your price. Enjoy the resort, the staff and your vacation. It's very fun at the IFA.

<Content>It was a real vacation Me and my fiance just came back to New York after a 10 day stay at the IFA Villas Bavaro Resort. Overall it was a great experience, we are now relaxed, tanned and gained weight(unfortunately!)... Rooms: Very clean, very basic, TV is mostly Spanish, also some American channels like CNN, Fox 5 available. Nice balkony viewing the pool and palm trees. Only few minutes walking from the beach. Room service punctual, clean bath towels everyday,garbage taken out, beds made, room cleaned;thanks to Juanita, our cleaning lady.We left her a 10 dollar tip. Pools and bars: 3 pools,very clean,the one next to the main lobby has a tiki bar, other pools also have nearby bars open from early morning. Only local drinks available. The only beer is Dominican  Presidente beer which is pretty light. Do not forget to try exotic drinks like Banana mama (you can ask them to add Rum as well) and Coco Loco Food: PLENTY of food.....Be careful, one tends to overeat...I did not get sick at all, but my fiancee had some diarrhea mainly from eating and drinking a lot. Coffee is excellent( I think even better than Starbucks) It is Dominican Coffee, the best brand is Santa Domingo, I bought plenty of it on my way back. Restaurante Colibri offers good breakfast, you can customize your omlette by mixing cheese, mushrooms, sausage, tomatoes and ask the cook to make you an omelette. For lunch we preferred the beach restaurant to get some light and fast food mostly grilled chicken/fish/meatball or salad/fruits. For dinner I recommend making a reservation for Mexican restaurant. The tacos (chicken or beef) are especially good. Anything you eat at the stationary section is good. Do not even bother to make a reservation at the Dominican restaurant, nothing special is served except this drink called  mama juana which is believed to be a local sexual enhancer.Otherwise Restaurante Colibri is good for dinner too, I recommend fish or chicken rather than beef, for some reason beef was hard and tasteless.As for fish, poisson is the best. Lots of deserts every day,make sure you try the rice puding. Beach: Flawless. Beautiful soft white sand,pine trees, still and light blue water not so cold, cool enough to refresh your tanning body. We spent most of our days at the beach or at the pools. Animators have daily beach programmes, I took a few merenge and salsa lessons (they don't let you leave the hotel if you can't learn how to dance!!), some aerobic lessons as well. We also rented a canoe and went for snorkeling ( included in the all inclusive package).  Shopping: Hotel has lots of little shops for great gifts like cigars, jewellery ( DR or is well known for Larimar which is a blue gemstone found only in this island and very fine amber), paintings. Right next to the hotel at the beach on the right side is a bazaar where you can buy all this stuff and more. Make sure to bargain!! Offer 1/5 of the price they tell you, you'll get it. Now here is a little tip; if you walk on the beach to the left for about 15 minutes you will find an  Art Galery where tens of paintings are literally hanging on the strings in rows like a festival. The colors are amazing. The pictures are real oil paintings, the styles are very local, themes are mostly native women, fruits or symbols of ancient Indian Gods. You get the best prices there. The sellers are very nice,speak English well, especially Rafael. Still make sure you bargain. We bought 5 paintings and lots of other local goods.We did not have money on us, they drove us back to our hotel and accepted credit card. Staff: Very friendly,warm. Service is fast. Try to learn a few Spanish words, they do appreciate the effort. Other: We took a daily trip to Santa Domingo. We saw the first cathedral built in America and the house of Colombus's son. It is a poor city but I think it is worth to get out the resort at least for a day and get to know the country you visit. The trip is arranged by many travel agents, can be booked at the main lobby, we paid 72 USD per person.There is also a complimentary shuttle from the main lobby to a casino nearby. It is small but still we had a lot of fun especially playing blackjack. In the shuttle they give 20 dolar worth of free coupons per person.  Health: Medications are over the counter in DR and the hotel has a pharmacy and a doctor if needed. Still I brought some medications for pain, itching, diarhea and nausea from US. Make sure you bring mosquito repellents with you as there are many mosquitos around. We also took prophylactic medication for malaria. If you will not leave the hotel resort then malaria prophylaxis is not recommended as there have been very few cases from the resorts, but malaria is endemic in DR so if you are planning to go out of the resort and go around then you need to take malaria prophylaxis, so you need to see your doctor about 4 weeks prior to your trip to get your prescription. Before I went to this hotel, I was tired, stressed and overworked, needed a real vacation. I got what I needed, I stepped into a world of clean, beautiful beach, pools, unlimited food and drinks, lovely people. I did not even carry a purse or ID with me. Just the wrist band given from the hotel reception to all the guests.....I highly recommend this hotel. We probably will not be able to go back again because we are planning to explore other countries for our next vacations.

<Content>Great Deal and Great Place Me and my 3 girlfriends had a great time here! The rooms were very clean, good water pressure and they refilled the mini bar everyday. The people at the front desk were very attentive and the dolphin excursion was well worth the money. The help waits on you hand and foot and they are very nice and appreciative. The food was good. the steak place was the best and the pasta at the buffet was surprisingly better than a lot of restaurants I have been to. The mexican place was also very good. it would have been nice if there was more of a night life but it was sufficient for the time that we were there. they played good music in the club and the piano bar was nice in the caribe. the tv in the room was staticky and the room needed a little more light. also there was no alarm clock but they were very good with the wake up calls. the guys on the beach were a little shady when you took out the kayaks b/c they didn't even give you life jackets but it was free of charge. bottled water, all drinks, beer, wine and even shots are all included which i couldn't believe. I would def return b/c the beach was beautiful although it would have been nice if they played music on the beach. overall had a great time, great get away for 5 days.

<Content>NOT WELL MAINTAINED We stayed at this resort in early Jan, 05. The grounds and pools are very nice and well maintained. Can't say so much for the rooms. If you go, don't let them put you in the Villas unless you don't mind a long walk. Next time we'll pay more and stay at a nicer place. Food was so-so. Enjoyed the OUtback Safari tour. If you like to see the island, be sure and do that.

<Content>Good Value for the money We visited for one week Feb.5th- Feb12th 2005 The rooms were not bad but could use some modernization the beds were hard and not very comfortable the pillows were flat the comforters were old looking.The bathroom and the dresser in our room had ants but we brought our own bug spray and that took care of them. The bathtub had been spray painted and was peeling also the stainless steel soap dish in the shower was very corroded and the caulk around the tub was not in good repair. Bring your own washcloths they don't seem to know what they are. There was a pretty good variety on the buffets although they seem to have many repeats such as carrots and french fries almost everyday but we always had enough to eat.The evening entertainment was nothing to brag about in fact it was boring to say the least. The bartenders obviously look at women as a lower human being as they would wait on every man standing at the bar before they would so rudely wait on a women. Not many people spoke english so we almost felt like aliens from another planet. The beach was beautiful and because of that we would go there again and hopefully by that time they would have done more renovation.

<Content>First Time ILL go back Just got back Jan 29th to Feb 5th The resort was very clean. The beach was alittle crowded but was raked every day and looked better then the Palace. tHE PEOPLE WERE VERY FRIENDLY!! The only people i had any problem with were the cheap people who wouildnt give the help a dollar because they were at an all inclusive. The bar tenders and maids make approx 4000 pesos a month which is about 160.00 US I gave the one guy two stuffed animals and a bag of suckers for his 4 children and he had tears in his eyes. The rooms were dated but clean. The water was reversed cold was hot but once you figured that out no problem.. There was more people from Europe then the U S Many women were topless on the beach. The weather was about 80 degrees in the sun but two of the days it was windy about 35mph.The food was ok and you could always find something to eat. The beach always had hotdogs fish hamburgers salad cake mussles. The beer was cold and flowing . If your looking for lobster you pay 20.00 for a dinner for that This is a 3 apple rating and for the money we had a very good time. I never saw so many people particapate in beach activities The service was fast and friendly. Again I say if you have short hands and deep pockets you may not enjoy yourself remember this is a poor country and give them a buck or two. Hope this helps you out. Ill go back agian !!!! This property was taken over by new management and is called IFA Bavaro Villas and is good value for the money.

<Content>3 Apple and no more. Ok, I just stayed at this resort from Dec 31-Jan 7th. The apple rep was there every night so if you had questions, she was very very helpful! The rooms were always clean before dinner. The pools are nice and it's so easy and quick to get to the beach. You don't have to ride a trolley, just walk! The only problem we had their was that the hotel tried to let somebody else check into our room at 1am!!! Yes, our room must not have been on the 'occupied' list! We told the front desk about this, they didn't help us solve the problem, and to know that this happened could happen again! Other than the room escapade, the resort was defitnly a 3 apple and nothing more. Thank you for reading this!

<Content>Fell in love with D.R. way of life!!! My friend and I travelled to the Dominican Republic Nov 20, 2003. Our flight there was excellent, the transportation provided to the resort was great as well. Our check in was prompt and the service was excellent. Both my friend and I only speak English and had no difficulty communicating with the staff. We spent most of our time at the Bar Margarita and had the best food and friendly service at the Las Careyna's? buffet (closest to the Margarita Bar). Our room was kept clean and towel art was a regular occurence on our beds. We had no problems with air conditioning but did find that hot water could be hard to come by just before traditional mealtimes(8am/5-6pm)but otherwise our stay was excellent!! The resort grounds were immaculate as was the beach, not an ounce of seaweed or garbage to be found. I will definately go back and stay at this resort as well as recommend it to others!! I made some great friends while on this trip, including some locals that I have kept in touch with. I am looking forward to going back early 2005. We also took a couple of day trips outside the resort as well as attending a club that allows locals, what a blast! Email me for photos or suggestions.

<Content>Paradise for the right Price We visited this resort June 20-27, 2004 for our honeymoon. Our flights were on time, no delays, and check-in was a breeze. From the moment we arrived, we noticed the kindness and friendly atmosphere from the people who worked there. Our room was in the little villas which was very private and very clean. Contrary to a few other reviews I've read, there were absolutely no insects of any kind in our room. Nor were there any in the rooms of the many people we met there. I took the advice of travelers who went before me ... I left a small gift for our maid - Esther - every day. She was so very sweet. Every day she left fresh flowers in a glass of water on the bathroom sink. One day she made a little trail of flowers along the edge of the bathtub and on the sink counter. Another day, she made swans out of the bathtowels and put them in the middle of the bed. This reflected the positive attitude and helpfulness of every employee we met on this resort. The first day we were there, we came back to our room to find a gift of fresh fruit and a bottle of rum with a letter from the management congratulating us on our marriage. How thoughtful was that? :)You've all heard many stories about the food. For breakfast, I had a freshly made omelet everyday with a variety of meats, vegetables, and cheeses to choose from. Every meal offered a huge variety of breads, rolls, crescents, and biscuits. There is a cold food bar with different salads. There is a fresh fruit bar. The hot food bar always had a beef dish, fish of some kind, chicken and/or ham. There is a pasta bar with different kinds of sauces and a chef to cook it for you. Was the food gourmet quality? No. Did you pay for gourmet quality? No. But the food is good and plentiful. And we never got sick the entire time we were there. We kept bottled water in our refrigerator in our room and used that to brush our teeth, just in case.The beach is beautiful. It takes no more than 10 or 15 minutes to walk through the resort to the beach. There is also a shuttle that will take you back and forth for free. The sand is sugar white and very soft, the water is crystal clear and very blue. There are plenty of beach chairs and free beach towels from the resort. Yes there were a few topless women on the beach. And they didn't think anything of it. There was no complete nudity, just topless women. If this offends you for some odd reason, either get over it or don't go to the beach. The beach market area can be as fun as you make it. No price is final. Have some fun and barter with these shopowners. If you don't want bothered as you're walking, just put up your hand and they will leave you alone. They will be pushy as much as you permit them to. If you seem like the type they can pester until you give in, they will. If you let them know that you're not interested, they will pretty much leave you alone. Again, if you don't want to deal with this, then don't go there. But if you're good at bartering, you can get some unbelievable bargains. We did.As far as excursions, we did the Outback Safari which was the best day we had. You really get to see how Dominicans live and work. It was a blast. We also did the catamaran to the private island for a day. That was also very nice and you see some of the most beautiful beaches. Stay away from Manati Park. This place has several violations for mistreating animals. The dolphins are kept in a small tank 24/7 and they are very overcrowded. Please boycott this park. If they go out of business, these sea creatures will be turned loose in the ocean where they belong.We paid $600 pp for 8 days 7 nights. It was a last minute deal. If you want save a bundle, book it within 2 weeks of leaving. In my opinion, we got way more than we expected.

<Content>Good bang for the buck Winter 2003 Hotel Barcelo bavaro villas in Punta Cana Republic Dominican.Room: Room was ok. Clean with nothing special with a mini bar.Garden: Garden was nice.Pool: Pools where good. Nothing special but good.Beach: Beach was outstanding, extremely wide and with lots of mature palm trees. Crystal clear waters with some sea grass.Food: food was ok with lots of variety at the buffet to choose from.Bars/Drinks: Drinks where good. But the pina colada and other fruit drinks where in a slush dispenser and absolutely undrinkable! Service was 2-3 minutes wait.Activities: went to Santo Domingo. Very boring. Little to see and a very long 3-hour bus tour to get there. Avoid it!!!.We also did a safari/boat ride to the island of Catalina. It was fun. But I would recommend the catamaran excursion (no safari) much better from what I heard. General appreciation: Very nice trip. Nothing fancy. We got what we wanted and paid for.Note:Stayed 14 days (for a very good price)***********************************Rating50 --------- Stay away50-60 ------- Not recommended60-70 ------- good (enjoyable vacation, go if price is low )70-80 ------- very good80-90 ------- outstanding90-100 ------ paradise***********************************room 12/20garden 3/5pool 7/10beach 12/15food 16/20bars/drinks 4/10activities (outside hotel) 4/10general appreciation 8/10------------------------------------  66/10060-70 ------- good (enjoyable vacation, go if price is low)

<Content>Loved it We just back from this resort and it was great. The weather was beautiful-sunny, hot and in the high 80's close to 90. The food is excellent but then again I am not a picky eater at all. We never went hungry. The beach and pools are beatiful. There is a huge language barrier since most of the employees speak Spanish. I was happy to get someone who spoke English. Bring dollar bills since it's easier to work with but I am sure they will change your money. I preferred not to have any pesos since I didn't want to get stuck with them. Bargain and haggle with the guys at the beach shops since they will work with you. They do pressure you a bit but I told them that I didn't want any pressure. We dealt with one guy that we bought T-shirts from and he was excellent. I told him that I would come back after looking around which I did. I understand they are making a living but sometimes they are too much. If you have a price in mind, try and work with them. Stand your ground and don't give in. They most likely will come around. I was able to get a carton of Marlboro Lights for $12 (US). My fiance and I enjoy the beachy atmosphere so we laid low. We went on a paddleboat but it was too windy so we got stuck. I jumped in and freed the rope and we returned the boat. I wish the workers n the beach would have told us before we rented the boat but we can only live and learn. I suggest you bring extra toilet paper since the resort has some that feels like paper towels. Bring your own tissues and wash cloths since they don't provide any. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and brought the maid a little plastic bag full of crayons, pencils, pads, soaps and hair clips. I left it for her the day before we left. It's a third world country so they are very appreciative of little gifts. If you want to make their day, I would recommend doing it. I bought some items at the $1 store and packed up in a little case. I didn't want anything in return but just to help out since they work very, very hard down there.One pool was being renovated and the workers were there for 12 hours during the day and night. We actually felt bad for them but they were doing a great job with the renovations.We took a picture with a little money from a photographer on the beach and the it came out good so we bought it for $6 which was reasonable I thought.We had an amazing relaxing 4 days/3 nights so I have no major complaints. We made the most out of it and did the best we could.We took a shuttle to the Barcelo Casino which isn't too big but they have slots and tables and it's nice and cold in there. We only spent $20 so no major loss there. We took a taxi back since the shuttle leaves and picks up every 3 hours. The last shuttle leaves at 10 pm and picks up at 1 am. We didn't want to stay that long so we took a $5 taxi and tipped him $2. He spoke no English but we did make it back to the resort. The Villas Resort has a mixture of Americans and Europeans. Some tourists were rude but that can happen anywhere at any time.I do recommend this resort but if you can learn some Spanish beforehand you are better off. I wish I knew more than a few obvious words.I do believe that the male workers were more friendly than the female workers but that was my own opinion and observation.They do need to have more nightlife and nightly shows. They have one at 10 pm and the disco opens from 11:30-3 am. We were in a room on the beach so we heard the music. It was great when the air conditioning kicked in so it drowned out the music. It's a nice, beachy, friendly atmosphere. The check in was a nightmare but we believe since it's a holiday weekend that the staff was overwhelmed and not enough rooms were available. Check out was a breeze though.For the price we paid $530 pp for 4 days/3 nights all inclusive was well worth it. It was a fun, relaxing time and much deserved rest. Just some sun, fun, beach and pool. That's all we needed and all we wanted.

<Content>Loved Bavaro Villas I have to say the poor reviews out there about this place are wrong!I have been to this resort 3 times now and I love it, it is priced fabulously! The rooms are average but really you're not there to sit in your room are you? You are right on the Bavaro beach which is to die for! Crystal clear water, you can snorkel right off your own beach, my husband and I bring our own from home, so you don't have to wait for equipment!The food is great, but I guess some are pickier than others, I have been to other resorts along the beach and yes there are 5 stars out there that you are paying allot more money for but really I don't see a huge difference some but not worth double the price!There is a market right on the beach and I have seen reviews of too expensive for souveniers! Are you nuts! You need to barter with them first, and I have always walked away with beautiful gifts to bring home to everyone I know they are such good deals. You do need to watch out and not buy cigars on the beach and the local travel agents at the resorts will warn you to, they are not the good ones, we found the best on a tour of a cigar factory, not a museum but the actual factory for amazing prices you can't get anywhere! ($50us)It is a poor country and we always tipped our maids in money or what we did was take things from home like, crayons for the kids, small lotions and things that are like luxury to them but everyday to us, let me tell you your service will skyrocket from this!We are returning for a 4th time this coming winter and can't wait, the entertainment team even know us now when we return...do we get that here???It's truly worht the great deals don't be afraid!

<Content>Great Time, isolated in complex We stayed the week of July 23 thru July 30 2004. We has a great time, for the price you could not beat it. The food was not great but we expected the worse and we were surprised it was not too bad. We did not have any trouble getting drinks even four at a time. Some of the staff were grumpy but most were pleasant. We found very few americans but alot of europeans. Just a few tips, bring a beach umbrella(you'll be glad) none for rent. There are no close ATM machines and if you do find them they will give Dominican dollars. There are safes in the room but you need to pay $9.00 per week for the key and lock. If you go looking for deals on cigars forget it. Any cigar I found in the Domincan Republic can be bought for half the price in the USA. They do have beach towels and beach chairs. The beach was beautiful, very little shade. A trolley runs back and forth from the beach since it is quite a hike. Prices for souvenirs are very high. Have fun!

<Content>Great value, great time My husband and I stayed here 6/5/04 -6/12/04. we had a wonderful time. I was a little apprehensive because we got a great deal. Our room was far from the action, but we liked being away from the hussle and bussle. The beach and pools are clean. The food was average, but I did not come home feeling like I gained 10 lbs, either. That was nice. Drinks were fine. My husband is not a beach person, at all, but at his suggestion, we will be returning in October. I thought we might try another property, but we were pleased here. Would I enjoy another resort twice as much ? Because we would pay about 2x to stay at RUI or Iberostar. We were happy here, and it is a great value for your money.

<Content>Pleasent surprise! to be honest I was a little concerned reading some of the reviews leading up to my trip. my trip was from from 7/11/04- 7/17/04. I must say everything was great. At the check-in we had a bit of an extra wait (20 min.), which is something they could improve on. The room was between the large pool and the beach, which made it a quick walk to either one. The food was good, specially at the beach in the afternoon (talk about pigging out!), and also at the beach at night. The Gourmet restaurant was terrific (ac, the whole nine), and we were only charged for the wine and Lobster. The room was clean, no bugs or animals. The late afternoon pizza and hot dogs were fun and the beach was great. I was really concerned about drinking the water and getting food poisoning, but none of us got sick-or close to it. I think some people are just never happy with anything in life.

<Content>Barcelo Villas Bavaro was Great! A girlfriend and I went to the villas for eight days and we had a blast. At first they put us in this room sooo far away so we complained and got a much better one. Other than that and the bad service at the pool bar I have no other complaints. We laid out everyday and never had a problem getting chairs, drinks were great (you have to tell them to include rum) and the people were very friendly. We ate like pigs and didnt get sick not once. They have fresh pizza everyday at 4 o'clock and it is so good. Then on Thursdays they have a market day in the pool area where you can buy a whole bunch of stuff, just make sure you bargain with them or they will rip you off! Ok well we were sad to leave but I'll definately be going back again as soon as I can afford it!

<Content>nicely surprised Last year we stayed for 3 days at rui naiboa.We decided we were willing to try a different resort for our vacation this year.It was 7 days July 3-10 we paid total of 1502.00for 2 people we opted for no travel ins.I must say the evening we arrived i feared the worst i had a very negitave feeling about it mostly because we enjoy nabioa so much last year and it already was not as polished as rui naiboa was but i didnt say a word.Bye the way i did request building 3400 or 4300 when we scheduled the trip and i called 2 days before we left and talked to ismeal at the front desk and he said he would make sure we had a great room.when we arrived i asked for him and he gave us 3419 and i gave him 10.00.our room was great location realated to beach, food, pool.to sum it all up.the beach was great :it did have sea grass and last year naiboa had clean water and clean beach so i was alittle disappointed but i got used to it.the food in my opinion was better than naiboa.im sure people can complain about it but i thought it was fine.the al cart was nice for a taste of america we ate there 2 of 7 evenings REMEMBER MAKE RESERVATIONS AT 12:00 FOR THAT NEXT EVENING.THE THINGS ON THE MENU MARKED WITH AN * YOU HAD TO PAY FOR everything else is no charge.the animation crew was really nice i enjoyed their energy they were great.all things considered i had a great vacation at this property i was pleasently surprised.Naiboa was more service oriented and there were more aminities there even the surroundings were nicer but i have to say for the money i have nothing bad to say about this place and if the price was right i would go back again in a heartbeat it was great.our weather was perfectno bugs in my room no stomach trouble no funny smells.advice: rooms in 3400 to 4400 section closer to beach take a big mug for water or drinkslots of sunscreen and some bug spraydont over pack maybe your own pillow they were lumpywe took a float but it was too much work to keep it away from shore.take your own good snorkel we did take our own but we bought them at walmart and they were crapwhen we tried to put them on our heads they fell apart and when we tried to use some the property has they were always out.well i guess thats it have fun

<Content>great trip We went to barcelo villas on March 26.2004.My boyfirend and I had a wonderful time. We stayed for one week. First of all, I want to immediately respond to a review from a person from Lebanon,Pa. These peoplecouldn.t be farther from the truth.We have traveled all over the carribean and this place wasn.t anywhere nearthe way these people described it.For instance,the Dominican people are the friendlliest we have ever met.Second of all (we actually started laughing when we read this remark) There are armed guards with gunsand sticks that made obscene gestures at us.The onlysecurity people were on the outskirts of the complex whose duty was only to keep non guests off the premises.These security people did nothing but smile and say ohla.We were there for one week and never had any problem getting bottled water not even once.As a matter of fact,sometimes we would go to the bar and get five waters at a time.We saw not even one bug in our room all week.To be fair,there are a couple of things that these people had correct.The food is ok,but nothing spectular.Also there are Europeans on the beach that are topless.You know what,put on your shades,and get over it its not that big of a deal.The beach is absolutely beautiful with alot of palm trees and gorgeous white sand.This is not the fanciest resort in the world by far,but if you want a relaxing vacation for an extremely good price this is the place. It just aggravates me when I read some of these reviews that couldn,t be farther from the truth.My advice to some people would be if your miserable and unhappy upon your departure,stay home,the resortand its guests would greatly appreciate it!.Sincerely a happy couple from Rhode Island Nancy and Jay

<Content>Pretty good for the price! We went for 3 nights June 27-30. Went for my mother's 75 b-day. had a blast 4 women in Punta Cana. Was glad to read reviews we new what to except. the hotel was clean no bugs food was ok but most of these all Inclusive are buffetts are ok. The grill at the beach was good and pizza at 3:00 was a fun snack. The drinks were good. but drank more beer than I ever have. The beaches are the best white sand and palm trees cover all. the weather and water was warm. rained once at night.We went to lay in the sun, eat and drink we did all and had a blast. It was not a 5 or 6 star but I guess for the price i did not except it to be. We felt it was worth the money we paid. I would go back, but I like to go to different places and try different hotels.. Have stayed at a Barcelo in Mexico was nice.

<Content>Villas, Not Very Good:( My husband and I went to the Barcelo Villas for 7 nights from May 21st-28th with our two daughters (4 and 1) and my sister and her friend (both 19). I have been telling everyone the same thing its the most beautiful place I have visited, but probably my worse vacation. I have a long story, but I will try to make it short. Originally, I booked this trip back in Feb 2004 off an early bird special for $679 pp (not including taxes) so I thought it was great for 7 nights, but come May when my sister booked it the price dropped to $379 pp. I felt so ripped off I contacted the travel agency (Apple Vacations) but no refund offered due to not having bought travel insurance (don't know what that has to do with higher price?). Anyway, that was a sign of the bad trip ahead. At the airport (BWI) we had a seven-hour delay on USA 3000. I am surprised to not have seen any reviews from some of the passengers but we are still trying to recuperate from the trip. Reason for the delay, no plane. It was a wasted day with no explanation from Apple Vacations and a lot of frustration from the passengers, at least we gotbreakfast vouchers. Instead of arriving at breakfast we got to Punta Cana at dinner. We also had a four-hour delay on our return trip (talk about throwing salt to injury), again no plane. They gave our plane away and hoped we would get another. It was so hard at the airport with two small children. I wrote a letter to Apple Vacations consumer affairs and just got back $100 Apple Vacation gift certificates each to use on our next trip. Punta Cana is a beautiful place. It is a very poor country, but the beach is absolutely breath-taking with 40 foot palm trees all the way down to the water. The first two days we were there the beach was extremely windy (sand going in our eyes) and the water was too cold. I thought this sucks, I came all the way here and I can't swim. Turns out the worse devastation to strike DR occurred on Monday when flooding killed thousands of people along a river bordering DR and Haiti. It was all over the news and flags flew at half-staff. After that the beach was no longer windy and the water became warm. The only thing I didn't like about Punta Cana, is that you can't leave the resort. It鈥檚 not safe. You are basically trapped if you do not do excursions. We went to Manati Park (fun shows and great animals) highly recommended. PC, is not likeCancun where you can walk around town or take a bus and go out on your own. There is no city to visit unless you want to go to Romana or Santa Domingo (too far). You are stuck in the resort. Now, if the resort was great that would not be a problem, but this was in the states what you would call a 2 star at best. Let me start with the rooms. As you have read on previous reviews the hotel layout is narrow going away from the ocean. The Ocean Village is the closest to the ocean, than the Village and than all the way in the back (I mean all the way) is the Villas. The ones all the way in the back are 30 minutes to the beach (I timed it) but they are for the staff and not for guests. The staff works 11 days straight and goes home for 3 days. So, its about 15-20 minutes at the beginning of the Villas. If you don't mind Geckos and a long walk stay at the Villas, but we had small children so the Village worked well. We were ready with our tip to get a better room at the Villas and to my surprise we got a room in the Village. The front desk would not accept a tip. I gave him American candy, he seemed surprised. The room seemed great, it was right in front of the Village pool (very shallow and great for small children) and directly in front of the snack bar. We always got pizza first. Our room turned out to be infested with everything possible. We started with mosquitoes, moths, biting ants and than cockroaches ranging from babies to extremely large. I threw away my husbands flip-flops b/c he killed so many and now he is mad at me b/c he liked them so much. It was really bad guys. I walked around with shoes all the time. I left our area to get away from the cicadas (17-yearlocust hitting Mid-Atlantic States) and came back not afraid. I literally killed 20 bugs a day and my husband, God knows how many. The worse was when the ants crawled up to our beds (we moved the beds away from the wall) or when the extremely large cockroaches got away and we could not catch them. I had nightmares that they would crawl up on me. I told my husband about some of the reviewers stating they had bugs but, I didn't think it would be a problem and he was mad that we stayed there. My sister and her friend on the other hand did not have any bugs in there room, but a monkey outside their balcony that wokethem up at 8am every morning. The big problem was that we could not be out all day in the sun with small children and we could not stay in theroom b/c of all the bugs. By the time we finished killing everything, the next day the maid would leave the doors open while cleaning and more would get in. Believe me we never opened the balcony door and or let things in, but there were definitely some holes around the room that were letting them in. One lady told us she had a spider living in her mattress that bit her so bad she had to go to the doctor on site for injections for her swelling. They charged her $100 for each visit. Hope you get a room with no bugs. At least this experience has made me tough.I was looking forward to the eating out everyday b/c I was tired of cooking at home and needed a break. I would have been happy with anything, but I actually was happy to be home again. I can't believe I said that, but the food was pretty bad. I never went hungry but I didn't like the selections. I ate mostly bread (tons of it on the buffet) and fruits. Please take Imodium with you; all of us (except the kids-thank goodness) got traveler's sickness. If it weren鈥檛 for Imodium we would be stuck in our room the whole time. My husband didn't say much about the food; he just didn't eat too much. The teenagers hated it and my small children ate it but pushed most things aside. My husband is from South American and I from the Middle East so we are familiar with non-American food. We love food from all over the world; it was not that, it just wasn't good. Also, the one restaurant was closed down the week wewere there for renovations so we only had three to pick from. The restaurants do not have doors and windows so the bugs get in, especially the one near the Villas. The food is directly in front ofthe open space. I got to a point where I pushed the bug (still alive) off my plate and continued eating. The drinks are pretty watered down so be prepared (coke taste like coke+water and pina colada tastes as bad as the ones I make at home). I still drank them. The entertainment was great, really funny contests, but some nights it was the same and we left early. We went to the disco a couple of nights and it was okay. The staff is friendly, some too flirtatious with my sister and her friend. Theygot annoying after a while. Beware of the markets on the beach, you do not get much of a bargain, just hassle. I went once and never returned, I don't like pushy people and shopped at the gift stores. My sister and her friend got a lot of stuff and some stuff for the same price I did. They give you tons of free necklaces though. Be careful buying cigars too, we got stopped at BWI. We bought DR cigars but the one cop said they were grown from the cochiba seed which is from Cuba so we have to throw them away. Than the head cop said it was okay b/c it was made in the DR. They made some lady throw away $600 of cochiba cigars. Tips: If you can, don't bring babies or children under 2 years old, hahaha...Ours ate sand all day, didn't like eating at restaurants and didn't let us have a good time. The hotel is old and if it wasn't for the great landscaping it would not be very nice. I noticed it was the least expense hotel in the Punta Cana, so don't be surprised. Upgrade to a better hotel if you can, seriously. I agreed with most of the advice on the other reviews except tip with money not gifts. I left a different gift everyday for our maids and to other workers and they all looked at me funny. The gifts were worth more than a few dollars, but money works best for them. I would go to Punta Cana again but never, neverstay at this hotel again. On the way home, all the other passengers raved about their hotels and all of us at the Barcelo stayed quiet. I don't believe you get what you paid for b/c I paid double what other people did for the same hotel, but read reviews and check the internet before making a reservation here. We were ready to go home by the second day, but we stuck it out and we definitely had good times as well as bad times. Make the best of your trip and have fun as we tried to do!!!:)

<Content>Beautiful My husband and I just returned from 7 nights at the Barcelo Villas Bavaro, Dominican Republic. I would not use Charm City Travel again. We flew into La Romana airport which is an hour and a half ride from the resort. This was nice because you got to see a few towns and some of the country. We flew on USA 3000 airlines. Great airline. Nice planes and we got food.  The resort is beautiful with flowers and Palm Trees everywhere. It is also very large. The rooms were plain but clean. The air conditioning worked very well and there was plenty of very hot water. The pool by the Villas is the largest and prettiest. There is a stage near the pool where there is nightly entertainment. Around 7:30 or 8:00 pm there are clowns to entertain the children and the adult show starts around 10:00 pm. The Villas are about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the beach which was great, giving us a chance to walk off all the food we ate. You walk past three pools and bars on the way. The food was better than I expected. A large variety at every meal and Pizza and hot dogs at the pool by the lobby at 3:30. There was ice cream and many desserts. The people were very friendly although they didn't speak very much English, but we managed to communicate with some Spanish words I had printed from the internet. The tour guides at the hotel and on excursions spoke English very well.We took the Jungle Safari tour which was about $70.00 a person. We visited a Dominican mid-income home, a cattle ranch where we had lunch, a place where they grow coffee and cocoa beans, a school and a public beach where we went boogie boarding. Our guide, Alex, made Cuba Libras (rum and coke) and Champagna (sprite and rum) on the whole trip. There was also Cervaza (beer) and soda and water. All included in the price as was lunch. It was a lot fun and interesting to see the countryside and get a feel for the country. We also took a speedboat snorkeling tour, $50.00. This was a lot of fun.Unless you like to be on the beach or at the pool, or play volleyball there isn't much to do at the resort. There are a lot of other things to do (tours) but they will cost extra. There is also a Casino which we didn't get to go to. Of course you can always sit by the bars.Bring a lot of $1.00 bills. You will need these for tipping. These people are very poor and the tips really help them We didn't change our money into pesos and had no trouble. Most places gave us US dollars in change. At the time we were there (June 5th - 12th) it was 48 pesos to the US dollar but it changes daily.It was hot but there was usually a breeze. The beach is gorgeous. There is not much shade on the beach and no umbrellas. The Palm trees are very tall and provide enough shade for two lounge chairs, which you have to keep moving with the sun. You need Sun Screen 40 or 50. We had to buy it there and it is very expensive. One of the stores wanted $26.00 for it. Bring it along. There is a small store near the pool closest to the beach where they will bargain so I got a small bottle of sunscreen for $15.00. Also bring washcloths. There aren't any.There was a little rain, but not much. It rained mostly at night. Really no problem with bugs; a few ants on the porch.We met a lot of nice people. There are people from many countries; England, Russia, Germany, France, Spanish speaking countries and the US. It was well worth the money.

<Content>Vacation from hell... My girlfriend and I traveled to This resort on May 10-17 2004, boy we thought we got a really good deal off the internet. --- We were mistaken! When we arrived our room was not ready when they initially told us it would be, not really a big problem, but it gets worse. After we got settled in we inspected the room to find rust in the shower, dirt on the floor, and a maid that could not understand a word of english. We decided to go for a few drinks at the pool bar--JOKE, they ignored you as if, they didn't see us, I had to get out of the pool to wait another 10 minutes to get a drink. Everytime I was waited on, they paused for a minute expecting a tip. I'm not cheep and this is All-Inclusive, but fair is fair and I tiped thinking it would increase there attention in my direction, and the drinks would be much easier to get,NOPE. They just took the tip and went about their business taking their good old time with other requests. I spoke to one of the travel agents down there and he said that they work 11 staight days with 11 hour shifts, then they get off for three days, soo that's why they are soo grumpy. I realized by the end of the trip that this is not a vacation for Americans, they tend to favor, Germans, French, Dustchland and pretty much any other European Native. On top[ of that if you are an average American who does not speak any spanish, this resort is not for you. On the beach, they never had any snorkel equiptment. They response would be  5 minitos, an hour later they are still saying 5 minitos! In conclusion; The Island is beautiful, the people suck, and the food sucks!!! My advice would be to bring alot of snacks, don't go to this resort, pay a few more hundred dollars and brush up on you Spanish! Good luck and I hope this helped you in your decision.

<Content>Take your own food!!! Just got back last night from Barcelo Villas after a 3 night mini-trip. All I can say is this place was a major disappointment. I knew going into it that it would not be THE RITZ, but I never expected what I found. The grounds and rooms were adequate, but we were in the #1200 villas which are as far as you can be from the beach (3/4 mile), pools, etc. They have guards with long sticks and guns draped over their chests who lurk around at night and make obscene gestures at you (there were 4 females on our trip) while standing 4 feet from your patio. I called the front desk to ask them to remove this guard from standing there because we were frightened and I was told they are there to provide a service. What a bonus for us! One of my friends twisted her ankle and we called the desk about 10 times in 2 hours to get her some ice. It seemed that there are only few people who can speak English at this resort and no ice ever arrived. I had to walk all the way to the reception, speak in my poor Spanish, just to procure ice after finally asking for the manager.As for the food, we were all repulsed -- choices were goat stew, lamb ragout, rabbit. After seeing those items, I was not going to trust something marked beef on the buffet. I lived on pizza at 3:30 everyday which was served at the main pool as my one and only food for 4 days!!! All of the alcohol was Normandy brand and the top shelf drinks were more than you would pay for them in NYC. The Presidente beer that was served on tapwas not all that bad, but it wasn't all that good either. They actually sold it in the stores on the hotel premises for 50 pesos a 6 pack. Funny, but 44 pesos is equivalent to $1US, so that pretty much explains the beer. I haven't drank such cheap beer since my college days!My two biggest grips are the hospitality you do NOT receive and the lack of bottled water. We did get a hint from another guest that a bartender guy named Sandy at the Margarita Bar was excellent and attentive once you tipped him. I gave him $10 one night and my friend gave him $5 the next so he was one of the few people who was actually attentive to us, most usually ignored us. As for water it is hit or miss, somethimes the bars have bottled water and sometimes not. Plus in the resturants you are always served tap water. Needless to say, 2 of us on the trip both had to visit our doctors today for a mega dose of z-pak to get rid of the bacteria that found its way into our bodies if you get my point.I have traveled extensively in the Carribean, Meditterean and Mexico and would not return to this resort if they paid me to visit it! We did manage to create our own fun and met some great people to hang out with and go to the disco later at night which is really fun, but hot since it is outside. At the disco they also never had bottled water.A word of caution for American families considering going here -- do keep in mind that most of the clientele is European so there will be a majority of the women on the beach going topless while wearing thongs. I am used to this and realize it is their culture, but I did speak to some people who were appalled with it.Take the snorkeling trip from the beach for $13 though. The fish on the reef are plentiful, but there are not as many different types as you would see in the Caymans or Mexico, but make sure they take you out to the caged sharks. That was cool swimming with them, and the variety of fish there is much greater.Next time I can book a trip so cheaply, I will pass and pay more for a higher rated hotel as people on our plane were raving about their 5 and 6 star hotels!!!!

<Content>Good Time, overall grade is a B! My girlfriend and I just got back from the Villas on the 11th of June. We paid $622/PP including tax, air out of Philly, transfers, drinks, and meals. We stayed in room 1229. This was our first all inclusive vacation although we are avid travelers. The flight there was smooth, we were very pleased with USA3000. The transfer to the hotel was smooth also, it was neat to see what the natives live like in terms of a house. Check in was smooth, everyone on the bus is checking in so it could take a little while. We were let into our room right away and then went right to tthe beach. The room was fine, no bugs as I have read on previous postings. The air worked for us but we did talk to another couple whose air did not work. Basically, it's a standard room with a tv and air. Besides sleeping, you are only in there to get ready usually or to take an afternoon nap. No complaints about the room. On to the beach, it was beautiful, everything you heard on this site is true about the beach. My only complaint was that there was quite a bit of seaweed in the water, everywhere actually, but not like it was horrible where you couldn't swim or anything, that's the beach, what are you gonna do ya know. The sand is white with pink speckles. There is a little hut on the beach right when you walk down from the hotel that serves lunch. The food is better at the other restaurants but if you are on the beach and want a quick eat you can find something. There is a restaurant right next to that where you can sit down to eat your lunch and also serves as a sit-down dinner joint. You have to make reservations for dinner between 12-3, they get booked fast. It's a sit down and a waiter comes and takes your order, just like going to eat in the states except it's free. I would reccomend going at least once. The lobster and seafood are not free. The menu will have a price for everything but you only pay for the seafood. You can order an appetizer, a meal, and a dessert, and of course drinks, it's all free. If you have a question about the item being included just ask. There is also a bar at the same area it usually is pretty full but no more than a 4 minute wait. To the right of the beach about 100 yards is a market. It is not part of Barcelo, there are vendors in there selling everything from cigarettes to alcohol, to jewelry, to crafts. They are a pain in the butt!! They will say everything to get you to come over and look at there stuff. They will start out at such ridiculous prices it's really unbelievable. So don't pay the original, or even close to it in most situations. They do have some deals but the Apple guy said there is no quality and usually that was obvious. Marlboros for $10 a carton. I got a $40 pair of earrings for $6 after bargaining. Simply show interest and negotiate, then walk away and say no gracias. They will yell for you back and give another price, then you can counter again. Be careful with the cigars because they can't be good if they are in the heat all day ya know. There are shops on the resort grounds that are priced decently and will give you an idea of what you can expect to pay. The cigar shop on the resort does bargain with you if you try, so try. The others I couldn't negotiate with. But I did most of my shopping on the resort because I trusted them more. And shop around on the resort too, there are some places you wil find better deals by almost half the price. I found the shop by the towel exchange to be the cheapest. As for the food. Like they say, it's not gourmet. That is close to an understatement. I love to eat. I am not picky at all. I did get full every night, my girlfriend is careful of what she eats and usually did not have a problem. Like the posting before said. At breakfast you can get fresh made omletes. You can pick from onions, tomatoes, spam, greenpeppers, and cheese. My advice get creative. They have bacon out at the buffet line. I cut some up and had them throw it in there for me. I ate mostly the freshly prepared items and would reccomend that course of action. At dinner they have a freshly prepared pasta line with a choice of red or white sauce, then the tomato or onion thing, and they toss it up over high heat for you in a pan. I added the freshly made chicken usually to the pasta dish it was good. Some night I could only find 2 things I liked and just ate a bunch of that whatever it was. You won't go hungry. But somethings arequite rough looking and tasting. They do use spam alot, or there processed version of spam. By the barpool near reception there is a hut that serves pizza from 4-6, it is ok and will serve as a good snack. Don't eat the hot dogs, they are that spam stuff once again. To sum up the food, it was ok, I ate well, and I did not go hungry. The food is not gonna be the highlight of your trip, the hotel and beach will be. Try all the restaurants out, see which one you like best and go from there, we had a rotation going and it seemed to work. There are 4 restaurants in all along with 4 bars. The drinks were excellent! The pina colada's were amazing, I drank them all the time. They come out of the mixer with no alocohol if you want alcohol simply ask con alcohol porfavor There is only one kind of beer, Presidente, it's a pretty good beer. As for the resort, it was nice, they had 2 very nice pools and the workers did do a good job of keeping it clean. They do work hard out there in the sun. I always tried to say hola! Everyone was nice, the wait staff, the workers, and everyone. Some were not as friendly, but none were rude. Now it's time for my suggestions: Take sunblock and apply it liberally and often. And make sure you take at least 2 bottles. We went through one 8 ounce bottle the whole trip, but my girlfriend didn't use it all that much. The cost of forgettting it will be sunburn that you won't forget and $20 (That's how much a 6 oz. bottle costs at all the shops). Take mosquito repellent! You will need it. Not during the day. Just from dawn till dusk. If you plan on going out at night, bring it. Even for the walk to dinner. Take pepto, immodium, benadryl, and tums, or similar products. They have a doctor there that costs money. I could only imagine how much. We took all our own toiletries, but they have shampoo and conditoner there. Don't know how good it is but it's there. I would say take a bar of your own soap though, can't hurt. Don't take big bills, there is no need. I didn't change a single dollar over to pesos, US dollars are widely accepted. More advice, learn a little spanish, just a few words if you don't know already. Hola!(hello), gracias(thank you), por favor(please), adios(goodbye). I bought a spanish phrase book just cause I felt like it here in the states for $7, it's called Rick Steven's something Spanish, it for Spain but it works and I had fun trying to communicate. I like to immerse myslef in the culture. I read it and it was nice to be able to say certain things to them like buenos diaz(good morning). The staff at reception speaks english. Most people speak a little. There is a language barrier obviously. It's up to you how big you want it to be. If you don't know how to speak a single word you will still be fine, you may have more difficult of a time, but not much more. Don't drink the water, there is bottled water at the bars for free. Near reception there is a towel exchange open from 7-7. Don't lose your towel, it's $15 if you do. We tipped the maid the first 2 days, it didn't seem to help, actually make things worse so we stopped. Not that it was bad but she sometimes forgot towels, then sometimes forgot the blanket. Nothing that held us up or inconvienced us for long. We did not take any tours so I can't give any insight on those. Basically, take health supplies! If you are taking a good camera, you may want to opt for a disposable due to the sand that can tend to get messy if it gets mixed in with your camera bag. Also take a comfortable pair of sandals for the beach it is a walk to the beach not bad though, and they do have a bus. But make sure you know they won't give you problems. There are a lot of Europeans and they do walk around topless, at least half of the women on the beach are topless, old and young. Overall the trip was definitely worth it, and as others said, next time I would pay the extra money and upgrade to a 4 or 5 star. But for the price I would reccomend it. Like others have said, if you are looking for a place to relax on the beach, in the sun, and eat and drink and be merry, with no fuss. This is what you want. We did nothing but go to the beach and the pool and eat and drink. We did not drink much alcohol, but if you want to there is plenty available. The weather was amazing, it rained a few times, only once in the afternoon for not even 5 minutes, and a few times at night it poured but we were in bed by then. As for the grading scale, my girlfriend and I would grade as follows:Service - BFood - CResort - ABeach - ADrinks - BCleanliness -BOverall Value - B

<Content>Expected more services I returned June 7th from 4 nights at the Barcel贸 B谩varo Beach Resort. The resort is comprised of 5 hotels. We stayed at the Golf Hotel. The best thing about the Golf Hotel was our room had two bedrooms and two balconies and two thermostats for the a/c. My friend was able to stay in the room with the TV, fridge and closets while my room had the bathroom and sink (separate areas). The room was brown and dated as mentioned in a previous review. Actually the reviews were quite accurate depending on where you stayed. I must say the grounds were pretty (Golf was a bit rundown). More attention seemed to be paid to the Palace (Convention Center), the Casino and the Beach Resort. We didn鈥檛 get to see the Caribe at all and the Palace only from the reception area while waiting for a trolley. The trolley is the only way to get around and a definite necessity. Searching for good food was an ongoing problem. Our first meal there was at the Las Canas buffet. The pasta was good but that was all. The rest of the food looked like left overs from the night before and tasted worse. Lunch was so bad we skipped dinner. The next day we ventured out a little farther to the Beach Resort, which also had the Internet Caf茅, Hair Salon (Peluqueira) and a decent gift shop. I must say we spent most of our time at the Beach Resort because everything was just better there than the Golf. I don鈥檛 know why they call it the Golf because the golf course is really connected to the Casino. The Golf was like a place that the resort forgot about. The Staff were less than enthusiastic. Continental Breakfast was a sometimes thing. Sometimes it was there鈥ometimes it wasn鈥檛. Didn鈥檛 seem to have a particular time either. Drinks were lacking alcohol but if you wanted something sweet they served a purpose. Even when you asked for alcohol (in Spanish or English it didn鈥檛 matter) the drink seemed like water was added. This might be because we didn鈥檛 tip. But I didn鈥檛 see anyone else tip either except at the Hair Salon. Drinks were good in the Casino though.The second day we went to the Beach Resort and the Ambar Buffet for lunch. It was delicious. I wish there were microwaves in the room so you could take out whatever you found that was good to eat and save it for the hard times. We also went to the Peluqueira (Hair Salon). They do very nice work but the prices are higher than the Dominicans in New York. From there we sat at the bar by the beach and enjoyed the ocean breezes. Never did get drunk no matter how many drinks we ordered. That night we went back to the Ambar and found they were only serving seafood. So we tried the Steak House. Big mistake. The ribs weren鈥檛 good and the rib steak was so small and tough I had trouble eating it. Everything came to the table cold. I ordered a pizza and that was good.The third day we missed breakfast at the buffets and had the 鈥淐ontinental Breakfast鈥?at the hotel bar. It turned out to be better than the food served at the buffets. But that was not something to rely on since it wasn鈥檛 always available. The coffee is very strong (like espresso in NY) when you ask for espresso you get something close to sludge. We then went to the beach, which turned out to be the best part of the vacation. Nice hot sun with cool ocean breezes sweeping over you. Excellent! The beach was clean but the currents were a little strong. Not many people anywhere. Not on the beaches, not in the buffets or restaurants. Even the Tropical铆ssmo show was a little more than half full. The casino was empty but I did win a little more than I played on the slots so I consider myself coming out ahead. The Tropical铆ssmo show was good but all in Spanish. They did speak English and other languages when the show was over and they wanted you to try your luck at the Casino. English is definitely not spoken here. If you want anything you must speak the language. I don鈥檛 speak Spanish. My friend spoke Spanish and that was a help at times. Still didn鈥檛 get us any alcohol in our drinks.The restaurant in the Casino hotel (Mirador) was very good that night. One of the problems for me was that not all of the food is labeled so you have a difficult time determining what you are eating. I don鈥檛 eat pork and most meals had a lot of pork. Every night was an experience in trying to find something to eat. Thank goodness for the trolley. It was the only means of getting from one hotel to the next to find food and entertainment because nothing was happening at the Golf Hotel. After a few days you want to leap for joy when you see the trolley coming. Hotel check out was easy and the taxi to Punta Cana airport, although expensive, came quickly. Punta Cana airport is much nicer than Santo Domingo airport but be prepared to walk the entire length of the airport with your carry on luggage and keep in mind there are stairs to climb (no handicap accommodations) to the plane. Also, there is no a/c until you get to the Terminal.To summarize the vacation I would say that the Barcel贸 B谩varo Beach Resort was somewhat of a disappointment. I still like the Dominican Republic, but I would rather visit another resort that has a more friendly staff, much better food and drinks, cleaner accommodations and more English speaking staff. I would also have liked to see more activities for the guests at night. Besides the casino, only the Tropical铆ssmo show was offered for entertainment. For the money I paid I expected more FUN, Drinks and food.

<Content>Excellent value! Just came back from our 7-day trip on 6/5/04. We traveled with our kids, ages 1 and 4. Initially, we were placed in the Villas section, in the 1100s, which is quiet, but the rooms are smaller and it is a hike to the beach. The staff was very helpful, though, and moved us closer to the beach in the 3600 building located right at the middle pool. Mind you, that was an upgrade in price which was given to us totally free. Both rooms were spotless and made every day. The beach is wide, white, and filled with palm trees. We had 90 degrees and sun every single day, without a drop of rain. You can rent, for free, free sailboats, pedalboats, and kayaks, and even do some snorkeling. The food is pretty good, even though it is somewhat repetitive. I wouldn't spend too much time at the salad bar--a couple of times, at lunch, some of the salads smelled rotten. I loved the fresh grill that they have at lunch and dinner, as well as the fresh omellettes at breakfast prepared with your choice of ingredients. Drinks with lunch and dinner you get only after you request them a couple of times, or you risk getting your beer while eating dessert. The waitresses had trouble getting an order for six people, but were quite willing to bring more drinks once they figured they've messed up. Don't order the wine--it is really watered down. The beer is OK, though. Drinks at the bars are limitless and free, of course, and you can drink lots of them, since they mix in a ton of ice and barely any alcohol.My advice to anyne going to Punta Cana is to break $20 in singles before leaving from the US, and give $1 tips to everyone that helps you--guides, cleaning lady, porters, bartenders, etc. They were really pleased and we got pretty good service.

<Content>We loved our stay! - but resort could use some updating My husband and I just got back from our 7 night all inclusive vacation at this resort. We booked it through Apple Vacations at quite a low price at $1,028 for the 2 of us, with airfare included. This was a great deal, as the resort was nice and we had a wonderful time. However, because the resort could use some updating, next time I will pay the extra $$$ to get a 5 star place. I was worried about the charter flight to Punta Cana, but the flights on USA 3000 were smooth and very nice. I would definitely fly this way again, as it was very inexpensive, safe, nonstop, and much easier than flying on a conventional airline. The Apple reps met us at the airport and took us right to the resort. They were there at the resort the duration of our vacation, and that made things very easy when it came to getting information about the area, things to do and booking excursions. Apple is an excellent company - very organized and offer a low price-to-value product. I would definitely book with them again. The resort is a very pretty place, with gorgeous grounds and beach, and Tiki hut style buildings. I have to empasize that the beach was absolutely beautiful. There were elements of the resort though that were getting old and needing replacement. The rooms were cute with high wood ceilings, wicker furniture and white tiled floors, but they were well worn. The bedspreads could be replaced, and the bathrooms were getting mildewy and rusty. Also - while the pools were very pretty, there are places needing repair. The food was good and plentiful - just not gourmet. If I was a big eater I would have enjoyed the food more but next time I will probably not do all inclusive, as I got tired of the food by the end of the week. These elements did not take away from the quality of our vacation and everything was kept very clean - but they could have been better. On a positive note - this resort is a fun place to be. The service is always prompt and friendly. We loved the nightly shows and the mini disco show for the kids. We loved the disco on the beach. We met and hung out with a lot of friendly people the duration of the week. Also, we had a lot of fun on the excursions we went on - the Outback Safari tour and the Saona Island tour. I recommend both of them. People also enjoyed the snorkeling and Santo Domingo trips. The Dominican Republic is a lush, largely undeveloped country with friendly, hardworking people. I would like to go back to see more of it. To sum up - the vacation was inexpensive and fun, and you can't beat that. I will spend the extra money next time though to get more updated facilities.

<Content>not a 3 star May 27, 2004. This resort was a major disappointment. We will definately return to Punta Cana, but not here. We are not picky people, but folks who try to travel 4-5 times a year to Mexico or the Caribbean with a budget in mind. The room they put us in the 1000 building was full of mosquitos and ants. We ask to be moved and was treated very rude. We were not moved. No hot water in the room, etc. If this is Apples version of a 3 star, I cannot imagine what a 2 star would be like. I will post pics of the room on msn mexicobound. The food was not very good. No one would go hungry as they do have a variety of food, but how many ways can you cook spam? Two bars and one restaurant were being renovated while we were there. The beer is cold, the drinks are very bottom bar. Any top bar drink will cost you more than it does in the US. The staff was a mix of friendly and rude. However, this Country just suffered severe floods, and that could have played a part in the attitudes. The weather was beautiful while we were there. This trip was a cheapie so we basically got what we paid for. In the future I will pay a little more to avoid something like this. I was very thankful I did not book this for 7 nights and only 3. My advice would be that if you have traveled very much, try to avoid this resort. We have stayed at some extremely nice ones for not much more than this one. If any one has any questions, feel free to e-mail me. Also, if you shop in the beach area here, beware of the cuban cigars, as they are counterfeit. The USA3000 airline that we traveled on was great.

<Content>a lovely paradise My girlfriend and I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Villa from May 3rd-10th 2004. We found it to be clean, very well run with a courteous staff. The surrounding beach was very pretty. I would also suggest touring the other nearby surrounding hotels that you have access to, especially the Barcelo Palace, and the Barcelo Golf/Casino Hotels. The staff doesn't particularly go out of its way to inform you of the amenities it has, so keep asking or be prepared to explore on your own. We took two optional tours--one to santo domingo(it's 3 hours by bus), and the other to see a show called caribe caliente which is in a 16th century castle with an adjoining cave. The cost was $60.00 and $45.00 respectively. We were initially told that it cost $35.00 to go to the Barcelo casino (with free transportation). Actually, take a trolley from the palace (just a walk up the beach) and get in for free! The food was buffet style, a bit mediocre, the best of the eating places was through the stone pillar lobby, the worst was on the beach(we both got sick that nite...beef like shoe leather). the fish and chicken however were generally pretty good, and breakfasts were hearty. The entertainment was between 8 p.m.(a childrens' show), 9 p.m. ( a band featuring salsa and meringue music), and 10 p.m. a dance revue....the format was the same each evening. I thought it would've been nice if they had some entertainment other than pool volley ball in the late afternoon...or do what many did...sit at one of at least 3 bars. On the beach,.... more music, and you can exercise or do group dancing which was lots of fun.Dress was informal, even in the evening..you'll be in a bathing suit most of the day...be prepared for sudden rain showers If you're seeking a high energy vacation go elsewhere....if you truly want a slower relaxed pace in a beautiful setting, this is it. Also, regarding shopping...never settle for the first price on ANYTHING...the vendors (who are very aggressive) will come down the minute you show disinterest.

<Content>Great time! Two of us girls traveled alone here in the fall of '03. WE HAD A BLAST! The villas looked like little half houses. They had 2 queen beds in them..it was small, but you get what you pay for. The beds were a little lopsided, but we weren't expecting pure luxury. Spoiled people will complain, but those of us that just want to go and have fun will love this place. Its all paid for! All the food, all the liquor, beer. You wear a bracelet and show it to them, and you are set! I've never drank so much in my entire life! They are not shy on the amounts of liquor either! Its a mans dream! It is true about the mosquitos. Bring repelent and you'll be fine. The beach was a good walk..but if you dont feel like walking, there is a shuttle by the main lobby. The view on the way to the beach makes it well worth the walk. IT just depends on which villa you have really. We had one in the far back, but we'd just stop at a bar, grab a drink, walk to the next one, get a drink, then you're there! (ha ha)(true!)Don't be surprised when you get to the beach! Lots of topless women and thongs. Felt weird at first, but it grows on you. The beach is incredible! No seaweed...very clear and calm. Little fish everywhere. There is a daily exercise session/dance session in the mornings. The staff is sooo friendly, but I found myself one of the very few who didn't speak much Spanish. YOU should really study up on your Spanish. Very few know English...but will do what they can to help you. The main lobby people know all the languages. There is a disco on the beach at night and it is soo much fun. Teens will love this place b/c I did as an adult. The nightly shows were great too. Waitresses walk around and bring you any drink you want and plenty of it! You are treated as royalty at this place. The hotel may not be a castle, but you are treated as a king/queen here. Food is all over the place. There's 4 different restaurants......all of them being an open buffet. We love not having to pay for our meals,,we ate so much! All kinds of food. The bartenders were extremely friendly.....they sing to you, sing to the songs being played, throw the glasses up in the air, catching them behind their backs.....they just made things so much fun. The pools were breathtaking....most of them having little habiscus flowers floating in them. So pretty. Wait until you see this place! I'd go again in a heart beat. The only thing I didn't like about this place was leaving it!!!!!

<Content>Smiles and sun! Well where do we start? We arrived before we could check into our room in the Villas but not a problem for us - we changed into our bathing suits (be sure to put them in your carry ons!), had lunch and hit the beach! It literally takes your breath away when you see it for the first time. This beach is far better than Veradero, Cuba! This resort is made up of the Villas, the Village and the Ocean resort - you have access to all three! Checked into our room, and the fun began! We were very impressed with the service and the friendliness of the staff at this resort. They always say olah and smile! These people work very hard to keep all of us happy and it shows. We stayed in 1046 and while it was a little walk to some of the other bars, etc. we certainly didn't mind taking in the beautiful grounds which were very well kept! The rooms in the 3000s and 4000s were the closest to everything but they could also be the noisiest. The rooms were standard but very clean and we had lots of towels (we were good to our maid) - bring facecloths! We kept our mini fridge stocked with cold bottled water at all times. The buffet at the Villas (Las Cayenas) was our favourite buffet not to mention the excellent service and friendliness of Alberto, Francis, and others! We found this resort more of a family oriented resort but if you went with friends and wanted to party, you could certainly do that! There are shows every night and we liked them all. Loved the beer but found some of the drinks very sweet so we stuck to the daquiris and the bloody marys. We always found food we liked and the variety was very good - we ate at the beach grill most days which was great for lunch. Jose, Angel and Ramon were the bartenders who really stood out for us! Very friendly and fun. There were mostly French and German at this resort and some Canadians, didn't meet very few Americans. We did the Outback Safari Adventure Jeep Tour and that was a blast! Our tour guide, Andreas, was totally awesome and worked hard to see that we had fun! We saw this resort marked as a 3 1/2 star and also as a 4 star. We would definitely return to this resort - I honestly can't find anything to complain about. Great value for your money and something for everyone. Have a great time and just smile - you will receive smiles back!!! We love Punta Cana!!!Sherry

<Content>It's a Wonderful Life Last year on March 27-April 4th 2003, me, my dad, and my little sister went to Punta Cana. I love this place! It was fabulous. The service at the resort was excellent, and they were always so happy to help. The beach was right by our resort and was about a 15 minute walk. If you didn't feel like walking, they had Beach Buses. The beach was amazing! IT WAS GORGEOUS! We had the best and biggest beach around! We visited other beaches, they were nice, but, we had the BEST! The food was alright, but sometimes you have to watch out! The pool was excellent! They had a bar right in the middle so whenever you were thirsty you went right up and asked for a drink... and there you go! Our room was standard, but it worked for us!! Overall we all enjoyed staying there with the excellent service, great beaches, and great room! We are hoping to go back!
