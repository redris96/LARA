<Content>lovely hotel Nice hotel. Slightly out of centre at the end of the U1 U-bahn line. Very nice and fashionable hotel at a very reasonable price. Surrounding area bit run down but maybe only a 5 min walk from the fashionable Kurfendamm shopping area

<Content>Extremely good value, friendly staff, great breakfast! We got this hotel via priceline for a ridiculously low price. We stayed for four nights and would without doubt stay here again. Very serviceminded and friendly staff. The room was exceptionally clean with a big and beautiful bathroom. The lobby has free wi-fi, the breakfast was very good with a wide range to chose from, and the hours for serving breakfast was generous. This is situated in the heart of the center of west Berlin and it is easy to find nice shops, restaurants and caf茅es in an easy walking distance. Since the U-bahn and S-bahn is near and easy and comfortable to use it's easy to get to other parts of the town.

<Content>A Berlin Gem This was our first visit to Berlin (7-10 November 2008) for my daughter and myself. My daughter booked the weekend in Berlin for my birthday. She chose this hotel from a search on the web of the variety of hotels available in Berlin, then booked a flight with Ryanair and we made our way to the hotel via the rail link from Schonefeld Airport to Savignyplatz Station, a short walk from the hotel.We had read the reviews about this hotel on the web, which in certain cases gave some back feedback, unfounded in our case.I can honestly say we were apprehensive on arrival but on walking through the door, we were greeted by very friendly staff, who were professional in there approach to us and certainly went out of there way to make our three day stay a joy to behold. We booked breakfast for each morning (buffet style) the variety of food on offer was excellent and plentiful, (they had a special offer on at 8 euros each). We asked for a quite room and received one on the top floor (6th) to the back of the building facing a court yard. On walking in we were delighted with the colour scheme and the Andy Warhol theme, which is present through out the hotel (no we are not Andy Warhol fans).We found the whole of the hotels decor to be very pleasing on the eye. Cleanliness and comfort was first class along with TV and the usual mod cons. No tea/coffee maker in the room, which wasn't a problem This hotel is not central in Berlin but we walked right across Berlin, from the hotel in the west to the East Side Gallery (Berlin Wall). I work as a freelance in the Tourism and Travel sector as a Photojournalist so this was a great opportunity to capture many images of life around Berlin. Very pleased indeed with the hotel, staff, breakfasts and its position in Berlin. Would recommend it to any one visiting Berlin who needs to be in a quiet location.

<Content>Good base Visited Berlin in early May. Picked the Art'otel because had stayed at other properties and liked them. The property is unique due to the Warhol theme. Get prepared for some bright purples and greens. It's all in fun though. I would stay here again due to the surrounding neighborhoodsAs usual, the good, bad and ugly.The Good- Room was clean and fairly-well kept (a new paint job could be used). The room had essentials and was fine. Nothing too amazing - everything fairly standard. Room had good size closet along with a sizeable enough room. It had bed only and no room for separate sitting area.- Bathroom - sizeable and clean. Had decent shower.- Location for the price. The location is about a 10ish minute walk to city-center (West Berlin). The subway could be had in about half that time. - Neighborhoods surrounding the hotel. We ate each night in the neighborhood at great restaurants with good value. Do yourself a favor, and branch out around the hotel and find some of these jewels.- Front desk arranged van service to airport for 15 Euros. Pick up was on time and the ride was quite pleasant.The Bad- 16ish Euros each for breakfast. Too high priced in my eyes. While there was a decent selection of OK food, close cafes made it a no-brainer for following mornings.- Check-in. While the hostess did a nice quick job, she assigned a smoking room after asking for a non-smoking. When I went down to inform her, she was waiting for me. My thought is she could have met me on the floor, admitted the mistake and gave me new room keys versus waiting for me. There were multiple people behind the desk so leaving the front area should have been fine.- If you are planning on spending most of your time in East Berlin, this may not be the best place. While the public transportation system was excellent, it took us 40ish minutes to get from hotel to Alexanderplatz including one metro line change (bus system was on strike).- The towels. The smell of the clean towels was absolutely horrid. The typical vinegar-like smell is horrid. I do not understand why hotels do not spend a bit more to ensure fresh smelling towels or have no smell at all. The Art'otel is not the only hotel with this issue.The Ugly- Nothing.I would recommend this place as long as one is mobile and does not mind walking a bit.

<Content>Nice Arty hotel in good location I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights in Januay. Berlin was very nice. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is quite modern and very colourful. Staff were very friendly. The rooms were the tiniest we have ever seen. They were more than adequate though. Extremely clean and comfortable with the exception of the size. Bearing in mind the good price we paid for the room however the size did not really bother us. The location is excellent. Within a short walking distance of most things. The Hard Rock cafe is just around the corner and we found a nice little bar nearby with an amazing happy hour every night. The beers are huge!!! Would recommend this hotel and would stay in it again for the right price.

<Content>not so arty I read a few bad reviews before my stay in this hotel and now i can only confirm it. the personell is a bit rude, stains on the carpet show the lack of cleanliness, except the sleeping and showering there is not much else to do in this hotel - pay tv tops it all-obviously everything here is extra and very expensive. the location is great, cause it's really near ku'damm and a few excellent restaurants but other that that there is nothing else good about this hotel if you're used to real four (or three) stars - regarding german standards. i'm sure you can find a better 3/4* hotel in the same area for same price.

<Content>very disappointed Have just come back and was very disappointed. We got a room in the 1st floor and it was very noisy. The room was pretty small, very basic, the carpet was stained, the walls had many marks of what I guess are suitcases marks, and the shower floor had permanent dirt that didn't seem to come off. I would say that the only advantage of this hotel is it's central location. Would not suggest to stay there if you can afford some thing better! Looking back I would have preffered to pay more and get a better hotel.

<Content>Good value hotel Very good value - we got a deal on Expedia and were pleasantly suprised by the hotel. It was very clean and comfortable and very centrally based in the main shopping district. The main tourist attractions are based in the Mitte; however these are easily reached by the U-Bahn or by the S Line from the nearby Zoo Bahnhoff.Good amenities and nightlife nearby and I would be happy to stay here again the next time I go to Berlin

<Content>Comfy  Had an enjoyable 5nt stay in 2 rooms for my family of 5. Rooms were comfy, decent sized, with the larger rooms able to hold an additional rollaway bed if desired. Coffee  tea making equipment was provided, as well as a minifridge stocked with beverages. Bathrooms were clean, good-sized, with combo bath/showers.Location was pretty good. 1 block S of Ku'damm with all its shopping and restaurants. 2 blocks to the Uhlandstrasse U-bahn. Bus stop 1 short block away that takes you to Zoo station where you can connect to any other type of transportation. Since breakfast was an additional 11-15 Euros pp, we opted to buy pastries daily from a couple of bakeries nearby for breakfast. There were also 2 grocery stores within 2 blocks. Clusters of nearby restaurants 1 blk away on Uhlandstrasse, 2 blks N on Ku'damm, and 2 blks S around Ludwigkircheplatz.The staff was nice  pretty helpful. The door lock mechanisms were difficult to figure out at first. Wifi availability was convenient but a little expensive, as was computer use in the lobby.Online rates were excellent at 59-79 Euros/nt with no xtra chg for a rollaway.

<Content>Excellent location My partner and I spent four nights here recently. The room was reasonably clean, reasonably sized. Staff was very friendly. We had trouble figuring out exactly how the air conditioning worked. Whether you like the omnipresent Warhol theme and the colouring scheme (lots of lime green and yellow) is a question of taste I guess. What we DEFINITELY liked was the location. The hotel is just off the main shopping mile of Ku鈥檇amm, halfway between the big department stores around the Kaiser Wilhelm church and the more upmarket shops at the lower end of Ku鈥檇amm.

<Content>Cool hotel with great style Me and my sister went to this hotel last September for three nights- Friday, Sat  Sun. We got a bit lost coming out of the zoo train station so the work was longer than if we had known the way. The hotel is actually just a minute away from Ku'damm and there's three easily accessible underground stations nearby. Check in wasn' until 3pm but when we arrived at 11.30am our room was ready and the reception staff were really helpful. The young man gave us a map and marked where the hotel was and where local underground stations and good restaurants where. The room was spacious, very clean  fabuously decorated- we had some drunken fun on the chair that spun round! the beds were big and comfy, bathroom was huge  air conditioning was easy to use  effective.Didn't use hotel restaurant but did use the bar and found the staff were friendly and the drinks very strong! Overall we loved this hotel- it was very cool and relaxed, in a great location for shopping and getting around generally and had lots of beer gardens nearby. Hard Rock cafe is also a five min walk away if you fancy a retro evening. I loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it, especially as the prices are so reasonable - 拢210 for two people for three nights. Uber bargain.

<Content>What a great hotel! On a leisure trip, we stayed at this hotel because the friends we were traveling with had already pre-booked there, so there was pretty much no choice. However, I have to say that this was a good experience! An artsy hotel (as the name implies), pop-artsy to be exact, with Andy Warhol holding court on walls, decorations and colour schemes -- a very bright and pleasant environment! Very young and extremely friendly staff, OK bar and food, expensive but good breakfast (wasn't included), great rooms in lime green colour schemes, spotlessly clean, central (very near the famous Kudamm)... the list goes on and on. The only drawback seemed to be the very strange room door opening system. All in all, a very positive experience!

<Content>Pefect value for money Amazed that for 180 GBP pp, we got such lush accommodation and flights via lastminute. This designer hotel is 5mins walk from Ulanstrause Station, handy if you are travelling by tubes. Its is off street from busy areas and tourist, but has loads of good affordable eating outlet nearby (recommend Goyst restaurant if you want good, cheap seafood located in front of the metro station). It is also within 5 mins walking distance to Kurfurstendamn, which is one of the busier districts.. Rooms were immaculately clean and superb finish of the designer touch. The bar downstairs was excellent for chilling out and funky coloured deco was perfect after a long day of travelling. I cant comment on the food, as it was over our budget, but there were so many restaurants around the area that made choosing difficult. If I were visiting Berlin again, I would definitely stay here again. Staff were friendly and helpful..

<Content>Not really a 4* hotel Got this room via Priceline at a great rate. Hotel is somewhat in an isolated area of Berlin but the walk to the KuDamm is really close. The decor and modern feel of the room is not my taste. Beds were ok, but the design of the shower is interesting. The water easily escapes the shower area and onto the main bathroom floor and even outside the door, which was disappointing. Even though there is a restaurant and bar on the premises, I felt this hotel is more like a 3 star, but you cant beat the price. Staff is nice, however. Parents beware that the pay tv shows XXX rated previews of the movies!!! I would not book my next stay to Berlin at this hotel.

<Content>Great Breakfasts The best breakfast known to man (well, 2nd best: the best is available at the EO Hotel, Penang). There was simply everything and anything available including smoked salmon and champagne! Buffet style too. Cheesetastic. Berlin's quite a noisy city and despite being doubly double-glazed there was still some road noise. Room had minibar which was curiously and obtrusively filled by staff shortly after our arrival, ie without knocking. Decor Ikea like. Good bathroom. Plenty of frills. Styling unusal.

<Content>Great stay; great value We were in Southern Germany for the World Cup and decided to take a trip north to Berlin with our three kids. We picked this hotel based on the feedback from Tripadvisor and were very impressed. Room were an excellent value for the money, were extrememly clean and quiet, and had excellent access to the shopping, eating, transportation and sightseeing. The breakfast was very reasonable and quite good. I had stayed in Berlin for three nights ealier in the trip at a different hotel and paid three times as much for 1/2 the ambiance and experience. I would absolutely stay here again. The only downsides were limited on-site parking and (like most German hotels) limited ability to sleep two adults and three kids in one room.

<Content>Very Modern, Art Hotel Very nice and clean hotel. We spend there 4 nights and everything was excellent. The hotel was very modern, the room huge, painted in a nice light green colour. The beds very comfortable and pretty big and the bathroom stylish and clean. The people in the reception were polite giving us details for what to do during our stay. There were only 2 things that were not so good. The coffee station is not availiable in rooms of the lowest category (Fortunately we knew and we had booked a room of a higher class) and secondly the elevator is really slow, so I used many times the stairs and as we were staying in the 5th floor it was sometimes tiring.

<Content>Great Value. This hotel is conveniently located near the Ku'damn. There's a taxi stand located across the street from the hotel and a Metro stop is one block away. There are many nice restaurants within walking distance. The hotel staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We received an excellent rate on the website. I would definitely recommend this hotel for it's value and cleanliness. However, I would have preferred to stay in Mitte.

<Content>good value for the money Stay there for five nights. The hotel is located on a main noisy road but in a nice and elegant neighbourhood. There are lot of cosy and smart restaurants and cafe in the vicinity - lots of dining options. The staff are very nice and helpful. The room is very basic, large enough and clean, but a bit cold and not so intimate. We check one hour before offical check-in time and they charged us for an extra 5 euro for it!!! - we checked out 4 hours before time and didn't get credit for that.... As previous reviewer has noticed, the airconditioner didn't work and the room was too hot at night. We asked the reception to solve the problem but they didn't take care of it!If you want to stay on the west side of the city and not to spend lots of money - it's a good choice. If you expect to stay in a place more characteristic - stay away.

<Content>Lovely for the money For 38GBP on Priceline this hotel was excellent value for our four night stay if you're wanting to stay in the West End. Like a previous reviewer, I also received a lovely fruit platter on my birthday - a really nice touch. No problems with the room other than it was a bit hot at night (maybe the aircon wasn't working?). The bathrooms are large with walk-in shower.All the young staff were extremely polite and helpful. Didn't try the restaurant, but the bar area is quite cool.Location is 2 minute walk from the Ku'dam, and about 5 or 10 minutes from the S-Bahn station at Savignyplatz (try the always busy Italian restaurant XII Apostolis next to the station for excellent food and lively atmosphere).

<Content>Excellent Location to Explore West Berlin My wife and I enjoyed a leisure trip to Berlin staying at this hotel, it is ideally suited to the main areas arounf Europa Centre and the shopping areas with cafe's bars etc, the hotel is cloise to both the U and S Bhan so travel to the east of Berlin is easy as well as connecting to the airports. The hotel has an art theme with Andy Warholl throughout, the reception is pleaseant, the staff were extremely helpful the room simple but comfortable with a mini bar. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting berlin and hope to be able to stay there once again.

<Content>Nice  Staying one night in Berlin for attending a conference we - or rather my boss ;) - decided to go for the Art'otel. Fair price, nice stylish Andy Warhol Design elements, nice people working there and and a good night of sleeped located close to the Ku'damm. I surely will consider it as an alternative when returning to Berlin.

<Content>Decent hotel Nothing too exciting about this hotel, but nothing bad as well. Location is fairly good for tourists - Nearest metro and the main shopping high street is just 5 mins walk away. To get to most of the attractions though you have to go to Mitte area but for a good price (under E100), this is a nice place. (We really enjoyed walking on the main street and actually would prefer to stay here than Mitte - the cafe scene is really nice). Negatives - We got to hotel at 11am but they would not let us check in before 2pm. We had requested a crib for our baby but we got a rollaway bed. Our room was on the main street so we did hear a bit of traffic noise but it didnt really affect our sleep. We didnt have the breakfast as it seemed too expensive and there are so many cafes nearby that one can go to that it didnt seem worth it. Overall the hotel staff was very accomodating and helpful and I would recommend this hotel to people who want to stay in a good standard hotel at a budgeted price.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay here. I had a very positive experience at this hotel. I stayed for 6 nights in May. Room was perfectly adequate and comfortable. Staff were all very pleasant and helpful. My first room on the 6th floor was huge ( or maybe because i had just been staying in Amsterdam! ) and my second room smaller but again fine.I would definately stay here again !

<Content>Very good Nothing bad to say about the hotel, the service on recption was great they couldn't be more helpful, they have thought of everything including lending you a brolly if it's raining. Think we got upgraded as the room was very big, it had a seating area with comfy chairs and a table and had a kettle with lots of tea's and coffee which the website says you don't get. There was a minibar too which had enough space for you to put your own drinks in it. The green carpet wasn't as bad as it looks on the photos think you get used it! Everything was very clean and comfortable, we even got left little chocolates on the pillow at night, a nice touch though it may be because it was Easter.We didn't eat in the hotel, however about a 5 - 10 min walk brings you to Ku-damm with lots of restaurants, there is also the entrance to Ku-damm Karree (a shopping center) opposite the hotel which as shops,the story of berin incluing a nucular bunker and a few drinking places in it. On arrival at Zoo station we got a taxi to the hotel which was only 5 euros, it takes about 15 mins to walk and is very easy to find. The nearest U bahn station is Kurfustendamm and is about a 5-10 min walk from the hotel.I would definaly stay here again and recommend it.

<Content>Thumbs up for Art'Otel Berlin I spent Easter at the Art'Otel City Center West and had a great time.Rooms were new, clean, quiet and comfortable. Staff were always friendly and helpful with all our enquiries (opening times, how to get there etc).On arrival the street outside the hotel is not great - I was worried I'd made a mistake - but all was well.The hotel has a good small casual bar which serves coffee and drinks all day/night long.The hotel is one block from the Ku'dam - which is a great shop/restaurant/bar lined street. Savingyplatz is 7 mins walk - also great (if not better) bars  restaurants.There's a U-Bahn on the Ku'dam (5 mins) or S-Bahn at Savingyplatz (7 mins) - once you're on the train line it is easy to get anywhere in Berlin. Bus 129 (4 mins) takes you to the Gallery area and Potsdamer Platz. Most of the sights are East - so you do need to travel from this part of town.If you want to stay in the thick of things - you'd be better off staying East - near Orianberg or Freidrich Strasse - but personally I found the Ku'dam a nicer area to stay.Art'otel didn't seem to offer a lot of other facilities - but I was out all day so didn't matter.Breakfast was a buffet with a wide choice - but I thought you got tastier and more interesting breakfasts at the many cafes nearby.Have fun!

<Content>Fun place! Perfect location! We loved the Art'otel. The lobby area, with a sofa and computer on one side, the desk, and then a bar/lounge on the other is totally comfortable and has great art on the walls. The rooms are clean and spacious, a great place to relax after a long day or late night! The only thing that would make it perfect is if they had wireless Internet. It's only a 5-minute walk from the Uhlandstrasse U-bahn, and not much farther to other stops on other lines. Excellent location. I'd definitely like to stay there again. Can't wait to go back to Berlin!

<Content>Fun, but not tres chic We liked our stay there, the rooms were clean, quiet, well kept. The only downside was the overpriced and lackluster breakfast. Having stayed in many German hotels, the usual breakfast fare was much better at other places. In fact, most of them were punishing in their many choices!  If you stay there, plan on tourist activities in central Berlin and outlying areas via Bahn/U-Bahn. Don't expect anything extra. It's a bare bones place with fun, modern design. Considering exchange rates, its not a bad value.

<Content>A nice place to stay in central-ish Berlin We got a steal on this hotel through expedia and were very happy with it. I agree with some of the TripAdvisor reviewers that the Warhol factor was a bit much. More Warhol art and fewer pictures of Warhol himself (waking up looking at a disheveled middle-aged guy with a wacky haircut got a bit tedious after a few days--and I'm not talking about my boyfriend, har har) would have been preferable. The room was simple and clean but clearly the victim of a retro seafoam green invasion. I was instantly transported back to my childhood house in 1977. But I understand that they're going for the funky angle. The carpeting in the hallways was as purple as any purple I'd ever seen. A few drawbacks: no kettle/coffee/tea, although to be fair, this is stated on the Web site. And do be careful with the TV. As others have mentioned in their reviews, when you turn it on, a menu pops up, and Pay TV is the first selection. It would be easy to end up selecting expensive Scandinavian porn if you're not paying attention.There are many nice bars within walking distance of the hotel, particularly on the street behind it (I forget the name, but you can鈥檛 miss it--there鈥檚 a red-hued American diner on that street that can be seen for blocks). If you opt not to partake of the 13-euro hotel breakfast (upon checking in, we were given a 2-euro-off coupon, which was rather curious internal promotion), there are many coffee-type places nearby.  All in all, a perfectly adequate and well-located hotel.

<Content>Too much Warhol Just come back from a three day stay, and liked this hotel. We were a group of 6 women. The restaurant area is quite stylish, though empty apart from at breakfast time. We had one breakfast there which was good, but expensive. Better to go somewhere else to eat. Recommend the Twelve Apostles for breakfast which is an Italian restaurant about 10 minutes walk away.Reception were friendly and helpful, and in fact it was them that recommended the Italian restaurant.The rooms are very clean, well-equipped and generally comfortable. It was very hot at night, and there the air conditioning didn鈥檛 seem to work. The standard is a double rather than a twin bed, and even though we had specified twins we got doubles. After the first night, they were able to find rooms with twin beds.Location is good for shopping and eating out, but the main sites are not walking distance away. However we found taxis cheaper than in the UK. This is a Warhol themed hotel, with many prints and photos. I liked the prints but could have done with less photos ;-)

<Content>It's fine, but is basic and not customer friendly The hotel position is alright and reasonably close to a train station - which you will need to use to get around to see the main sights, which are mainly centre East. Upon arrival our room was not ready and we were offered a larger room for an extra 鈧?0 per night. For the sake of convenience we said yes - guess they bank on that. The room was fine, clean, but very basic. There wasn't even tea / coffee making facilities, something I expect as standard and have always had, even from lower star rated hotels. I enquired at the hotel desk about this and found that it was available, at an extra cost of 鈧? per day. I guess they want to encourage guests to use the hotel's bar / restaurant facilities.Whilst staying there I wasn't aware that any of their recreational facilities were on site - I think they had nothing and that everything must have been in the vicinity of the hotel.When we checked out there were 4 other sets of guests at the desk and all had problems. One lot had been 'upgraded' but hadn't been informed that it would cost them more money - luckily we were told of the extra cost. One lot had a baby and were put in a room which had no bath and so they couldn't bath the baby = they wanted to move rooms which seemed to be a problem... I think that showers were standard, rather than baths. The others were also querying their bills as they were checking out.Basically this hotel is fine, but I think you could probably pay the same money for somewhere better or for a better location. Somewhere that is managed better and is more customer aware and friendly, that isn't constantly trying to make more money out of you - I know that all hotels are trying to do this, but not all are so blatant about it.

<Content>Location was not the top First of all, beware of the gym : THERE's NO GYM, in despite of what they say in their brochures.The breakfast is not worthy at all... several kinds of yogourth, bacon, and orange juicy...that ' s it, overpriced for 15 Eur.The TV is plenty of german channels, but you will just reach one foreign channel : CNN, that 's all,...The staff is correct, but dont expect too much from them... ordered a wake up call and they forget it, placed a dont disturb signal in the door, and housekeeping was entering in the room every half hour the same....There's a internet point in the lobby, but 5 Euros/hour doesnt seem to be any good deal...(no fraction time)The location is not superb,.. the main touristic spots are far far far away from there... if i ever visit the city of berlin, i ll be for sure in Mitte, which is the area to stay for the first time when on tourism in Berlin. Got a rate of 68 Eur nite (excl breakfast) and at that price is okay...Beware of the safety in the rooms,... when housekeeping is around, she let more than one room door opened at the same time meanwhile she's cleaning, but she s alone,..so someone could take our your properties just by entering in a second....doesnt appear to be safe at all the way they clean....

<Content>Excellent service and well priced through Priceline! We stayed at the Art'otel Dec 17-19, 2004. We enjoyed the ambience of the hotel and the service received. There were absolutely no complaints!

<Content>Best of Berlin In my opinion this hotel should be a class higher, definately more of a 4 star hotel than 3. Clean modern rooms, superb bathrooms and friendly helpful staff made my 3 days in Berlin a joy.Good location for shops, but if you are in Berlin for nights out then I would probably suggest it's sister hotel in Mitte.
