<Content>bargain this hotel was a real bargain in florence. the location from the train station was great and it is in easy walking distance to all sights. there are many good restaurants nearby. the room was clean and was truely no-smoking . the staff is very friendly and quick to help with reservations and information, including free internet and luggage storage. the basic breakfast was only 5 euro. 2 needs to improve points-- they really need new mattresses and the shower water was somewhat inconsistent with temperature.

<Content>I Love This Place!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hotel Enza is one of my favorite places we stayed. It is historic with great character, it is in an AWESOME location-right near the train station and the David (and everything else) and the staff are friendly and so helpful. Free internet and free bag storage and the room was clean, nice, very comfortable and so perfect. It is quiet and fun and I loved it so much!

<Content>Nice place! The hotel was only a 10 minute walk from the major sights. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. The walk from the train station was a little difficult on the narrow sidewalks with suitcases. We enjoyed our stay!

<Content>Perhaps Got The Bad Room? Chose this property based on Rick Steves' book and was really disappointed! The location is the best thing about this place, as it's minutes walking distance from all of the major attractions. From there it is mostly downhill. The staff is very friendly, especially the morning girl at the front desk. The other staffers speak little English, but try, and that goes a long way in avoiding frustration. The room was extremely dark, the carpet was dirty, the bathroom was slightly below average, there was a damp feeling to the room, and even though we kept a do not disturb sign on the door the bed was made every day and the window opened, allowing new mosquito's in each day. The breakfast charge of 5euros was about right as they offered just breads and some juice. We didn't bother, just going to the McDonald's (usually we avoid these places) for a 1euro coffee/tea and croissant. No internet access but a PC in the lobby area is available to guests.

<Content>Good Location - but overpriced Very basic hotel in a fabulous location. However, no matter how expensive Florence is - the Hotel is not worh 拢80 a night for a double room. Staff are friendly but do not bother with breakfast - there are many cafes around serving coffee and pastries for half the price.

<Content>Great budget hotel with character We are currently living in Switzerland, and met some touring American friends here for the weekend. She had picked the hotel, and after reading the reviews, I was quite happy with her choice. It's a very nice, clean, budget hotel, located relatively close to sites like the Accademia and the Duomo. We sightsee with baby backpacks, and this wasn't a far walk at all, maybe 10 minutes. It was located in an old building, and also had characteristic Italian flip-up blinds, which I thought were neat.As for the staff, Katia was wonderful in helping us get reservations at the Accademia and the Uffizi. We weren't booking too far in advance, and all the reservations available to the public were gone. Katia was able to get us reservations at both museums, no problem. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and helpful, especially the lady that served us breakfast one morning (I'm sorry, I don't know her name). Most of them speak English, and we had no trouble communicating. One last bit of advice - they only have one babycot, so if you have twins or two young children that need one, you'll have to bring at least one of your own.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel Choice For inexpensive lodging in Florence, you may not be able to beat the Enza. It is only a few blocks from the train station, not on a busy street and therefore quiet, and you can walk to all the major Florence sites and central restaurants. My single room was small but sparkling clean, with a good bedside reading light. Katia at the reception desk speaks English and is very helpful with reservations and sightseeing tips, and the free internet in the lobby is a big plus. No charge for international phone calls from your room if you use the Italy toll-free number. Pack light if you plan to stay here, because you'll be walking up one or two flights of stairs to your room. Get the best price by booking directly with the hotel and paying cash.

<Content>Great Value Hotel Enza was a great value for the price (especially with the 10% discount if you pay in cash). The bathroom was large and the air conditioning worked like a dream. They also have free internet access in the reception area. The location is slightly out of the way (approx. 5-7 minute walk to the Duomo), but that means it's on a quiet street. My only complaint is that the walls were a little thin, so I could occasionally hear other guests in the hall and in the reception area.

<Content>Do not Recommend at all!! I was very excited about our stay in Hotel Enza especially after I confirmed and read all the reviews of the hotel on many websites. it turned out that we possibly got their worst room because our experience was anything but good. first and foremost, the walk to the hotel from the train station is longer than 10 minutes and is a difficult walk what with suitcases etc. you have narrow sidewalks if that and the traffic is heavy. the hotel itself is in a non-descript neighborhood, many flights of stairs before you get to your room (imagine lugging your luggage after having walked 25 minutes). the room we were alloted had the worst bathroom no real demarcation between the shower, the toilet and the sink..they all just sat in a small area.. awful. the air conditioning refused to work and the front desk refused to acknowledge that there was a problem with the AC. Our room was supposed to be ready by 1 pm but we could not get in till close to 3 pm delaying our plans to sightsee. I know we were not the only ones waiting as we saw several pieces of luggage in the office area of other guests waiting to be checked in. I felt like the neighborhood was not very good later in the evening...some good things about the hotel: one of the few places that had free internet access, the hotel did all our museum reservations ahead of time, the staff is very good (katia) on email and would respond to any emails promptly. apart from this, do not believe the location proximity, some of the pictures on the hotel website show nicer rooms and bathrooms (not where we stayed!). Go only if you have no other choices...it is somewhat close to the duomo and very close to the accademia museum.

<Content>Good, clean and quiet Stayed here for three nights, very clean and quiet. Lovely spacious room. You get free Internet access which is excellent and the staff are very friendly. Was a little difficult to find but this is more the fault of the maps we were given rather than Hotel Enza's. Only minor gripe would be that the room was not ready when we arrived, and we arrived at the correct time we were given, this was mainly annoying because we were very tired. A good basic choice for accomadation in Florence.

<Content>Enza was great value for money Hotel Enza was booked on a whim and we were so pleased when we arrived to see a clean, comfortable and quiet hotel room. We opted for a communal bathroom which was no problem as the hotel was not busy, and this kept the price pleasingly low. Although not right in the heart of Florence, it was a comfortable stroll into town and there were a couple of nice local type cafes for brekky and lunch, so we felt as though we had escaped from the touristy parts of town and experienced the real Florence. Would recommend to family and friends for a no frills yet comfortable stay.

<Content>Decent budget option, great location I booked a room through the hotel's website, and was pleased with the excellent and fast communication of the reception. I paid 70 Euros for a double room on the second level, which included a basic room with sink and bidet inside, and a private bathroom and shower located just outside the room (next door, but only available for us to use). Breakfast was not included in this arrangement. The room was quite basic and dark, but it was clean, as was the bathroom. The shower was tiny and had a problem with drainage. The people at the reception were very friendly and helpful, and even allowed us to use their private phone line to call Milan to arrange accommodations. There is a computer in the lobby for free internet use. The best part of this mini-hotel is the location. Easy walking distance from the train station, just steps away from the outdoor markets, and plenty of options for eating and shopping just outside. The duomo is also an easy 5-10 minute walk as well.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay We (my wife and I, both 55+) stayed at the Hotel Enza for two nights on our first trip to Europe. We had to carry our bags up a flight of stairs when we arrived as reception is on first floor of the building, but this was not a problem. Our room on the first floor was clean and quiet with its own very clean bathroom. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. They explained directions of how to get to Pisa (train) and Sienna (bus.) About 10-15 minutes walk to station. We did not find it difficult to walk from the hotel to main tourist places in Florence. Had a great stay in this very reasonably priced hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel with clean rooms and good location I stayed at the Enza during a recent trip to Italy with my wife. We both really liked the hotel and our room. The price was reasonable and the location was great. We paid 80 euros a nite for our stay in late Oct of 2007. About a 10 minute walk from the train station, its in a friendly neighborhood and easy walking distance to all of the major and must-see sights of Florence. The staff was helpful and answered all of our questions. There is also a computer w/ internet access in their lobby, which is always helpful when traveling abroad. The room was clean, bathroom was fine, had hot water. We stayed in room #9, which is on the 1st floor (really the 2nd level though). Had a balcony off the room, which overlooked a back alley, but whatever, it was a balcony. Quite at night, no street noise. AC  heat as well. Didnt pay for the breakfast though, for less than 5 euros you can find plenty of places for a bite and some great cappucino. I would definately stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. I mean, its not the Ritz Carlton, but definately does the job for a clean room and a place to crash at night.

<Content>Excellent value We stayed at the Hotel Enza for five nights in Sept. 2007, and loved it. With the shrinking US$, I wish that we could find more lodgings like the Hotel Enza in Europe. The location is great - only a few blocks walk from the train station, the Duomo, and the Accademia. Our room was quiet, and had a remote control for the A/C - just set the temperature at 21 degrees Celsius, and a good nights sleep is guaranteed. Keep the A/C on, even when it is not too hot out. If you leave the windows open, there are no screens - you will get mosquitos. ( I woke up on the one morning after leaving the windows open all night, with a bite on my left eyelid - no fun ! ) The breakfast is an extra 5 euros / person - I think it is worth the money. The staff is pleasant and helpful, and most of them speak some English, although learning basic Italian is not too difficult. The front desk is up one flight of stairs, and there is no elevator - but they would surely have to raise their rates, if they had to put in an elevator. Lots of nice restaurants in the area ( try ZaZa's ). There is also a small supermarket close by - just turn left at the hotel exit, and you will walk in to it.

<Content>Great "Mom and Pop" budget hotel. First time to Florence for me and my wife. Picked hotel out of Rick Steve's Italy guide (Rick is my tour guide!) and it was exactly as described. We had a room on the backside of the hotel off the street and heard nothing of the noise complaints listed in other reviews. The side street it is on is not busy at all so not sure where the alleged noise mentioned in other reviews could possibly be coming from.Very comfortable room and nicely furnished bathroom. Most European hotel rooms are smaller than their American counterparts, and this was no exception, but given that our trip was to see Florence and not hang out at the hotel all day, it was perfect for our purposes. Very clean and quiet. Good air-conditioning for the summer months.It is on the north west end of the old town in Florence, and the walk to the very south end of the old town was a 20 minute walk, but you can get to the touristy areas within 10 minutes walking depending on how fast you walk. Great for working off all the bread and olive oil you eat at the restaurants. Skip the breakfast at the hotel and go eat a pastry and coffee and one of several nearby shops within a few hundred yards of the hotel. Great little supermarket/grocery store at the end of the street to the north that caters to locals (and has locals prices).

<Content>Lovely Hotel in Florence We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at this hotel. They have internet access in the lobby that guests can use, which was really helpful to us. Location is good with a 10 minute walk to the train station (be sure to check out evening before if you have an early morning train!). We thought the bathroom was very large for European standards! Great price as well! Two great restaurants in Florence - ZaZa's and Tratoria Marione!

<Content>Reasonable value - Adequate Hotel I stayed here 5 nights in May of 2007. The room we were in faced the front. The room was fairly big but it was a funny shape, long and narrow. It felt a little dirty and could have used a paint job.It was a fairly noisy, both from the street and from the other rooms. The en-suite bathroom was OK but it felt like it could have been cleaner. The hotel's public areas were much more pleasant. The halls and breakfast room were quite nice.There is a free internet connection in the lounge The front desk and breakfast staff were polite and helpful. They booked my museum visits for me at no charge and answered all my touristy questions. The location was good and it was easy to get around Florence by foot from there.The room rate was reasonable for what I got.While I might look around to see if I could get a better hotel for the money next time, I would be ready to stay there again.

<Content>Good budget hotel in Florence I thought this hotel was a very good value for the price. Good location and clean and quiet. The hotel is up a flight of stairs, so might not be optimal for those with mobility issues. 24 hour concierge service was helpful as I had an early flight out. I would stay there again.

<Content>Nice but buggy We booked the Hotel Enza through their own website and email. I got a rate of 65 euros, which was pretty reasonable for what we got. (Breakfast not included)PROS: quiet; spacious room; bathroom ok; a/c worked well; location decent (but not in the heart); close to MANY internet places and inexpensive cafes and small markets; only about 3 minutes to the market and 5 to the train station and bus terminalCONS: at any given moment there were 2-3 mosquitoes on the walls of our room and I got bitten at night; the shower was difficult to use due to the wand and shower curtain which had to be pulled or you'd flood the 5x5 bathroom; not much room for toiletries in the bathroomOVERALL: a good place to stay for the value; reminded me of what I'd think a convent looks like inside

<Content>Cute hotel, but too noisy This is a very cute hotel within walking distance of the train station, the Accademia and the Duomo, however the noise at night was unbearable! My boyfriend and I had the front room looking right out onto the street, so I have no idea if this is true for the rest of the hotel. But if you plan to stay here, make sure you request a room in the back, away from the street (there are many). Otherwise, the reception people were very helpful and my internet-addicted boyfriend loved that there was free internet in the lobby. The room was very clean, nice bathroom, very modern accomodations.

<Content>great little hotel My wife and I, celebrating our 60th birthdays in Europe, stayed at this great little hotel for 4 days in May. It was clean, comfortable, reasonably priced and so very close to all the major sites of beautiful Firenza. We walked to all the sights. The location is close to numerous quaint little restuarants and stores of all kinds.We had a room off the courtyard and it was exceptionally quiet. The room was good sized and beds very comfortable. The owners and their family were very accomodating and helpful. We had no problems communicating with everyone able to get along in English very well.We would recommend this hotel as a place to rest after a day of touring.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful We found Hotel Enza after searching for a budget option in Florence. This seemed like the pick of the bunch, and it certainly was cheap by local standards - 鈧?0 per night, with 10% discount for cash.The hotel is located on a quiet street in the north of the city, 10-15 minutes walk from the main station. Although the area doesn't offer much in terms of immediate entertainment, it is close to the market and you can walk to the Duomo in less than 10 minutes. To this end, the location is fine. There is also a superb trattoria a few minutes away, Trattoria Guelfa (Via Guelfa 103r) which offers amazing local food and homely atmosphere for good prices.There is no lift in the hotel, so be prepared to struggle up some narrow stairs to the first floor reception; then onto your room. The welcome was friendly, and we were led to a perfectly nice room, albeit somewhat dated and jaded. It was very clean, however, and had a good, large bathroom. It also had air conditioning, but literally no view (the window opened onto nothing). The reception area had some cosy sofas, books, and free internet access - as well as a selection of cold drinks for sale.Breakfast was a disappointment. Served in a very small area, you had to book a time-slot in advance. The food on offer amounted to nothing more than cereals and croissants. You could get a very nice fresh coffee made to your tastes, which somewhat made up for that, however!Summing up, Hotel Enza offered excellent value and the location, whilst not perfect, was good enough. For budget travellers, we'd certainly recommend it.

<Content>Great Value We stayed at the Hotel Enza in Florence for 2 nights in May. Our room was quite large for Italy standards. We paid 80 euros (72 with cash) -no breakfast. The hotel has free internet in the lobbyThe location was a quick walk from the train station and Accademia. Overall the hotel wasn't impressive, but for 72 euros a night it was a great deal.

<Content>ok hotel for the money we stayed in hotel enza for two nights while in florence. I thought the hotel was ok, but it had a few drawbacks. one, our room was very dark and was also near the breakfast room so was very loud in the morning. the room itself was clean and bathroom was very clean. this was one of the cheaper hotels that we stayed at on our trip, so wasn't one of our favorites, but definitely a decent budget hotel. the free internet was nice..and the staff was very nice!

<Content>Good value hotel in Florence We are a middle aged couple. We chose this hotel because it was listed in Rick Steve's Italy Book and had positive reviews on tripadvisor.com. We needed a budget hotel that was clean, convenient, and safe. Hotel Enza fit the bill. We booked the hotel by e-mailing them directly. All our e-mails were answered promptly and professionally. We were given a good rate with a discount for paying in cash. Although the Hotel is a little worn and dated looking we found our room to be comfortable, clean and quiet. The bathroom was modern and spotless with thick towels, lots of hot water, no plumbing problems it even had a towel warmer. The people who worked at the reception desk were all friendly and helpful. There was free internet available. Breakfast was not included and we chose to get a coffee and croissant down the street at a very reasonable coffee bar. We found economical restaurants for dinner nearby (recommended by the hotel staff or in Rick Steve's Italy Book). The hotel is an easy walk to most of the tourist sites, however, the actual street is a bit seedy looking at night. I might not have felt comfortable walking home at night without a male companion, but with my husband it was fine. All in all it's a good hotel for budget travellers.

<Content>Great Hotel for price I enjoyed my stay here. Booked 2 rooms (for my mother and sister and one for myself and partner). The hotel was well located and well appointed rooms. Lovely and clean and the staff were very helpful.I did not try the breakfast but there are many small places nearby to get a cappacino and crossaint. My mother's room did not have hot water in their shower unfortunately and on the last day the toilet blocked but my shower and toilet worked fine. So for the price I would book here again.

<Content>Disappointed This is a so-so hotel in a inconvenient location. Our room had a shower so leaky it ran a stream into our room! Also, management was less than honest concerning a discount for paying in cash and in fact refused to honor it even though a guide book had said they would.

<Content>Great value and location Large, comfortable room with aircon and double-glazed windows. Excellent staff, particularly the lovely and charming Katia. A little worn around the edges, but at the price its very hard to find fault. Good value continental breakfast and free lobby internet. Safe and relatively quiet area. Walking distance to everything you'll want. Would return with no hesitation.

<Content>Friendly, Charming, Quiet, Perfect! Hotel Enza was delightful. I absolutely loved it. My first time to Italy, my first city, and the staff (especially Katia!) were more than accommodating. I had Room #1, single, shared bath, 5 nights from October 6-10, 2006. I must admit, I was a little reluctant to share a bath, but there was absolutely no problem. The shared baths are cleaned throughout the day and were spotless. The hotel was within easy walking distance of everything (Florence is tiny next to New York!), most especially the Accademia.The only downside to the hotel, if there was one, was that you had to climb to the second floor for reception (not bad because I didn't have much luggage; but could be difficult if you had very heavy bags).The accommodations were astonishingly reasonable (Euro 40/night) and I have to say, I have never had friendlier service anywhere. Everywhere in the hotel are tasteful and bright original works of art, and fine prints. The small den/common area just outside reception is a friendly little living room, with free internet access, TV, and a fabulous antique illustrated book (in Italian, of course) by Dante. You really feel at home right away there. I was very reluctant to leave.Do get up for breakfast in the morning, if only for the coffee, which is fabulous, proudly served by the owner  owner's son. I wanted to get my haircut, and Katia pulled out a beautifully detailed map and gave me two options--both right around the corner from the hotel. There was no view from my room (a quaint, flower-filled alley) but I didn't need one. The quiet was such a gift, restorative and invigorating. Had the best sleep I've had in months.Loved Hotel Enza an hope to return one day.

<Content>Wonderful family, wonderful hotel. We loved the Hotel Enza! The room was very clean, and twice the size of other hotels we stayed at in Italy. The best part was the wonderful family that took care of us. The daughter was quite adept with English, and was very prompt in responding to our reservation requests. The son set out a generous breakfast for us - complete with coffee made to our specifications. The father was warm and welcoming; he was kind to help us with various tasks such as opening a bottle of wine we bought, and helping us find a laundry. All around fantastic experience at a very reasonable price.

<Content>Great hotel! We absolutely LOVED the Hotel Enza! The location is great - far enough away that it is quiet and close enough to everything that the big attractions are about 10-15 minutes away by foot. We timed our walk to the train station and it was 12 minutes, so very good if you are relying on train travel. It had a wonderful European feel, and the rooms were quite big, as was the bathroom (and wonderful water pressure!). The staff was excellent, both before and during our stay. We had been in email contact with the hotel to make hotel and museum reservations and ask questions and they were very prompt and courteous. On our check-out day our train left in the afternoon several hours after check-out, but they let us keep our luggage in the office and let us freshen up in a bathroom right before our train left. We definately would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Florence.

<Content>Great value I travelled around Europe for 2 months and stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in June finding it really good value. It's about 8 minutes walk from the train station and easy to find. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. My room had a lovely little balcony overlooking a garden and while I didn't have a bathroom in my room (which meant I paid considerably less), I had exclusive access to a bathroom just outside my room. The area the hotel is in is not 'exclusive' but it was fine walking around the streets alone, though I wasn't walking them late at night. My room was also really quiet. I'd certainly stay there again.

<Content>Good budget option in Florence We stayed here for 3 nights and were very pleased. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the train station (which feels longer with luggage) and an easy walk to the Cathedral and all the other sites of Florence (the historic centre is pretty compact). For 65 euro we got a good sized room with a private bathroom (down the hallway) which seemed pretty good for Florence. The staff were generally helpful though the women at the desk seemed unwilling to book Uffizi tickets for us (maybe her English wasn't as good as some of the other staff). Also has (slow) internet access for free. The hotle is a short walk from restaurants and cafes - we ate breakfast each morning at a cafe down the street for less than 3 euros.Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Comfortable, Clean, and Cheap I stayed one night at the Hotel Enza, and was very happy with my choice. The room was comfortable and very clean, and the price was excellent. Moreover, I found the location convienent -- not too close in to the sights, and hence more quiet, but still convenient to everything. The staff were friendly and helpful. I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Florence.

<Content>Nice rooms - friendly staff! This hotel was well worth the money. The staff was friendly, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Only negative was that there is a lot of noise from the street.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise We spent three nights at the Hotel Enza in Florence during January, 2005. It had not been reviewed by Tripadvisor so we went by the Hotel's description and some other user reviews. First, the hype. The hotel descrbes itself as a converted mansion. I guess that depends on your definition of mansion. It is not 200-300 meters from the train station as described but more of a 10-15 minute walk. Now the good stuff. It is on a quiet commercial street out of the tourist area but is an easy walk to to the Duomo-10 minutes, the Uffizi, add 10 minutes and the Piti Palace, another 10 minutes. The rooms are clean, large (ours was about 180 square feet not including the bath) and the bath is simple but modern with American style fluffy towels and a towel warmer. Breakfast at 5 euro was a bargain for Florence and included a buffet of beverages, croissants, rolls, yogurt and corn flakes. The decor is one of eclectic art. Best of all is the helpful and friendly English speaking desk staff who at our request, made Uffizi reservations for us prior to our arrival. We would certainly stay there again.
