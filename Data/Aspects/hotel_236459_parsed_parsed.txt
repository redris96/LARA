<Content>Cannot beat this location We go to Paris fairly often (I'm French) and have tried multiple hotels in Paris. This was the second time we stayed at La Perle. This hotel has a fantastic location in St Germain. There are lots of great restaurants and bars in the street where the hotel is located and the surrounding streets. There are three metro stations really close by and the hotel is also at walking distance from the Jardin du Luxembourg, rue de Rennes and Notre Dame.The room was of a good size by Paris standard. The room was very clean, the bed very good and so was the bathroom.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed in the La Perle hotel in October 2008. My first impression of the hotel was wow what a fantastic location ! The hotel is located in the beautiful and lively St. Germain district and I could not have asked for a better location. The area was full of outstanding restaurants and quaint coffee bars. The metro was a 5 minute walk which will take you to any part of Paris. Our room was spacious and provided us with everything we could ask for. It overlooked a courtyard and was very quiet at night. The front desk personnel were extremely friendly, helpful, and attended to all of our needs. I recommend this hotel highly and will stay there again on my next trip to Paris.

<Content>A Definite Recommendation This was our fourth trip to Paris and we have stayed in numerous hotels. The Hotel La Perle was a lovely place to stay. Although the standard rooms are very small (I think I would upgrade to a larger one), they were very clean and well maintained. The staff was very helpful and the breakfast in the lounge/bar/atrium was very good. The La Perle is conveniently located to many attractions in Paris - The Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, River Seine. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers. I would also recommend a restaurant just down the street and around the corner called Evi Evane. The food and service was outstanding.Mature Canadian Couple

<Content>Perfect Location My wife and I stayed in the Hotel La Perle for a fantastic weekend in Paris. Firstly, the hotel is located on a beautiful side street in what turned out to be a beautiful area of Paris, St Germaine des Pres. Across the street from the hotel was a little bar, called Chez george, that overflowed onto the street on Saturday night and provided the perfect Parisian experience for both of us. Close to the hotel are an array of small, intimate restaurants and bars that were easy on the pocket too. There was alot to see within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel itself is very clean and tidy, we asked for a courtyard room, based on previous reviews and the room overlooked a very quiet courtyard. The room was indeed small but it was only somewhere we threw the bags. Breakfast was just a simple cold meat platter and bread, but it was nice. The staff were very helpful, and recommended nice restaurants etc. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Small  We stayed for only 2 nights in this lovely little hotel. The location is excellent for shopping, restaurants, sight seeing, free internet  even doing one's laundry! We had been travelling for over 4 weeks by the time we arrived here  it was great to have a laundromat so close by. We had a room on the 5th floor that overlooked the street.It wasn't large, but it had a bath and it was very clean  comfortable. It was great value for Paris. The cupboard  wardrobe space is a bit limited but if you're only here for a few nights, it doesn't really matter. We found the staff very friendly  helpful  the breakfast more than adequate. It's also an easy walk to the Seine by the Rue Bonaparte. Henri's restaurant is excellent around the corner! We would definately stay here again.

<Content>A Great Hotel in Paris A great small hotel located in the 6th district. It is in walking distance of all major sites. We had a room on the 5th floor facing the street and it was very quiet. Room was small and comfortable and very clean. It had a large modern tub and shower bathroom. Staff was very helpful. Places to eat are nearby along with a super chocolate shop by the name of Pierre Herme at 72 Rue Bonparte.

<Content>Fantastic location, but VERY noisy I booked this hotel based on a recommendation of a friend who has stayed there a few times. The hotel is in a fantastic location, close to the Metro, great little restaurants and bistros and amazing stores. Walking around is just a pleasure and price is very reasonable, given it is Paris we are talking about.La Perle is a basic hotel. The room I stayed was TINY, ie no need for a remote control; you can reach TV from the bed. Also, closet space is really really small. But what was really a problem was the noise. My room faced the street which is very noisy given all restaurants all the way until 2 or 3 am. And I could not really close the window, since A/c did not work in spite of many complaints to the front desk (and this was January!!!).Once I talked to my friend I realized he always booked one of the more expensive rooms facing the back. So, my recommendation is that if you stay there do the same...NBGreenwich, CT

<Content>Cozy Paris Comfort I stayed at the Hotel La Perle for 4 nights in early July and I loved it. The location is great and is near the Metro, a pharmacie, and a Monoprix (think Target/grocery store). Rue des Canettes is full of restaurants and shops. The Pizzeria Positano is literally 10 steps from the hotel and has excellent pasta. I was travelling alone (female) and always felt safe in the location. The room was small, plain, clean, and quiet. It overlooked the back courtyard. The street becomes packed with people at night, but I never heard noise from my room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a shower/tub combo with a shower curtain. The breakfast offering was yogurt, fruit, croissants  bread, juice, coffee (made to order), and some meat and cheese. Perfect to start the day. The staff was always helpful and arranged a taxi for me to the airport with no problem. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great Paris Hotel Stayed at this Hotel for two nights after the Tour de France. It is close to all major attractions and within walking distance of the Louvre and attractions close to that. The rooms are quite nice, breakfast area is great (and the service was great), and the Bar area is excellent for a relaxed drink. If you ask at the Desk you can get a voucher for free WIFI internet access that lasts for 24 hours. When that runs out ask for another. Overall very happy with this Hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We had a great experience at Hotel La Perle. The best part of this hotel is its location. It was within walking distance of many of the sights we wanted to visit and very close to several metro stops. It was also within a few blocks of many great cafes, shops, and best of all, a grocery store. We found the staff to be very helpful and polite, and they all spoke English. We requested a room where the window opened to the courtyard rather than the street based on the excellent advice of prior visitors. The room was very small, as we have found most hotels in Europe, but very clean. The breakfast was perfect for us because we are not big eaters in the morning. We added a night after we made the original reservation and verified it by phone before we left the U.S., but when we arrived, it was not there. So, the hotel apologized and sent us to an upgraded sister hotel for one night which was a few blocks away and it was very nice.If you are looking for a great boutique-type hotel in Paris, we highly recommend this one, especially for such a very expensive city. We think you get more of a French experience at a smaller hotel, expecially in the St. Germaine area.Ken  FlorenceCastle Rock, Colorado

<Content>Will return to Hotel La Perle We spent 4 nights at the Hotel La Perle and overall it was a good experience. The location is wonderful, the staff very accommodating and the hotel is very clean. Our room was small and on the street. It is true the noise on the front of the hotel will wake you from sleep but we asked to be moved and were moved quickly. The rooms on the courtyard are 100% quieter. The person at the desk was very apolegetic. The hotel is so close to great restaurants, a good market and the metro. It will be my choice when I return to Paris.

<Content>Disappointed We came across La Perle back in 2005 on a whirlwind trip to Paris, we decided it was time to go back and had no hesitation in rebooking la perle as we had good memories from last time. However the experience we had was very different.We arrived to find the receptionist more interested in talking to the cleaner. Once we had got her attention she was very brisk with us and told us we had to wait 10 minutes.Once we got our keys and opened the door to our room we were extremely disappointed to find we had been put at the back of the hotel in a very small dark room that was not at all inviting or expected for the 170 euro cost.We immediately went down stairs to complain about the room and asked if we could be moved, we could not have one of the front rooms like last time as they were all full, therefore we took an upgrade to the only other available room at an extra 50 euros per night.It made the room very expensive however it was a big improvement.When I booked it originally online I was told it did not include breakfast however when we checked out the same very stern receptionist asked if we had had breakfast as it was included. We felt frustrated that she hadn't bothered to tell us when we checked in.The experience was one we would not recommend, there are loads of good hotels in the area, would advise leaving La Perle until they can give better customer service to it's guests.

<Content>"Great Location but small room" We just retuned from a 3 week trip to France. We ended our trip at the Hotel La Perle. We loved the location it could not be better it was right near Luxembourg Gardens, St Germain and just around the corner from St Sulplice.The room was very small and we had a lot of luggage so it was tight. From other reviews, it sounds like you can get a larger room. We tried but the hotel was booked and could not upgrade us. However, the staff was very accommodating.The breakfast was your standard fare nothing fancy. For the price, I think it was a good deal considering how much rooms cost in Paris and the location.

<Content>Great location Well located hotel in the Latin Quarter district...the room was tiny especially after we came back from our plush quarters in Alba but the rate, the location and the breakfast that was included more than made up for it. Family is travelling there this month on our recommendation keeping all these factors in mind.

<Content>Fantastic trip We spent 6 fabulous days in Paris and the hotel met every expectation we had. It was incredibly easy to find, just a very short walk from the St Germain metro stop and the staff on reception were incredibly friendly and helpful on arrival and throughout the whole stay. The room was perfect, we specified a superior bedroom overlooking the courtyard and not the street as we read reviews this kind of bedroom could be noisy. We had very comfortable restful nights! The room was a good size, bathroom was fairly modern and were cleaned very quickly and efficiently everyday. Breakfast was basic but sufficient and we often sat in the bar area in the evening before or after dinner as it was very peaceful and relaxing in the conservatory area. It is a fantastic location for a hotel as it is situated in a very upmarket area with many designer shops a stones throw away and many tourist attractions are within a reasonable walk. Restaurants are very good in the vicinity, particularly the italian directly opposite the hotel. We loved everything about our stay from start to finish and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of having a relaxing break.

<Content>Great hotel in fantastic location I've been to Paris quite a lot over the past 10 years and in terms of location, price and quality the Hotel La Perle is my favourite. For the reasonable rate you get a very clean and good sized room, and for Paris a good sized bathroom. Everything was in good condition (walls, floors etc) and did not look shabby or unclean. Comfortable beds.For me the location is perfect, close to many metro stops and within walking distance of many places, and around the corner from the best shopping in Paris.The street it's on does have restaurants and bars on it and people were outside smoking, but we didn't find it noisy at night. If anything I liked the atmosphere.The only thing negative I have to say is that we were woken up in the mornings by hammering which seemed right beside our heads, but this was because our room was on the other side of the wall from the next building over, so this wasn't the hotel's fault.I will definitely go back to the Perle next time we're in Paris.

<Content>Second time and cant wait for third We are a family with three young boys ages 7, 10 and 12. This was our second time at La Perle and we cant wait for the next time. The staff are extremely freindly, never say no to anything, and the rooms are exactly what you need, clean, comfortable and bathrooms are new. Location is excellent though rooms on main street could be nosiy at night especially on weekends, but this is easily adressable if you ask for a quite room.

<Content>Enjoyed stay I read the reviews and decided to book after my agent recommended it. We found the rooms comfortable and very clean. The staff spoke english so it was easy to comunicate, plus they were eager to please. There was confusion on a triple room, so contact the hotel directly to make sure the room is large enough to sleep three adults. There is a metro station close so we used that and only used a taxi to check in and out. Area is very safe, with shopping and eating all around.

<Content>All-around superb! Every aspect of La Perle is excellent. Nice, well kept property, very professional and helpful staff, well appointed and clean rooms and a great location. The hotel is just a block from St. Sulpice cathedral (of Da Vinci Code fame) and very near two subway stops. Gobs of good restaurants and shopping, shopping, shopping within easy walking distance.

<Content>a pearl of a hotel I know Paris( having lived there 20 years) and I know hotels,( having been in the business), and I loved the Hotel LaPerle! The 6th arrdt is very central and has both history and high fashion. Great Metro possibilities in close proximity.The hotel staff is friendly and competent. You get a real welcome.Super professional, and helpful; Lovely well appointed room with nice amenities super clean and although small the rooms are not tiny. This is Paris after all. Its three stars but to my thinking its a tiny 4 star!!Only the breakfast offerring seemed less that all it could be but then the French are not very Breakfast conscious.The Hotel LaPerle is an excellent choice for anyone with taste and a love of Paris at it's very best!

<Content>A 14 year long realtionship with the hotel For 14 years I have been a regular customer at this Paris hotel. I have remained so loyal for several reasons: The personnel has changed very little and has the personal qualities of kindness and frioendliness that I usually only encounter in the hotels of the Far East. The quality of the rooms, beds, bedlinen, bathrooms and bathtowels are first calss. I find it very suited for writing and for relaxing when the day is over. The breakfast is - without being overwhelming - more thand adequate.As a diplomat I travel a lot and this is indeed my favorite Paris hotel without a doubt and I have recommended it to many friends. They have all loved it.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in the heart of Paris Exceptional location in the heart of Paris within walking distance from most interesting sites. Close access to metro and bus. We chose this hotel more than 10 years ago and return for 3-4 times a year for several nights. There are many recommendable restaurants close by. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but very comfortable and charming; those facing the courtyard are amazingly quiet. The breakfast with fresh fruit juices and pastries is of high quality. We recommended this hotel to all our friends.

<Content>fantastic-galleries We stayed in Hotel La Perle for a couple of nights in Nov 2007. We liked it a lot. The staff, especially Lydia, is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small, but very cute and clean, the bathroom has a large bathtub. Location is excellent, within a walking distance to the best of the museums, galleries, boutique shopping and great surrounding places to eat. The price is very reasonable given the location. Ask for the courtyard side because the street side has something going on till 3 am., so it;s quite noisy at night The only thing that disappointed us was our friend left us a message that we have never received. We will definitely come back again.

<Content>Loved Le Pearle My husband and I stayed at Le Perle the end of September, 2007. The staff was amazingly helpful and friendly. We felt most welcome from the first time we entered the lobby. The rooms are clean but small. When you have the whole city of Paris to explore, a clean small room is everything you need!! There's also a tiny gift boutique in the lobby for last-minute purchases.Breakfast was filling and the hotel is very near to wonderful bistros, shopping and sites. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood.

<Content>Reviews are accurate Other reviews are accurate, this is a lovely hotel, fantastic location. Staff very helpful but rooms facing the street are noisy. Asked for courtyard room but very late arrival so didn't get one. Streetside rooms are not quiet until about 3am, either join them or get the earplugs out!

<Content>Fair to Poor Service; room and location fine We chose this hotel because we had seen it on a prior trip and liked it. The service was disappointing. Our friends left us phone messages twice and stopped by to leave us a message and we received none of those 3 messages. So unfortunately we missed getting together with them in Paris.Also once at the front desk I asked for some assistance and the clerk without even looking up at me said they were too busy to help. Another time, I asked how the weather would be for the day and I was told to go to the elevator as it was posted inside.

<Content>hidden pearl This past weekend was my 4th or 5th stay at the hotel. I always find it very cosy and has great access for everywhere. It is hidden in a tiny street where you would never imagine finding a hotel. It is very practical for shopping too. You can get in and out, drop off all your packs! It's walking distance to lots of cafes and restaurants. The rooms are very clean and neat. The only problem is the closet. It's enough for a long weekend but does not have hangers for skirts! One might find the rooms small but why should we stay in when the whole city is waiting outside?!

<Content>Wonderful Left Bank Hotel We stayed at La Perle for four nights in September and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We recommend the hotel highly because of its wonderful location in a marvelous Left Bank neighborhood, with good access to public transportation and within easy walking distance of almost all the tourist attractions. The neighborhood has excellent restaurants, cafes and brasseries virtually on every corner.The rooms are admittedly small, which is typical for this part of the city. Our room faced the courtyard and was both dark and quiet. If you place a high value on spacious, comfortable rooms, you should either seek a hotel in another part of the city or be prepared to spend a small fortune. Although small, our room was perfectly adequate and had beautiful wood-beamed ceilings. We would have appreciated a larger closet, and some of the furnishings were a bit tired.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. When we needed a taxi, they were able to produce it right on schedule. They all spoke English quite well and bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable.

<Content>Poor value for money Based on Trip Advisor reviews we booked one night here before flying out of CDG airport. It presents a charming facade on a tiny Left Bank street and staff were very pleasant, helpful and multi-lingual. However we had a standard room furnished with chain motel quality furniture. It was clean but in need of refurbishing and had zero charm. Had a tiny flat-screen TV with poor picture quality on some stations, good storage, comfortable but low bed and very good sound proofing. Lots of bars and restaurants on the street so this was its saving grace. Bathroom had tub/shower combo with a shower curtain and decent counter storage. There was a step up to the tub which could be dangerous and made a long reach from the sink to a hand towel.Since we had a flight to make we had the buffet breakfast which had variety but was expensive. They could not make a decent cup of tea.We have stayed in 3 hotels in the 7th arrondissement over the past 10 years and any one of them would be a better value than La Perle.

<Content>wonderful hotel in great location La Perle is a wonderful hotel in a great location. Like most rooms in Paris, our room was small, but very well laid out. It was in the back, on the courtyard, and hence very quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful, arranging taxis, etc. Good breakfast at resonable price, and nice bar. Wireless access for a fee. The neighborhood has St. Sulpice, many fine restaurants, and several convenient Metro lines, plus it's an easy walk to the Louvre, Latin Quarter, Notre Dame, etc.

<Content>Great Staff My wife and I celebrated our 16 year wedding anniversary and stayed at Hotel La Perle from Sept. 21st until the 26th. The hotel staff first and foremost were fantastic. They were accomadating and helpful at every turn and made us feel welcome from the moment we entered the lobby. The hotel is situated in a fantastic, quaint neighborhood just off the main boulevard of Saint Germain which was within walking distance to most of the major sites and just a few blocks from the subway. The room was not too spacious but it was clean and quiet. We would definately stay again provided the chance!

<Content>An oasis I have been staying at Hotel la Perle for about 7 or 8 years. I travel to Paris at least twice per year for about 5 days per visit. If you are looking for consistency in service, cleanliness, courtesy, value, coupled with a superb location, then Hotel la Perle is an excellent choice.An unusual attribute of la Perle is the tenure of the superior staff. Amin or Lydia will greet you at reception and will be wonderful at helping you navigate through the streets and restaurants and maze that makes Paris so unique. And the breakfast room/bar area is truly an oasis with all the natural light and friendly atmosphere enhanced by guests from all over the world.This is truly one of those little gems.Barry - Montreal

<Content>consistant We have many experiences of Paris hotels, so were not too concerned at the very small rooms at La Perle. The location is fantastic, so close to everything. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast courtyard area an added bonus. Paris hotels can sometimes be very surprising, but at least at La Perle the staff all speak english, the food is consistant and the location is wonderful.

<Content>A home away from home in Paris This is our third stay at Hotel La Perle so we can vouch for the consistency of service from this small and friendly hotel. We love everthing about the hotel. We always stay in a superior room - they are very comfortable and the beds are wonderful. The location is great - close to everthing you want on the left bank and within easy walking of 3 metro stations. It is the people who run the hotel that make the difference. If they are not the owners - they behave like they are. Nothing is too much problem and they make you feel that La Perle is a home away from home. It is good value and high quality everything.

<Content>Excellent location Spent 5 nights at Hotel La Perle and enjoyed it very much. We had a superior room on the 5th floor overlooking the courtyard so noise was no problem. The room was small by US standards but how much time is one in their room in Paris.The front desk was very pleasant and helpful. Each day after sightseeing we would enjoy a glass of wine in the tiny bar and the bartender there was quite nice as well.Great location--walking distance to sights. Close to metro stops. Many good restaurants in the area. St. Suplice church and Blvd St. Germaine block away. Purchased museum pass from front desk--well worth it.

<Content>Perfect location We chose this hotel based on the reviews in Trip Adviser and we were not disappointed . The hotel is located in a side street which has a great buzz about it ;is not commercialised and has a real flavour of the everyday working life in the city.We had an executive room which was fine though because it was long and narrow meant we were squeezing past each other at times. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was excellent. Good shower and bath .We had a glass of wine in the bar most evenings and found it to be cheaper there than most other bars . The bar was usually quiet which was a pity as we thought it was a very pleasant environment .We found the staff to be friendly ,helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing . St Germain de Pres is an interesting area where many writers and philosophers such as Sartre and Rene Descartes lived . We loved it and would certainly go back to Hotel La Perle.

<Content>Loved La Perle! We stayed at La Perle this past July and found it to be clean, comfortable and centrally located. The staff was friendly and most helpful in assisting us. Museums, good shopping, great cafes, churches, and the Seine are all within walking distance.We plan on returning to Paris and will definitely plan on staying at La Perle.

<Content>A Great Place in Paris We stayed at this hotel in July and loved it. Great location, close to everything - restaurants, attractions, shopping, etc. The staff was unfailingly helpful and friendly. The room was small by American standards, but we found that to be the case in virtually all European hotels in which we stayed. You get used to it. The room was in very good condition though - clean and well maintained. The A/C worked well during the hot nights. Good internet access in the lobby. Street-side rooms can be noisy at night. Request an interior facing room. We definitely felt the hotel offered good price-value and would love to stay here again.

<Content>Travelling Australians The last time I was in Paris I was single, 25 years ago, this time I retruned with my husband and 2 children 18 and 16 for 5 nights. The hotel is in a fabulous location just off Boulevard St. Germain in a one way street. The street can be noisy so request a courtyard outlook. There are wonderful reastaurants within 5 minutes of the hotel and the staff were very helpful in making reservations.The rooms are very small, but clean and if I returned I would book a deluxe room. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as the breakfast room looked bland and uninviting with packets of jam on the tables. I reccomend Pauls ( a patisserie/cafe chain and great value) or Les Deux Magots for breakfast both of which are a short walk from the hotel.The staff at the desk were not very friendly and on a couple of occasions I felt as though I should apologise for disturbing their day. A good laundry service but no iron in the room. I would reccomend this hotel but check location of room and if you are there for longer than 2 nights book a larger room.

<Content>Good price, great location We stayed in this hotel in March, and while the decor was a bit outdated, we found the room to be clean and a decent-size. The staff was very nice, and the breakfast that they offer (not included in the price) was very good. Our third floor room overlooked the courtyard, and it was very quiet for our entire stay. The elevator was pretty tiny though, so if you have a lot of luggage, you may not be able to fit it all in the elevator at once. One kind of weird thing though: throughout our stay, the maintenance staff stowed the mop in the stairwell--maybe they don't expect people to use the stairs that often?The location was great, as it was within walking distance of several Metro stops. I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to say in the Saint-Germain area.

<Content>Ok, but a bit overpriced My fiance and I stayed in a superior room for 2 nights in the last weekend of June. The location is great, right in the heart of St. Germain. The staff were friendly. However, the room was only average. The size of the bedroom and bathroom were big by European standards, but the carpet was tired and old. The decor was a bit dated with no real character. The nooks and crannies were not cleaned very well (e.g., the curtain, behind the bathroom door, etc.). The bathroom was clean and large, but the tub, sink, and toilet were squeezed to one side of the room. This left a large space in front of the window that was completely empty and open with no function other than to have one small, not so clean stool.We woke up on Saturday morning to the loud sounds of the cleaning staff turning over the room next door. The walls are very thin.In general, the stay was fine, but definitely overpriced for 鈧?85 per night. We have stayed in other places in the area, with just as nice locations at a same price which were cleaner, with thicker walls, and with much more character.

<Content>Excellent location This hotel is very conveniently located in the St. Germain district, very close by the subway, two bus lines and lots of restaurants. The hotel is surprisingly modern, and the room was very clean and up to date. We were very fortunate to have the only room on the bottom floor, and aside from hearing every time somebody flushed (it's an old city!) the room was quiet. Breakfast at 13 euros seemed a bit expensive, so we found a bakery about a block from the hotel and had delicious baked goods at a fraction of the cost. Overall a good value in an expensive city.

<Content>rude staff I am shocked to read other reviews saying how helpful the staff was. The front desk was anything but helpful. I spent 3 nights there and upon check in the room's air conditioning did not work. When we returned later that evening it still was not working. When I went back to the front desk the man working the desk came up to the room with me. The fact that the unit was blowing (hot air) meant to him that the air conditioning was working. When I asked about another room, none was available. I called my tour operator for suggestions and they spoke to the hotel, suddenly there was another room available. Air conditioning worked occassionally in the second room. When asking for bus number information we were told there was no buses to the Eifel Tower. Of course there are buses to the Eifel Tower. We were helped only when we questioned him and at that point we were a large inconvenience to him even though no one else was waiting at the desk. He was also rude about use of computer which is in very poor condition. Monitor is extremely difficult to read. Rooms were clean and hotel is in a good location but the staff at the reception desk were far from helpful. I would not stay here again nor would I suggest it to anyone. It might be a good hotel if you are part of a tour group and do not need any information or suggestions from the front desk (no concierge). Also small animals are allowed so a dog barking from the courtyard was not unusual early in the morning.

<Content>Awesome little place in excellent location We just completed a stay at La Perle and it was a joy. We love to stay in the 6th when we're in Paris, and this was our 4th time in the last 6 years and our 4th hotel try. By far, the La Perle was the best of all. Hotel staff was VERY helpful and accommodating. The breakfast buffet looked quite complete and ran the typical hotel cost for the continental breakfast (we didn't eat there.) The location is fabulous... it is on a set of small one way streets that are more pedestrian than auto ready... and they're full of little bistros and restaurants, small boutiques and an english language bookstore. Our room was big for Paris and neither of us spent time crawling between the walls/desk/closets and bed to get around. Beyond the immediate location, the hotel is about 2 blocks from two different metro lines, close to two movie theaters, and not that far from the Luxembourg gardens.We were thrilled with our stay there and we both agreed we'd stay there again and again.

<Content>Great Hotel  We spent 4 nights at the LaPerle in May  loved it! The location was perfect  really gave us the feeling of being in Paris - quaint street (limited car access) with many wonderful cafes  shops to choose from. Also great access to the metro bus  subway lines. We found the staff to be very, very accommodating, the room highly adequate (altho not large by U.S. standards), very comfortable beds  bedding and overall excellent service. One tip - ask for the upgrade to superior room so it will be on the inner court. Our room was on the 5th floor over the inner court  was exceptionally quiet - but we overheard other guests saying their room on the hotel front was noisy in the evenings due to people in the cafes across the street. If we get to go to Paris again, we will definitely stay at the LaPerle. We arrived very early from our U.S. flight (7:30 a.m.) and didn't expect to be able to do anything other than store our luggage until later in the day, but they welcomed us warmly, invited us to partake of their breakfast, fixed us much-needed coffee,  had us in our room within an hour! Also, their recommendations for restaurants, etc. were great. They even went out of the way to mail us a scarf we had inadvertently left when we checked out. Dave  LindaSacramento, CA

<Content>Enjoyed La Perle My girlfriend and I stayed at La Perle for five nights in mid May 2007. We very much enjoyed the hotel and loved Paris. The hotel is just a couple of blocks off St. Germain which is a great place to stay - lots of great shops and boutiques, restaurants, galleries, and attractions. Plus the hotel is very close to two different metro lines so accessing the rest of the city is easy.Within a ten to fifteen minute walk are the Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Notre Dame, St. Chappelle and St. Sulpice. Others, such as the MuseesRodin and Picasso, and the Pompideau centre, are a little further butalso walkable. Other attractions (Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe) are just a short distance away by metro, which in Paris is easy and safe to use.The hotel itself is above average and good value for downtown Paris. The street is quite quiet at night and I didn't have any trouble withnoisy neighbors outside or in other rooms. Yes, the rooms are very small, but quite comfortable and you will spend most of your time outside. The hotel has a small breakfast area and lounge off the lobby and a computer you can use for internet access.If you are considering going on the Open Top bus tour around the city, there is a stop quite close to the hotel on St. Germain. However, it is not the main route (there are four routes altogether) and we waited a long time for the bus to come by (it also ends for the day sooner than the main line). It is a better idea to walk down to Notre Dame where two or three of the bus routes intersect and you can board there.We bought a five day metro pass which we found very handy, and we also bought a 6 day museum pass which also was very useful and saved us quite a lot of time waiting in lines at the main attractions. Both are worth buying.The Louvre and D'Orsay are of course fantastic, as is Versailles if you get the chance (although Versailles is unbelievably busy). One highlight, especially if you like Monet's work, is the Musee D'Orangerie. It is just past the Louvre and is excellent. I also thought the Hotel Des Invalides was amazing.Have a great trip!

<Content>Perfect La Perle We just returned from a three day stay at this small hotel. We prefer more intimate hotels such as this one as we enjoy the personal service and contacts with the staff. We had (as well as our travel companions) a room on the street. Both rooms were large and had wonderful and clean barhrooms. It was a bit noisy in the evening with the noisy customers across the way enjoying themselves. My husband actually enjoyed the chatter. We had the casement windows open. When we closed them the sounds were hardly noticable.Two things that were exceptional about La Perle were the location of the hotel and the staff. We speak no French at all and were concerned after hearing so many stories about the rude French. Much to our delight we found that NOT to be the case at all. The staff went out of thier way to make arrangements for us with care.The location of the hotel is on a small side street, almost the size of an alley. There were numerous restaurants in the immediate area. Each one we visited had wonderful food and friendly service.We have always heard how beautiful Paris was and now we can agree. It is also the cleanest city Wwe have ever visited. They power wash the sidewalks/streets several times a week!

<Content>La Perl is a Pearl My wife and I spent 3 nights at La Perle May, 07-had 2 rooms on the courtyard. Was quiet and commfortable. Service and personnel were very kind and helpful to us. The location near St. Sulpice church and Blvd St. Germain was perfect-lots of reasonable places to eat right on that street or very close by. We enjoyed our stay there and would go back.

<Content>Good stay at the Hotel La Perle for the Price Range My husband and I just returned froma 4 night stay at the Hotel La Perle (May 14-18th, 2007). We paid $185 euro per night for a superior double room facing the courtyard. Though the room is small, as most rooms in this price range are in Paris, it was quite clean and the location was great. It's located on a very quaint street with boutiques, restaurants, pubs and creperies. On a side note, there is a wonderful little Italian pizza place across the street from the hotel (Pizza Positano) that serves authentic Neapolitan pizza nd pasta. Delicious! We ate there twice. Good shopping in the surrounding areas and walking distance to many key sights. About a 15 min. walk to Notre Dame and 5-10 min. walk to Luxembourg Gardens, St. Sulpice, etc. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Our only complaint would be that the walls are very, very thin and you can hear everything going on in the hallways or in the room next to you. You can't hear any street noise from the room which is quite nice but we were woken up fairly early (6 or 7 a.m.) on several mornings either by the guests in the next room or by maids cleaning, couldn't quite tell.For the price range and location, I would recommend it. The area has a lot of character and overall, we enjoyed our stay there.

<Content>Fantastic location  I stayed here for 5 nights in early May, as part of my continuing search for a decent hotel for single travellers (i.e. small room acceptable) under EUR150/night near St Germain. Though I got a great price (for Paris) on the hotel website, I was still disappointed in the overall quality of the hotel  would definitively not return.Pros: Absolutely fantastic location, within a 10 min walk of 3 metro lines, great restaurants/bars/cafes, shopping, 20 mins to major museums  the right bank. Room was of decent size  kept very clean, no smoking odors. Most of staff helpful  friendly. Quick check-in/out procedure.Cons: Unprofessional staff behavior - when I arrived, the cleaning staff were having a huge screaming row downstairs, which could be clearly heard throughout the lobby. This continued for 30 mins; no one did anything to stop it. The staff (I never ate here but the guest computer is right next to the breakfast room) simply threw the silverware into the cutlery trays every morning, making an awful noise. The walls of my room were so thin I could hear every guest on my floor coming  going. The shower pressure was so weak as to be laughable,  the temperature fluctuations were painful. My minibar was only refilled 3 out of the 5 days (I was almost never in the room). The guest computer didn't work well  there was no printer, which was inconvenient.Overall the place just seemed a bit shabby  poorly managed, which is enough to put me off staying there again. I preferred the nearby Hotel de Fleurie, which is in the same price range, but I'd still try another hotel next time.

<Content>Great Stay at Hotel La Perle We stayed at the Hotel La Perle for 8 nights in late April, booking with the hotel directly after reading many reviews online here at TripAdvisor. We found the hotel to be just as described by other reviewers. We stayed in an executive room on the top floor facing the courtyard. It was very quiet with nice air conditioning. It was good sized by European standards with even a small sitting area by the French windows facing the courtyard which was very nice to relax at the end of a day of sightseeing. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating, helping us in every way possible. We did not eat the breakfast they served as it was expensive. The location of the Hotel LaPerle is wonderful. It is possible to walk to many sites. We did use the metro extensively, using a Carte Orange Pass. There are two metro stations very close. The bank just a block away on Blvd. St. Germaine was a great spot to use the ATM with our debit card and get cash for the day. We loved the whole area, the restaurants, cafes, shops, ambiance. We walked to the Luxembourg Gardens. The Rue de Buci area just across Blvd. St. Germaine was especially fun. We'd stay at the Hotel La Perle again, no doubt. We had a wonderful Paris visit with this hotel as our base.We did ask the front desk to order an early cab (6:00 A.M.) for us on our day of departure. It was not a Taxi Parisian as hoped, but was a shuttle service. They told us it would be 45-50E. It was 60E to the airport, but could have been the early hour.

<Content>Great location April 2007 Aussie TouristsWe decided to stay at the La Perle after reading good reviews on Trip Advisor. The location was fantastic, the staff friendly and helpful and the room a good size, as we took the hint and booked a room facing the courtyard.The courtyard rooms are not only a bit bigger but also quiet and we were never woken by noise during our 5 night stay.The staff as mentioned were very good and our limited French was never a problem.The location we thought exceptional as Metro stations were close by, hundreds of restaurants within the square kilometer and the Seine merely a 10 minute walk.Although we wouldn't class the hotel as inexpensive we thought it to be good value for Paris, a classy establishment in an up market location which added to a wonderful April break in Paris

<Content>Recommended hotel in Paris! This is a great hotel for a weekend in Paris. The hotels I usually stay in were full (this was a last minute trip) so I did my research and stumbled upon this excellent spot. The location is great - very close to both St Germain des Pres and Mabillon metro stops. It's a few steps from St Sulpice, from the Marche St Germain, and from all the other wonderful places in the 5th and 6th arrondissements. There are some excellent restaurants in the vicinity if you don't want to venture far, but, as well as location, this hotel has the benefit of friendly staff and very clean, comfortable rooms. This is Paris, so don't expect a room the size of a ballroom...however, we had a small double room which was big enough for two people. The green curtains and green bathroom were slighly outdated, but as mentioned before, spotlessly clean and the water pressure was better than in some 5* hotels I've stayed in! I will definitely stay at La Perle again, and will recommend it to friends who visit Paris as a perfect base for a short trip to the city. Ask for a room facing the courtyard (quiet).

<Content>A Left Bank Gem! I have been to Paris many times. My girlfriend and I went together for the first time in August of 2006 and stayed for 6 nights. It was truly a wonderful experience. Our room was facing the courtyard area, which we requested so that we wouldn't have to deal with any street noise. Turns out that the street it's on, Rue des Canettes, is tiny and very quiet. They have a small bar/restaurant that has about 6 tables and is very cute and efficient. The room was on the small side, but totally functional and very comfortable: small flat-screen cable TV hanging on the wall, two big French door windows, hair dryer installed in the bathroom wall. The hotel is immaculately well-kept and the staff was very friendly and happy to help us with directions or making restaurant reservations for us. It is in the midst of a great neighborhood for shops and cafes around St. Germain-des-Pres. I would highly recommend this gem and look forward to returning.

<Content>La Perle Hotel My husband and I stayed at La Perle for four nights in March and we would like to recommend it to travellers. We had read the reviews and found them to be accurate and helpful in our decision to stay there. The location was excellent and the room was very good. The only problem was the use of two beds pushed together and single doonas for a double bed . The bathroom was very good and everything was clean. the staff were helpful and friendly. We had a wonderful stay for our first trip to Paris.L. Stevens Australia

<Content>Long Weekend in Paris The St. Germain des Pres area is lovely to visit -- many cafes, shops, historic sites. A lot of side streets full of shops, bars, restaurant's etc. We went from Friday to Monday in late March and found the Hotel to be clean, friendly and in a very good location. Within easy reach of the Metro and walkable to Notre Dame (heart of the city). Hotels rooms are small (but you dont go to Paris to sit in your Hotel room all weekend). One tip - request a room overlooking the inner courtyard. The rooms overlooking the street are very noisy (with people coming out the bars/restaurants, not cars). Another tip - don't use the Hotel to order you a taxi transfer when you arrive as they are too expensive. Just jump in a taxi (鈧?0) for four of us. It's fine to get the Hotel to order you a taxi to return you to the airport (CDG). It's a small hotel but appeared to be well run and we would stop there again.

<Content>Hate To Share The Secret But, La Perle was a really great experience. The staff was very gracious, always friendly, and accomodating to my every need, be it Metro directions, restaurant recommendations, or helping me find a big and tall shop. Yes, the room was a little small and I couldn't figure out how to turn down the heat (I never asked the staff for help), but since my windows opened to the courtyard and I could listen to the rain, it wasn't a very big issue and I didn't care very much. I can imagine the bar across the alley being loud, but in my patio-facing room, I couldn't hear anything. Good water pressure in the shower and the bed was very comfortable. I liked the breakfast downstairs as well as the local creperie and overpaying at Cafe De Flore (go for the experience). Very good location. Right in the center of the city and easy access to three different Metro lines. I booked online (easy) and stayed five nights in early February. When I return to Paris, I plan to stay at La Perle again.

<Content>good location but incredibly noisy and just Ok rooms The hotel is on a trendy narrow street right in the heart of St Germain and very close to St Sulpice. We had a room overlooking the street on the 5th floor so pleasant views to the left and right. There is a very busy bar across the road that spills onto the street and the noise is incredible into the early hours - then the noisy street cleaners arrive! The hotel was incredibly hot - it was unseasonably warm outside - and the airconditioning did nothing except add more noise so we had the window open and those people in the bar could have been in our room we could hear them so clearly. I booked a standard room but emailed to ask for a superior room and got a confirmation. When we arrived I thought the room was quite ordinary but (being English) didn't bother to check if it was a superior room - just put up with it. When we checked out and saw the bill I realised that we had stayed in a standard room.Our guide book stated that a taxi to the airport would cost around 35 euros. on Sunday night it was nearly 70 euros. The hotel seemed very keen to book us a taxi (ythey told us we would wait 30 mins at the ticket offie at the station). When the car arrived it wouldn't start and I had to push it to get it going - I'm guessing not paris's most prestigious cab company!

<Content>It won't disappoint unless... You've read it all here before, La Perle is perfectly clean and comfortable, very helpful staff, wonderful location. My only reservation, and I add this in the spirit of giving readers a wider view - is that La Perle is well...neutral. Architecturally it is indifferent, its not quirky, its not funky, there's not much atmosphere. It won't lift your spirits and make you sigh '...aah Paris' when you walk through the door. I realise many people won't worry about that - they'll be grateful that the shower is hot and loo flushes, that they feel safe, and the place is well run.. .and so they should. But if you looking for romantic Paris - be it the furniture, a pooch, a special breakfast jam, unusual decor, something with a bit of mystery or charm, even at the expense of walking the stairs or a noisy pipe - you might keep looking. (We paid 230 Euros for a room, the largest on offer)

<Content>Loved everything about La Perle We stayed 10 nights at La Perle in October 2006 and loved it. The location is superb on a narrow, charming side street and perfectly situated to set off walking in any direction. We found the rooms very comfortable and very clean; we loved the quiet of the courtside room. The breakfast was just enough -- very well presented and very good. The break fast area is in the courtyard but is covered over with a glass roof -- light and airy.The staff was exceptionally friendly and spoke very good English. Any English speaker will feel able to ask questions. If we are fortunate to visit Paris again, we would love to stay at La Perle.The St. Germain des Pres area is lovely to visit -- many cafes, shops, historic sites and close to the Luxembourg Gardens. Do not miss the Cluny museum of medieval art with gorgeous gold pieces and the spectacular Lady and the Unicorn tapestries. Another tip in a different area: plan on visiting the Musee Jacquement Andre, quite exquisite.

<Content>La Perle is a pearl! We stayed here in early September and liked it so much we returned in late September. All of the positives mentioned in the reviews below are true. The staff were especially helpful, especially Anya. We followed her recommendation for dining at La Petite Court about 2 blocks away and were delighted. Although the rooms are on the small side they have a lot of light thanks to large windows. Room 51 had a window in the bathroom, a major plus in my book. The location is ideal from every aspect. (Note: The review below that mentions Marennes is about a different hotel, not the one in Paris.)

<Content>perfect location, excellent service We had an absolutely wonderful experience here. The hotel location is drop-dead perfect for shopping and restaurants, with very easy access to most of central Paris by walking or metro. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and professional at all times. Our courtyard room was perfectly quiet and clean, though would be considered quite small by american standards. Loved, loved, loved this hotel!

<Content>Nearly Perfect! We stayed at La Perle for 4 nights the end of Sept/beginning of October and were very happy with our choice. The hotel is in a GREAT location, with tons of restaurants and cafes right outside the front door. The hotel staff was exceptional, spoke perfect English and very helpful. We were able to walk all over Paris from the hotel. The only downside, as noted in other reviews, was that the rooms are a bit small (we had a standard double). However, they are clean, modern and well-kept so that certainly makes up for it. The breakfast buffet was good as well. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Paris and we will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great location We stayed here for 6 nights while in Paris - our initial 4 nights, then our last 2 in France. We chose it for the location knowing at the time only the museums and sights we wanted to see while in Paris. It is tucked away on a side street surrounded by excellent restaurants - many french cuisine, but the Italian place right across the street is better than some I've eaten at in Italy! It is in between great shopping in St Germain, the Luxembourg gardens, and the Latin Quarter. We walked everywhere in the city and never felt too far from anything.The staff spoke pretty good english and were helpful with food recommends and directions. All were friendly. The room was very clean and pretty good sized (we had a different room for our last 2 nights), and the bathroom was a decent size with good water pressure in the shower. Breakfast was good when we didn't want to find a cafe.

<Content>Fine Small Hotel, Great Location This is a small, comfortable hotel at a reasonable price in an excellent location on the Left Bank. It's down the block from St. Sulpice, and a couple of blocks from St.-Germain-des-Pres and the famed literary cafes La Folie and Deux Magots (where while having breakfast we spotted an honest-to-goodness famous American author). Close by are plenty of small restaurants in a variety of cuisines, and a supermarket. The continental breakfast is adequate if a bit sparse, served in a bright, cheerful atrium. We found our first room small (perhaps normal for Paris) and moved to a larger one, still not spacious by any means. In both cases the staff rushed to have the rooms cleaned and ready, which might excuse the less than meticulous cleaning jobs. We didn't have a problem with the daily cleanings.And the young staff, while friendly, willing, and with a generally good command of English, was often unable to provide the sort of neighborhood and sightseeing advice one would get from a concierge at a larger hotel. But La Perle isn't a large hotel - it's a small, friendly, well-located, cheerful Left Bank place and a good value.

<Content>We loved it! My husband and I honeymooned for a week in Paris and stayed at Hotel La Perle - it was excellent. The front staff were very helpful and friendly. The location in Saint Germaine can't be beat - you can literally walk out of your hotel room and into a great restaurant, cafe or bar. Close to the Metro, bus station, and great shopping. You can walk to the Louvre, Notre Dame, Jardin du Luxembourg, etc. We used Fodor's See It Paris the most b/c it has excellent maps and info, although Rick Steve's has good walking tours, tidbits, etc.

<Content>Great location, average hotel Stayed for eight nights at La Perle. Good location, very well situated among restaurants and metros and Left Bank activity. The hotel itself was OK. Room was small, and quietly located on the inner courtyard. Front-desk people are helpful when asked for specific assistance, but not imaginative in suggesting things or providing information about activities. The hotel's location is worth an excellent rating; the hotel itself warrants an average rating -- hence my overall rating of above average. Next time I would stay in same area, and look for another hotel with more ambiance and activity. That said, the hotel's internet specials provide worthwhile rates.

<Content>Great find We needed a hotel for just a night in Paris, as we were in transit from Provence back home. We arrived at the hotel on a Sunday evening after a long train ride, to find that they had no record of our on-line reservation. The desk staff was extremely friendly and worked with us, in fact, giving us an upgrade from what we had booked, at the same price. Everyone we dealt with was friendly, professional and very helpful. The hotel location is fantastic; we just walked a few blocks to get our favorite macaroons at Laudre on the Rue de Bonaparte!

<Content>Great location Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 4 nights in August as part of a bit of a tour around Europe, and it was a great start to our trip! It will never win any awards for spaciousness or great style, but it was perfect for us. The staff were friendly and helpful, it was peaceful and quiet (ask for a room that overlooks the courtyard) and a brilliantly 'French' location with loads of little bars and bistros right on your doorstep. It also didn't feel like a really touristy area so you felt you were getting a real taste of Paris. Notre Dame is a short walk away (recommend going up the tower here when it opens late on Sundays) and so is the Ille de Louis (probably spelt that wrong!) which had some lovely places for an evening meal. Lots of Metro stations are nearby too. Having been to the Eiffel Tower and seen the area around there, I would pick St. Germain again every time. Recommended.

<Content>An excellent hotel for a first trip to Paris I just returned from a 5 day trip to Paris with my mom, during which we spent 3 nights at La Perle.La Perle is situated on a little street in St. Germaine, where despite its size was full of Parisian cultured stores, cafes and restaurants. The hotel itself had a very personal, quiet and what felt like a very 'French' atmosphere. The staff was very welcoming and accomodating. Despite our slight language barrier they all very good English and were very helpful when it came to helping us find stores and restaurants recommended to us by other travellers. Our room itself was small but designed very well. My mom and I had plenty of room for all of our stuff and shopping in the room. The windows faced out onto the little courtyard in the middle of the hotel which also, felt very Parisian. Overall, I loved my stay at La Perle and would certainly recommend it to future travellers. It absolutely made my first trip to Paris go way beyond my expectations.

<Content>Great little place! My husband and I stayed here from April 1-6, 2006. It's just a nice, small, quaint place tucked away on a small side street near the church of St. Sulpice. Our room was clean and the bed was very comfy! It had a down comforter on it and that was sooo nice! There is a little courtyard in the center of the hotel which is pleasant. The employees were english speaking and helpful even when we may have appeared to be stupid tourists! It was quiet most of the time, but on a few nights there was singing from the restaurant across the street. It didn't last very long though and didn't disturb our sleep much. In a way, it was kind of fun to hear the singing in French! The room was small but nothing I wasn't already expecting. The European standard is simply different than the American standard and we didn't go there expecting a big room. There are several shops and restaurants right on the rue and all around the hotel. Take a little walk in any direction and you will find just about everything you are looking for shopping-wise. There is a little bar in the hotel and we had some nice wines there in the evenings. They offer a European-style breakfast but we never did eat there. I'm a Starbucks die hard and we trekked about ten minutes or so to get our fix each morning. The Starbucks is in the Odeon area and right in front of a subway entrance. We'd just hop the train and begin our adventures from there.Overall, I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice place off the beaten path. We were quite happy with it and enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Great location We have just returned from a lovely 5 night break in Paris. We selected this hotel on the basis of reviews from other Tripadvisor people and we weren't disappointed.The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was clean, quiet, airy, modern and comfortable; the bathroom was modern and exceptionally clean.The air conditioning was a huge bonus.The location is top class. There are lots of restaurants, cafes and busy bars all about. Main attractions are within a short walk.Breakfast was ok, probably not worth the price...better to get yourself to one of the hundreds of gorgeous cafe's in the area.Only niggle we had was with the cost of airport transfers that we arranged through the hotel. We feel we were mislead about the price and were charged 190 Euros for a return trip!!!But that aside, a great hotel, good value for money.

<Content>Simply outstanding Having been to Paris a number of times over the last few years, Hotel La Perle is the first and only place that I would call a home away from home! A small, charming and recently (?) renovated Hotel in one of Paris nicest areas and just a short walk away from one of my favorite places in the World - the Luxembourg Gardens.Small, but comfortable and impeccably clean rooms with air-conditioning (that actually works!).There were only two rooms on our floor and ours faced the cosy inner-courtyard, which allowed us to sleep with the windows open and yet it was completely quiet! In Saint-Germain-des-Pr茅s? Yepp - believe it or not!The staff? Simply wonderful - they all spoke English, they were very attentive and helpful at all times and gave us some great dinner suggestions (Monteverdi - we'll be back soon!). Special thanks to Andreas, Amin, Anja, Evi and Momo for taking such good care of us! We have finally found our home in Paris and strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting Paris.

<Content>A great hotel We chose La Perle after reading the Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. This is an excellent hotel located in an attractive area of Paris that is close to many of the major sites. The staff are very friendly and helpful and will ensure that you have an enjoyable stay. We stayed in one of the superior rooms that was located at the back of the hotel overlooking the courtyard. It was very quiet (even on the night when a rock band was playing in St Sulpice square less than 200 metres away) and it is worth paying a little extra for these rooms (they are larger as well as quieter). There are some good local restaurants (ask the staff for recommendations), but these are lively French bistrots rarther than an intimate dining experience. You will be rubbing shoulders (literally) with the person at the next table. The hotel breakfast is expensive for what is provided and I suggest that you find a cafe. A previous review recommends Pauls which is a short walk away and is very good value. I would certainly stay here again and will definitely recommend it to friends.

<Content>Perle's Great Location We stayed in the Hotel La Perle for eight nights in June, and really enjoyed the excellent location. The hotel is on a narrow one way street, with an awesome choice of many small, excellent restraunts within 2 blocks. The area is quiet in the morning, yet very active by afternoon and evening. Metro stations are also quite convienent.We had a nice room facing the courtyard that was very quiet and clean. We ate their breakfast each morning, which although is not cheap, we enjoyed it very much. The hotel staff was helpful when ever we had any questions.We took the metro to all the sights, did some english language walking tours, and enjoyed our week in Paris very much.

<Content>Wonderful stay at La Perle My wife and I stayed for 6 nights at the Hotel La Perle in June 2006. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is situated in a wonderful area of Paris (St. Germain area), and sits on a street with lots of activity - restaurants, shops, bakeries - and easy access to the metro. The hotel itself is a gem, the courtyard is a quiet sanctuary from the hustle-and-bustle of Paris, and the hotel staff is VERY NICE (warmest compliments to Anya and the others at reception, and the boys at the bar). We happened to be there during the early rounds of the World Cup, watching it on the TV in the courtyard while sipping wine and beer with the other hotel guests - very nice experience. The room itself was clean, and large (we had one of the bigger rooms, on the top floor). This hotel is a very friendly place, for Americans and everyone else. When we return to Paris, we will definitely stay at the Hotel La Perle again.

<Content>Another nice stay at La Perle We really like La Perle, although it was interesting to hear the reaction from friends from the US who were travelling with us, who were not as impressed. Paris hotel rooms can be smaller than US visitors are used to, can have traces of smell of cigarette smell even though they are no longer smoking rooms, and you can sometimes hear street noise. That being said, La Perle is one of the best and minimising all of these and providing a fair price for the amenities offered - especially if you get one of their larger inside rooms. I'll challenge you to find friendly staff in this part of Paris.We would stay here again.

<Content>Fabulous hotel!! Fabulous neighborhood!! Fabulous trip!! A friend of mine recommended this hotel as she's living in Paris now - and it was excellent!! The hotel was close to three metro stops and walking distance to Notre Dame, the Louvre and some excellent shopping. There are also 5 excellent restaurants within a 5 min walk - from some great Italian restuarants to beautiful white linen table topped Parisian restaurants. I wouldn't stay any place else upon my return!!

<Content>Excellent Paris Hotel I was pretty nervous as a woman alone staying in Paris, not knowing the language, and never having been in Europe before. I did a lot of research before booking my 5 nights in Paris at the Hotel La Perle. I am so glad I did.As other reviews have said, it's very, very quiet-at least if you have a courtyard room as I did. One night a block away there was a huge outdoor concert blasting. With the windows closed, I could barely hear a thing, and I'm very sensitive to noise.All the people at the desk spoke excellent English, and were extremely helpful.The room was very clean, and very pleasant to stay in.The location was terrific, tons of restaurants within a couple of blocks (I particularly recommend La Boussole), an English bookstore a block away, a safe area to walk around at night. I walked with ease to the Louvre, the Musee D'Orsay, the Rodin Museum, the Luxembourg Gardens.I recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Simply Wonderful The Hotel La Perle on rue des Canettes is a charming, quiet, clean hotel with a wonderful staff. I was very nervous about staying here- only because with so many choices I wanted to make sure I found something perfect for our 20th anniversary. I did! We arrived at 11am- exhausted but excited for our adventure and were allowed to check right in- I had let them know ahead of time and that helps- they had my email in a little folder with our name on it! We went up to our room- which was adorable- simple, cool and CLEAN!! Great AC-individually controlled and again-quiet!! There were only 2 rooms on our floor-we never saw anyone in the other room-no noise above us or next to us. It was smaller than American standards but who cares- you're in Paris- we are tall people- 6'5'' and 5'7 and we had plenty of room- 2 twins pushed together as requested- a double would have been too small. The bathroom was little but modern and clean- 2 windows open up over the tub-very cute! It even smelled clean- not fake smelling. The bedroom had 2 large windows which opened up onto a small courtyard where breakfast was served every morning-13e-didn't try it but it looked good. Drinks were also served on the patio at night- that we did try and loved it! The bartender was wonderful and when we were ready to go he said -please - one more glass of wine - on me- relax and enjoy- which we did!!  There was a family reunion going on that night and the hotel gave them menus from the restaurant down the street and they ate in peace and quiet on the patio- it's not an easy thing to do to get a table for 12 in Paris but the hotel was so very accomodating-especially because they had 2 little girls running around!! One night we followed the girl at the front desk going to the restaurant around the corner to drop off an order- very nice!She gave us excellent recomendations and made reservations for us at Le Petit Cour-amazing! They were more than willing to help and went out of their way- but not intrusive. Just a perfect experrience!I went to check out the other places I was thinking of staying- Le Regent on rue Dauphine-way too busy of a street and BW Premier Left Bank-funky smell in reception area- moldy. I was so pleased with my choice. This hotel is on a very small side street which is bustling at night with cafes and bars and adorable shops during the day- but no cars or scooters(well very few-its only 1 way)- very very quiet!! We will definitely stay here again when we return with our children next year. They don't have quad rooms but said we could just have the whole floor-our kids are 18  16 so that would be fine!At 140E I feel we had a great value for the money. Remeber- it is not fancy-no ornate furnishings or toile wallpaper-just clean and friendly-but very pretty.Stay at La Perle- you are so centrally located you can't believe it but yet feel like you are in your own little world! We loved it!!

<Content>Vewwy Vewwy Quiet I'm not hunting wabbits, but I am a very light sleeper. I do NOT like urban noise when I am trying to sleep. One thing I learned about finding a hotel is that if you see that the street is narrow or short, the hotel probably does not have a lot of traffic noise. That was spot on in this case. The street Rue Canette is only about a block long, terminating on a nice boulevard on one side and a plaza outside St. Sulpice on the other. It is narrow and quaint.I was in a room facing the courtyard, which was pretty quiet at night. They were renovating during the days some of the time I was there, but they are probably done by now. The shower took a little fiddling and a phone call to figure out (you pull on the tap to get the water to go up through it). The a/c worked for me just fine. My travel buddy had the next room. His a/c was not working, but they fixed it same day and it did work. The rooms were a little plain, but that's OK. I am not there to sit in the room and stare at the walls. The bathrooms were fine. As an American, I find myself to be a real diva about plumbing.The staff was polite and spoke good English. My buddy loved to start the day with a hearty session of Twenty Questions and the people at the front desk are happy to answer them. One nice thing was a brochure about a few restaurants a block away. We decided to just have dinners there 4 of our days, which made dinner easy to deal with. All 4 restaurants were very nice.Didn't try the breakfast. It was 13 Euros and I just opted to slope down to the cafe on the plaza and have my coffee and croissant while watching the people go by. That was a little more Parisian than the courtyard experience and half the cost. However, if you are really tired, that kind of thing comes in handy. Oh yeah, I had a small fridge. That was very useful, as I kept my snacks in there for the midnight jet lag munchies.Given the horrid rate of exchange, my bill (at the off season rate) was not too bad. I think it was a good value considering the fact that it was in the center of town and August.
