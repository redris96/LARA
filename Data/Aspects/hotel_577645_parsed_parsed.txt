<Content>Best Hotel We Stayed At This is a magnificent hotel. We got a room with a view of Venice's cobbled roofs. It was beautiful. Bed was so comfy even though I slept in the sofa! Flat Panel TV and Venice's Canals were right on our doorstep. Hotel has free internet access and will provide you directions of how to walk there from the famous Rialto bridge water metro station! Will welcome you at night and every morning we woke up to a freshly - made continental breakfast (optional) which we had in our private dining room with the view. An amazing hotel right in the heart of Venice!

<Content>Lovely, homely and spacious We recently stayed at the Residence Corte Grimani and were not disappointed. It is very spacious and cosy and lovely to return to after a day out. We were visiting with our five year old son and the extra space (as compared to a normal hotel room) was fantastic. It was very clean with good fitiings etc. Bathroom is nice and roomy. We were on the 5th floor and could see the domes of San Marco and the Bell Tower (when it was not foggy). The residence is really close to San Marco square as well as the Rialto Bridge. I would not hesitate to highly recommend this place to anyone going to Venice.

<Content>Wow! What a gem! After reading TripAdvisor reviews for this place, I was pleased to find 3 apartments available here for my group of friends. It was everything we had hoped it would be. The place is spotless, friendly, in a perfect location, great bathrooms, and the rooms are enormous. What more could you want?! Seriously, I couldn't believe the price either.My travelling buddy and I decided to share a room and were delighted to discover that our apartment has a second full bathroom and the sofabed was very comfortable. It was definitely worth the price for the upgraded room for us. We didn't use the kitchen but if we had been there longer or with kids it would have been perfect.Some of the previous reviews talked about the noise and yes, we could hear someone above us walking around a little but it wasn't bad at all. We were also in room 201 which has a view of the canal. It didn't seem terribly loud either with the windows closed. So, maybe if you are very sensitive to noise you might want to bring earplugs, but I didn't think it was a problem.Finally, the staff was helpful and cheerful -- and spoke great English.It was an all-around great experience and I highly recommend it!

<Content>Outstanding place to Stay We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Residence Corte Grimani after booking based on reviews read on TripAdvisor, and I have to say we were not mislead. The staff were incredibly friendly, the hotel was immaculate, the location beautiful. We loved the room (Superior Room). Our only concern had to do with the fact that you could hear people walking and chairs being dragged on the tile floor in the room above ours. This kept us from sleeping in one morning (which we were looking forward to as this was a weekend without the kids), but once we adjusted to our neighbour's schedule, it was fine. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Venice.

<Content>This is just a great little hotel! This hotel was great! Six of us stayed in the upstairs rooms with 2 foldout couches and 1 queensize bed. There are lots of windows looking down on a small canal that has lots of activity. It was quiet at night and the location was fantastic. When I first walked in, I thought it looked a little bare; but our two daughters- in law and sons loved it. The staff brought up a wonderful breakfast for us in the morning and were so nice and helpful - ordering a water taxi for our trip to the cruise ship, explaining how to get to the restaurant we had booked..... I can't say enough about this hotel. The cost was 420 euros, with a small % extra off for paying cash. One son and his wife stayed at Pensione Accademia and paid more than 500 euros for just the two of them. We usually stay at Pensione Accademia, but will stay here from now on!

<Content>An Outstanding Place to stay Staying for 5 nights, 16-21st October 2008, my wife and I and two sets of friends took three one-bed apartments at the Corte Grimani.The hotel is outstanding. Location, staff, size of rooms, facilities and relaxed atmosphere are all first class. The staff are a delight. ever friendly and ever present. The chambermaid services and cleaning is also first-class.The 'hotel' actually comprises lobby, breakfast room and small lounge and 15 one and two bed apartments, three to a floor, at prices that you would normally pay for a pokey and much less well located ensuite bedroom in a circa 3/4 star Venice hotel.The apartments are very, very spacious with a lounge/kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom(s) with masses of storage and hanging space. Beds are very large and comfroatable. The kitchen is very modern and well equiped. You can chose to use the kitchen facilities or not. We chose not to, preferring to have breakfast prepared for us and served in our apartment or going out for breakfast. The hotel does not have a restaurant and does not have top-end, 24hr on demand, five star facilties, but nor should it. Venice is an exploring city and hotels should be used to rest, sleep and occasionaly have a lzy breakfast.This is a gem of a hotel, supremely well located and a 'must-consider' for most travellers to venice.

<Content>Fantastic After finding this place on TripAdvisor we decided to book for three nights at the end of October. Booked one Classic with Room and one Superior Room. Both were absolutely fantastic.The Superior Room was massive. We had Rooms 401 and 502 and both were faultless. Great views and a great location.We wished we had booked the inbound private water taxi through the Hotel as the one we got at the airport wouldnt take us to the front door, and we had to haul our cases with the taxi driver as a guide from the Grand Canal. On departure we asked the Hotel to organise a private taxi, and this one came direct to the door. Much better.Venice is very expensive. At each end of the scale we loved Da Fiore Osteria, about 10 mins over the Rialto and very hard to find. Its a Michelin one star and will cost 140 euro per head plus wine but was outstanding. At the other end of the scale we loved the Gondoliers Bar, near the Hotel. Go out the front door and turn right over the bridge and its on your right facing the Gondola park. All the Gondoliers use it and its very cheap. By far the best value bar we found and most atmospheric too with all the locals and gondoliers in there. We also loved The San Marco Osteria near the Hotel. Excellent food.

<Content>Outstanding place to stay Superb appartments in a city where bedrooms are normally tiny. Beds very good (and large) and plenty of room everywhere. Excellent location, about 10 minutes to either St Marks or Rialto, and generally very quiet. The Staff were without fail welcoming, polite, helpful, and responsive - would recommend this hotel to anyone without the slightest fear they would be disappointed.

<Content>Excellent all around! Agree with the other reviews. This place is hidden and very hard to find. Follow their directions carefully. Once we got there, it was amazing. I never expected a room like this in Venice for the rate given. Great views, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The gentleman at the front desk is very kind and helpful. Staying anywhere else would be foolish! The place is centrally located. Having such a wonderful place to stay added special ambiance to the trip.

<Content>great but hard to find spent 4 nights as part of our honeymoon Europe tour, very hard to find as nobody knows where it is, but worth it when we found it. room over the canal was nice, singing gondoliers were nice in the evening but garbage collectors use the same canals in the morning as do suppliers and everybody else., so noisy in the morning, we will go back in December and take a room off the canal

<Content>What a great find! We walked into our apartment at Corte Grimani and our first reaction was This is the cleanest place we have ever stayed at in Italy. And we have stayed in small pensiones as well as 5 star hotels over the years. The hotel was an apartment building which was completely renovated in 2005 into 3 apartments per floor and is wonderful for families as there is so much room. It is about a 3 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. We had apartments #501 and #503, both on the top floor with delightful views over the rooftops. #501, which easily sleeps 6 (i king bed, 2 pull out queen size couches, 2 bathrooms as well as a living room/kitchen) also looked out over the canals - at a confluence of two so we could see bridges, activity, etc. Yet with the windows closed we heard just about nothing. There is a separate charge of 10 Euro/day for the use of the full kitchen as well as a 50 Euro kitchen cleaning charge. You can have breakfast brought to you for 15 Euro each (cereal, bread, croissants, yogurt, slice of ham and of cheese plus coffee/tea or chocolate) if you don't want to do it yourself. (Do be aware that if you arrive late on a Saturday you will have to go quite a ways on Sunday to get groceries as the small local groceries are closed on Sunday.) Donatella, the manager, was a great help via email prior to our stay - from where do we want the crib to arranging a motoscafi (water taxi) to pick us up at the train station and deposit us 4 feet from the front door. About 80 Euro for that, but well worth it if you are with a family and tired - plu you get such a wonderful first moments in Venice, down the Grand canal and then through a bunch of small canals. The front desk staff was very helpful and exceedingly friendly throughout the stay.

<Content>Only place in Venice that we've stayed that we would come back to! Just come back from a 2 night stay at the Corte Grimani for my husband's 60th birthday. It was everything I'd hoped for and more. Donatella thoughtfully provided us with a bottle of Prosecco on our arrival for my husband's birthday. As stated this was our 4th (but NOT last visit to Venice) my favourite city and this was the first place we've stayed that we would definitely both revisit.The appartment was clean, spacious and extremely comfortable. I think being on the top floor was the best place to be. We certainly did not notice any noise from any other rooms as I noticed another reviewer mentioned. Also as I do not usually cook when on city breaks not being able to use the kitchen caused us no problems at all!The access to the Internet was very useful and being able to check in and print our boarding passes off for our flight home was much appreciated. Specially when we saw the huge queue the next morning at the airport check-in and we walked straight to on-line bag drop.Just wanted to say thank you to Donatella (and the rest of the staff) for a terrific stay and for all your assistance and information. We will be back, though not in September it was too crowded for us!

<Content>Great Hotel and location with just one problem The Residence Corte Grimani is in a great location 5 minutes from Rialto and about 3 minutes from St Marks Square. The hotel is off the main street and is tricky to find on the first occasion. The hotel however has good directions on it's own website which got us there with little trouble. We got the Vaporetto from the bus station (no 1 or 2) and got off at Rialto. The hotel is also near to the San Marco, Valleresso stop. The room was extemely clean and modern with an excellent bathroom, bedroom and lounge area with kitchen. It does cost 50 Euros to unlock the kitchen if you want to use the cooking facilities or the washer/dryer. We did not bother, you can still use the fridge and microwave without charge. The fridge was stocked with a large bottle of water and a can of coke when we arrived for no charge and also some cookies. These were very welcome after a hot trip from the aiport. I found the large bed comfy and had no trouble getting to sleep on it. Each room has it's own airconditioning which worked very well. We did not find too many grocery stores in Venice that would make using the kitchen worthwhile. The nearest we did find was Supermarket Su Ve which is about a 10 to 15 minute walk in Castello at the end of Salizada San Lio (not to far from the Rialto Bridge). This was very useful for stocking up on bottled water and beer as it was very cheap (about a 5th of the price that you would pay eating out anywhere). The hotel itself does sell beer, wine and water at reasonable price. The staff at the hotel were all extremely helpful and friendly. They helped us with locations of restaurants etc. There is a internet machine in reception that guests can use for 15 minutes at a time, useful for online check-in and we could print our boarding passes at reception. The room had it's own (wired) internet that was free to use for which you need to get a username and password from reception. Now to my only negatives! My room was a Standard room booked through Expedia. Unfortunately this meant we had a room at the back of the hotel on the 2nd floor directly opposite another buiding (about 6 feet away). This meant we had no view and the room was very dark. I had all the lights on all the time. There are other rooms that overlook the canal at the front of the hotel but obviously they cost alot more. The one major drawback for me (and would have me thinking twice about staying here again) was the extremely poor sound proofing between floors. If anyone upstairs from us even walked across their room we could hear it clearly. You can also hear any conversations if they are even a little above normal volume, sneezing, light switches and especially when the room is being made up by the daily maid service. In our case this meant being able to tell exactly who was above us during our 5 night stay. 3 different sets of people who we could tell exactly when they arrived and left, what nationality they were (especially when they were having an argument) and if their children were unhappy or just enjoyed running up and down the large floorspace. If you are an early riser this may not bother you so much but I was woken up every day around 6.30/7am with no chance of getting back to sleep. So overall a lovely hotel, great location and facilities but beware if you want a bit of lie in. It could be worth paying extra for a room with a view and trying to get the 5th floor with no-one above you!

<Content>great place to stay but... We've just returned from 3 days at the Corte Grimani...I would have scored this excellent, but there is a 'but'. The apartment itself lived up to or exceeded our expectations - location was fantastic and the rooms very spacious, clean and comfortable. We would recommend booking a room with a view on the canal as this includes singing gondaleers for free! BUT there was a down side - we were surprised to find out on arrival that the price quoted to us as a 'special rate' was only applicable if we paid in cash - any payment by debit or credit card incurring an extra 300 euros (or as they exaplained the full price). This was not clear on the booking terms and caused us no end of hassle withdrawing 拢250 cash each day to cover the bill, leaving us unable to use our cards for other purchases (some may say this is a good thing while in Venice?!) Worth watching for if you book direct with the hotel!!

<Content>An oasis of calm! Just returned from 2 nights at the Corte Grimani. What a find! This is a fabulous place to stay. 2 minutes from St Marks Square but a calm oasis amidst the hustle and bustle. The room was fabulous, plenty of room for us and our 2 children aged 14 and 11. The staff were very helpful. I could not fault our stay.

<Content>Fantastic location, excellent value We picked this hotel based on the other reviews and were not disappointed. Fantastic location, only 5 mins walk from St Marks but in a very quiet cul de sac so no noise at night which was ideal. We had one of the smaller apartments which was just perfect - did not need the kitchen facilities but having a fridge and kettle was ideal for my early morning cup of tea. Lovely huge bed and tons of wardrobe space, far more than we needed. Great bathroom (with shower caps!) and I can see how this would be great for families as the facilities with dishwasher, clothers dryer etc are fantastic.We asked for recommendations for restaurants and both were excellent. We only did the breakfast on our last morning and it was pretty good value for the money. We should probably have done it more often as we found it surprisingly hard to get breakfast at a reasonable price locally (unlike France where every single cafe will do one). However a minor issue. We got the water taxi there and back and although expensive would definitely recommend this to guests as it is so much more convenient than waiting for the vaporetto and dragging your luggage across St Marks. We were on a very late evening flight and the hotel staff were more than happy for us to make full use of the lounge, watch TV etc after a long days shopping.Would defininitely stay here again.

<Content>A great choice. I reviewed the top hotels on Tripadvisor this spring and settled on the Corte Grimani....particularly since I was traveling with a family of 4. We booked one ot the cheaper rooms, since I knew we were not going to hang in the room.It was a great choice.... great location, great price (for Venice), helpful staff. We didn't use the kitchen (you pay to get it unlocked), but it was nice to have access to a refrigerator and microwave. We also didnt try their breakfasts... since I love Italian bars.

<Content>Another 5 Not much else to add here - stayed on a weekend late July with my teenagers. Location is perfect - Piazza San Marco was our beacon when we got lost. The rooms are even brighter and airier than their website suggests. Was a little expensive, but so was everything in Venice with the weak dollar. Excellent service, very clean, very friendly. They're doing everything right.

<Content>Truly Enjoyed the Residence Corte Grimani We decided to stay at this gem of a hotel after reading the wonderful reveiws on Trip Advisor, and it did not disappoint. Donatella, Guido, and the entire staff helped us with everything from restaurant reservations to tracking down lost luggage. We took a water taxi from the airport directly to the hotels doorstep. It was expensive, but well worth it, especially with luggage. Venice is not the easiest place to get around with luggage. The hotel is located right around the corner from St. Marks Square, away from all of the crowds and noise. It is tucked away on a charming little street that's easy to find once you have been there.We stayed in 2 apartments on the 4th floor that were both spacious and clean. We looked forward to returning to them each evening after a long day of sightseeing. We did not use the kitchen, but did order breakfast from the hotel on the last morning of our stay. It was both plentiful and well worth the cost of 12 euros per person.We will always remember our trip to Venice and the wonderful hospitality we received at the Residence Corte Grimani.

<Content>Made the holiday It was a real pleasure staying at this hotel for a number of reasons. 1) Comfort and decor were very good. 2) Location: very close to San Marco but relatively quiet / exclusive area - nice shops etc. 3) The suite was perfect for sharing with our two 8 year olds. 4) The staff were very helpful at all times. 5) Room service was reasonably priced. We opted for the breakfast (served in the room) on one day of our stay - it was excellent and more than ample (too much) - @12 euro a head we found it expensive ( because our children just wanted juice and bread) and we could find a good breakfast for at least half this price in local bars. It was our first trip to Venice and the experience was greater than our expectations, in part this was because we enjoyed this hotel as a family. We will certainly be recommending this accommodation to friends.

<Content>Superb Choice Don't hesitate to stay here - it's a lovely hotel, well deserving of its Trip Advisor awards. We stayed in 501 - 2 huge rooms, (I massive double bed, 2 double sofa beds) 2 bathrooms, kitchen and dining area. Beautifully decorated and quiet location; pretty views of canal. Very helpful front desk staff, helped with great restaurant recommendations and airport travel logistics. Ample breakfasts, plenty of variety, served in room (no restaurant in the hotel). Central - short walk from St Marks. Free 15 mins internet use via lobby pc - useful for flight check-in etc. Our teenager complained that the sofa bed matress was a bit hard! Great shopping nearby (above Armani) and numerous reastaurants in the vicinity.

<Content>Perfect July 10-16, 2008. A steal for Venezia; includes gondola traffic (Oye!!!), singers and musicians (on the boats) - just open your window. Top service; used the kitchen to save a small fortune on breakfast and supper, thus we could splurge on lunch. (Two people, three courses and a mezzo of vino is often well over 100 euros!) Learn to shop and stock the little fridge. Absolutely would stay here again.

<Content>fabulous with a baby I stayed here for six nights with my one year old and my mother. It was absolutely fantastic - central but quiet and you could watch the gondolas right outside the window floating down the canal. The hotel supplied a high chair and cot and it was very easy to cater due to the excellent kitchen facilities within the apartment. I slept in the lounge diner, my baby slept in a walk in wardrobe area and I let grandma have the main bedroom. There were two bathrooms. It was all spotless, loads of space and very tasteful with lovely wooden beamed ceilings. It is certainly a bargain considering the standard and location. You felt totally part of the action even whilst eating your breakfast, as you watched the gondolas float by. St Marks Square is less than five mins walk and the rialto about 7 mins. One recommendation if you are travelling with a baby - take a backpack type thing as carrying prams over all the bridges which have stairs cut into them and which are everywhere is not great for the back! The water taxi took us too and from the airport and went right to the front door - don't let them tell you the water is too high - they said that to us but then when they realised we had a baby they magically managed to get us right to the hotel by canal!

<Content>Fantastic Accommodation We followed the other rave reviews and booked 4 nights at Corte Grimani. Yes, it is absolutely wonderful. Huge spacious rooms and immaculately presented. Not glitzy. Very central location. Discretely positioned, we found it without difficulty by following their map. Adequate English spoken by reception staff. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Refined and comfortable with great location We stayed at the Corte Grimani for 4 nights at the end of a 17 day trip to Northern Italy. The stay there was just perfect in every way. It is a small and refined hotel with a private water taxi stop at the front door and 1 block from St. Mark's Square. The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful. We booked a corner suite with two bathrooms and a small kitchen/dining area overlooking the canal. We were really happy with it. The rooms were large and well appointed with classic contemporary furniture. I agree completely with all the other reviewers who liked this hotel. Most amazing was the room rate which we found to be very reasonable in Venice. Because the hotel is so close to St. Mark's Square, you can buy a day pass on the vaporetto (city public water taxi) and be anywhere in the Venice area for sightseeing locations in minutes. In addition, we felt like we had our own apartment in Venice and it felt great to come home to it every night we were in this beautiful city.

<Content>Great Stay We found the site through Fodors and/or Trip Advisor. Great Location. Quiet. Clean. Very good staff. The beds were firm (hip, hip, hooray). The a/c worked. We rented a place with a kitchen.  Under 5 minute walk to San Marco Square. The staff was always great about making resturant recommendations. We really have nothing bad to say. Venice can be tough to navigate when you are trying to find your hotel vs. the train station or however. We took a private water taxi to the hotel. More expensive, but it worked well for us. I would glady return and gladly stay at the same hotel. Oh, I found a negative - the lift was small. We took the stairs. It seems that all lifts (elevators) in Italy are small, not just here.

<Content>Great Hotel  We just finished an amazing 3 night stay at the Residence Corte Grimani. We loved this hotel for so many reasons. First, the owners are exceptionally pleasant, welcoming and helpful. Second, our two room apartment was large, very clean and well equiped. We paid extra to use the small kitchenette. Since we were traveling with two small children, this was very helpful. There was a small refrigerator, plates, cups and microwave. The bathroom was large, clean and equiped with a washer/dryer. Finally, Venice is very expensive. We paid 160 euros for me, my husband and our two children to eat a basic buffet breakfast at a near by restaurant. Yet, our three night stay here was only a total of 900 euros. This hotel is a bargain by Venice standards. This place has it all. Great location, great apartments with space for traveling families, great owners and great price. We will definitely return.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Spent three nights at the Corte Grimani and very impressed by the location, friendly service and excellent set-up. The room was like a mini apartment with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a small kitchenette. Definitely worth splashing out for rooms with a view over the canal. The space is large, very stylishly furnished, spotless and air conditioned. Don't forget to close the shutters at night - keeps out the early morning sunshine. Exactly what we wanted - no over-priced restaurant or gift shop, just a small and comfortable place with very friendly and helpful staff. Cannot recommend this more highly - and the location is fabulous. Literally 5 mins walk to St Mark's and very close to the Rialto. Take the map to find the exact location - or if you forget, as we did, just ask for directions.

<Content>Absolutely loved loved loved this place! It is a GEM of a find! Our family of 5 (my parents, 2 brothers and I) just returned from our Europe vacation where we spent 5days in Venice and our stay at the Residence Corte Grimani definitely contributed to making our stay in Venice a very memorable one. We're so glad we found this gem of a hotel thanks to tripadvisor!!!PROS: Location. Location. Location. Its very near Piazza San Marco but just around a small street corner so you're still away from the noise and the hustle and bustle. {TIP If you have a lot of luggage its easier to have a water taxi bring you directly here from the airport, its very convenient since they have a water dock right at their doorstep.}The room's lovely picturesque window with beautiful flowers on the ledge is overlooking the canal where you can watch the gondolas pass by and also has a great view of the Goldina Bridge that leads to the Piazza.They serve a generous and hearty breakfast right in the room which is very very convenient.Friendly, warm, helpful and welcoming staff especially Donatella.Travel and guide books on loan in the lobby.Free wired internet access in the room and internet station in the lobby.Well maintained/ Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Good water pressure. Bedroom slippers provided. Ample towels. Very comfortable bed in the master's suiteGreat airconditioning.Large rooms - comfortably spacious for 5 adults and 10 pieces of luggage. Sufficient closet  drawer space.Made use of the kitchen since there are delis and bakeries nearby so this was a nice addition.CONS: (a very minor one) but the sofa bed in the second room and sofa bed in the master's suite was not that comfortable and could be improved although it was not that bad

<Content>Fabulous stay My husband  I have just returned from an overseas trip that included 3 days in Venice at the Corte Grimani.We had an apartment which had loads of space.... comfortable bed.....super clean.....large telly  fantastic views overlooking a canal with Gondolas passing by , it was heaven.We had breakfast there the first morning which was basic but nice.We caught a waterbus from the main station to the hotel  got off at the Rialto stop. We did get a little lost walking to the hotel the 1st time but after that no problems, it's really easy to get around Venice.Make sure you do the walking / canal boat tour it's a great way to see the city if you only have a few days.The hotel staff all spoke excellent english  were very friendly  helpful.We chose this hotel because of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor  were certainly glad we did this place is just beautiful.We can't wait to come back to Venice  will definately stay at Corte Grimani again.

<Content>Nice place to stay Our stay at the Hotel was nice. It was difficult to find, but I did recognize the spot from a picture on the hotel website. The hotel staff was helpful and the room was large. There were four of us and we had a living room-kitchen with a fold out bed and a Bedroom. We decided not to pay the 50eu. to use the kitchen because we did not need to cook. We were able to use the refrigerator and the cups and spoons and made hot water in the electric pot. The canal was close by, you could see it out the window and we could hear the gondolars singing. There is a computer in the lobby that worked well for us.

<Content>perfect for our family As this was our family's first visit to Italy, we didn't know where to stay while there. After reading the reviews on Travel Advisor, we decided that Residence Corte Grimani would be a good deal for our family of 5. A word to the wise - please, please get a good map and good directions before you get to Venice. We walked over bridges and down streets for 2 hours before we actually found the Residence. It is kind of hidden in a corner, around a corner. Once we arrived it was a wonderful sight for sore eyes. The apartment was spacious and clean. It was perfect for my husband and I, and our 3 children. The washer/dryer was a lifesaver! The front desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly. It was also nice to have FREE internet access after having to pay in Rome and Florence. The apartment was very close to San Marco square but away from the crowds and noise. We felt it was a great deal for our money after paying much more for a hotel room with 2 beds and a cot and having to pay extra for my 13 year old, as she is considered an adult in Europe. We highly recommend the Residence. You will not be disappointed. One more thing- be prepared for the very tiny elevator. We had to send our luggage up and meet it!

<Content>Fantastic Apartment! I highly recommend Corte Grimani. What a fantastic and awesome apartment. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well. Our apartment had a great view of one of the small canals in Venice. It was located off a side street but was right in San Marco, in the midst of everything. The apartment itself was very new and modern and a housekeeper came daily to keep it in great shape. The lobby had internet access and someone on staff at all times. I would definitely stay here again when i come of Venice!

<Content>Residence Corte Grimani is Wonderful My husband and I just returned from a wonderful, several-day stay at the Residence Corte Grimani at the end of May into the beginning of June 2008. We have been to Venice several times before, staying at top hotels and without doubt the Corte Grimani is the best place to stay. Corte Grimani is in a wonderful, central location, and very conveniently can be reached by water taxi when you have heavy luggage (aboout 鈧?0). It provides apartments, rather than hotel rooms. We rented an apartment with a bedroom, living room, kitchen and two bathrooms, and our apartment was large, spacious and scrupulously clean. We had charming views of canals from both rooms. The value in comparison to a hotel room, particularly a top hotel room, is extraordinary. Corte Grimani is reasonably priced and you get fabulous space, daily maid service and superb service from the staff. They also provide, if you want, a very good breakfast for a small additional price that is well worth it.Every single person of the staff--from front desk reception to maids--is extraordinarily friendly and helpful. They all provide top notch service, including concierge service with wonderful restaurant recommendations. We were very impressed. They made sure that our celebration of 22 years of marriage was a lovely, romantic time. Corte Grimani is a true gem of a place to stay. Mille Grazie to them from us!

<Content>Great for families This is a great property for families. Lots of space.It is a little tricky to find, but is in a brilliant location very close to the Rialto bridge and St. Mark's Square. Get a good map (you will need it anyway!), follow the hotel directions, and you should be fine.We were a bit disappointed that the water taxi could not (or would not) get us directly to the hotel, but we understood once we saw the queue of gondolas in the canal!Our only complaints were with the additional charges for the kitchen use (50 euros if you want it opened at all) and for the breakfast. Also, there was air-conditioning, but it seemed pretty ineffective! The provided toiletries (shampoo, etc.) were barely sufficient and were supplemented by our own travel supplies.The down-sides are easily out-weighed by the positives of this property. Internet access was free in the room (not wireless - and you have to get the code every 24 hours). It was great to have the refrigerator in the room to store cold drinks, etc. Prices for water, soda, beer, wine, etc. were VERY reasonable (as cheap as we found in the shops). The guidebooks on loan in the lobby area were appreciated.The staff at reception were helpful, but did not go out of their way to be friendly.Overall, it was a great experience, and was much more cost effective than booking 2 separate rooms for 2 adults and 2 teens.

<Content>Donatello is fabulouso! We recommend this absolutely! We booked here having read the reviews on Tripadvisor, My husband, 2 daughters and I originally booked for 4 nights, but due to a train issue had to change to 3 nights. Franco and Donatella could not have been more helpful. I emailed them a couple of times about various things, they provided links to other websites to help with bookings, asked customers what they thought of a local show, organised a water taxi to meet us at the train station and were absolutely lovely in every way possible. We booked an apartment with a bedroom and living room, and the living room contained a comfortable fold out sofa bed. The bedroom was enormous - and very lovely with antique looking furniture throughout. The rooms were very clean, and manuals for the washer / dryer  dishwasher were on hand. Our apartment had 2 bathrooms, so there was plenty of room for us! We had a view over the canal and it was lovely watching the boats carrying mail, fruit  vegetables in the morning! In the afternoons the gondoliers went past singing, which was also very special!We were very close to Capo San Luca (5 mins) where we could pick up all kinds of groceries. We were also only 5 mins from St Marks Square. It was lovely to walk around Venice early in the morning, or in the evenings when the bus groups had gone. A great time of year to visit, and we will definitely return to these apartments.

<Content>Fanstastic for families This residence is in a perfect position in the heart of Venice. Our party of five included two teenagers and grandma. The superior appartment was perfect, two bathrooms, two separate rooms, a kitchen and lots of space! The view of the canal from the window was lovely. Very quiet, very clean, highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent and Enchanting This wonderful hotel added to our enjoyment of this beautiful city. Donatella and her brother Guido are charming and helpful, we felt very well cared for over our 3 night stay. The apartment was modern and yet the decor carried the character of the city. We could see a small canal out the windows, which had wooden shutters. We had a breakfast brought up to our room one morning and I regret not snapping a photo of the presentation before we dove into the variety of breads, yogurts, cheeses, fresh fruit, jams,etc., it was lovely. The bathroom was very large and well appointed, and we enjoyed the nice touch of complimentary slippers. I do not have one negative comment. Excellent on all counts.

<Content>Definitely a Hidden Gem! My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel back in December for a romantic weekend, actually he surprised me with the trip and booked this hotel because it was number one on Trip Advisor! It thoroughly desrves it's number one ranking (how can this be rated as a two star?? It should be four stars!), superb value for money, the location is second to none, right in the centre of Venice but hidden away in a quiet corner which admittedly was a bit too hidden away when we were trying to find it, even a local Venetian who took it upon himself to help us find it didn't know of it's existence!! Very close to St. Mark's square and not far from the Rialto bridge. The staff checked us in and showed us to our apartment very quickly. Throughout our stay they were all friendly and willing to help in any way in which they could. We were stuck for somewhere to have dinner on our last night and they recommended the excellent Bar Centrale which was very swish and sophisticated, sumptuous food, a low-key relaxed atmosphere and somewhere the well heeled in Venice frequent!The apartment itself was massive! The open plan kitchen living area felt spacious and had enough room for a large sofa and table and chairs without feeling crammed in. The entire apartment was spotlessly clean and neutrally decorated. The bathroom was huge with plenty of toiletries supplied, slippers and even a washing machine! Again the bedroom was large on scale with a king sized bed and plenty of wardrobe and drawer space with a view out onto the canal.We never got up in time for breakfast but I'm sure it was delicious, instead we went to one of the cafe's nearby and had hot chocolate and croissants!Just one thing to note, there is a particularly putrid smell at all time in reception from the nearby canals/ drains but once you get in the lift the air is somewhat sweeter smelling.I would definately go back so if you are thinking of booking, just do it!

<Content>Almost five stars This is a very good place to stay indeed. We had a two bedroom classic apartment on the second floor. It was absolutely spotless - and I mean spotless (not even a hint of mould, dust, stains or marks on anything) - it was in tip top condition and was very stylish - gold and cream everywhere. It felt like somewhere we should be paying twice the price to stay in. They provided lovely towels, bath gels, manicure sets and carpet slippers to pad about in. It cost us 140 euro per night as we had a cash deal. Our child stayed free.There are a few things that stop me giving this place five stars (and I'm probably being a bit picky here but I think it is useful for people to know these things): the smell of the canal wafting into the reception and also up the stairwells (that's probably why they had beautiful air fresheners in our room), the thinness of the walls (we could hear next door having a heated discussion and then the next night getting amorous at 1 am!) and the incidental things that they did/didn't do, like wanting to charge a supplement for setting the single bed up instead of the sofa bed that was set up for our son in the dining area, not having a tv in our bedroom despite the floor plan showing that we should have one and teatowels to dry the cups and saucers with (there was no charge to make hot drinks). I would suggest that if you have a child and want to watch tv in the evening ask if they can set the single bed up in the second bedroom before you arrive instead of the sofa bed at no extra cost. English speaking tv was limited to CNN - but they have so many nationalities to cater for I can't expect BBC everywhere I go!The staff were so friendly and helpful, the location was brilliant - we walked everywhere even with a 5 year old in tow. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel but if you are prepared to eat on the hoof at one of the many cafes or bars then you can breakfast much more cheaply. If you stand at the counter it's cheaper than sitting at a table. Try San Polo for eating and visiting - slightly cheaper than the central area, much less frenetic with less tourists and a more 'authentic' italian feel. You can walk it from the residence in about 20 mins via the Accademia bridge. Be careful of the trattoria Antica Capon in the Campo Sant Margarita! Very friendly front of house/head waiter and when we walked in they guided us to an outside table and then charged us 4.25 euros for a capuccino. We didn't get a receipt which you are supposed to get in Italy otherwise you/the owner can be fined. We'll know better next time. Nice little cafe opposite tho' on the bend in the same square who only charged us 1.60 euros for a cappuccino.We got the water bus from the airport to San Marco, cost 24 euro for both adults and it took over an hour. On the way back we walked from the hotel to Piazzale Roma and got the express bus to the airport. Took 30 mins to walk (really scenic too) and only 15 mins on the bus - cost us 6 euro in total.Despite the little niggles that stopped it being absolutely perfect, I would highly recommend the Corte Grimani as fantastic value for money.

<Content>Truly memorable Selected this hotel based on the previous Trip Advisor reports. It is hard to fault any aspect of our stay. We were 2 couples and had 2 of the larger apartments with views of the canal. Rooms were very spacious, exceptionally clean and the large beds very comfortable.Heating was responsive and toiletries of a good standard.We ate breakfast there on each of the 3 days - a good quality continental style buffet with good supply of fresh fruit.The reception staff were helpful.The hotel is very well located just a few minutes walk from St Mark's Square where you can board a waterbus to most areas.Barry Jones

<Content>Great Weekend in Venice We stayed at Grimani last weekend for 3 nights on a short break to Venice.Like most reviewers here, I booked this particular hotel because of its rating on Trip Advisor. I had contacted the Grimani in advance and been told that a water taxi from the airport was 100 euro, whilst the water bus was 12 euros each. I thought the water taxi was a bit pricey, so did not prebook. However, when we arrived in Venice on Thursday evening, we found that the water bus is hourly at that time of night, at ten past the hour. To avoid a 40 minute wait, we did take a water taxi from the airport at 90 euros. It was a lovely experience in itself, and much better than the bus. This dropped us at the Rialto Bridge, and we had a short walk to the hotel through the shopping area. The path to the hotel from the shops, almost looks like you are walking into the canal. If you are expecting that, its not difficult to find.Upon arrival at Grimani we were greeted by an Italian man who did not speak any English. Whilst I fully accept that I should be the one speaking Italian ! and can't, it was disorientating not to understand what he was saying.We had apartment 502 which has a brilliant view over the rooftops, to the tower in St Marks square. It was very quiet and peaceful, and spotlessly clean. There was no information regarding breakfast arrangements in the apartment, and as our host could not speak English, I am not certain whether this was available during our stay. We certainly didnt get up in time anyway !As previous reviews have said, the apartment had all the facilities you would expect, and a couple of wine glasses would have been a nice extra. Unfortunately I personnally found the beds and pillows uncomfortable, and did not sleep particularly well during the stay. I think it is worth mentioing that the apartment is excellent value for the money you pay, and the location is perfect. It is a good 3 to 4 star experience, and much better value that the luxury hotels.On the first evening we ate out at a small restaurant in the shopping area - Antique Carbonara I think. It was excellent. A seafood restaurant with lovely fresh fish, excellent service, and wonderful desserts. The following lunchtime we ate at da Fiore in the St Paolo area, which is recommended in all the guides. It is a bit of a trek, and dont get it mixed up with the one in St Maros area. I had tried to book in advance, but they required credit card details. Luckily it was not full on this Friday lunchtime. This was a great restaurant as well. There are 2 two seater tables beside the canal, and its worth asking for one of these if you're feeling particularly romantic.Over the next two days we ate at the Grand Canal restaurant in the Monaco hotel, and Canova in another 5 star hotel. It was pleasant enough, but I wouldnt necessarily return. Monaco was very touristy, and Canova was stuffy (in my view), although the service was very good. Our lunch at Canova was more expensive than we paid in the 7 star hotel in Dubai !Grimani were very helpful in making bookings for us. We saw Vivaldi played in period costume at Scuola Grande di San Teodoro, which is 5 minutes from the hotel, and worth the cultural experience. That can be booked on line with Classictic before you go, and they email you the tickets.We also visited a Jazz Bar close to the Rialto Bridge. We were very surprised to find the Jazz consisted of a DVD being played on a screen in the bar. When it finished, they played the same DVD again ! It was a pleasant enough evening, but was full of tourists. There seemed to be little choice if you were seeking evening entertainment in Venice. Overall a great weekend break in Venice, and a good experience at Grimani. Thank you

<Content>Fantastic! My husband, 2 daughters and mother in law stayed at Corte Grimani for two nights in Jan 08. We stayed at a wonderful, cozy apartment composed of a very large bedroom with a queen/king bed, and a pullout queen bed. The master bedroom was luxurious. The other room had another pullout queen bed and it's own bathroom, as well as a small kitchen with all amenities, a plasma TV and a dining area. We had quaint views of the canal. The room was sparkling clean and perfect for our group...lots of space. The customer service was A+. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel, and the buffet was very complete. There is also complimentary internet in the room (but not wireless). Besides its comfort, the best asset of this apt. hotel is is location. It is in a quiet corner, only 2-3 blocks from Piazza San Marco, close to all major attractions, restaurants and shops. We recommend taking a water taxi directly to the hotel entrance and also back to the airport if you're flying out of Marco Polo airport. Overall, it was a perfect experience....we would definitely stay there again when visiting Venice.

<Content>a great find I only heard about the Corte Grimani from Trip Advisor and read all the good reviews. I was not disappointed.The hotel was located perfectly in between San Marco (5 minutes walk) and the Rialto Bridge (10 mins walk). We arrived by water taxi from the airport which took us right to the door and were welcomed by friendly helpful staff. The room was large, clean and comfortable, with excellent facilities. There was a full kitchen (although the use of this was not included in the room rate) and a washing machine and dryer (for a small additional cost). There was also free internet access in the room.The only criticism we had was that the sofa bed in the living room had a fairly uncomfortable mattress and the breakfast and kitchen use were expensive. Otherwise a wonderful stay and we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in this fabulous city.

<Content>Amazing! I only heard about this hotel because this site. I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype and it did (for me at least.). If you are looking for a full service place with lots of amenities this is not the right hotel for you. The rooms are more like apartments. My room was huge and on the 5th floor with incredible views. My room was very affordable for a very expensive city. Going off season had it's advantages. The location is perfect. Close to San Marco and the Rialto but in a quiet pocket of the city. Donatella and Maurizio were the nicest people. I had long conversations with both of them. They made me feel right at home. I went by myself but this would be a great option for a family. There is a living room/kitchen area separate from the bedroom. The decor is spare but warm (which I like) and the room was spotless. I also liked the free internet access. Very nice touch. When I go back to Venice I will stay here again.

<Content>They do have internet After reading one of the previous reviews, I thought I'd add my 2 cents too: They do have in-room internet connection, and it is free also.They have internet cables in the living room (I forgot if they have itin the bedroom) inside the apartment, which was curled up and hung at one of the curtain hooks on the windows. You do have to go downstairs and get an access number every 24 hours in order to get online. It is free to use the service, and was very convenient. Of course you have to bring your own laptop though.We LOVED our stay. Our room looks over one of the small canals, and if you open the windows in the afternoon, you will hear the gondola singers singing right from downstairs when they pass by. We didn't expect that at all, and it was a beautiful and unforgettable experience. The location was perfect too. We were 5 minutes away from St. Mark's square, and we would go down there at night and listen to the orchestra performance. The only thing is it was a bit difficult to find for the first time, so be prepared for that.

<Content>Terrific Location You could not ask for a better location in Venice. A quiet location just 5 minute walk to the madness of San Marco and 10 minute walk to Rialto Bridge. We had a one bedroom suite with full kitchen (which we never used) and free internet. The suite was exceedingly clean and comfortable. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful and gave us great recommendations for restaurants.

<Content>Best Stay Through our Whole Honeymoon! I selected this hotel for our last days in Italy for our honeymoon based on the tripadvisor comments. We were so happy we did. The residence was great - our apartment was such a nice break from the tight hotel rooms we'd been in the whole trip. For less then we spent at luxury boutique hotels we had a place to stay that was AT LEAST 3 times larger. We stayed in the deluxe with canal view on the top floor. Exposed beams and views of a quiet canal AND the top of St. Mark's Square. It was breathtaking. The location was quiet but in a safe area just a 2 minute walk from St. Marks. It was impeccably clean, the owners very nice, and I can not recommend it enough!

<Content>Awesome place to stay in Venice The Corte Grimani was a wonderful place to stay in Venice. We stayed there three nights and it was great. Its a little difficult to find when you first arrive in Venice, but it is in a great location, about a minute or two walk from St. Marks Square. The rooms are like actual apartments, with a kitchen and living area, a bathroom, and a bedroom. The apartments are very clean and nice. The staff is very kind and helpful and will answers any questions you have about Venice. They have a breakfast that cost 10 euro a person, but its not that great, they don't offer you that much. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay and the next time I go back to Venice, I will definitely stay there!

<Content>Best location in Venice We just returned from our stay in Venice. We ended a cruise there and decided to extend our stay four nights. We based our reservation at Residence Corte Grimani on tripadvisor reviews. The value for the price of Euro 280 in the heart of San Marco sestiere is incredible. The room was so spacious and clean that we couldn't have asked for more. We rented a superior room, more space than two people would ever need, but felt that after two weeks of traveling (business and personal) that we could use some extra space. The staff, to a person, are friendly and seem to know everything. Their recomendation of the water taxi service saved us quite a bit of money, and when the taxi company didn't want to pick us up the day we were leaving because of the high tides, they observed that other taxis were getting by (the potential problem is that the high water makes it difficult to get under the bridges in the smaller canals) and called the service to insist that we would be picked up at the hotel. Indeed we were, and exactly on time. We didn't end up using the kitchen. Although Venice is extremely expensive, there are ways to eat out. Split a pizza and have a half bottle of wine for lunch at a cafe (for a couple), or pick up panini at a local tratoria. The hotel sells Coke for a mere E 1.50; it can run you E 4-8 in a restaurant! Dinner is another matter. It is hard for a couple to get away less than E 60 - 70 even if you have a 1/2 bottle of wine. Between the coperto (cover charge), the servicia (included 12% service), a salad, entree, and a cappucino it adds up quick. I can see where a family would definately need the kitchen. We were baffled by the washer/dryer combo. We finally did get one load complete, and that really saved us. We are not usually confused by small appliances at home; even with several degrees between us it seems we still lack the necessary skills to operate Italian appliances. The rooms themselves are sparely, but beautifully decorated. The location is perfection itself. We know friends who have spent much more for much less in Venice. Residence Corte Grimani deserves it's stellar reputation. We did have a view in room 201 and loved listening to the gondoliers in the afternnoon if we were taking a break from sight seeing. Venizia e bella!

<Content>In agreement with the other reviewers: an excellent choice We chose this place based on the reviews on this website and on the whole we were not disappointed. We stayed for three nights at 270 Euros a night for a mini-apartment (for a family with teenage daughters). Some of the rooms had views overlooking the front of the hotel or the canal that runs alongside it, but, alas, ours did not. Pluses: (1) Very clean and welcoming, (2) very knowledgeable staff: Donatella , Franca and Guido were able to help us with finding grocery stores and restaurants. Franca was good enough to try and get us tickets to the 鈥淒oge鈥檚 Palace Secrets Tour鈥?but they were fully booked. Consummate hospitality professionals, all three of them. (3) Located 2 minutes from St Mark鈥檚 Square, and right close by all the high end shops. (4) They allowed us to check in at 12 noon, but we called them the night before telling them when we would be arriving and they said our room would be ready (what other hotel lets you check in so early?). (5) 鈥渉onour-system鈥?library in the lobby, where they have several books about Venice that you can help yourself to, so long as you return it when you鈥檙e done.Minuses: (1) our room had no view, I suppose this is luck of the draw depending on what room they give you and what kind of room you book. (2) They add a 50 Euro extra charge to 鈥渙pen the kitchen鈥? i.e. unlock the cupboard where all the pots, pans, cutlery, etc. The charge, they say, is for the clean up of the kitchen after you leave. At this rate, you would think they could provide a little washing up soap, dishwasher soap, and maybe a little salt/pepper shaker. But all in all, if you are staying two or more days, having a kitchen is handy for a few meals, and the 50 euros pays for itself on the VERY HIGH cost of meals in Venice (1 lunch for family of 4). (On subject of food preparation, check out the Rialto market (walk back to Rialto bridge, cross over, and it鈥檚 off to the right, dozens of stalls selling fresh fish every morning, + great fruit and veg, etc.).

<Content>Absolutely loved it Add me as another very satisfied customer.We stayed in an Apartment Classic on the 2nd floor, with no view. Room was spacious, clean, and exactly as advertised on the web site.Our hostesses Donatella and Franca were so friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Donatella in particularly seems like a walking encyclopedia of knowledge about Venice. If there is anything you need, leave your request with the two of them, and you can definitely rest assured that everything will be taken care of promptly and well.The location is great - literally steps away from San Marco's. Ferries are within a two to three minute walk.All this for the price of 200 Euros per night, which for Venice surely must represent fantastic value.Heartily recommended.

<Content>Our second visit to Corte Grimani but I hope not our last This was our second visit to Residence Corte Grimani, the welcome we received could not have been warmer and it felt as though we were returning to our Venetian home. This time we took a friend with us and he is convinced that there can be no better hotel in the whole of Venice. He says that he wants to visit Venice again soon and would not consider staying anywhere else. Donatella and Franca are always ready to offer help and advice and Guido's breakfasts are a satisfying start to a day's sightseeing. When one considers that the hotel is in the heart of Venice, a major tourist city, the value for money is tremendous, the accommodation in the smallest apartment is spacious, quiet and impeccably clean and, as I have said above, everyone is very pleasant and very helpful.Any visitor using British Airways flights (I cannot speak for any other carriers) can use the computer terminal in reception to Check In 24 hours before your flight which saves a lot of time when you get to the airport.I would by very happy to recommend Residence Corte Grimani to anyone thinking of visiting La Serenissima.David Holland, Bedford, UK

<Content>Spacious clean apartment in great spot! This hotel is truly a hidden gem. This hotel has only been open a few years and once people start finding out about it, the price is surely going to skyrocket. The location is ideal... just a minute walk to Piazza San Marco. We were in room 502 - it was a one bedroom suite on the top floor. We opened the windows and heard the gondoliers singing in the canal right below us. It was wonderful. The rooms were tastefully decorated (nothing like the typical Venetian style). We had a full kitchen/ living room, a small mudroom, a beautiful clean bathroom and a spacious bedroom. The breakfast was fine... cereal, yogurt, cheeses, fruit, and a fresh croissant. Not sure if it was worth 10 Euros but we ate there anyway. Just one word of caution... Check out between the hours of 8:30 and 4:30. We had to check out at 7:30 am and the man didn't speak english. He wanted us to wait until 8:30 and got mad when we made the gesture of leaving. He reluctantly took our credit card number and everything turned out fine.

<Content>Perfection in Venice We spent 2 perfect weeks at the Residence Corte Grimani in September. Our apartment was spacious, bright, and spotless, with wonderful views over the rooftops to the domes and the campanile of the Basilica San Marco. The neighborhood was convenient and pleasant, lively during the day, quiet at night. In all of Venice, there can be no better hosts than Donatella, Guido, and Franca, all of whom made us feel completely at home throughout our stay, as did Cristina in the breakfast room. Because it is usually best, as well as a courtesy, to reserve for dinner at Italian restaurants, the telephone with free local calls was helpful. Many reviews mention how great this hotel is for families, but we also recommend it to couples who would enjoy a quiet, comfortable, attractive home-away-from-home. We could live there.

<Content>Perfect location This is a great little hotel in the most romantic spot right on the canal. Yes, difficult to find on first arriving, but that's the only thing I'd say to watch out for. The location was perfect, right in the centre of things but not so close that noise is a problem. The room was lovely and so were the staff. I think this is great value for money.

<Content>Great place, families or not This is one of the finest vacation hotels I have ever visited -- and I'm 62. What makes it so special is the attention of the staff. They will help you with any question. The rooms are good and, most important for those with families, large. As far as I could tell, all were two room suites. We were traveling with a small child, and the in-room washing machine turned out to be essential.Given what the hotel is providing, the location is really a plus, maybe 200 yards from St Mark's square.

<Content>Wonderful hotel The Corte Grimani Residence was perfect for us. We are a family of 4. Our children, both boys, were 16 and 18 (6ft, 190lbs each). I booked the regular sized room with a view to save money and was worried that perhaps I had made a mistake. No problem at the Corte Grimani. The boys both slept on the pull out couch, which we left out all of the time, and we still had enough space to play cards at the table in that room. Both rooms were very large as was the bathroom. We did not use the laundry or stove. The fridge came in handy for snacks and drinks. The hotel is newly remodeled, clean, cool and spacious. The owners could not be nicer and breakfast was worth every Euro. We would definately stay here again. Two things to note once again, as others have mentioned: Be very careful in following the map to this hotel when arriving in Venice. It is a little tricky in that the hotel is right on a canal and you turn right on a little sidewalk by a canal bridge. No problem after you have found it once. The second thing is remember to shut your rooms stutters at night or you will be up with the dawn. You need to open the windows and unlatch them from the side of the building. Enjoy Venice it was my favorite big city in Italy. There is nothing else like it in the world!

<Content>Worth the money My fiancee and I went on our honeymoon to Europe this past summer. Without a doubt, the Hotel Grimani was the best hotel we stayed in. I used tripadvisor to make my selection and the hotel had a cash deal on. For 160 Euro a night, it was well worth it. The washer/dryer was fabulous, although tiny. Each room in the apartment had its on a/c. TV could have been bigger but it was ok. Free internet in the lobby. Even the decor of the room was excellent. The front desk was pleasant and for some reason, you could always find your way back to the hotel no matter how lost we were. I would recommend it for a honeymoon or for a family. As all the other people on this site have stated and voted, this is the top hotel in Venice.

<Content>Perfect place to stay with family! A perfectly planned holiday can be ruined if the hotel one stays at is not ideal. Don't worry about this at the Grimani. My three year old daughter, wife and I stayed there for four days and had a wonderful stay. My brother is scheduled to stay there because of our recommendation. It is the ideal place to stay if you are traveling with children. we stayed at the standard apartment: very quiet, spotlessly clean and wonderful service. Can't wait to return!

<Content>All reviews are accurate!! This is a truly fantastic hotel, clean and very central. We stayed for 4 nights in one of the best apartments with our 2 children aged 9 and 7. We had a fantastic view of the canal and best of all we were only 1 minute walk from St. Mark's Square. Thank you Residence Corte Grimani for making our stay memorable.

<Content>Wonderful place My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights during our honeymoon. It's a fantastic centrally located hotel. It is clean and spacious and unbeatable for the price. We were given great service and free Proseca sparkling wine. The only negative was that we had no view of any canal, just an 10 inch wide ally with construction rafters. Still we spent little daylight hours in the room and we were very pleased with the value of a hotel this nice. Word of warning: it's not easy to find the Grimani if your carting around a bunch of luggage, so take a Water Taxi upon on your arrival to Venice so as not to stress yourself to tears.

<Content>Echoing the other reviews My family and I (2 adults and 3 children) just returned from a 3 night stay at the property in a Superior Apartment. A terrific property with an absolutely terrific staff. They helped with restaurants, sightseeing tips. And even before we arrived, helped with securing a water taxi reservation, local guides, and tips on prebooking tickets to certain sights.All the previous reviews have captured the pros of the place...it's just worth mentioning again though that the staff makes you feel like family...when we left, we felt like we were leaving a friend's house...nothing like checking out at the front desk of a hotel chain.

<Content>Gem in the middle of Venice We found Corte Grimani through travel advisor, and it was indeed as good as described in the other reviews here. Very nice rooms, friendly staff, very convenient location in the heart of Venice. We were traveling with two kids and the place was definiely family friendly. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Deserves its #1 Status We recently stayed for 3 nights with our 2 children ages 7 and 5. What the reviews here say is very accurate. The hotel is in a prime location, just off St. Marks Square - close enought to be extremely convenient and yet far enough to be away from the bustle. The fact that you look out on some small scenic canals helps, as does the building enterance - down its own little walkway. The boat landing also adds to the convenience (we came and went by water taxi - expensive but well worth it if you have a lot of luggage) The folks that run the hotel could not have been nicer and more welcoming to us - and were great for suggestions. All in all a wonderful stay in a clean and very pleasant hotel.

<Content>Amazing location - but best for stay of a week or more or families The location of the Corte Grimani could not be better - literally one minute from St. Mark's Square and a few minutes from the Rialto Bridge. It could not be more central and yet is just enough off the main route that you avoid noisy crowds - perfect.The apartments are very clean and modern and the service is excellent. Breakfast is available if you want it and reception will help you with maps etc. The photos on this website accurately show what the place is like.There is an extra charge for using the kitchen (50 euros). This is worth it if you are staying for a longer time or for families who cannot afford to eat out. There is also a washer/drier which is handy for longer stays.Our only gripe was that the room was very dark with another building only a few feet opposite our window. This is Venice and this is to be expected but don't be fooled by the photos that seem to show bright rooms with a nice view - these cost more.

<Content>A very fine spot Our family of three stayed two nights at the Corte Grimani and found it to be excellent. Very good location a short walk from St. Marks but quiet enough to be pleasant. We had an excellent two-room apartment on the 5th floor with a bit of a view. Very clean, comfortable, with a kitchen -- we used the refrigerator and microwave for no charge but were told there would be a substantial charge for real cooking in the room. The free computer in the lobby with internet access was nice, as was the lending library of Venice guidebooks and other local books in the lobby. The staff at the front desk were also excellent, very friendly and helpful. They made our short stay very enjoyable. We have no hesitation recommending the Corte Grimani and we thank TripAdvisor for helping us find it.

<Content>Great place to stay This is a great find. It has all the comforts you need, together with a great and convenient location.The room that we stayed in was huge and clean. There is a gondola station just down the street and just a bit further is San Marco Square!We didn't try the breakfast that the hotel offered because there are tons of places to get something on the go throughout the streets.We had a 6mnth old and a 16yr old with us and all the conveniences helped out with both of them.The price was right as well, and as we wlaked around the city and saw some of our other choices, we were glad that our final choice was this one.

<Content>Great Value in Venice Our family of 7 stayed in two rooms at the Residence Corte Grimani and agree with almost all of the positive comments made. Great location, big rooms, awesome canal view, great staff, great breakfast, etc.Our one negative relates to the sofa beds, which are a key component of these large rooms' ability to house a large family. We stayed in 5 different hotels during our recent European vacation and, of the 5 hotels, our kids said that the sofabeds at Corte Grimani were the least comfortable sofabeds that they slept on. They could feel the mattress springs poking them, and no cover blanket was provided for the bed -- just a single sheet. As the hotel clearly cares about details, we hope that gradually replacing the sofabeds, or somehow improving them will become a priority for them.We still rate this hotel a 5.

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful! I'm writing this review sitting in room 403 at the Residence Corte Grimani (yes, they have Internet access at no charge). I couldn't wait till the trip was over to post this, as the Hotel is wonderful. The only challenge for those not familiar with Venice is finding it, but that's Venice as we've discovered. My family of 4 is more than comfortable in the large room...actually a living area with a double bed, stove, fridge and washer/dryer and a bedroom. Plenty of room, teriffic location, just a short walk to the Piazza de San Marco and a staff that will help with just about any need you have from hotel questions (how does the washer/dryer work) to questions about where to go, what to do and how to book it. The breakfast offered is very acceptable and at 10 Euros per person a fine value. The only negative thing I could say is that all these great reviews will make it harder to book this wonderful hotel.

<Content>Steps to St Marks Square and simply lovely! Thank you Trip Advisor...without the reviews on this site, we never would have found this lovely hotel. I booked it because I had never read so many raves about the hotel, and now we would like to add ours. Our family, a group of 5 adults, stayed in two rooms; one on the canal and one not. Both rooms were very spacious and the furnishings and fixtures were top-notch. The canal room was great people-watching and we especially enjoyed the gondoliers singing as they paddled by our room--talk about ambiance! The room not on the canal had just a view of the next building but was very quiet which we enjoyed after returning from a long day of walking around. Either way the location can't be beat!During our stay, we used the kitchen and the washing machine; this was a special treat during our two-week 5 city trip, however the washing machine was very difficult for us to figure out how to use and we definitely recommend getting assistance with it if you are unfamiliar with european washing machines (it was a wash and dry all in one but took about 4 hours per load). Someone was always at the front desk to help us, and they assisted us with arranging for an early morning water taxi to the train station. BTW, knowing the name of the small canal that the hotel is on or having the map they provide to you when you arrive is invaluable when arranging for a water taxi.The staff was always friendly and very helpful. The only negative was they recommended a nearby restaurant to us, Acqua Pazzo, that was terribly unfriendly and we did not enjoy the food or the 25 euro cover charge for sitting outside. We told them the next day and hope that they take this restaurant off their list of referrals.

<Content>Terrific value at Residence Corte Grimani I'm happy to add to the list of highly deserved plaudits for this well-run hotel. Friendly, clean, spacious, helpful, good value, good location. We especially liked the location--tucked away but mere steps from both the Grand Canal and St. Mark's. Also, they were great at getting us a water taxi for our early morning trip to the airport--4:45 a.m! Mostly, however, we were impressed by the evident fact that these are genuinely kind and decent people--they're not just putting on a show for guests. We had 3 young children with us and they made us feel more than welcome.

<Content>Still dreaming of returning to this Gorgeous Hotel!! It has been nine months since we stayed (four nights) at the fabulous Residence Corte Grimani . . . I haven't yet got back there myself, but next week I have two seperate parties staying there because I told them that if they were in Venice, they couldn't possibly stay anywhere else!!The location is superb, central to both St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. We arrived in Venice by train and caught the Vaparetto to the nearest stop at St Marks Square as advised on the hotel's website. I was travelling with my husband and 9  6 year old children, and following the instructions from the website, it was an easy walk, wheeling our luggage, to the hotel - there was only one small bridge we had to cross just before the hotel. It was the same when we left, but if anything, the Vaparetto station to the airport was slightly closer.Our room was superb, we paid an extra 20 Euro to have the extra single room for my daughter. It just meant that the kids had seperate beds and didn't disturb each other (my son slept in the fold out sofa) - the kids thought it was great too, as they had to share beds in most of our other hotels.By the time we reached Venice we had been travelling for over two weeks and the very modern washer/dryer combo, was a very welcome sight. We still had several weeks travelling ahead of us, and didn't know when we'd get another opportunity to wash. Once we'd figured out the instructions, we set it up and left it to go an enjoy the sights of Venice and then came back to freshly washed and dried laundry.Donatella, Franca and Guido were wonderful, caring and very helpful hosts and made us all feel extremely welcome. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a Christmas e-mail from them and have recently been corresponding with them to help with my friend's accommodation.We had every intention of using the wonderful kitchen facilities, but we got too busy enjoying the local cuisine. We ended up having breakfast at the hotel too, after the first morning (we were supposed to go out and get breakfast suplies that day at the lcoal supermarket!!) we just fell into the habit of dining with Guido!!Anyone travelling to Venice MUST stay here, I'd been to Venice before and had not seen better. My girlfriend who lives in Friuli (just an hour north) came and spent the day with us, as she does with all her international friends who stop in Venice. Because of this, she has seen a lot of the local accommodation and could not believe the standard of this hotel!!!!Sorry this is so long, I've been meaning to add my review since we got back . . . . . ENJOY!

<Content>Great stay at the Grimani We decided to stay at the Corte Grimani after glowing 5-star reviews from TripAdvisor. The Corte Grimani is indeed, worth the 5-star rating. Upon our check-in at the hotel, we got a nice map, along with some restaurant recommendations. Our room was very nice and clean as well. We had enough room to stretch out! Breakfast was also delicious, with a fruit salad, some hot chocolate, and other breakfast items. We also got very friendly and helpful service from the staff during our stay. We even talked with the staff very casually too!

<Content>IT WAS FABULOUS! We agree with all the other comments, we booked because of the reviews on tripadvisor and they were so right. Yes it is a little more expensive than some but you get an apartment and after walking all day exploring it was great to come back to an apartment where you could sit on the lounge and have a cup of tea and watch CNN (only thing in english). The staff were fabulous and spoke very good english particularly when I got sick with a migraine and my partner needed someone to get me a doctor and then we had to stay an extra night and so we had to change plane tickets etc and the front reception staff were fabulous and ended up interpreting for us and it all sorted itself out. We highly recommend this place and it is in a perfect location too. My advice is bite the bullet and get a water taxi 100E straight to the door from the airport as after a long flight it is worth it but beware they dont always know the address so make sure you have ti with you and dont let them drop you off at St Marks square as then you have to walk, just insist on being taken to the door.

<Content>Yes, it really is that great! This place is pefection and it truly deserves to be number one on the tripadviser website. I booked this place largely because of the tripadviser reviews and it came through in every way. The staff are wonderful. The rooms are large enough for 4 persons. The bathrooms are polished white and large. It is beautifully located with St. Mark's about 3-4 short blocks away. All their restaurant recommendations were spot on. It is an easy 10 minute walk from the Rialto vaporetto station if you have a small suitcase on wheels. There is a fridge, a safe, and good air conditioning. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>A True Venice Gem My family of four just returned from a trip that included three nights in Venice at the fabulous Residence Corte Grimani. We booked the hotel because of the reviews on this site and I'm thrilled to say that everyone was right. When we arrived, having told the hotel that we would be there early after an all night flight, our apartment was ready. Spotlessly clean, it featured a bedroom with a comfortable double bed and a living room with a comfortable double pullout sofa, which was great for our family of four (and very difficult to find anywhere in Europe). We had room to walk around and two well appointed clean bathrooms. Although we did not use it, there was also a kitchen with a dishwasher and a washing machine.The front desk staff were all knowledgeable about the city and were all extremely friendly. The breakfast was lovely every morning and was always served with a smile. The hotel is convenient to Piazza San Marco and our water taxi was able to pull directly up to the door, making luggage transfer easy.I can not say enough about this wonderful hotel and can't wait to return to Venice so that we can stay there again.

<Content>Pricey but worth it... We stayed at the Grimani for 3 nights, in late-May.My wife, our 19-year old daughter, and I thought it was great.All the front desk staff speak English, and are very helpful with any request you make of them, whether it pertains to the hotel, or anything at all in Venice.We have travelled a fair bit, including a lot of business travel on my part, and this is easily the most expensive hotel I have ever paid for myself. We paid 310 Euros per night, which was about $500 CAN, at the time. We've stayed in more expensive rooms, but using points, or getting some special deal. Having said that, it was still reasonable value, as the suite was great, and the location is about as good as you can get, as a tourist. What we liked:- Huge suite, with two bathrooms, and tons of closet space. We had the largest apartment size.- Location. Doesn't get much better. Central to everything.- Staff. Great!- Free Internet in lobby. Our daughter loved that.- Toiletries, slippers with the hotel name on them, even though there are only 15 apartments in the whole hotel.- Washing machine in the suite.- View. We were on the top floor. Don't misunderstand, there is not really a view of anything breath-taking, but you overlook a small canal and a couple of bridges, so it's quaint.- Super air conditioning. Thermostats and ventilation units in each room. Super effective.Nit Picking:- Didn't know about the shutters outside the windows until after I got home and read about them on the internet. No blinds on the inside of the windows, so it was a bit bright in the morning.- The charge to use dishes, etc. is a little steep, but not a big deal. They let you use glasses, the fridge, microwave and washing machine without extra charge.- Washing machine was a bit of a conundrum, even with the user manual, with instructions in English.The hotel was one of the highlights of Venice which, overall, was our least favorite stop in Italy.

<Content>Best place to stay in Venice Thanks to the wonderful reviews on this site, we booked the Residence Corte Grimani the last couple of nights in May. What a great place to stay. The apartment was so clean and nicely decorated. (there was even a washing machine in the apartment)The staff was very helpful and the location could not be beat! The Gondola's were steps away, and it was beautiful to hear the singing throughout the day and early evening. St. Marks square was only a block away. We were in walking distance to all the major attractions. The hotel even arranged for a private taxi to take us to Murano, and from there we took the ferries to Burano and Torcello. Just Beautiful! The breakfast is worth the 10 Euro's, and the restaurant recommendations were great! Thanks for all the other reviews, I would never have known about the Residence Corte Grimani if it weren't for this site, and it truly is the perfect place to stay in Venice.

<Content>The Best in Venice This was one of be best hotel experience we have had in our years of travel. The room was spectacular -- immaculate, large, light and well-furnished. The folks who run this hotel are very special, helpful, cheerful and nice. They gave us many recommendations, all of which were great. Without question, I would stay at this hotel again in a minute.

<Content>Absolutely perfect jewell! Excellent little hotel in superb central location. At twice the price, it would still be a jewel. I've traveled in UK  Europe for years and one becomes accustomed to tiny rooms, dated plumbing  often less than scrupulous housekeeping, even in much more costly accomodations, but this is NOT the case at Corte Grimani. They excel in all aspects. I booked thru their website directly and found them to be wonderfully accommodating in all respects.

<Content>Great Place Three of us (myself, wife and 8 yr old son) stayed for three nights the first week in May. This great apart hotel was everything the other good reviews said. Ideally located less than 100 metres from St Marks Square yet quiet and in a relatively private spot. % m inutes walk back to St Marks in the evning when most of the crowds of day trip[pers have gone home.We found Corte Grimani easily enough arriving in the dark at 11.00 at night from Rialto. But pick the wrong alleyway and it is very easy to go round in circles. The staff were all delightful, always around to help, yet unobtrusive. Breakfast at 10 euros each was fine - few other options outside particularly with children. The apartment itself was brilliant, we had the basic option but had two very large rooms, one bathroom and one dressing room. Great value for money, free internet access in the lobby and free umbrellas on our very wet first day!

<Content>Perfect for our family!!!! A huge thanks to the reveiwers on Trip Advisor for recommending this wonderful hotel. We stayed for 4 nights in early April in the large family suite on the 1st floor. It sleeps six but was incredibly spacious for our family of four. My husband is still talking about the comfort of the beds (including the queen sofa bed the chiildren used). In addition to the comfort of the room we were delighted with how quiet and dark the rooms remained in the early a.m. due to the metal shutters on the windows. We had requested a room with a view (when we booked directly with the hotel 8 months in advance) and had a fantastic one! The washing machine was an unexpected surprise. We used the PC in the lobby with free internet access quite frequently. The staff could not have been more helpful while we were there and prior to our visit! Email communication with the hotel prior to arriving was answered promptly and was very helpful.Location is perfect but far enough away from the crowds.This is a GREAT hotel! We strongly recommend it!

<Content>Just as good as everyone says We've just arrived back from a 4 night stay at the Corte Grimani, booked largely because of the raft of favourable reviews on Trip Advisor. I can report they were all correct!We took a standard room, minus the canal view (although we could see it out of the window if we leant out). We got an immaculately clean and beautifully decorated suite, with space and comfort to spare. The bed was huge and very comfortable. I absolutely cannot fault the room - they even provided a bottle of water in the fridge, which is a nice thought. We also took breakfast at the hotel, which was standard Italian fare of meat, cheese, cereals etc, but with fresh hot brioche and excellent coffee as well. I thought it was good value and excellent standard for the 10 Euro charge, particularly bearing in mind some of the prices elsewhere in the city. (e.g. the wholly risible Florian - 13.2 Euros/拢9 for a cappuccino if they are forcing dodgy jazz down your throat. There are very nice cafes in lovely locations in the city where you could have 5 coffees for the same price. Absurd, avoid, and with a bit of luck they will go out of business).The Grimani's location is simply unbeatable, being about 3 minutes from San Marco and 10 minutes at most from the Rialto. Being tucked away on a side canal though, it is blissfully quiet at night, and during the day the only noise you normally hear is the regular oy, oy from passing gondoliers. And the occasional burst of O Sole Mio from the singing variety ...And a word for the staff, who were unfailingly polite and helpful, ever willing to assist and make our lives easier. The major hotel chains really should take note of this kind of service.Venice, of course, was majestic. As soon as you are off the day-trippers slog between rip-off St Marks and the Rialto, which is unspeakably awful during the day, it is just wonderful. If in doubt, dip down a side alley - any one will do - and walk. You will find a peaceful and remarkably normal place that presents something fascinating at every turn. Don't miss the Dosoduro or Canareggio, which are noticeably different in feel to the San Marco districts.We also took a trip out to Burano, which was both visually stunning and very charming.And finally, when we return to Venice, we will very definitely be staying at the Grimani. The price is good, the location superb, the service excellent, the standards high. The hotel and its owners and staff thoroughly deserve their high rating.

<Content>It really is the best!! Thanks Trip Advisor! Thanks to fellow Trip Advisor travelers' reviews, we booked the Corte Grimani for three nights in late October. We were a party of three adults and four children. We had a spacious, immaculate apartment right on the canal. The staff is fantastic and had great recommendations for restaurants. I cannot say enough about the location. Right in between the Rialto area and St. Mark's Square. This was our children's favorite trip ever! The gondoliers passed right by our windows (all four of them!) facing the canal and we enjoyed their serenades without paying a ton of money for a gondola ride. A wonderful Venice experience that we will remember forever!

<Content>fab We booked this hotel after reading such positive comments from this site and we were not at all disappointed. We stayed here for 4 nights and on arrival we were upgraded to a larger room. The room was fantastic, large, clean, very comfortable, lots of hanging space in the wardrobes, 2 bathrooms! We took breakfast which provided cereal, fruit, yoghurts, croissants, bread, cheeses and cold meats - set us up for the day nicely.Location of the hotel was excellent - we could watch the gondolas go by from our room, although we did have some problems finding it initially as it's nicely tucked away from the main thoroughfare but still close to St Marks/Rialto. We really enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend this hotel to anyone - lovely hotel and good value for money.

<Author>ItalyAnnivTrip
<Content>Nice, comfortable stay and nice staff! After reading reviews, we found that this was a favorite with customer satisfaction and cancelled our more expensive hotel due to the customer feedback. It is very confusing to get here:After taking the #1 stop on the vaporetti, go straight, turn right at your first opportunity and then left at your first opportunity. Go straight through courtyard continuing until you reach Timerland store. Then turn left (there was scaffolding there, but yes, that's the turn) and you will see a green awning ahead for Bon Vecchia, a new also good hotel with a great piano bar at night. Once you hit Bon Vecchia, Gucci is across the street, you can follow the hotel directions. When you see the bridge, there are stairs to the right of the bridge, go up a few steps off to the right around the bank and then you see it directly in front of you. I'm doing these from memory..you might want to check our BonVecchia's website for directions to their place and know that Corte Grimani is around the corner. I expected this to be more like some kind of efficiency since it was listed as an apartment, but we had maid service and the hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful!!! We paid 180 euros per night for two and they gave us a free upgrade! I was expecting very pared down efficiencies, but this is an old building that has been redone in the last couple of years and it was quite modern and nice. I had trouble finding the tiny washer and Donatella ran up to my room to help explain it quickly! They gave us good recommendations for dinners: Hotel Madonna and others.This is in a great location near San Marcos square and close to everything. Breakfast is an additional 10 euros per person so we opted out of breakfast. We enjoyed our time there and thought it was a great place! The lobby is quite small, but we were in Venice to see the city itself so it was fine with us! Also, we were celebrating an anniversary and they left chocolates and champagne in our room for the occassion!

<Content>A True Gem! Clean, modern apartment with brand new bathroom and kitchen. We stayed here first on our Venice, Florence, Rome itinerary. I told my family this would be the best, though least expensive, hotel of our trip. Though we did well in the other cities, this turned out to be true. The owners could not have been nicer. We enjoyed their dinner suggestion (Acqua Pazza). The key to Corte Grimani, however, is the location, convenient to both St. Marks and the Rialto Bridge. Back home for two weeks now, we're still amazed we found this caliber of hotel in this location for such a good price (E180/night for party of five.)

<Content>We were not disappointed! We visited Venice 3 years ago and the hotel that a travel agent suggested turned out to be a dump! I was determined to find the perfect spot for our family and the Residence Corte Grimani was it! A short walk from the Rialto bridge (dragging 12 days worth of luggage behind made it a little challenging!), the hotel is modern and very clean (possibly recently renovated?). We had a two bedroom/two bathroom apartment that was more than enough space for the 5 of us. The view from the room was amazing. Right on the water, near the starting point for many of the gondolas, we were seranaded by several different singers  musicians as we took a break in the room for a couple of hours one afternoon! Take advantage of the breakfast that they offer. The first morning we thought we would go out for breakfast. The only problem is they don't really do breakfast in Italy the way we do! I could go on and on, but you get the idea. We will definitely stay here when we go back to Venice!

<Content>Perfecto! Our trip to Venice was marvelous due in part to this great little hotel. The staff is highly receptive to emails and will answer all email inquiries promptly. The hotel is perfectly situated a short distance from St. Mark's Square on a small canal. The rooms are bright and airy with a small kitchen and large bathroom. It was a great place to take an afternoon rest before heading out for another adventure.

<Content>Great Hotel in a Great Location My 3 sisters and I stayed in the Superior apartment for 4 people. The apartment was surprisingly large, and was modern and clean. The two bathrooms were also very modern and nicely appointed. Best of all, the apartment overlooked two canals, and we enjoyed opening the numerous windows and people-watching. The staff were attentive and very helpful. We would certainly stay here again and highly recommend the hotel to others.

<Content>Bellissimo!!! Buongiorno,This was my first trip to venice and it was booked for my mother's 60th birthday. The first thing I would say about the apartments is that they are excellent accommodation for a group of people. There were 5 of us in our party and we booked the superior apartments which came to a little over 100GBP each for 3 nights. The apartments were clean, newly decorated and a delight to stay in. Almost every window had a view of the canal and it was quite tempting to remain in the kitchen/diner rather than explore. Our apartment had two rooms: a very large bedroom with ensuite bathroom containing a large double bed (two singles pushed together) and a double sofa bed, and a separate kitchen/diner with shower room. All the bedding was clean and comfy, linen and towels were provided as well as slippers.The apartment is around the corner after a bridge and a little difficult to find on foot but if travelling by water taxi (the expensive option) you can arrive on the doorstep. The staff are welcoming and friendly although beware of asking them to recommend restaurants and just wander off on your own. We, along with guests from other hotels, found ourselves in an awful establishment on the first night (the name of which I cannot remember now). Thankfully, Venice is scattered with lovely restaurants, its just a matter of walking around and stumbling upon them. We had breakfast one morning, which was a typical continental affair. I preferred the small tapas type venues whilst exploring.It rained whilst we were visiting in February and the apartments provided umbrellas which was nice.As you'll find from the other reviews, this is a real treat in Venice and just around the corner from St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. For the ladies, the delights of the designer boutiques which surround the apartment are diffcult to resist...Have a lovely time!Ciao

<Content>There is no finer place to stay in Venice Great location, great service, best location for visiting Venice....I am extremely late in getting this posted, sorry Donatella, franca and Guido!First, we had an excellent experience with all of our communications with the hotel managers, Donatella and Franca. Upon our arrival, our check in was warm and detailed and a complimentary gift awaited in our apartment. This is definitely the place for you if you like excellent, non-intrusive service.Our maid service was very meticulous...service of the likes that we did not receive in other stays at five star hotels. We can not recommend this property enough...I am grateful to TripAdvisor and to previous guests who wrote their reviews, because this is how I found the hotel.

<Content>Fantastic value in the centre of Venice After a five-day stay at the Corte Grimani, I have only positive things to say about this wonderful apartment hotel:- The apartment (we booked the standard one) was spacious, elegantly furnished and very clean. We were especially impressed by the bathroom, which was beautifully appointed and even included a bidet and laundry machine. - Use of a kitchen. For an additional EUR 35, a cupboard filled with basic kitchen utensils is unlocked. Sufficient for preparing simple meals. As eating out in Venice is rather expensive (and the food is not always that great - for Italian standards), we got a lot of use out of the kitchen.- Location, some 200 m from Piazza San Marco and close to all the other main sights in Venice. The hotel is amazingly quiet considering the very central location.- Great value. We only paid EUR 90 per night and booked through the hotel website. Even though January is low season in Venice, we still felt it represented a very good deal when compared to similar Venetian residences and hotels.Some tips:- We found the hotel without difficulty by using the instructions on the hotel's website. Still it would be a good idea to arrive in daylight. From Piazza Roma we took the vaporetti #1 and #82 in the direction of Rialto/Lido/Valaresso. Then we disembarked at Rialto and followed the hotel's instructions.- Buy a 72 hours vaporetto/bus ticket for EUR 25. It's definitely worth it when you want to visit Murano, Burano, Torcello or Lido. - For those considering self catering, we can recommend the Billa Supermarket located at the end of the Zattere across the San Basilio vaporetto stop (Dorsoduro). Great choice of hams, cheeses, antipasti vegetables, bread, olives, wine, etc. as well as the usual groceries.

<Content>The perfect place to stay in Venice Having read the TA reviews, we decided to go for it. Great plan!We've stayed in various hotels and apartments (privately rented)in Venice and have never quite managed to get everything right. This place absolutely did. We had room to put our kids to bed and stay up with a bottle of Nebbiolo if we liked - or order the room service hot chocolate and pastas one night! - and space enough to eat in the diner area, while having the civilisation of a check in desk and gettgin your beds made every day. This place ticks all of our boxes and we would definitely recommend it and indeed go back.It doesn't have a breakfast set-up as such (you can take it in your room via room service, but it's easier to look after yourselves really). And I would avoid a courtesy Murano trip - our son was really keen to see glass being blown so we asked about the trip. All was great until it came to the hard sell. Luckily we had nerves of steel from somewhere and didn't come away wiht an unwanted glass objet, but it was very uncomfortable. We were a little naive here, and ought to have anticipated a 'sell' but we just didn't look beyond the picture. I think a lot of hotels offer this service, so be warned!!!

<Content>Great Getaway This was a fantastic getaway during the offseason. It was near Christmas, so there were plenty of decorations; however, it the number of tourists was reduced by 90%, so there was time to enjoy the sights without the normal crush and waiting.The hotel was attentive to all our needs and was centrally located near San Marco and on a inlet to the Grand Canal. The breakfast was adequate, if not effusive, but it was quiet, clean and friendly. We actually prefer these BB type accomodations to the hustle and bustle of the typical hotels. The staff devoted plenty of time to each of our questions for directions and background.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - family friendly This apartment hotel was great. We were travelling with young children and also parents and uncles and aunts. Everyone had their own room or apartment. Our family apartment had a lounge and full kitchen as well as huge bedroom. It was great as the children could amuse themselves and have snacks etc. It was exceptionally clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and we would definitely stay again. Only breakfast is served in the hotel in a very small dining area. We had a lovely view of the canal from our window and lots of gondolas passed by. It is very well located and near to everything. It is a samll hotel - only about 12 rooms so there are not lots of extra facilities. Very good value for money in Venice!

<Content>Good location, simple, Internet falsly advertised The residence is located near San Marco, very convenient. The staff is friendly, the rooms have kitchens (but a 30 Euro fee applies if you use them). Breakfast was simple and inexpensive (10 Euro per person, not included in lodging price) . The TV has only one channel in English (the ever repetitive CNN World).The hotel advertises Internet service, but does not have connectivity in the rooms. A single work station downstairs is limited to 15 minutes of use at a time. To me this is a deal breaker. If you say Internet on your website, you better have it.

<Content>great location and peaceful, a hidden gem just come back from a weekend staying here with my wife for anniversary. we booked a superior apartment at 拢125 a night. v clean and comfortable. the space in these apartments is huge - one large bedroom with ensuite plus one lounge with adjoining kitchen and extra bathroom. Prob too much space for a couple but the view of one of the bridges over the canal from the lounge is beautiful. leaving the window open to watch gondolas drift by was special. the staff were friendly and unfussy - they allowed us to use the hotel facilities (leave bags, internet, etc) after we had checked out in the morning. they do however lack food/snacks for those who arrive late like we did. Talking of which - finding the hotel is a nightmare if you arrive late at night. It is so hard to locate first time around (many locals do not know it) but that is part of its charm - it is hidden away - but a bigger sign or plaque on the hotel front would have helped. we actually went past it a couple of times before eventually finding it around midnight.one more thing: the only TV channel in english is CNN and there is MTV. not a big issue but would have liked more choice for those moments of kicking back and relaxing in between the hard work of walking, eating and sleeping...

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic! Just come back from a weekend here and it was just fantastic. The staff were great (from the welcoming email before we left the UK to deliving a bottle of wine to our apartment!|), everything was spotless and the location really could not be bettered. We sat at breakfast (lovely if you like continental), watching gondalas go past the window before a five minute stroll to St Marks Square (and not much longer to Rialto in the other direction) I became slightly worried the cost quoted was per night as I could not believe it compared to the hotel prices I had seen on the net! One tip - it was cheaper to book on their website than on hotel sites! I cannot recommend it highly enough. Get over there!

<Content>Yes, believe all the good reviews! These are suites, not just rooms. Clean, elegant, quiet. Great bathroom, including washing machine, bidet, and view of canals. Breakfasts were very nice.The staff, Franca, Guido, Donatella, were great. They made me feel that they were only too happy to be of assistance.Location is excellent - very central, easy to walk everywhere.I planned to stay 3 nights, ended up staying 5.I am grateful to TripAdvisor and to previous guests who wrote their reviews, because this is how I found the hotel.

<Content>Corte Grimani is a hidden gem We stayed at the Corte Grimani for three nights mid October. Walked from St. Mark's Square (after getting off the Alilaguna) - took us about 15 minutes. We could not find the hotel, and stopped in at another hotel for directions, the one directly across from Giorgio Armani. (We missed the sharp left immediately after crossing the bridge).It is in a quiet little nook, but still centrally located and easy to walk to all the key landmarks. Probably 10 - 15 mins walk to St. Marks. It was really easy to get around.We stepped into our hotel and received a warm reception. The hotel has an elevator, free internet in the lobby and a tv in the lobby.We were in a Classic Apartment configuration -- for two people, it was more than enough room. We also had a small side room, which we did not use at all.The bathrooms were nice sized with aand the water pressure was good. My only complain there is that the toiletries provided were very basic.The bed, linens, and pillows were comfortable. The drapes don't close all the way - so it might be difficult to sleep if you need the room to be completely dark (also might be tough to sleep in). One thing we did was we used the hangers (the ones with the clips that were in the room to close them together.The room we were in was quiet and there were no disturbances at night.There is also a mini kitchen with a washer/dryer (not a washer and a dryer just a machine that has both in there). We did not use it but could be very convenient if you wanted to buy food and cook. We got great recommendations from the hotel on places to eat and they were always spot on.Highly recommend the hotel!

<Content>great place, location Loved this place! I chose it because of other reviews on TripAdvisor, and they were all right! I didn't get the breakfast daily, because it seemed a little high priced, but its location can't be beat. It is definitely worth the extra money to get a room facing the canal, because the view is priceless. Rooms are huge, and amenities are ok ( no shampoo, bring your own). Clean and good room servicing. People at front desk helpful and speak good English. No internet in rooms, tho.

<Content>So central! And such great people. We had a bit of a hassle getting here - as with several other reviewers, the water taxi driver couldn't be bothered dong his job properly and dropped us off at the Palazzi Grimani which is a fair old walk away.So we were hot and bothered when we arrived and were very happy with the reception we got on arrival. Our suite was huge and well laid out, looking out at the bank building, so if you leaned out the window and looked right you could see the canal. We could certainly hear the gondoliers go by, especially those who also sang or had accordions.The location is so central, at one point I left my partner with a glass of wine in Florian's and nipped back for a sweater; when I got back to Florian's the glass wasn't finished.My partner is needs a stick to get about and the hotel was fine in this regard, with only a few steps at the entrance to worry about. Venice itself is not a great destination for people with disabilities, but the people at Residence Corte Grimani made the experience as easy as it could be, including booking a water taxi to pick us up from the front door when we left. They were also very prompt in bringing up anything we ordered from the room, whether bottles of cold wine or fresh cups of hot coffee.We didn't pay the fee for kitchen cleaning and in retrospect I regret this. We stayed 4 nights and could have made more use of the local markets and shops - not to save money, although we would have, but as a pleasure in its own right.While in Venice we ate mostly at Al Conte Pescaor in the Piscina San Zulian (very good food and friendly service).

<Content>It's all True! I have just returned from Venice and the Residence Corte Grimani is all that everyone says it is--and more! A better location you cannot find and more attentive, gracious hosts such as Donatella and Guido are no where else to be had. I stayed in 302 and the first impression you receive is how spotless and fresh it all looks. The kitchen, if you are so inclined to prepare a meal, is large and well appointed. The bathroom is modern and extremely functional and the bedroom is wonderfully large and again, well appointed. The location could not be more convenient, steps from San Marco and the surrounding atmosphere is nothing short of charming. The room was unbelievably quiet and peaceful. Donatella personally escorts you to your room and carefully explains all that you need to know. Guido suggested restaurants and provided detailed instructions on how to get there. As you have read, it requires some detailed reading of a map to locate the hotel, but you will eventually find it. I took the #82 Vaporetto from the Train Station and got off at the Rialto. Once you get off you go right about 2-3 blocks and make your left turn on Bembo-then a right on Calle Magazen to Calle Goldoni and then a left onto Goldoni and just go straight until you come to the first bridge. Don't cross it! The hotel is tucked away on the street to your right just before that bridge. The only other helpful hint that I can provide is that streets and blocks in Venice are short, so be sure to observe the streetsigns on the buildings at the end of EVERY short block. You will never regret one moment of your stay at the Corte Grimani--along with all the incredible sights in Venice, it will make your stay in Venice magical.

<Content>Wow!! 1000 thumbs up!!! This is one of the best hotel experiences I鈥檝e ever had. The location is sensational!! So close to San Marco, yet you feel as if you are far away. We had Suite 101 with an exquisite view of a traditional canal and passing gondolas below. The rooms are huge, extremely clean, well appointed and have lovely wooden beamed ceilings. As if all this weren鈥檛 enough 鈥?the staff is unbelievable!! Donatella couldn鈥檛 be more friendly and helpful. This was especially refreshing in a town where tourists are often treated as second class. Thanks Corte Grimani and thanks tripadvisor!!

<Content>Our own little Venetian gem My fiance and I stumbled upon this hotel via Trip Advisor. After reading all of the wonderful reviews we went to the website directly and booked a room. Here are the pros and cons of the hotel:Cons: We booked a Superior Apartment but got a Classic Apartment with a View instead. We did not realize this until the next day when I realized that we did not have an extra bedroom/bathroom as indicated in the Superior Apartment description. Since it was just the two of us (and we really only wanted the Superior because it was only 30 Euros more a day) this did not bother us as much. Pros:1) The rooms are clean, spacious and smell great! The Classic with a View had a living room, hallway, large bathroom and a spacious bedroom. Our view was over a canal and we could see the Campanile (every Duomo has one..it is a large bell tower structure). The kept the windows open and the sounds from the Piazza, music shows and diners drifted up to our window. Beware - the bell tower lets out loud dong songs at 7am!2) The location is IDEAL! It is a short walking distance to the Piazza san Marco and the Rialto bridge. IT was perfect. We would walk for 2 hours, go back to the hotel and take a nap and then head out again. 3) The staff is amazingly helpful and sweet. There is nothing I can say that has not been said already.TIPS: We took a water taxi directly to the hotel. At first the taxi guy did not know where it was. But a quick call to the hotel fixed this problem. I know that during high tide the taxis can not get to the hotel because it is near a bridge. We were lucky on the way there and did not have this problem. However, upon leaving the water taxi could not get to us because of high tide and we did have to go the Rialto to catch one. The ride directly to the hotel was 115 Euro and the one leaving from the Rialto (organized by Donatello) was 90 Euro.

<Content>Great value This is an ideal location and great value for Venice. Large rooms and very helpful staff who could not do enough. The smaller apartments don't seem to have a canal view, unfortunately and the curtains were not dark enough to keep out the light. But, overall, a great find. We paid EUR 180/night in high season for the 2 of us whereas my friends paid much more in a different hotel further out.

<Content>Even better than expected After a four-day stay at the Corte Grimani with my wife I cannot help posting a very positive comment. The better points:- The room, or rather suite (though it was the basic one), was spacious, well furnished and spotlessly clean. Outside wooden shutters provide almost complete darkness when closed. We had no view, as anticipated, but the canal provided now and then a serenade by passing gondolieri. We experimented no funny water temperature changes (as reported by other guests).- Hotel location, some 200 m from San Marco鈥檚 square, and not far from Rialto, was great. Many of Venice鈥檚 highlights were within walking distance (expect to walk a lot in Venice) plus a selective use of vaporetti to cross the Gran Canal. Besides, it allows you to return easily to leave your purchases or have a short nap.- Staff was a delight. Led by the now legendary (at least in tripadvisor) Donatella, they live up to their fame and provide you with anything you may need, from advice on what to see, how to get there and where to eat, to gifts for special occasions.Looking for something to criticize, the very correct but impersonal international breakfast would be nicer with, for instance, a small choice of some of the delicious Italian cheeses instead of standard Emmental or Havarti. All in all, a great choice if you prefer small, quiet places with a personal touch and with space in your rooms instead of in flashy lobbies and halls.About reaching the hotel:-The driver of a watertaxi booked and paid in advance from airport to hotel initially refused to take us to the hotel and insisted on leaving us at Rialto to walk instead, claiming that water level did not allow reaching the hotel. After some discussion and threats to call the police he admitted that he did not know the way and finally delivered us right in front of the hotel door. Stand fast and give the taxi driver the hotel鈥檚 phone number to get directions.-On the way back home, a water taxi from the hotel door to the airport was booked by the hotel: no problems, punctual, and lower price.

<Content>Quality Hotel-Quality Staff We arrived at Corte Grimani from the Rialto stop several hours before check-in, just to drop off our bags. We followed the directions to the letter and found the hotel with no problem.The sweetest lady met us as we walked in and introduced herself as Donatella, the one we have been reading about here. She in fact does speak perfect English, as does her brother Guido. She told us our room was only 5 minutes from being done, and we could check-in early.This was great for us, as we had a long day of fighting traffic, trains and crowds and were ready to rest for a bit. My husband had caught the 鈥渁irplane hack鈥?and was feeling exhausted.Donatella showed us to our rooms, on the 3rd floor (there鈥檚 an elevator) and we stood in the entry with our eyes popped. We honestly thought she had made a mistake and given us the wrong rooms. We stayed 3 nights and the cost was 160 Euro per night (does not include breakfast which is 10 Euro PP extra) Our rooms were beautiful, new, clean and huge. You walk into your family room/kitchen area. There is a flat screen TV, a kitchen table with linens, a couch and several chairs. There is a washer/dryer right in the kitchen cupboard. There is a door that leads to a small hallway. The bath was on our right. Very nice with toilet, bidet, shower and bathtub. Nice toiletries were on a tray, lovely linens and 2 pairs of slippers. On the left side of the hall was a tiny room that looked to have a fold-up bed, along with a little table, lamp, shelves and hooks for hanging robes etc. Straight-ahead was a great big bedroom with a king-sized bed. There is a long wardrobe closet with lots of hangers and a safe. There was also a big roller-type desk with drawers as well. The best part was our air conditioning was in great working order.Yes, there is a renovation going on in the next building and we were directly across from it. However, the workers never bothered us. You might hear them talking ever so often, but nothing to be concerned about.After a little nap we took a walk and couldn鈥檛 believe we were so close to San Marco. The hotel sits directly on the canal right next to the Goldoni Bridge. You could hear the gondoliers talking, and only once we heard someone singing. After lunch, we returned to find a bottle of champagne, glasses and chips on our table with a lovely card wishing us a Happy Anniversary!This staff is everything a traveler would want. The Internet in the lobby is convenient and free.The morning my husband was really sick, I walked to the Pharmacy for some cough syrup. When I returned Guido had made a pot of coffee for me to take up and asked if there was anything they could do to help. How great is that?Since the vaporetto was striking the next day, all day, we couldn鈥檛 get to the train station to get our tickets. Donatella directed us around the corner to a travel agency who sold us our train tickets at no extra cost.We had found the best place for cappuccinos and pastries in the morning at a place called Andrea Zanin. They are right in the square just south of the hotel. There were many places to eat right in the general area.We could not have been more pleased with our decision to stay at this lovely hotel.Also, thank you to the Trip Advisor review writers. Without you we would not have found this little piece of heaven.

<Content>Superb apartment living a short walk from St. Mark's We cannot compliment this establishment enough for how they run their business. From the start, their website with online booking was a welcome change to the late-night phone calls to hotels checking availability and, ultimately, engaging in the time-consuming process of providing personal information as a non-Italian-speaking American. Corte Grimani's confirmation email even provided directions on how to get to the residence. Upon arrival, we noted the cleanliness of the building and our unit. They had Internet access available in the lobby, and their rooms were even wired for Ethernet should they one day decide to provide the service directly to the guest rooms. Our apartment suite was clean, spacious, sunny, and quiet. The staff was very polite and accommodating, and there was always someone available no matter what time we arrived home. Finally, the breakfast was the best we've ever had at an Italian hotel. Fresh-baked croissants served hot, fresh cereal, yogurt, tea, coffee, fresh fruit, you name it. But probably the best thing about Corte Grimani was its close proximity to St. Mark's. It was literally a 5-minute walk, having allowed for the beautiful square to always be our first and last stop every day.When we return to Venice, we will unquestionably return to this hotel.

<Content>Best stay in Venice Yes, it's as good as everyone says! We stayed at the start of July for just three nights, with two small kids in tow, aged five and two. It was a blessing to have somewhere so comfortable and central to escape from the heat in the middle of the day: the location couldn't have been better, especially with children.Just a couple of points I noticed in some of the other reviews: one gentleman mentioned the fact that the drapes don't close fully. In fact, the shutters outside the windows work perfectly, and give a virtually complete blackout!Also, when we arrived from Treviso airport, we booked a transfer with Shuttle Direct; the water taxi driver had to phone the hotel for directions, so it really does seem to be Venice's best kept secret.Will be back again next year, with any luck, and will stay longer next time.

<Content>Great for Families My family of four stayed here recently. We booked a classic with view room. It was on the 5th floor and had a sofabed and table for four in the living room, a tiny single bedroom, and a spacious king bedroom. There was also a kitchen with a dishwasher and washer/dryer in the living room which we did not use. The layout was great for our family - my 14 year old son claimed the sofabed - the better to be able to sleep at all angles, and my 16 year old daughter took the single bedroom - the better for privacy. The view was of rooftops, but was still nice. The location is very good - close to all of the action, but slightly removed. The staff was very helpful.As previous reviews have noted, the water does seem to cycle between hot and cold, but we adjusted to that. The biggest issue I had was that the king bed was hard. This was our last stop at the end of a 3 1/2 week Spain/Italy trip, and this was easily the hardest bed we encountered. As a result, nights were a bit uncomfortable.

<Content>Excellent Find in Perfect Location My wife and I stayed in the Corte Grimani for 4 nights in mid-July. Getting There: We asked a water taxi at the train station to take us there, but they claimed not to know where the hotel was. Upon check-in, I was informed that some taxis don't wish to go there, because they have to maneuver through back canals filled with gondolas, and it's more profitable just to wait on the next passenger with an easier destination. So we took a vaporetto to the Rialto bridge and walked with our luggage to the hotel. The directions were good, but the streets/alleys were a little confusing. Important note: look for street names about 10 feet up on the side or front of a building. Check-in/Staff: A little wiser and a lot hotter, we did eventually arrive at the Corte Grimani. Fortunately, it was a breath of fresh air (conditioning). The staff was welcoming and quickly checked us in, and got us to our room. Over the course of our 4 nights, we found the staff to be consistently genial and helpful, speaking in good English, and assisting with dinner reservations and theater/concert recommendations. While I don't think there was wireless internet in the rooms, there was a computer provided for guests in the main lobby with internet access (and a printer behind the front desk). Very convenient, but occasionally other teenage guests would camp out there for a little while. Room: Despite getting only a standard room (forget what they called it, but it was the least expensive room), it was better than I expected, with a living/breakfast room and kitchen, a nice bathroom (shower and bath) including a wonderful little washer/dryer, and a fairly spacious bedroom with wardrobe and chest of drawers. Best of all, it was spotlessly clean and well air-conditioned (a must in the July heat and humidity). One thing worth noting: the front desk will sell you the soap for the washer/dryer, so no need to go out and get it (I think it was a very cheap $1 euro per tab, or something similar). The bed was comfortable, though a little firmer than I'm used to, and the sheets were decent quality, so no complaints there. The rooms were tastefully decorated, with comfortable furniture, and a bright, airy feeling. One slight negative is that the drapes didn't really completely close, so expect some light in the mornings, but this didn't bother us too much. I agree with an earlier reviewer that there isn't much of a view unless you get a room that specifies such, but we weren't expecting one, and still got to see some interesting buildings and a glimpse of a canal and walkway. Breakfast/Maid Service: Breakfast was fine--a filled croissant, pastries or bread, jams, yogurts, and a choice of cereal, cold cuts, tea or coffee, along with juice and water. (Note: remember to inform them the day before that you'll be having breakfast with them, so they'll make sure to accomodate you--we saw one couple who didn't do so, and they still got the benefit of everything else, but there weren't any croissants left.) Maid service was also excellent--they did not bother us until we left mid-morning, and they always did a good job of replenishing towels, making the bed, etc. without disturbing the stuff we left out. Location/Restaurants: Despite our initial adventure in getting to the Corte Grimani, we quicky learned our way around the hotel's surrounding streets and found it to be extremely convenient to St. Mark's Square (maybe a 2 or 3 minute walk), and to the Rialto (probably a 5 minute walk). With its location just outside of the bustle, it was fairly quiet at night while still being ultra-convenient. Some nearby restaurants to try: Osteria Enoteca San Marco (casual neighborhood bistro, with excellent wines, best cheese plate we had in our entire time in Italy, good meals and friendly staff) on the way to St. Mark's Square; Fiaschetteria Toscana (a litte nicer neighborhood bistro, very good wines, appetizers, and main courses, desserts to remember) just a little northeast of the Rialto bridge; and L'Osteria di Santa Marina (the most formal of the 3, on a quiet piazza with lovely outdoor seating - but warm in July - excellent, creative gourmet-level cuisine with tasting menu options that's not ultra-expensive) a little further north and east from Fiaschatteria Toscana. Be sure and make reservations for the latter two, especially L'Osteria di Santa Marina. Other restaurants were also very good, but we thought these 3 represented the best combination of value, service, and excellence within a reasonable walk from the hotel. Leaving: Check-out was easy with no hidden surprises, though I had forgotten that they didn't take American Express--just Visa and MasterCard. After check-out, we let them arrange a water taxi to pick us up, rather than repeat the trek with luggage, and while the $65 euro fare was high, it was quick and easy. The train station was very crowded, with long lines for the ticket windows and even at many of the machines, so it may be a good idea to go ahead and buy your train tickets when you arrive, or online at trenitalia(--). Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Corte Grimani, and were impressed with the cleanliness, the space, the air-conditioning, the laundry machine, and the friendliness of the staff. I know it's not the absolute cheapest place to stay in Venice, but we felt it was a very good value, especially compared to places like the Danieli where you are paying a lot more for atmosphere and history without as much space. Be sure to tour St. Mark's Basilica (the headphones in the museum upstairs are worth it), and the Doge's Palace (again, the headphones are a must). For something different if you need a break from the Renaissance, try the Peggy Guggenheim museum - an extremely impressive smallish collection of post-impressionist and modern art that you can easily view in 2-3 hours (again, spring for the headsets, you'll be glad you did!). All of the other myriad sights were lovely/awe-inspiring/unique, but these 3 were the most memorable sights we enjoyed. Above all, take the time to walk around and get lost for a little while amidst the winding alleyways, canals, and decadent old buildings to experience the city, because Venice itself is the true highlight.

<Content>Perfect for families  I booked this hotel based on rave reviews on Tripadvisor and my expectations were exceeded! This is the PERFECT place to stay for families. We are 2 parents and 3 teenaged kids. The apt. is large, spotlessly clean, nicely furnished in a comfortable but slightly formal style with good beds and modern bathrooms. Rooms are nicer than photos on web site indicate. The A/C works great! We got too cold in the room and had to turn it down (actually each room has separate A/C controls so you can adjust to your preference). We brought a week's worth of dirty laundry to do and the combo washer/dryer was nice but small (and a little hard to figure out to operate). We ended up doing a bunch of loads in the room but sending some out since we didn't want to spend all day doing laundry. The BEST part of the hotel is Donatella and her amazing staff. Every one of them was SO NICE and helpful with everything from where to eat, where to go, where not to go, how to get everywhere, etc. They were the best hosts of our 2 week trip! You can't beat the location between St. Mark's and Rialto. The computer in the lobby let my 3 kids check their e-mail and connect a little with home. All in all the PERFECT place to stay for a family in Venice!!

<Content>Perfect Hotel and Location We were two families of four people each with 2 young children each. We had a LOT of luggages with us. We hired a water taxi from the airport to the hotel (120 euros) and pulled right up to the hotel. Let me tell you, between jet lag and heat, we were extremely grateful not to have to drag our luggages and our children trying to find the hotel. It was literally about a few feet from the taxi stop. The owner (Donatella?) came right out to help us with the luggages. They were all the nicest and warmest people we've met (especially after dealing with the horrible Alitalia people!!!) The hotel is immaculately cleaned and well-kept. The rooms are spacious with lots of windows. We had the classic apartment with view (we paid about 190 euros a night). They already had the sofabed opened and set up in the living room. The bathroom was spacious as well, with luxurious towels. The bedroom was tastefully decorated and again, spacious with views. There's a washer/dryer (one machine) in the bathroom. There's a small fridge and microwave in the kitchenette. A large flat screen tv for my kids. It was literally about 5 minutes to St. Mark's Square and Rialto Bridge. It was close to all the shopping areas. In fact, we could hop in and out of the hotel because it was so close to all the major attractions we were visiting. We really couldn't have asked for a more perfect hotel!!! We would recommend this hotel to everyone without hesitation!!! It really helped make our trip extra special! Thank you so much!!!

<Content>Exceptional Property, Serivce and Location Truly an exceptional property in the heart of Venice. Our family of four (two adults/two teens) stayed at the Residence Corte Grimani for three nights at the end of June. This was the first stop on our two week Italy vacation and will remain the nicest accomidation of our visit. The Grimani had it all; Clean and tasteful, two room suites, large roomy bathrooms (including a wash machine), small refrigerator and kitchen for those who want to cook, I could go on. We agree with all the other positive reviews. For famlies you can not beat this hotel and the location is great! Most of our contact was with Donatella, she simply was a delight and went out out of her way to help. This hotel/apartment was a great value and would recommend to anyone!

<Author>Missypie
<Content>A lovely, relaxing option for families Our family of five stayed three nights at the Corte Grimani. Earlier in our Italian adventure, we had stayed in apartments, so it was nice to have maid service and helpful front desk folks here!It was a bit tricky finding the place from the Rialto Bridge. We followed the directions and didn't get lost, but we stopped every block to make sure we were still on course. Once you arrive, it is a straight walk of only a few blocks to St. Marks. Since the hotel is on a canal, we had a water taxi pick us up when we left for the airport. We stayed on the 5th floor - I think the room is described as classic with view. We were not on the same side of the hotel as the entrance. If your room's windows are on the same side as the entrance, I believe that all such rooms have a view of sorts. On the side we were on, only the 5th floor has a view of anything at all, as the lower floors' windows look out at a wall (also at the construction going on in the adjacent buidling).The suite was tastefully decorated; lovely furniture, heavenly linens on the bed. In addition to the living area, bedroom and bath, our suite had a tiny extra room (the same size as the bathroom), which held a narrow bed, small night table and lamp. Even though very small, the room had two windows and was thoughtfully outfitted with a shelf for personal items and some robe hooks. My 15 year old son claimed this room and loved it.There was plenty of drawer space and there were plenty of hangers.The only problem we encountered was with the hot water. It seemed as if it was timed to go on and off. In the shower (TERRIFIC water pressure, by the way), we'd get about a minute of hot, followed by about 20 seconds of cold, followed by about a minute of hot, then cold, etc. If it is an intentional system to get folks to take shorter showers, it certainly works! Here is how the kitchen situation works: There is a microwave and small fridge that are free to use. There is also an unlocked cabinet that holds glasses and cups. If you want to cook, they charge a 30 euro cleaning fee and unlock a cabinet that holds dishes and pots and pans. We didn't pay to use that, as we were just having cereal, milk and yogurt for breakfast.I was impressed that the room was truly ready for us when we arrived. There were 5 pairs of slippers for us in the bathroom and plenty of towels. I would definitely recommend the Corte Grimani.

<Content>Yes, this hotel is a very good option Basically agree with the other reviews. A great option, nice decor, clean, good value, right in the heart of Venice. A water taxi to the door on arrival at the airport is a must (cost 2 of us 90 Euro total).

<Content>loved it I would definitely return to this hotel. It's more like an apartment. It has a large bedroom with a big, comfortable bed. The bathroom is spacious. It has a small livingroom, diningroom and kitchen all together. It's very modern. The staff is fantastic. It's right on a canal. We weren't able to get a room with a view, but it was high enough that the view was still ok. The location is great - It's very close to San Marcos Piazza. We really loved it here, and we have high standards since we usually stay in nice, large suites in the U.S. Be sure to have dinner on the Rialto. We found it by mistake on our last night there and it was very romantic. Also, visit Lido. Everyone goes to Murano for the glass blowing, but we loved Lido. It's a small beach community with great little restaurants and a beach where you can rent lounge chairs and umbrellas for the day.

<Content>The perfect Venice residence We cannot think of a better place to stay in Venice. The apartments are spacious, beautifully and comfortably furnished and the location is ideal - midway between San Marco and the Rialto but off the main tourist route between the two. Although the Residence does breakfast - either downstairs or delivered to your room - we chose to use the beautifully and fully equipped kitchen for our breakfasts and evening snacks as we eat our main meal at midday.Above all the three proprietors - Guido (pronounced 'weedo') Bianchi, his wife Franca and his sister Donatella - speak excellent English and could not have been more welcoming, helpful and kind. They know Venice well and can advise on tourism matters and nothing was too much trouble for them. They arranged a water taxi for us back to the airport so that we could leave right from the front door and take only 20 minutes - worth the 90 euros (for four) that they negotiated for us - though we paid the 100 asked for.The reception desk was manned all day by one of them or, after 9 pm, by a night 'porter' one of whom spoke excellent English and the other Fench.In addition to all this the value for money was incredible - the cost was no more than a 3/4 star hotel and if there had been four of us it would have been even better. In fact our apartment could have slept five - two beds, a double sofa and a single in the small second bedroom.So very highly recommended !

<Content>A fantastic hotel A wonderfulapartment. When we saw the size of it we thought there must have been some mistake - you could have put an entire bus load of tourists in there quite comfortably. The room looked out over the canal, was clean and cool and beautifully furnished. they brought breakfast to your room and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. It was also less than five minutes from San Mark's Square, but tucked away from all the tourists so it still felt secluded and peaceful. I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Venice.

<Content>You won't get better for less than this fab accommodation Having spent hours and hours searching what were very expensive, tired looking hotels, I came across this gem which had fantastic reviews on TripAdvisor! I made a booking and was not disappointed - this location, and Venice, exceeded all expectations! I can't say much more than you will not be disappointed and I agree with the other reviews. The standard twin room was huge and can easily sleep 4 people (for a small additional fee, with two on the sofa bed in the large lounge) and if you're staying for longer than 2/3 nights, then I am sure using the kitchenette will be worth the extra as Venice is not a cheap city. The market is only about 10min walk away. Get there early before the crowds! We walked everywhere and therefore never made use of the Venice Card we bought - so I would rather use that money for something else.

<Content>Deserves its high ratings It's like having your own apartment in this glorious city. The famiy suite was very generously proportioned, decorated thoughtfully and with sophistication. It's hard to believe it's just a few minutes walk to Piazza San Marco, but it's quiet and peaceful. The staff is totally professional and helpful. Call them as you arrive by train or plane and they'll give the number of the water taxi that knows their location (it's hidden--but in the middle of everything) and they have a boat-up location so it's worth taking advantage of it. We used the kitchen one night and found it well stocked. Having a washer dryer is helpful too, but since it's a euro-model that uses very high heat, it's best used only for your sturdiest clothes. Breakfasts are a typical European assortment of cereal, pastries, cheeses and meat. They'll deliver it to your room if you like, which is a nice touch. My only criticism is that the desk person on duty after 8pm speaks only Italian, so it was a bit difficult to make arrangements sometimes, though he tries hard. We will be booking this again for our next trip to Venice, but I suspect that we'll have to do so far in advance, because it's deservedly popular.

<Content>Wonderful place We stayed in a suite overlooking the canal, 2 adults and 2 children. The rooms are beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Breakfast is really nice. The hotel has broadband connectivity. The staff are all extremely helpful, day and night. The location is great - a few minutes from Rialto and from St Mark's. Just a wonderful place to stay.

<Content>Amazing, what a fantastic find! We have just returned from a 4 night stay in Corte Grimani. We decided to stay there from the reviews we read on TripAdvisor. How true these reviews were. The place is fantastic, beautifully decorated, great location (less then 5 minutes from both St. Marks Square and The Rialto) and the staff could not be more friendly and accommodating especially Donatella who greated us with a smile and a friendly word everytime we met her and she gave us recommendations for some fantastic restaurants. We booked a Superior Apartment which was beautifully decorated and had some spectacular views of the canal. We had breakfast in the Residence each morning which was great value and set us up for the day. We can't recommend Corte Grimani highly enough and we will definitely be back!!

<Content>Brilliant find We stayed at Residence Corte Grimani in the top level suite in early January 2006 (2 adults and 2 children). The rooms were huge especially for Venetian standards and very well appointed.Our view was better than expected. The Residence was perfectly located on a small canal and only a short stroll to all major sights.Extremely well priced for the size and quality of the establishment. The owners were very friendly and helpful - we could not have chosen a better place to stay in Venice and would definitely stay there again on our next visit to Venice.

<Content>It's as good as they say! Everything that other reviews say about this place is true so I won't repeat it. This is spacious, high-standard accommodation. One thing to bear in mind when booking is that some rooms only have a view of the building next door so if a view is important, make sure you mention this when booking. If you are planning to take advantage of the self-catering facilities, there is a wonderful fresh-produce market just the other side of the Rialto bridge. The hotel IS difficult to find - if approaching from San Marco, once you cross Goldoni Bridge, take an immediate sharp left along the walkway by the canal. If you go past the Armani shop (on your left) you have gone too far. Similarly, if approaching from Rialto, you will pass the Armani shop (on your right) as you approach the Goldoni Bridge - don't cross the bridge but follow the walkway by the canal immediately to the right of the bridge. The walkway will bring you to a small courtyard. Residence Corte Grimani is immediately in front of you - green outer door with small gold name plaque. Good luck and enjoy!

<Content>Great Hotel/apartment for families We loved our experience at this hotel and want to let families know what a fabulous place this can be for them. We asked for a seperate room for our teenage daughter and we got two huge rooms that were connected. One room had a new, comfortable queen? sofa bed, kitchen and bathroom (and canal view) and the other room had a king size bed, table, huge sofa and another bathroom. Both rooms had a large flat screen TV. A computer in the reception area is available for free internet use 24 hours a day. Breakfast was very good and included some wonderful fresh fruit, hot chocolate, coffee, and lots of choices. The people who work there are very friendly and just can't do enough for you. Ask for room 101--I understand that all of the rooms are not as large as ours. It is hard to find-take the phone # with you.
