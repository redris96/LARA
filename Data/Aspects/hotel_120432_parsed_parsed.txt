<Content>Not a place for kids We stayed at this hotel for 1 night prior to a cruise. We would never go back. The rooms were filthy. We were shocked that Marriott would put their name on such a dump. We were supposed to go back for one night after our cruise, but we cancelled because the thought of going back there was frightening. Not for families.

<Content>Was fine for a precruise stay Paid less than $50 for this room on Priceline. I am originally from Miami and usually stay in the Doral or Blue Lagoon area since it is so centrally located and has easy access to all major highways.The check in experience was positive. Since Priceline basically guarantees you one bed, we were prepared to pay a little extra upon checkin for the two beds we required. The manager did not charge us the extra $20 and we were very happy!The room was clean and on the medium side regarding size, We were only staying overnight and the overall experience was fine. I would not stay here for vacation, the location is very business oriented.Complimentary breakfast was a big plus and included hot and cold foods. Eggs, bacon, waffles, cerals, juices, fruit and bakery items covered most bases.Overall a good stay.

<Content>ok for one night We stayed at Fairfield Inn Miami Airport West/Doral Area one night on our way to Aruba. We just needed a place to sleep before catching our connecting flight. The reason why I booked there was the free airport shuttle and free breakfast. I usually stay at Marriott (any brand) and I typically get a nice place. I have to say this was a worst Fairfield Inn I have stayed at. The free shuttle bus was hard to get. After we arrived in Miami I called for the shuttle. They told us that we needed to get to another terminal to get it. After a few phone calls the driver agreed to get us from the terminal we were at. However, overall it took almost 1 hour to get the shuttle! The hotel was much further from the airport than I expected.The rooms were OK. Looks like this Fairfield was a motel at one point and was converted to a Marriott property. The front desk personel was helpful. The breakfast was fine for free breakfast. The shuttle back to the airport in the morning was much less trouble than getting to the hotel from the airport.If you just need a place to sleep for one night by the airport this place is OK. If you need more than that I would not stay there.

<Content>flooded shower This was a good place to stay overnight in transit, although a bit far from the airport. Quiet and priced reasonably compared to other airport hotels. Breakfast was good.The shower in #115, a handicapped accessible room, flooded from the shower into the rest of the bathroom, and it took 10 minutes to get the water back down the drain. Management refused to take anything off the room price in compensation. Make sure you don't get this room.

<Content>It was OK for what little money it cost. I wanted two rooms for one night after arriving at Miami Airport following long journeys and Priceline gave us rooms for GBP 拢30 each. We used a taxi from the Airport rather than the hotel shuttle. The Check-In staff were friendly but rather dim and the hotel itself was adequate for what little we paid for rooms. There are several eating places within a 5 minute walk - these are adequate but not a fine dining experience. We needed car rental the following morning and were pleased to find that there is a Hertz location in a small Mall very near to the hotel. The hotel is in a guarded compound but, to me, it didn't seem to be in a particularly dangerous area.

<Content>Not Bad for the Price We stayed at this hotel during our weekend trip to Miami. The hotel is located behind the Courtyard by Marriott. It would appear from the outside that the hotel had recently received a face lift, new paint and an adjustment to the facade. The lobby is quiet nice, defiantly has the Marriott touch with the wood grain desks, modern sitting area and breakfast nook. The business center is well equipped as is the marketplace. Check-in staff is exceptional. Each member of the staff warmly greeted us throughout our stay, occasionally by name. Our room featured two double beds, large television, mini-fridge and microwave; A very comfortable room for the price. During the hours of 6am - 10pm we were subjected to the sounds of jumbo jets landing and taking off from the Miami International airport. As a commercial aircraft enthusiast I did not mind the noise but I could see how this could be a nu cense to some travelers. Overall, this hotel could use upgraded carpet and a new elevator. This property succeeds at providing a safe, clean room were one can conduct a little business given the hotel has free wireless internet access. If in the area, I would defiantly stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent Experience We used this hotel because it was one of the few in Miami that offered free parking while we were on a cruise, and a shuttle to the Port ($14.00) We found it to be an exceptional property. Staff were friendly and helpful. Eddy Luna made our stay especially enjoyable. If you stay here, book your shuttle when you book the room as it is busy with airport traffic as well. As we hate driving in large cities, we ordered pizza for supper. A local pizzeria suggested by Eddy at the front desk brought the best pizza we've had in a long while. There were also re-heatable foods available in the lobby for reasonable prices. The breakfast was more than adequate. The lobby and breakfast room were both large and comfortable. We would definitely use this hotel if we were in the area again.

<Content>Look Elsewhere I realize that Fairfield is competing with mid to low end hotel chains so my expectations are realistic; however, this hotel was simply horrible. As one reviewer notes, this indeed is more like a motel than a hotel. I stayed there two nights in two different rooms. Each room was musty and worn down. One room's furniture was stained. The floors were dirty. The beds were hard and the pillows were flat and thin. Towels were like sand paper. It's located in a suspect area with noisy patrons during each night, during the middle of the week. The only good news is the complimentary breakfast had a wide variety for both hot and cold food options. Really, this was like an expensive Motel 6. This Fairfield should be ashamed of itself. If you need to stay near the airport, spend the extra $50 and stay at the Marriott. Or stay further away. And don't stay at the properties on La Jeuene -- they were worse!

<Content>Not perfect if you are on vacation The hotel is more like a motel.The staff are very nice and polite.If you are on vacation, it is too far away from the beach. I have to choose this hotel because Miami Beach was full nov 9 trhu 12.I want to use the pool, but never was the water heated. I asked to put the heater, but they never did it. It was too cold!! And also the pool is very small.I stay 3 nigths. The firts one, no fridge or microwave in the room. Next 2 days i have it both. If you stay 3 nigths is too much not to have it for 1 nigth, rigth?We were at 3 floor . The elevator broke my second day. So I have to use the stairs. Thanks to one guy from the staff that help me to take my baggage to ground floor. Imposible to do it alone by stairs!The free breakfast was very good. Waffles, eggs, juice, bagels, etc.The wireless internet in your room, was great.If you need to stay one nigth waiting for a cruise or another fligth is ok. But no choose this hotel if you are on vacation.

<Content>Use only as a last resort Unimpressive Hotel. No lobby pull-up area, so if you arrive while raining expect to get wet while you unload your car. The hotel must be located in a questionable area since it's surrounded by chain link fence and you must pass a security checkpoint before you drive onto the hotel property. Rooms were very small and poorly arranged. You could not view the TV unless you were in the bed because they were not movable. The hotel is poorly staffed, tried to call the front desk and the phone rang for 5 minutes. Repeated with same result. Had to call the hotel from an outside line and the phone was answered after several rings. I was told they were too busy to answer the line. Asked to speak to the manager and was told they don't return till the following day. Asked to speak to the on-duty manager and found out that only one staff member works at night, (answering the phones, checking people in, etc.). Hotel was loud with buses and people checking in throughout the night, till after 2 a.m. Sounds travel through the walls so it was very noisy as people walk outside your room at all hours of the night. Save yourself some aggravation and spend an extra 10-20 dollars and stay somewhere else. This is a low class, noisy, dirty hotel.

<Content>Nice Lobby, Small, Dirty Rooms For $189/night I have to say I was expecting more, much more, than this hotel offered. I didn't like the motel setup where most rooms face outside, particularly since the inn is a stone's throw from the interstate. It didn't feel safe, even with the security guard station there. Being next to the airport might be nice if you bring earplugs :). The room was unbelievably small, as in 1970's Motel 6 small, with nary 3 feet of space between the end of the bed and the television set. It looked renovated, including the carpet, but my children's socks were literally black within minutes of walking on the carpet. How gross is that?! The front desk clerk was completely unmoved by our complaint about the carpet; she just blinked and kept typing when we told her we were leaving. We had booked 3 nights, but could only deal with one. Promptly moved over to another Marriott property, the Doral Spa (talk about a hotel!), paying twice what we paid for the Fairfield, but getting about 10 times more.

<Content>Great for Pre-Cruise stay We stayed here one night before our cruise and it was perfect for what we needed. One person in our party had a broken door lock and they were immediately placed in another room. We ordered a pizza from a local place and the man at the front desk helped me carry the pizza and sodas up to our room when it arrived. The shuttle to the Miami port to board the ship was free and very well organized. The free shuttle from the airport to the hotel on the night we arrived, however, was very slow and even with 2 shuttles running, we ended up waiting for over an hour. If you're in a hurry to get to the hotel, take a cab. It's only about 7 miles from the airport. The breakfast buffet was great. They offered eggs, sausage, cold cereal, oatmeal, fruit, coffee, juice, toast, bagels, etc. and even had someone there making belgian waffles. The bathroom was a little small, but the room in general was perfect for our needs. Highly recommend to anyone needing a one night pre-cruise stay. NOTE! Call ahead and get your name on the list for the free shuttle to the port, if you're cruising. They have between 30 and 40 thousand people leaving on cruises from that port on any given weekend. There will not be room for you if you wait to sign up until you get there.

<Content>Never again - Terrible experience - I can't believe that Marriott attaches their name to this hotel. Very unclean and felt very unsafe. (Carpets were terrrible stained, furniture old and unclean.) Would not recommned - HOwever the pool area shared by the Marriott and Courtyard was very nice.

<Content>We've loved it My daughter and I went for a 6 days vacation to Miami, so we needed an economic hotel and also a central one so that we can visit all the best malls and especially Wal mart but by taxi because we didn't hired a car.So we stayed at Fairfield Inn Miami Airport West Doral, recommended by our travel agent and also a colleague of mine.And in some words it was fabulouse, we had a very great time, attentive personel, the breakfast was good and although there was no restaurant in the Hotel the delivery of the restaurants in the neighbourhood was perfect and on time.We had a very good time and for sure I will be staying at the Fairfield Inn for my next visit, I'm recommending this Hotel to all my friends.Not even the fact that they are working and remodeling the Lobby was a problem for us they don't disturb you at all.That is what we can say of a good and nice Hotel it don't have to be a five star to be good it can be good just for being good.Thanks for everything people at Fairfield Inn Miami especially Judith she was nice to us.

<Content>Good Hotel for Pre-Cruise--Shuttles for Airport and Port of Miami We stayed at Fairfield Inn for one night just before boarding our cruise. The reasons for picking this hotel were 1) free breakfast, 2)a free airport shuttle and 3) a shuttle available ($12/room booked--not per person) to Port of Miami. The Port of Miami shuttle should be booked ahead of time as the shuttle can only hold about 15 people. The first shuttle leaves at 10:30 am. This is the best one to take as there is no waiting and embarkation begins around the time you reach the port. I found it cheaper to book the shuttle through the hotel separately instead of getting the Pre-Cruise package (room  shuttle) through the reservation center. The airport shuttle took half an hour to come. There seemed to be just one shuttle running the night we arrived. If the shuttle is already in transit when you call the hotel for a pick up, then it may take longer depending on where the driver is. There are restaurants a few blocks from the hotel. It rained the night we arrived and the shuttle driver was willing to take us to the restaurant of our choice but we opted on ordering Chinese food that was delivered promptly.The staff was friendly and the hotel was going through renovations. The rooms were clean and spacious. There is an outdoor pool and there is a computer in the foyer for free internet access. The breakfast came with bagels, cereal, slices of bread, self-serve waffles, variety of juices, milk, fruits, yogurt and danishes. It was a good selection.I would use this hotel again for a pre-cruise for its convenience.

<Content>NEVER again! I would NOT book this hotel again, in fact it should be called a MOTEL because that is exactly what it is. This 2 storey building that carries the Marriott name was in a state of disrepair and the rooms were musty and smelled like mildew. Basically, I went to see the room I had booked and turned on my heels and walked out....in fact I walked next door the Courtyard By Marriott and booked my family there for the night. If you don't mind staying in a motel 6, then this is the place for you. If you want clean and comfortable I suggest the Courtyard next door. Hard to believe they are both Marriotts.....

<Content>Good Value We stayed at this property on January 1, 2005 because of it's airport shuttle, cruise shuttel and continental breakfast. The airport shuttle is very slow in picking up at the Miami airport but i read it on reviews prior to my arrival so we just sat down and waited. The property is in a location that has 3-4 places to eat withing a 7-10 minute walk. I did not feel unsafe in this area, but we traveled in groups of 10 or more. The pool area was small but clean and very nice. Out of our group of 18, my family lucked out on the nicest location in the hotel (i felt), room 223. It was on the second floor, overlooking the pool and very close to the stairs. We signed up for the cruise shuttle at noon (the cost is $12 per room, not per person). The shuttle was late returning from the 1030am shuttle, due to traffic- - - but we made it to the port by 100pm. If you book this hotel, please be sure and call to reserve your spot on the cruise shuttle, and double-check it before your arrival. The staff was very courteous, knowledgeable and always trying to please. This hotel is NOT the Ritz, but for the money, it is a good value.

<Content>Not the Best We stay at the Fairfield Inn pre-cruise 10/23. Our room was at the end of the hall there was mildew on the ceiling and it smelled like damp carpet. Not to mention I was quoted a different price when I made my reservation and when I got there it was a higher price of course. The pillows were to soft I felt like somehow those beds were not that clean under the sheets. My girlfriend had an allergic reaction to the pillows. One night was enough for me I cancelled my return stay.

<Content>Great Deal for the Money After doing ALOT of research, I chose the Fairfield Inn by Marriott Miami West for our pre-cruise overnight for a number of reasons - the complimentary shuttle to and from MIA, the complimentary shuttle to the Port of Miami, and the Marriott name. The first two reasons alone were going to save our party of 17 people (9 adults and 8 children) quite a lot of money! Coupled with the fact that we got a GREAT deal through Orbitz - four rooms at $42.68 per room (inclusive) on a holiday weekend nonetheless (7/02/04) sweetened the deal even further!The only two complaints I had were the little tiny itsy bitsy bugs that appeared out of nowhere by the bathroom sink. They weren鈥檛 there when we left for dinner, but were very obvious when we came back 鈥?maybe we spilled a drop of soda and the bugs were thirsty. I wiped the little critters away and they didn鈥檛 seem to come back. But, hey - we were in Florida, right?My 2nd complaint was just getting to the hotel from the airport. We were told by the Fairfield Inn operator that once we had our luggage in hand, we should use one of the courtesy phones to call the hotel to let them know we were ready to be picked up. The hotel operator told us where (outside) to meet the shuttle 鈥?the driver would meet us in about 20 minutes. Once the waiting time approached one hour, and our crabbiness had reached new heights, we decided perhaps it would be best to seek other means of transportation. But wait ~ could it be? Yes ... here comes the Fairfield Inn shuttle 鈥?yeah! Maybe it was waiting in the humid 90 degree Miami heat, or perhaps just wanting to settle down already after a very long day of travel, but I thought an hour vs. the estimated 20 minute wait time was a little excessive. The look on our faces was probably quite familiar to the driver who quickly squelched our crabbiness with his pleasant demeanor. He was extremely courteous and offered a variety of dining options for us for that evening 鈥?including offering to transport us to the restaurant of our choice in their very comfortable and clean 17-passenger shuttle bus.After a dip in the pool, a nice dinner and a good night鈥檚 sleep, we thoroughly enjoyed the generous continental breakfast spread (bagels, toast, danish, juices, fruit, coffee, tea and fresh BELGIAN WAFFLES topped with scrumptious strawberries!) After this yummy breakfast, we began loading our party of 17 into the shuttle bus. While the driver loaded the never-ending pieces of luggage into the back cargo area, we secured the carseats into the shuttle, settled everyone into a seat, and were soon on our way to the Port of Miami.To make our stay even more comfortable, the hotel gave us complimentary use of a 1st floor guest room to store the items we wouldn鈥檛 be needing until we left for our cruise on 7/03/04 - carseats, excess luggage, etc. Now that鈥檚 service! All in all, I would recommend this hotel to others for a comfortable pre-cruise overnight.

<Content>Great value for pre-cruise stay We stayed here on a Saturday night prior to our cruise leaving on Sunday. I can't say enough about the money we saved by staying here. The hotel provided a shuttle from the airport (it took about 45 minutes for the shuttle to pick us up), solid continental breakfast and then a shuttle to the port of Miami. We were at the port by 11:30 am. For a family of four this saved us a lot of money. The hotel was clean and in a ok area,the only negative I would not want to walk around at night outside the hotel area but the value was exceptional. We would stay here again if they offered the shuttle.

<Content>A good value I stayed at the Fairfield Inn - Miami West for two nights in December 2003. The staff were friendly and accommodating. My room was clean and relatively quiet, although jet airplanes flew overhead as they did over much finer hotels nearby. The buffet breakfast was delicious and more than adquate. I especially liked the self-make waffles. When I arrived at the airport, I had to wait one hour for the shuttle bus, and even then it passed me by once although I had run after it. But it came around for the second time. I wanted to take the inn's shuttle bus to the airport and arrive there at 4:00 am, but the first shuttle bus would leave at 5:30 am, which is reasonable. So I took a taxi for $20 -- quite expensive for a 10-minute ride, but that's Miami!
