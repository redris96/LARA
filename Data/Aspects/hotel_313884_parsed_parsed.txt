<Content>Beautiful Resort The resort was absolutely beautifule. We had a great 7 day vacation. If you do go buy up to the platinum membership, this allows you premium drinks including Corona, personal concierge service, 20 minute massage, cigars, etc. We did have a hard time getting our premium drinks from the pool and beach bars, they would send us to the platinum lounge, but if a female requested the premium drinks they would get them at those bars. Also, make sure they put Rum in your tropical drinks, they try to serve these without. The atmosphere was great, October was a great time to visit.

<Content>Great Resort We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess over New Year's. We loved the resort. We found all the staff friendly. They were constantly cleaning. The grounds were beautiful. The food was good, we have stayed at other resorts that had more selection, but we always found something we liked.The rooms were probably the most spacious that we have stayed in. We had a great view.New Year's Eve there were fireworks on the beach. All the resorts up and down the beach put on a display. We would go back.

<Content>What a Great Experience 13-20 December 2008I am sure you have read a few reviews on the Punta Cana Princess - we read quite a few before going and we were really looking forward to our trip. The fact that many of the residents at the Punta Cana Princess are return visitors should tell you that it's an amazing place.Upon our arrival at the Resort, the check-in was quick and efficient. We were extremely satisfied with our room and even though it was quite late at night our first task was to check out the facilities. The beach was amazing that first night. Throughout the week whether it was day or night, whenever we did go swimming the water was exhiliarating - leaving Canada and being able to swim in December is indeed a novelty. One review we had seen stated that the food had been barely palatable - well there's an amazing selection of food for each meal. For breakfast a very pleasant gentleman made eggs any way you wanted them - including an amazing omelet! There was also a vast assortment of all kinds of different foods, whether it was fruits, cereals, oatmeal, etc. For lunch and supper the selection was also amazing. At lunch they would have a BBQ set up outside and the variety of the different meats was pleasing and tasty. I particularly enjoyed the pasta bar for supper - you could pick your favorite type of pasta and the gentleman would add your selected spices, ingredients and sauces and voila you would have an amazing little pasta dish. At some point during the week I did get ill - not sure what it was but I think it is something that a majority of us travellers will experience - my recommendation? Immodium is very quick in relieving any issues a person may have and you are able to continue on and enjoy your vacation.The staff was amazing - they would greet you at the entrance of the buffet area and bring you to your table and then would provide you with your drink of choice. In a previous review, someone had complained that the drinks were watered down? I didn't find this - I found the variety of the drinks pleasing and considering that the alcoholic beverages were provided from 1000 hrs in the morning to late at night - we had no complaints here!! There were bars set up at the beach, at the buffets and the swim up bar in the pool. All the bartenders were very friendly and would do their best to ensure we were well taken care of.The staff work so very hard to ensure that the diners are well taken care of for food and what not - every day you would normally see the same server/hostess. Many of the vacationers would slip a gratuity to the server/hostess to show their appreciation for their efforts.There were some complaints about the Entertainment personnel of the Hotel - they're job is to ensure that the residents of the Hotel are having a good time. They have very charismatic personalities and would do their best to engage the residents in volleyball, aerobics, Bingo, dancing, etc - if you didn't want to - then they would leave you be. The people that did join in did have fun - we played volleyball in the pool on our first day there and we had lots of fun (although our team lost against the Entertainment personnel). If anything these people worked very hard as they were often at the Resort early in the morning, were there throughout the day and would return for the evening activities.My sole complaint about the resort was the lack of English that some of the personnel spoke. But, when you think of it - I should have made more of an effort to have learned basic Spanish phrases prior to our departure - When we did speak Spanish they appreciated our efforts.In closing, if you do decide to go to the Punta Cana Princess, you will undoubtedly have an experience of a lifetime and will meet some amazing people also enjoying their stay at the resort.

<Content>Beatiful resort...awful food! My boyfriend and I just returned from an 8-night stay at the Punta Cana Princess, and while we had a nice time, we won't be returning. We had read all of the reviews before going and were prepared for a lot of what we experienced, but not really for how much it would influence our vacation.A couple of really good points...The facility is beautiful; the grounds are immaculate, the room is spacious, and I slept like the dead while we were there. The place is so quiet and dark at night that you can't help but sleep well. A note...you want to be careful when you are getting up to use the restroom in the middle of the night. Get your bearings before you make your way there. It is so dark in the room (which I loved) that you can't see your hand in front of your face. I was a bit fearful of falling down the steps into the sunken living room. I might have brought a small flashlight with me had I know just how dark it was going to be. Also, the lights in the hallways of the building are shut down at night, so if you leave your room while it's still dark in the morning (like we did to get an early pickup for our only excursion to Sanoa Island), be careful! You will have a hard time making it out of the building without some assistance.The beach is gorgeous; the Punta Cana Princess has one of the nicest stretches of beach in the area. The water was a bit chilly, but definitely refreshing and easy to get used to. It is still the Atlantic Ocean, so you will get waves, hence, no snorkeling! The waves were actually pretty intense at times, but I was still able to go out pretty deep. The staff of the resort is very friendly; some speak English, many don't. Learning a little Spanish goes a long way at this resort. Just having a couple of phrases in my repetoire was very helpful and much appreciated. The animacion team was a bit annoying, especially when we were trying to nap on the beach beds. My boyfriend was happily napping one day and was interupted by the shrieks of the animacion team trying to get people to play soccer on the beach). The excursion that we took to Sanoa Island was amazing. This was well worth the extra $100/person. The boat ride out was great, the time on the beach was great, even the bus ride was amazing.On to the bad stuff...the food. We had read that the food was not good. I had no idea. Like someone else who recently reviewed this place, when we got to the Punta Cana airport and saw Wendy's we stuffed ourselves and I almost cried with how good it was to taste something good. I found myself relying a lot on the pasta station at the buffet (which was mediocre) and I ate a lot of bread. The specialty restaurants were horrible. My boyfriend ordered filet mignon, and it was 90% fat. The loaded baked potato was a joke, and the wine is not good. We both got sick (not sure if was from food at Mare Nostrum or the fact that the bartenders wash out the blenders with water from the tap) on our vacation, and while it didn't ruin the vacation, it put a huge damper on it. We came back from vacation not really feeling de-stressed, because much of our vacation was spent being sick and/or worrying about being sick. For this, and this alone, I would not return to this resort and would be hesitant to return to the DR at all.

<Content>Could be world class, but the food is horrible! I need to start off by saying this could be a world class hotel. The rooms are great, large, clean, good a/c, roomy bathroom, with no issues with water temp in the nice shower, and great pressure as well. The daily housekeeping was nice, and included a late nite turndown service as well. the mini bar is a great asset as well, stocked daily with soda and beer. The beach is awesome, and is one of my favorites, they have it being cleaned all day, white sand, blue water, nice waves. the vip package includes the use of the beach beds and they are great too, you can even have drinks brought to you by the waiter, though the bar is close and quicker to use.No issues with getting towels, there seemed to be plenty. The grounds and pool are well kept, and very nice, many people working on the upkeep all day, they really do a nice job. Internet access is available in the lobby, starting at 9am and is included free in the vip package, they give you a 20 minute pass code daily, though most days i got a few no problem. We dont stay up too late, so cant say much about the entertainment, karaoke one night was fun, and our friend went to the sister resort next door for a show they said was great and included fireworks. Check in and out was a breeze, very helpful, friendly, and courtious staff for the most part, though language can be a bit of a stumbling point at times, and chalenging at others, But I am a visitor, so not too many points off for that. So Jay you ask, whats up with 2 stars?? the place sounds wonderful! OK, now it gets ugly... Judi and I travel 3 times a year to all inclusives at least, we've do not go away for the food, we go for beach and fun, we usually ignore reviews about food complaints because we've never had an issue, until this place. The two ala cart restaurants we ate at for dinner were just ok, and only open for dinner, the breakfast and lunch buffets were just plain weak to gross, no better, seriously, just plain nasty, though thebeach buffet/grill I have to admit was nasty times 2. In the airport on the way home,, we ran to Wendys for a burger because we were so hungry, and i must say it was soooo good! In fact we then had pizza next door as well, we were stuffed, it was like we hadnt eaten in a week! OOOPS, we realized we actually ate at least 30 cheese sandwiches between us throughout the week for breakfast, and lunch, and snacks too. I publicly apologise to all the reviewers, and complainers that in my mind Ive character assinated, I now feel your pain, Must be Karma.LOL Hey, did i mention the wine? YUK! We are really easy people to pleas when it comes to wine, although we like fine wine, at home we we enjoy fairly cheap, though good stuff, Im telling you the house wines they serve are positivly disgusting, undrinkable, did i mention nasty? You can purchase other wines, but only at dinner at the ala cart restaurants, $22 a bottle for a cheap mondavi sav blanc, hey we drink it at home. so not too bad. They will make you sign for the bottle, no cash accepted at the restaurants, you know why? cause they add $6 to the price called a convience fee, what is that? $28 dollars a bottle, oh well, at least we got to enjoy a glass of wine with our newly made friends. Well at least I could also drink a nice absolute on the rocks right? Not so fast, hmm, this tasts funny, kinda like lighter fluid.. the manager was kind enough to get a new bottle for me though, and after sniffing both admitted there was a problem with the bottle at the bar, LOL caught ya filling the good bottles with the bad booze! any way, he let me keep the new bottle, which I tipped the bartender well to only pour for me. Ya know, I could go on ang on, which I have ,and now Im done, will we return to the PCP, not even if it was free! Unless they fire the and fix the food and beverage dept.

<Content>Great time at the Princess We have just returned from the Punta Cana Princess having spent a wonderful week with 6 of our friends. We have been to this hotel on 3 previous occasions and again were not disappointed. There is nothing negative to say about the whole holiday from our point of view. If you are looking to go to a big resort, walk for miles to get to the beach, bar, restaurants or your room, line up at the buffet and bar and like the disco at night, then this is not the resort for you.The Princess has 270 rooms so everything you need is close at hand. The beach is beautiful and the pool is well maintained. All the lounge chairs are comfortable and plenty and there is lots of shade.The food is good and the bars stock premium liquor for Regency Club guests. The other Princess resorts have a la carte restaurants that are available to the PCP visitors but we have found that they are no better than the 3 at the PCP.What sets the PCP apart we believe are the incredibly good staff. They are the friendliest people that we have found in all our travels. Year after year they remember us and there doesn't seem to be much staff turnover.There have been many improvements since our last visit to the beach bar area and the lobby is now undergoing a renovation. The hotel is 5 years old and it appears that mangement is working to keep everything in good repair.This may not be the place for the very young who can get bored easily but for us retired people it's the perfect place to relax, enjoy the beach and the company of our friends.Ron  Judy Toronto

<Content>Poor Customer Service Then the adventure continues, we arrived at the resort and had absolutely no complaints, well except that the maid left a dirty towel that she cleaned with on our dresser, which was most disgusting, and the room had a bad smell to it, which is really not much compared to the following events:On December 2, 2008, our last full day/night of our vacation, around 4:30 p.m., the hotel entertainment staff washaving a game at the pool. The game consisted of people walking around the pool perimeter with eggs (not hollowed out, nor were they hard boiled) the eggs were carried on a spoon, which the spoon was held by their mouth. The staff did not have anyone cleaning up the eggs that fell off the spoons during or immediately after the game. My boyfriend was walking in the pool area to go back and retrieve belongings left at our chair by the pool. As he was walking around the pool he stepped on and slipped on a broken egg resulting from said activity. He slipped and fell hurting his back. After we returned to the room and took a hot shower in hopes of soothing some of the pain resulting from the fall. After showering he was still in excruciating pain. We walked up to the guest services to report the incident, as we were reporting it the woman at the desk phoned someone (I believe Diana the guest service manager), speaking in Spanish, not knowingly that he understands and speaks Spanish as well. She was asked by Diana what nationality we were. We then reported the accident, filled out a accident report form, and was told to wait for the Diana to come out and speak with us, we were then told to wait again for the doctor to arrive. After the doctor arrived we proceeded to go to the medical facility for an examination of the injured area. He was examined and then given a shot, which knocked him out for theevening. The doctor informed us that she would call in a few hours to see how he was feeling, and then for him to come the following day to see her, there was no phone call that evening. That evening was completely ruined as we had lots of activities planned for our LAST night on vacation. The next day we went up to guest relations wanting to speak to Diana and the general manager, who stated that he does not speak to guests. Diana told us that he needed to go the hospital to get an XRAY of his back so they could determine whether or not he could travel. They refused to pay for the hospital, after arguing the fact that the injury was a direct result of the resorts entertainment activities, Diana said she would phone the hospital and take care of it. Then came back and said that they would only pay for the cab fare.Our VIP travel representative, Pedro, also met us in the lobby. Pedro was extremely useless as well as rude. He acted as if he was frightened by the manager and would not address any of the problems that we were having. I then spoke to Pedro explaining that Diana said she would take care of the hospital, as I was speaking Pedro turned to my boyfriend totally dismissing as if anything I said did not matter. This vacation was booked and looked forward to immensely. We booked the vacation while my boyfriend was in the hospital having surgery. This vacation was supposed to be OUR time, after he had spent 2 months in the hospital. Our last two days were completely ruined, and quite a disappointment and the resort and VIP did nothing to try to resolve the issue, nor did they apologize or show any concern for our situation.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess - Superb!!!!!!!!!!! November 4 to November 14 - Punta Cana Princess My girlfriend, Cyndie and I, (The Maineacs), just returned from another super fantastic vacation to the Dominican Republic, this time at Punta Cana Princess, Nov. 4 to Nov. 14. This was our ninth trip to the DR, and 2nd time to a Princess Resort (1st was Bavaro Princess).. First year at the Iberostar Costa Dorado in Puerta Plata, second year at Bavarro Princess in Punta Cana, third year at the Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus in Bayahibe, fourth year at the Iberostar Punta Cana. Fifth year at Casa del Mar. Sixth year at Sunscape the Beach. Seventh year at Punta Cana Grand. Eight year at Casa del Mar. Read on to get some pointers on the resort. Thanks to all who gave input in helping us decide where to go (Especially Lea).Flight/Airport We are from Maine, and our trip departed from Boston on American Airlines. We took the bus from Portland, ME and it drops you off right at your terminal. Worked out great Our vacation was booked through Vacation Travel Mart, and Beth Miller again found us the best deal anywhere, for the ninth straight year. No one has come close to their prices, plus you accumulate mileage, which we will use next year for our 2nd free trip!!!!!!!  We were able to use the check-in kiosk at Logan and it took us 5 minutes to check in. Glad we didn't get to the airport 2 hours ahead of time. Flight down was thru San Juan and flight back was thru JFK. Flights were all on time.Arrival in DR Arrived in Punta Cana and we were met by our tour representative from Caribe. Had one other couple on our van and we dropped them off first, Took about 30 minutes. Nice new van.Check-in No wait whatsoever. No large tour (Apple, etc.) was checking in. No greeting drink!! Who cares. I had a drink in my had from the lobby bar right away. No charge for room safe - yeah!!! We thought we had VIP but I didn't ask then. We were on 3rd floor of Bldg. 4 facing pool and ocean. Fantastic room and view. Cathederal ceiling. Luggage was whisked away to our room, and by the time we arrived at our room the bags were right behind. As to VIP, the only thing I cared about was the gourmet dinner at La Cava and the internet access.Room Room was fantastic. AC worked great, always on - they had a card in the wall switch. The best hot water and water pressure of all our trips to date. Coffee pot in room. Everything was perfect. No bugs. When I saw that there were no bottles of liquor I figured out that there must have been a mix-up. Later that night I emailed Beth miller at Vacation Travel Mart telling her that I thought we didn't get VIP. The next day our room phone rings and it is Beth!!! She had called the front desk and corrected the mix-up and we had our VIP. She also said that because of the mix-up she bought us a private dinner on the beach!!!!! Talk about fantastic service. None better!!!!!They were all set to move us into Bldg. 5, etc., but we were all settled and we loved our room. We went to the front desk and tols them we were all set, and they gave us our new wrist bands, and cards for massage, inernet and gourmet dinner. We were all set!!!!!!! Beach As many of you know, you can walk for miles to the left or right. Not as calm and clear as CDM, but always kept clean. Did miss the snorkeling somewhat, but we became pool Maineacs for this trip. No major problems getting a palapa or bed if you wanted. We didn't use a bed at all. I was in the water (pool bar) all the time Always stayed at the palapa closest to the pool bar.  Pool It was fantastic and large with sloped gradual entry at each end. Brought our own floats. Nelson at the pool bar was the best. Every time I would turn around he would have another drink ready for me. What a guy!!!!!Food The best food overall that we have had to date. Buffet was great. Seafood night was super. Fantastic fish and sushi. We probably ate half of our dinners at the buffet, it was that good. The ala carte restaurants!!!! Since you didn't have to sign up to eat there, and you could eat there as many times as you like, this made for great dining. We didn't find a bad thing to say about any of them. (Mexican) - Great. As other have said - the filet, the filet, the filet!!!!!!!!!!!!! And many margaritas!!! (Gourmet) La Cava (next door at Caribe) - Maybe the best ala cart restaurant for food and atmosphere that we have ever had in the Dominican Republic. It is like going into a wine cellar. Food was exquisite. I had snapper and Cyndie had duck (quack, quack). Just fantastic(Seafood) mare Nostrum - This was also great. The appetizer was to die for. Very simple. Shrimp broiled in a butter sauce. We were there asking for more bread so we could sop up the remaining butter sauce. We definetly took an extra cholestrol pill that night!!Dinner on the beach/wedding gazebo!!!!! About as goog as it gets. Appetizer was again simple but delicious. Large avacado filled with shrimp with a Romalade (sp?) Sauce. We almost got filled just eating that. Then we had steak (filet) and lobster. Great bottle of wine, or was it two??Julius (Julio) Caesar was our waiter. Great guy. He also worked lunch and dinner at Mare Nostrum.Had a great beach party on Tues?? It was all great but they had all the food on tables in one long line, which made for a long line of people waiting. If they had it broken up in stations then it would have been better. Drink What can I say. Anything and everything you want - just ask. Top shelf drinks aren't a high priority for us, but when it is available, we will and did partake. Caiprinha's. and many Manhattan's ;-) Had any drink or liquor that you could think of. If you thought the drinks were too weak, just ask for more ron. They will give it to you with a smile. Met a nice gentlemen from Toronto(via England) at the lobby bar and he was sipping on a Scotch. So asked him what kind, he said Johnny Walker Black, and I said that sounds great. So I was sipping on many of these the rest of our stay. Staff Everyone was wonderful, friendly, and always going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Maids were great. Fridge always restocked each day. Animation team. They were great kids, but with this being an adults only, they could do without the constant chatter. Also at night in the lobby, they would show up and try and entertain. One night they had a piano player/singer which was great, and another night they had a band and singers which was great. Until the animation team would get involved and try to singBADLY.. If they just kept the piano player and band it would have been great. Never made it next door for entertainment. We were there to relax and unwind, and we did. Hi to all the people we met from afar Okla., Canada (all over - especially Palsmom), PA, England, and Ireland. I think we Americans were in the minority, which is fine with us. It lets us meet more people from away.Flight back No problem at the airport. Flew through JFK, We arrived back late in Boston and we stayed at a local hotel, and took the bus back to cold Maine the next morning. So sad to leave. We would go back to this resort in a minute. Maybe even next year!!Overall it was another fantastic trip to the DR. We never made it to any of the local bars to meet up with some of you. We just vegged out and lost all sense of time. We were on vacation to decompress, and we surely did that. As usual, please email or PM us if you have any questions. Photos will be up in a couple of weeks on Webshots.

<Content>A nice resort ..... with room for improvement The resort is a perfect size if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing holiday. The beach is spectacular and the pool is huge for such a small resort. Always ample chairs and beds. We had the upgrade package which was a nice touch, especially when it came to alcohol - Absolut, Smirnoff, MGD and Bailey's. The staff is wonderful. It truly was a nice vacation. Our only complaint - the food! You'd never go hungry but meals were hit or miss at both the buffet and a la cartes.

<Content>Nice Resort Stayed at PCP Nov.17-22,2008 . VIP Package, got bathrobe, slipers, fruit basket, bottle of rum and cigars. I had requested a room in buld. 5 and got room # 5003. Nice room close to the beach and pool. never a problem with towels. The mini fridge was always stocked and extra bottled water left in the room. The bed was always turned down at night. The housekeeping staff was wonderful. TV had NBC, ABC Showtime, HBO etc. came in handy when it rained. The weather was warm sunny and beautiful, with a nice breeze for most of the trip. It did rain one evening and most of the following day.The entertainment staff did a very good job at keeping us occupied and having fun. They set up dart game, Bingo, we had all types of board games, dancing etc. They set up in the lobby during the bad weather. In the evening, they had lite entertainment, Music, Karoke. You could take a shuttle to the big stage at the Caribe Princess for the nightly show, or to the Tower Casino. Went to the Tower Casino one nite and won aprox. $40. It is a nice sized venue. Didn't go to the Arieto Disco, if you choose to go, they will bring you there.Food I always found something I liked. Tried the Fondue Restraunt liked it. How often do I have fondue (never). Loved the Asian buffet. Enjoyed Lobster at the Seafood Restaraunt. The Mare Nostrum on the beach had a lovely brekfast each morning in addition to the buffet.Nice pool with swim-up bar. There were plenty of chairs and bali beds both at the pool and the beach. Love the beach the water has waves but they aren't too big. I found the beach clean, nice soft light sand.The PCP is on the quite side. I would've liked a bit more entertainment at the resort ,but all in all it was a very nice vacationIn addition, if you check out late and leave your luggage in the luggage room, lock your bags or take money and valuables with you. I was due to be picked up at 2:45 PM. The hotel was kind enought to let me shower in a courtesy suite and keep my bags in a locked room so I could enjoy the pool and sun for a few more hours. This was greatly appriceated. I had a large beach bag where I put the clothes to wear after the shower, my travel doucments and money were in a zippered pouch from the TA. I left the pouch in the bag with my clothes, I had ment to take it with me but overlooked it.. after my shower I got my luggage gave the bellman a tip and waited for my ride. As I was leaving I was touched by the enthusastic goodbye the bellman gave me. Waving giving thumbs up with a 1000 watt smile. As we were nearing the airport , I opened my pouch to get a tip for the driver, when, I noticed that two $50. bills were gone. I still had about 40 singles and a few $5's and $20's. Now that enthuastic goodbye took on a whole new meaning. Bye Fool. At least I had enough to get home.

<Content>The Low-Budget Honeymoon Our travel agent BEGGED us not to select this resort... but the price was right. We selected quantity over quality. He suggested a short trip to a high-end resort. We got what we paid for.My biggest complaint is that I found the food inedible. I was sick the entire trip, but found out I had gall stones the entire time. My luck! I hated that the restaurants I loved most were closed randomly. The buffet was so nasty, yet always open. I lost 5 lbs by skipping breakfast and lunch for 7 days. The dinners are by far better than the other meals. The drinks to me were super sweet and cheap tasting and we had the honey moon package VIP.Here's what I loved: The room. We had a lovely honeymoon suite overlooking the beach, actually it was ON the beach. We had an amazing TWO patios. We were in Bldg 5 which is actually cooler temp. wise so you may want to request it as it's also right near the beach and pool. We always got a beach bed and seat. The staff is amazing. They are super friendly and helpful - though bring your Spanish dictionary, they speak very little English. Our maid left our room spotless and with the help of some singles every day, she jammed our fridge with waters and soda. Note that the staff works so very hard. They will do anything in their power to make you happy. The place is spotless, the janitorial staff does not stop for a minute. I didn't see one bug in our bathroom or room, this was a big fear for me as I have never been to location like Punta Cana where people warned me of weird tropical bugs. Ha ha!I was bummed that the Internet was constantly down - we lugged our laptop there for nothing. They have what I refer to as fun nazis that run around the pool and beach area trying to get you to do aerobics and other games. I told them I was fat and lazy and just wanted to chill out after planning a wedding for a year. I found out the other guests LOVE the fun squad and so I'm just a cranky American. Speaking of which, we were almost the only Americans. I found everyone who spoke English were from Canada and they were SOOOO nice! The other guests were very helpful and would say hello and chat with you in the pool. We had a blast gabbing with people poolside and my husband loved the bartenders and barflies. There are lots of choices for excursions, though I wasn't into this at all, my husband enjoyed them while I laid around by the pool. It's a nice small resort, you won't get lost or feel overwhelmed with choices. I picked this resort also to escape kids and there weren't any spring breaker types - it was a very relaxing, quiet environment which is what I was seeking.I knew the food was not their best quality so I wasn't expecting anything really. Funny thing is, I'm happy with TGI Friday's and Applebees, I'm by no means a gourmet - but it was just icky. The fondue was a big big let down - even the onion soup was nasty. Oh well. Stick with Tex Mex and the Seafood place. We loved La Cava which is at the other resort. That was great!

<Content>Don't use the ATM at the resort and cancel your card if you did! This review will definately be tainted based on a bad experience, but rightly so. My husband and I stayed at the resort from September 27-October 3 and overall had a good time, but found everything about the DR, including this resort to be sketchy. We both used the ATM at the resort several times during our stay as no one would take a credit card for anything - shops, excursions, etc. In the past week, BOTH of our checking accounts have been cleaned out with fradulant ATM withdrawls in foreign countries. We have separate accounts and never use the same ATMs for withdrawls except for this one. Basically the resort machine was hacked and our account numbers and pins were stolen and it would have been an inside job. Oh, and either housekeeping or airport staff stole my husband's electric shaver and belt.We are definately left with a bad taste in our mouths, but wished it would have been a better trip in the first place. On the plus side, we met some great people and had a lot of fun with them. Our room was big and clean and we had a pool view. The beach was pretty and the excursions we went on were nice. The bar and restaurant staff were really friendly and nice as well. We had a very lovely private beach dinner for our anniversary. I think we would have found these things though or had hoped to find them at any resort and unfortunately nothing stood out as outstanding and the bad things really stood out., beyond the theft. I will list out a few:1. The ala carte restaurants were hardly open - only one at once and I don't think the Italian place ever opened. And you couldn't plan ahead because it was never listed which would be open when anywhere.2. They shut down the seafood restaurant on the beach while we were there and started constuction on a new restaurant closer to the beach. We were treated to bright lights, bulldozers and LOUD noises on the beach day and night - not very relaxing.3. The buffet food was edible, but not necessarily good. 4. The salespeople on the terrace each night were beyond annoying. 5. It was inconvenient and it turns out costly that the gift shop, excursion representative, and dive shop on the resort would not take credit cards - cash only. I think many of these things are the case at most all-inclusive resorts and that you get what you pay for. We've stayed at a Secrets in Mexico and a Couples in Jamaica which are top of line resorts and did not find these problems at all. So, I don't even know if I would have posted this review before the ATM theft because the resort isn't marketed as a 4-star or superior resort. I am surprised so many others have posted such glowing reviews here and that it ranks so highly.

<Content>Totally pleasant, totally comfortable resort Just returned from a week's stay at the Punta Cana Princess resort. Overall, it was a great week. The resort is lovely and met all of my expectations.Check-in and check-out were a breeze. Couldn't have asked for a quicker or more efficient process. During the week, all of the writing on my wristband wore away, but there was no problem having it replaced (I believe the continuous spray sunscreens were the culprit). Other than that, I didn't need to speak with the front desk all week, so really can't comment on how they handle true crises.Bell services were also excellent. My suitcase was delivered and picked up promptly.Maid service was excellent. I'm sure it helps to leave that little marker in your key slot, so they know when you're in your room and when you're out. Plenty of towels were provided (no wash cloths), extras when requested, and plenty of bottled water provided. I did not drink the sodas/beer from the minibar, so don't know how quickly they would have been replenished. Only one very minor maintenance issue in the room - a burnt out lightbulb in the bathroom. I left a note about it before leaving for dinner, and it was replaced before I returned to the room for the night.Room decor is simple...almost stark. Plenty of storage. Bed was comfy, and the day bed in the living room was a nice place to relax. Bathroom was fine. Double sinks I guess is considered an upscale feature, but it left minimal counter space. I'd have rather had the counter space. Shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and lotion all provided.Grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The patio area around the pool is hosed down and scrubbed each morning, and the pool is meticulously cleaned each morning, as well. Public restrooms were also very clean. The deck area attached to the Mare Nostrum bar was a wonderful place to hang out - very comfy seating, lovely atmosphere.Beach was great. Not sure how full the resort was, but there were always plenty of chairs available, even if you showed up late. not sure when the palapas were claimed, but, unless you really need one in the front row, you could show up at 9:30 and still find one. I never made it over to the beach beds - really preferred the palapa/ chair arrangement and that you could sit up to read. The beds seemed popular, though. Surf was gentle enough but big enough for some fun. There were some strands of sea grass floating, for those of you who don't like that.Did not go in the pool and only spent two hours on my final morning in one of the pool chairs. Seemed like the younger guests gravitated to the pool.Food was, overall, pretty good. There were a few things that were not the best, but overall, pretty well done. I had most of my breakfasts and lunches at the beach buffet - Mare Nostrum. Limited selection, but plenty enough. Dinner buffets at the main restaurant were good - went to the Mexican and Asian. Also tried three of the four a la cartes - Rio Grande Tex Mex, Fondue and Mare Nostrum. All were good meals. The steak at Rio Grande was actually pretty excellent. There were late night snacks at Mare Nostrum but never made it down there to check it out. Didn't use room service at all.Drinks were good, overall. There was a little shack right on the beach or you could go to the bar at Mare Nostrum. There was also the lobby bar and pool bar. There's a bar in the large buffet restaurant, but I believe that's only a service bar - not for guests. Remember - if the drink isn't strong enough for you, ask for more rum....it's gladly poured.Service was outstanding. Always with a smile. Special kudos to Santa at Mare Nostrum and Yenny, bar waitress at Mare Nostrum and lobby bar. Lovely women, both. Santa is a mother hen sort, always making sure I had the drink(s) I needed, table setting, etc. Entertainment - the Animacion team worked very hard to get guests involved, especially during the day. But, it became a little annoying when they would just not let it go, when it was clear that no one was interested in what they were offering. Please don't sit down on my beach chair and try to talk me into doing something I really don't want to do... when I'm very clearly not interested. I know they have to try, but..... it's a minor complaint. No big deal. Evening shows were not much. Karaoke a few times, some games, some music. I guess for the real shows, you have to go next door. But, I found the little trolley system to be lacking. Trolleys were infrequent, and the drivers were kinda surly, except for the one I got on the last night - Gabino. The little pathways that the trolley takes are really dark, and kinda spooky. There's one spot, on the way to the casino, where you pass through a back stage area where there was always a bunch of men hanging out, not doing a whole lot.... nothing bad happened other than feeling uncomfortable, as a woman traveling alone.My biggest complaint about the resort is that it is soooooo dark. The lighting along the pathways is just not sufficient. And, after returning to the resort late one night, the lamp posts had been shut off - no lighting whatsoever. This is a very quiet, very sleepy resort. If you're into late night partying, look elsewhere. The guests were of all ages, but probably leaning towards the 50+ range. There were a couple of groups of younger couples who seemed to be able to create their own party, so that was good for them. But otherwise, the resort really isn't conducive to socializing with other guests, so everyone either turns in early or leaves the premises.Overall, I give the resort a thumbs-up. Was torn as to whether I should give it 3 or 4 circles but settled on 4, because what they did, they did well. No reason not to return, but not sure I will, with so many other resorts to try. Would depend a lot on who I'm traveling with, I guess.

<Content>Great vacation at Punta Cana Princess We just returned from a weeks stay at the Punta Cana Princess Resort  Spa. We have been to other resort areas in the Dominican Republic, but had never been to Punta Cana.Of all the resort choices in Punta Cana, Punta Cana Princess met a few of our top criterias- less then 300 rooms, adults only, and more then 1 a la carte dinner options. We were very pleased with our choice.The rooms are decent sized. We had a king size bed, but 2 double beds are an option. There were plenty of drawers and the closet was double sized making it possible to unpack and not live out of a suitcase. Two steps down from the bed area is the seating area with a daybed, coffee table, a chest with the minifridge  tv, and sliders to the balcony. The bathroom has a double sink vanity with the tub/shower combo. The tiling/vanity in the bathroom appeared updated, but the tub itself was, in my opinion, old and in need of updating. They should consider ripping the tubs out to make it a large walk-in shower or replace the tubs with ones that are actually deep enough for someone over 5鈥?鈥?to have a proper soak. We never had a problem with water temperature or pressure. In general the room/bathroom was in good condition and the housekeepers did a fantastic job keeping it clean and well stocked.Personal observations about the room- I HATE flat sheets instead of fitted sheets! Nothing feels worse then waking up in the middle of the night wrapped up in the sheets and your arms/legs/both are itching from the mattress pad. Our 2nd floor room had a very musty smell pretty much 24/7 even with the AC running, but I find that typical in many of the resorts I have stayed in. From past experineces I now travel with a scented candle or a glade plug-which cures the problem. I also found the clothes in the closet were getting the same musty smell so the travel size bottle of Febreeze I brought with me went quickly.Dining- as I mentioned one of the reason we chose PCP was because it offers 4 a la carte restaurants on site as well as the others at the sister resorts. I don鈥檛 mind buffet for breakfast or even lunch, but I much prefer a la carte for dinner. The a la cartes at PCP do not require reservations. Twice we walked in and sat right away, two other times we had about 45 minutes to wait. A 45 minute wait is not bad except your waiting options for the Tex Mex  Italian are.. loiter in front of the restaurant, go to the lobby bar and if you are lucky you may find an empty chair/couch, or walk around. I think it would be a great addition if there were chairs outside the restaurants so people could comfortably sit and wait- which is what they have at the sister resort. At Mare Nostrum and the Swiss you can get a drink at the Mare Nostrum bar which seemed to have plenty of seating. Of the 4 a la cartes at PC, Mare Nostrum was our favorite. Our second favorite was the Italian. We also ate at the Tex-Mex which was good, but the other 2 just happened to be better. We did not try the Swiss.At the sister resort we ate at both gourmet restaurants. You have to make reservations at least a day in advance. We booked both our reservations the day after we arrived. Because it was 鈥渙ff season鈥?and rather then having both gourmet restaurant open, the La Cava restaurant alternated its menu with El Pescadors. El Pescador (with tax) was $32 per person and La Cava $35 per person. Both were a great dining experience- the menu and food presentation was definitely gourmet as well as delicious. The service was top notch. It was well worth the extra money. Some people may argue that being an all inclusive resort one should not have to pay for gourmet food... well my feeling is that everyone does what they like to do on vacation. I personally would prefer to spend $35 for fabulous dining experience rather then any amount of money for a parasail or banana boat ride. To each their own. And that is why I am so happy that the Princess resorts have the gourmet surcharge restaurants as an option- I think more all inclusive resorts should do the same!We did not try any of the other restaurants at the sister resorts- just not enough nights!Comments on dining at PCP- the main buffet for breakfast and lunch had plenty to offer. I never walked away from a meal hungry. However, I think at a resort this size, that caters to adults only, and is rated as well as it is, Mare Nostrum may be more suited as an a la carte for breakfast and omit the buffet at lunch offering more grill food items. The resort property is beautiful. It is well kept and has a very natural, tropical feel. The lobby is a great place to have drinks before or after dinner. There is a well stocked gift shop and if you are planning to shop at the airport on your return, don鈥檛 count on it! Limited shopping at the Punta Cana airport鈥?you are better off shopping at your resort- either at the gift shop or down the beach at the vendors. The spa and fitness center facilities are nice. However, I did not use any of the fitness equipment because they do not open til 8am! I was up and ready to work out by 7am and for the week stuck to power walks. Waiting til 8am to workout would have meant a late breakfast and a late start to my beach reading days! A 50 minute massage was $80.The beach is gorgeous! You could walk either direction for a very long distance. I loved that! Although we had acess to the beach beds we never used them鈥?in our opinion they were way too close together and unless you draped towels on the side, provided little shade. But most of the week they were all being used which verifies their popluarity. We prefer to spread out and have a little personal space and there are lots of huts and shade from palm trees. However, if we wanted a front row hut, we had to go down and save one by 7:30am. In the paper work that you are given at check-in it says you can hold chairs for 30 minutes. My husband and I took turns getting a hut and waiting there for the other to return from their walk and then we would go to breakfast. We saw many huts being saved with personal belongings and the people not showing up til mid-late morning, hours beyond the 30 minute time allowance.... which noone was enforcing anyway.We spent all day at the beach. We were pleasantly surprised and impressed with the beach bar service. The bartender/server Jose was one busy man.. but he had a great system and I think for once we were served at our chairs more often then we had to go to the bar ourselves. Jose not only makes the drink, he serves them. No back up whatsoever! We have had beach service at other resorts where there is a bartender and server(s) and they could not even compare to Jose鈥檚 one man show! The pool area is lovely, but we are beach people. Whenever we walked by it was pretty busy and in the afternoon it seemed to get more lively and social. We did notice that there was hut/bed saving along the pool as well. It appears there is less shade poolside so people were up and saving huts/beds earlier then at the beach.Since we are exhausted by full days of sun and reading, we did not take advantage of the night life. On site at PCP there is no night life.. although one night there was a band set up in the lobby... so the resort is very quiet  peaceful which was perfect for us. You can take a short 鈥渟huttle鈥?ride to the sister resort for the nightly show which start at 9:45pm. Unless you want a front row seat, don鈥檛 plan to arrive much before 10pm, you will save yourself 15-20 minutes of introductions in 3-4 different languages! The casino  disco are also a shuttle ride away.Other then taking out the Hobie Cat ($11 to get 鈥渁pproved鈥?by waterports), we did not participate in any organized activities or tours. For those who want to be more active, there are enough things offered to keep you entertained.A most often discussed topic- tipping. We choose to tip for good service we receive rather then tip with hopes of getting better service. The service at PCP is great! So we did a fair amount of tipping thru out the resort. All the staff members we interacted with were exceptionally friendly. Considering there were staff members working the breakfast/lunch buffet and then later that night you would see them at an a la carte restaurant with the same big smile is pretty incredible. Whomever is in charge of the staff at PCP is doing a great job with employee morale. We were quite impressed. ( a quick thanks to Diana in Guest Services who replied to my many email questions!)Overall it was great vacation. We would definitely return to PCP.

<Content>LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! Three of us just returned home from 10 days at the Punta Cana Princess and we all loved it.Property - Was just the right size, not large but not too small. The hotel was at full capacity, but it never felt full. It was easy to walk through the property and not feel cramped. We used the facilities at the sister property too, the Caribe Club and it was too big. You had to take a trolley from the lobby to the restaurants and beach.Staff - they were all super friendly, everyone says Hola! And are genuinely excited to see you. Lots of fun activities and the animation team is great!Food - We all enjoyed the food, even the buffet was good. there are 4 a la carte restaurants. Tex Mex was ok, Fondue was fun, Pasta was amazing, and the Mediterranean I recommend the grilled lobster.Beach - Was beautiful!!! We made it down to the beach between 930-10 every day and still got a cabana. For the best boogie boarding, walk down the beach about 10 minutes and the waves are awesome!Over all we loved it and i would go back in a heartbeat!

<Content>It's what you make of it Well, I read reviews for months prior to my group of 6 going to PCP from 11/6 - 11/15/08. The range of comments and ratings really boils down to it's what you make of it. It is not a 5 star resort, and it's not priced that way. If you are an entertainment, food, or beverage critic, you will have plenty to write about. The best advice I can give is get the VIP Package that gives you the premium drinks. ASK FOR the Baily's, Tanqueray Gin or what ever you want. They did not have Grey Goose Vodka. The cigars in the room are OK. Don't plan on drinking the rum they give you in the room. If you go to the bar to get juices, you mught as well have them make the drinks. It's all included anyway.The rooms and resort is kept very clean. That was great. The beach is great and we loved the beach beds, that they also have at the pool by the way. Be sure to schedule your dinners at the different restaurants. Those that complain about the food or the fact that they only ate at the buffets, just didn't make the reservations correctly. You can only make them 1 day in advance, but it's worth it to just be in different places each night. The walks to the other resorts are fun. keep in mind you are in the Caribbean, and look at the stars. They are beautiful!My opinion is that the resort is fine. Great beach, everything is clean, and the food is OK. There is plenty to do with Banana Rides, boat rides, Kayaks, Para-Sailing, ATV and other excursions. Going out of the resort was not fun. Actually it is a little scary. We went to the Casino 3 nights, and even that ride passes an area that make you feel like someone might jump you and take your money. It's a very poor country, and the roads and local housing are terrible.Would I go back? Probably not. But the biggest reason is I am more of a ben there, done that kind of guy. (Except for Vegas)If you are booked and are reading this, GO. Enjoy the beach and pool, get the VIP package and be sure to ask for the good stuff. Just don't expect too much. Again, you will get what you paid for. It's actually a really good deal.

<Content>Nice resort, terrible food. This appearence of this resort is excellent! Most of the staff is great. The food was not that good. The best meal I had all trip was at Wendy's at the Punta Cana Airport. My wife and I both got sick on our 3rd day there. I can only attribute it to the food since we had not drank much at all. I will definentally go back to Punta Cana but not to the Princess resort.

<Content>First Time to the Caribbean We have recently returned home from our first trip to the Caribbean, and our first experience with an all inclusive. We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess Oct 23- Nov 6 and loved the fact that it was small, very clean, very friendly, beautiful beach, staff absolutely wonderful and friendly. We appreciated that it was quiet later in the night, knowing that if we wanted more excitement we just had to go next door to the sister hotels. The Food: We are not picky eaters, and found the food to be good. The a la carte restaurants were delicious, no complaints. The buffets had various theme nights and if you weren't particular on that theme nights food, there was still always plenty to eat with the standard pasta, salad, ect food bars.The room: We were very fortunate to have room 5114, the view was beautiful from our balcony, and we enjoyed it everyday! We could view the beach to the left and the pool to the right. The room itself is spacious and was always attended to thanks to the lovely maids we had. They always cleaned our room, turned down our bed at night and kept our fridge full of water and coke lite, which is exactly what we liked. The beach: Like I said absolutely beautiful and clean. The workers did a wonderful job at keeping it clean, the beach beds were a nice touch. My husband and I enjoyed the long walks along the beach both day and night. When you went left up the beach there were shop sellers and they were pretty good at not hustling you, which was a wonderful change from what we found out when going to the Bravaro Shopping Plaza. We lasted 20 minutes there and caught a cab quickly back, due to the constant barrage of hustling, not something we were at all used to! If you walked right of the PCP there was plenty of beach to walk as well, but beware of the woman selling hair braiding not a pleasant experience either as I so found out, while having my hair braided.Tours: We took 2 tours while there - The Bravaro Runners Safari Tour. What a wonderful day this was. We lucked out with a wonderful bunch of tourists on our safari truck. If you want to see how these wonderful people actually live, what the schools look like, and enjoy a little bit of everything, like seeing a sugar cane field, a cigar factory, where they grow and make coffee and cocoa, go horseback riding then this is the tour for you. The tour guides were very nice and very infomative. Thanks Andy and Adam! Our second tour was Zip lining. We enjoyed this tour as well. My husband had never been zip lining and I think this was a great beginner zip line tour. Having done the one in Mexico in Puerto Vallarta, it didn't quite measure up for me, but still a good tour none the less. The staff: All that we met and conversed with (even though our spanish was very limited) were above and beyond! Very helpful, friendly and enjoyable. We made a few new friends and wish them all the best. We will miss you all! Thanks to Luis, Nelson, Jose Doria, Grisdelda, our lovely maids - sorry didn't catch your names and the many other waiter and waitresses!In closing we would definately go back to this resort, and will definitely recommend it to all our friends and family! We will cherish our experience there and take home with us many happy wonderful memories!

<Content>Absolutely Awesome Vacation!!! Recently spent FANTASTIC 2 weeks there, Oct. 5 - 19. I just had to write a review after reading that one from Rhode Island. Honestly I had to check their review to make sure it was the same place! I couldn't belive the bad experience when ours was just unbelievable.I too did months of research and reading of reviews on different DR resorts and decided on Punta Cana Princess because it was the one with the most consistent great reviews, also it was smaller (270 rooms, and it was Adults Only. We were not disappointed one iota. Check in went fast, got the nice cold drink, but no wash cloth (big whoop - needed the drink more). Room was as requested and paid for - ocean view in building 5, also right near the pool. Mini-bar was not in our room on check in (bottle of rum, vodka, whiskey), mentioned it to guest services next day - was in our room before we got back to it. Food was excellent, whether in buffet or a la cartes. We did take a tablespoon of Pepto Bismal every morning as I had seen suggested and neither of us had the tourista trots or any nausea at all. Breakfast there is many, many things to chose from, made to order omelettes, scrambled/hard boiled eggs, yogurt, boxed cereals and always pancakes/french toast. Of course there were some things on the dinner/lunch buffet menus that didn't appeal so we just stayed away from them, but there was always so much to choose from we never had any problems. There was always a great pasta bar. I didn't care for the milk only because it is the boxed, sterilized kind and I couldn't get use to the taste. Honestly never had a bad meal and we are used to eating in some very good places. There is fish offered and also lobster, both at the a la cartes and at the buffet. Salmon at one a la carte and grilled lobster at both - they are the Carribean lobster tails so much smaller.Facecloths - don't know why they don't readily supply these but I had also read about this before leaving so packed a couple to take and used them instead of worrying about asking for them all the time. Staff was just great - don't worry about the language they know enough English to help or someone else does, or sign lanuage goes a long way. Our maid service was terrific, we did tip $2 a day which we left on the bathroom vanity beside the water we used for brushing teeth and 9 out of 10 times got an extra big bottle of water in the bathroom, besides the 2 always left in the fridge. We drank the drinks, ate the salads - they are supposed to have a purified water system and we did see huge bags of ice delivered - again we never had any GI problems and neither did anyone we talked to, honestly, and they weren't even doing the Pepto Bismal thing!Place is kept amazingly clean and if you get up early you will see the groundskeeping crew and maids washing and scrubbing the walkways every day. Wait staff at resort very accommodating. Guest services was excellent (especially Adriana) Our original room was on 3rd floor (4 flights of stairs) which we asked to change after 1 week as my husband had knee surgery about 6 weeks earlier and it was getting a bit much for him - we moved to ground floor same day we asked about it, same building, the morning we asked about it.Guest services arranged breakfast in our room the day of our 30th Anniversary and when we returned later in the day it was beautifully decorated, also enjoyed the 'towel swans/hgearts' they made up during our stay.Sorry this is so long, but wanted to let everyone know this was one great place and since our return we have already talked about going back again to this wonderful spot - if you decide to go there I know you will have a great time!Yes there were some vendors on the way to the buffet/restaurantes - ususally just either Friday or Saturday - just say no thanks and keep moving - didn't really interfere with our enjoyment and I understand this is the case at most of the resorts on different nights.If you have any questions I'm happy to answer best I can.

<Content>I won't be returning This place was OK, but as I said in my review title, I will not be returing and I cannot say I'd recommend it. Usually each year my husband and I go on vacation to Couples Negril in Jamaica (where we will be returning for sure, I like it there a thousand times better) but this year wanted to try something new.Here's what I thought of Punta Cana Princess:1) the grounds were very well kept.2) the rooms themselves were nice, better than I expected3) english is sort of a problem for many of the staff members4) the Tex Mex restaurant was decent, the only decent place. But, it is not open each night.5) the buffets were HORRIBLE. Seriously, unedible food. Especially the beach buffet....gag me. Especially the meat. Yuck. Really, really bad.6) the drinks were SUPER weak. I drank three rum drinks in a row and felt zero effect. We watched them pour the drinks, and they were adding plenty of whatever was in the rum bottle. My guess is, when they buy a bottle of booze, they dump half of it into a different bottle, and fill it up with water. Finally, my husband and I went to the gift shop and bought a bottle of rum. We asked the bartenders only for pineapple juice and then we took out our own bottle of rum to add to the juice.7) the beach was pretty nice8) the pool was pretty nice too. Except, at about 3pm, just when everyone wants to relax, they start some horrible music and beging screaming into microphones for people to play water polo, play bingo (this is an all-adults resort, right?) or to do water aerobics. Very annoying. Maybe some people enjoy that. Aerobics, in my opinion, would be an activity better for the morning. In any case, the shouting and screaming into microphones was too much.9) skip the fondue restaurant at all costs.10) they serve wine, or what they call wine, with lunch and dinner. I'm no wine expert or anything, but this wine they serve was extremely bad. I've never tasted anything like it. Both the red and white, awful awful awful.11) internet access in the lobby was very spotty. You can bring your own laptop and pay $15/day for wireless access. I'll give you a hint. You pay the $15 and they give you a user name and password to log on to the network. It's user name mili and password 123456. It did not change the whole time we were there, so don't bother paying $15 each day.12) the weather was great and I got a nice tan :)

<Content>PCP - Mixed Feelings We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess (building #4 - nice room overlooking the pool) during the last week of October.....we have mixed feelings about this hotel.The hotel grounds are lovely, the rooms are clean and neat - the staff works very hard to take care of everything. The bathroom was a big problem......most of the time the water pressure for the toilet was SO BAD that it would never flush! We reported this to guest services but nothing was corrected. The pool and beach are beautiful - that is a big part of our enjoyment on a tropical vacation. We weren't too impressed by the Animacion Team - it was very loud and started at 3 pm each day at the pool. Also, we didn't appreciate the animacion team members approaching us to go to the bar and get them orange juice and beer.......very tacky!! If management of the Princess is reading this you might want to remind these employees that the guests are there to relax - not to be asked to wait on them!!Another disappointment was having to eat at the buffet so many times for dinner because they didn't have the gourmet restaurants open. My husband and I do enjoy the fine dining in the restaurants in the evening and look forward to that. It may have been because the hotel was not full so they don't keep everything open.The majority of the hotel guests were from Germany........we met several couples from the USA and Canada. In general, everyone was very polite.We did like the Adults Only feature at this hotel.......a good place for quiet time!Thank you to Daniela and Nelson at the pool bar for such good service......delicious mamajuana!!This was our fourth trip to the D.R. and we have already been discussing our return but I don't think it will be to the Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>Can't wait to go back!! AWESOME!!!!!! Beautiful, beautiful resort. When my husband and I got there, check in was not even 10 minutes. We were greeted with a nice smile and a cold drink. When we got to our room, within 2 minutes our luggage was there. The grounds are so beautiful. I can't believe how hard the staff work to keep the grounds looking so spectacular. They still manage to smile.The food and drinks were incredible. The white wine looks stronger than it actually is, but it was great.The staff, awesome, awesome. They make you feel sooo welcome. They are constantly going around making sure you are ok. They were great!!!Overall, there is nothing bad to say about this resort. we can't wait to go back, my favourite by far.This is the resort we are sticking to from now on. Truly amazing!!

<Author>JoiaLee
<Content>Great way to loose weight We've just returned from our vacation at Punta Cana Princess Resort. I would like to thank everyone who takes the time to write reviews, good or bad. I have been checking TripAdvisor since we booked this vacation in April and have found very useful information.Upon arrival at the PCP, we were not given cold towels as many of you wrote about. We were however given a fruit punch drink and that was nice. Our room was on the ground floor level of buiding #4. It had been flooded in the past - you could tell from the water marks around the furniture, musty smell in general, and mildrew on the couch cushions. I would suggest getting a room on a higher level than the ground floor. We paid for a platium all inclusive package, top shelf liquor included. We did have a mini bar in our room as we were told (a mini fridge stocked with 2 bottles of beer, 2 bottles of sprite, 2 bottles of Coke, and 2 bottled waters). We did not get the assortment of liquor I expected to get in this package , although we met other people, same package, and they had bottles of gin, vodka, etc. Not really a big deal, drinks were free wherever you went - it would have been nice to have them in the privacy of our room though. There are no ice machines in this hotel. You have to call room service whenever you need ice. We only received face cloths and hand towels one day. Just the two shower towels (and beach towels) were changed daily. If you wanted a wash cloth, you had to call and ask for it. I had a problem right away with anything with ice. I found the food to be edible but that also didn't agree with me. All the mixed drinks were made with ice, so I couldn't enjoy them. I did try everyday to have something different, a daquiri, a marguerita, a mixed drink...aside from the GI upset, everything tasted like bubble gum. No matter what liquor you had, bubble gum. When I asked for diet soda, they went to the machine and I thought, uh-oh, this will have that water again, so instead I asked for something bottled or canned. There was nothing diet to be had. Just regular coke and sprite, warm because you can't have the ice. The Mexican restaurant so many people have raved about was only open one night and I got very very sick after eating there. I did order, again, as I read the reviews, the filet mignon. It tasted wonderful. We also had the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. They brought you nachos with different dipping sauce and automatically gave you a margueritta....so I can't say what exactly made me nauseated (with severe vomiting). In the main buffet area, if you asked for cream/milk for your coffee, they bring out a square plastic container that simply says Cow's Milk. I got sick on that also. There was no seafood at all - I would have thought being on an island and all, there would be plenty but absolutely none at PCP.We thought we would try the Caribe since we weren't having any luck at PCP. Basically the same food but birds everywhere, waiting around your feet for you to drop something. When we left, my husband had bird poop on his pants. We didn't even try the Tropical after that experience. Our package also included 24/7 room service. When you call to order something, they let you know it is not included and you will be charged. There are prices listed next to the items and at the bottom it says that there will be a 27% fee also added. A small cup of soup would have cost me around $8 - and this was supposed to be all inclusive ??We ended up getting Pringles and cheese crackers in the little gift shop and that's what we ate for the last two days we were there (that cost $14). I lost 6 pounds on vacation! Like I said, nothing actually tasted bad, but 1/2 hour after eating, we had to go back to the room, we both had severe GI upset.I agree with most of the reviews regarding the grounds - beautifully maintained. The pool was wonderful, except I heard more than one person say that they peed in the pool - kind of disgusting to think about. At night, there is a main walkway you have to go through to get to the lobby or dinner. They had flea-market style tables set up and pushy, pushy people trying to sell you stuff. You actually dreaded having to walk by them. I found that to be tacky.Many of you rated this hotel to be great, maybe we were just expecting too much. I can't believe there would be such a difference when we went in October unless it had something to do with the hurricaine they recently had ?? My advice to anyone going here, bring plenty of cup-a-soup and crackers. I am sorry to review this as a bad vacation but it really was. We could have done a lot more with the money we spent on this trip. I would not return here.

<Content>Loved loved loved it!!!! This places is so beautiful, i'm sitting here at work and wishing i was back at PCP! My boyfriend and i are 24 and 29 and we absolutly fell in love with this resort.The ride to the resort isn't THAT bumpy, i don't know why people complain. It's fun jumping up and down a bit. We arrived at the resort about an hour after we landed and were greeting with drinks and cold towel. The receptionist (jose) was VERY nice. He upgraded us to VIP, and we stayed in building 5, which i must say had the most beautiful view. One morinig we got up early enough to see the sunrise from our room, so beautiful!Food- since we are vegetarian the choices for us was very minimum, we never went hungry tho !! the pasta for lunch and dinner at the buffet is more then engouhg food. We tried 3 of the restaurant. please note that not ALL the restaurants are open everyday!! we tried the tex mex( surpriseingly they had no veggie food, but they did fo out of their way to make veggie fajitas for us) the fodu resturant which was really good and the italian place. all the restuarants we tried were amazing food! Didnt try any meat so can't comment on that.Beach!- Omg.. that all i can say. Just beautiful! the princesses beachs are the nicest, we went walking along the beach( only a short walk) and found the other resorts werent as nice as ours..I was happy! there are some vendors along the beach but just a smile and a no thanks will keep them away from you. and remeber the prices you pay should be less then half of what they ask. This is for stuff they sell on the beach.Services- The most friendliest people i have ever met. Eveyone has a smile and go out of you way to help you. We would tip everyone that would help us and they did a fantastic job! Please tip everyone they deserve it! the Animacion team do such a great job in trying to get people to join in on the fun!! from veronica, mosquito, chocolate and everyone else, they are sooo funny and knwo how to dance! the resort get a bit dull after the pool closes but they is always stuff to do in the lobby after dinner, like karaoke or going over to the sister resort to the club( which i had a lot of fun in!) the only bad experience i had and it has NOTHING to do with the resort is that we had our digital camera stolen by these 2 ladies( mid-40's) one of them had been diganise with breat cancer and had maybe 2 months to live. My bf ..being a doctor took his time out to talk to her and give advise. We eventually found out they didnt bring a camera, so we were like hey we'll take some pics for you and email them to you.. we had a bit too many shots and ended up leaving the pool bar at 8 45, drunk. we went upstairs to our room and with in 10 mins realized the camera was gone, we went back down and it was no where to be found. i remeberd one of them telling me thier room number so we went to thier room to see if they thad it .. they said no( which they liedddddddd!!!!!) The ladies were leavign the next morining at 5 am... but the staff was so friendly! I told Fransico what happened and he keept on calling security every day to see if the camera had been found but not luck! we bough a disposable and we madefriends with ppl and took pics on thier camera which they will email to us!! i Loved the resort!! Highly reccoment it!! did not get bitten by any bugssss nor did anyother person i met..!! but on of out resort friends did..

<Content>cant make my mind up I was so looking forward to this trip, and wasnt greatly at all disappointed. The complex as a whole is absolutely fantastic, staff all really pleasant and willing to help, it amazes me how they manage to keep a smile on their faces all the time, so very helpful. We stayed in the Platinum Suite area (4 of us in all, 2 couples), I can only say the rooms and domestic service every day is a 10 out of 10 for everything. The villa was only a 5 minute walk to the breathtaking beach, with lots of free activites or paid activities. The shop within the complex is very expensive, so if any Brits going make sure you take plenty of things, my hubby run out of shaving foam, I bought him a small gillette tin which cost in English money around 拢6, about 25 q tips for roughly 拢4, so take plenty of things including shower gel. The food is absolutely excellent 10 out of 10 in all the restaurants including the Hespaniola in the main lobby, if you get the chance go to the Gaucho on the beach (steak house), brilliant. The only downside was the theatre bar which is within the main lobby, phew what can I say, Brits take a battery operated fan, you're going to need it, the humidity in an evening is unbearable and no air con, we found we were totally exhausted from the humidity. When you go to the beach, have some of the Mama Juana, its great fun and the bar tender gives as much as you want, the drinks are plentyful. I will warn you about going shopping outside the complex, its a very scary experience, as soon as you leave the complex, the men from the shops across the road are coming over to you and saying lady you come into my shop I have plenty of cheap things, but believe me its not just 1 man its a possey of them, and once your in their shop be warned they close the door behind you, I did feel intimidated but gradually became quite calm, however do haggle, dont pay the price they are asking, stick to your guns and the price you have fixed in your head, dont go over. The tip is just tell them you're leaving the shop. they soon come round. If you can go on the quad bike trip, really good fun, would recommend that. Hope this review helps anyone going. Have a good trip

<Content>Great Honeymoon other than getting sick My wife and I went here on our honeymoon from July 4, 2008 to July 12, 2008 adn had a great time. The only issue we had was we got sick around halfway through our trip and stayed that way for weeks. It was just a small stomach issue, but it does need to be said that we still loved this place in spite of what happened. We are still contimplating going back because everything else about our trip was unbelievable.ARRIVAL: Our arrival went without any problems. From the time we landed on the runway to the time we got to the resort it only took about an hour and once we got to the resort the front desk was awesome. They checked us in and gave us cold washcloths and drinks. We were in our room within minutes and a few minutes later our luggage arrived. ATMOSPHERE: This place was immaculate. The grounds were beautiful and the gardens were nice. Everything looked just like the picutres and was great.ROOM: We got a room in the building that we requested, building five and it overlooked the pool and the ocean. The view from our room was great and we were only a few steps from the ocean. We had a bottle of Rum waiting for us in our room and our maid cleaned our room thoroughly everyday and would make nice animals out of the towels on our bed with flowers.BARS: The pool bar and lobby bar were awesome. Emelio in the Lobby Bar was so much fun to be around. He certainly knows how to have a good time. The pool bar was always a blast, who doesn't love to sit in a pool and drink?RESTAURANTS: All of the food we felt was very good. We went to the buffet for breakfast and lunch everyday. I loved the fact that I could get an omelette every morning. We went to all of the al a carte dinners other than the Italian. The Tex-Mex and Fondue were our favorites. We also ate at the Seafood Restaurant which was also good. The Filet Mignon at the Tex-Mex was delicious. We didn't feel the food tasted badly, but we did get sick after about 4 days of being there and it took several weeks for our stomaches to start feeling better.The Beach beds were awesome and we never had any problems finding a place to sit on the beds or on the chairs at the pool. The hotel dies down really early which was alright with us because after a long day of drinking we were usually in bed early. If you get the Platinum Package you have access to all the upper shelf liquors, which they have at all of the bars, you just need to ask. I really miss the Coco-Locos they were delicious. All in all even with getting sick my wife and I are debating still going back again next year because the staff was excellent, the resort was beautiful and we liked that it was a smaller adults only resort. I would defintely recommend this hotel to a friend just be careful of what you eat.

<Content>Welcoming, beautiful place but bad wine. We had fun at the Princess the grounds are beautiful, the service was outstanding, the rooms were immaculate and the food was good. We were surpised that all of the restaraunts are not open every night so that limits your selection. Its important to know the wine is terrible you can't even buy a decent bottle so bring it with you (this is not the all inclusive to go to if you only drink wine, I would go to Club Med then for their French wine). Allow yourself enough time to pick up a few bottles at the duty free shop. If I had it to do again I would have upgraded just for the name brand liquor and beer. We met very nice friendly couples there. I'm sure you'll have a great time.

<Author>CozumelDreams
<Content>Paradise is Punta Cana Princess Let me begin by saying that I will gladly answer any private messages/questions from anyone. There were 4 of us traveling: Me, my husband, and our 2 daughters (20  22). We arrived July 16th and departed July 26. We also renewed our vows on the 21st.First, I booked the trip through Resort Vacations to Go, AKA Travel Impressions, and it could not have been simpler. The agent was willing to take care of all of my requests and questions with a quick yes! Everything was handled and we had no worries, including not having to pay the $20 exit fee. We also had a representative on resort daily to assist with questions or booking excursions if we needed.Upon arrival at the resort, we were greeted by Carol. She saw to it that we were given a cold towel (very appreciated) and a refreshing drink. Check-in was so quick and easy. We were directed to our rooms, 5007 for the girls  5106 for us. Our bags arrived within 10 minutes. The room: Just as lovely as the pictures. We had rum  cigars waiting for us. A lovely fruit basket arrived shortly after. As we were honeymooners, a lovely bottle of champagne also arrived quickly. Our rooms were always impeccably cleaned, smelled wonderful, and never failed to have extra touches. The service: Wow! Did they pamper me every single moment, no, but they always went above and beyond for us. Anything we needed or wanted was simply one phone call away. Guest services would make sure everything was quickly handled. Housekeeping always made sure we had lovely flowers. When we returned to our room after our vow renewal, the turn down maid had even gone to the extra trouble of using palm fronds  flowers to decorate the floor and spell out happy wedding and placed flowers on the bed. These lovely touches made everything special. Everyone was willing to do whatever to make you happy. Emilio in the lobby bar was so entertaining and wonderful. He was always a good way to end the day. Niki, Jose Q.  Luis always made sure dinner was a worry-free affair. This included the dinner for our renewal. The wedding cake was supposed to have been moved to the steak restaurant and set up for us. It was not there when we arrived and I became anxious. Jose Q. said that he was there and to have no worries. We finished our dinner and were just about ready for the still unseen cake. Jose Q. had been on the phone and then rushed out. He returned a short while later with our cake. As it turned out, it had been left at the beach restaurant and, Jose, rather than disappoint me, ran all the way there and back (with the cake!). Such wonderful people! Food: I had no issues what so ever with the food. Between the 4 ala cartes and the 2 buffets (not to mention room service), we always had plenty to eat. The filet mignon at the steak restaurant was our favorite. The Italian restaurant had wonderful pizza and pasta choices. We only did the seafood restaurant once and had a surf  turf. The fondue restaurant was wonderful as well. We also enjoyed the Asian night at the buffet and the Dominican party on the beach (so many choices!). We only went to the neighboring resort for one meal (chose not to be around the kids). We went to the Mexican restaurant. It was okay. Perhaps we are more picky about Mexican food coming from Texas. We did the main buffet for breakfast and lunch every day and snacks at the beach buffet. We never failed to find many things that pleased each of us (at least 2 very picky eaters!). I have nothing but good things to say about the food and drinks!Spa: We 3 girls did the mini spa for massages that were wonderful. It was $34 US for about 30 minutes and well worth it. One daughter also had her hair braided there for about $80 US. We did not use the main spa so I can't speak about that but the mini spa was great!Excursions: My husband and youngest daughter did the zipline tour with the Bavorro Runners. They completely enjoyed themselves. My husband came back so jazzed! My oldest daughter and I did the parasailing with the company right there on the resort's beach. The parasailing itself was incredible but the boat ride was not so great. I do get a little sea sick but I am usually able to control it. However, they kept us on the boat for a very long time for no reason. Boats came to put more people on but would leave empty. We were on the boat for over an hour after we did the parasail. I regret that I did get sick. They finally called for a boat but instead of taking us to our beach first, they went to the other end and began dropping people off. We were to be last but as I could not take any more, we got off and walked the rest of the way. So bottom line, loved the parasailing but if you have a tendency to get sick in rougher waters, make sure you get their word to let you off as soon as possible!Grounds: So well kept and absolutely beautiful. They are constantly taking care of the grounds and pool. Who could ask for more!Vow Renewal: We had our ceremony on the beach. They thought of everything from decorating the cart to drive us to making a decorative aisle on the beach for me to walk down. Everything was provided for and we were treated like royalty. Francelia, the wedding coordinator, was fully prepared for our arrival and took care of everything for us. I would definitely suggest them for anyone wanting to renew or even have their wedding.Shopping: There are many shops on the beach for shopping. As you come onto the beach from the resort, if you begin walking to your left down the beach, you will encounter the beach shops after about a 10 minute walk. Stay by the water to avoid the timeshare guys and even the shop sellers if you are not shopping. Do not be afraid to negotiate the price. You should never pay more than 50% of the original asking price and you can get it even cheaper. Simply be polite and friendly and stick to your pricing.Airport: Upon arrival, we had no problems getting our luggage. Be prepared that plenty of people will be more than ready to take your luggage for you. There's no problem with this except it is just right around the corner. As soon as we turned the corner, our representative was waiting for us and immediately got us into the van with AC and loaded our luggage. Upon departure, the line was not bad and moved quickly enough to get checked in. There were two more lines (customs  security), both of which moved quickly enough. There are places to eat right after that, including a Wendy's. This part of the airport is open-air and can be rather hot. If you move over to the other part where the gates are, you will find AC, snacks, ice cream, bar  shops as well. Definitely more comfortable.Overall: I would highly recommend this resort. Is it for families? No, this is an adult only resort. We enjoyed this aspect quite a bit. The rooms, service, food, people, and grounds were all that we expected and more! Everything is geared to insuring you have a good time from the beach/pool beds to the people always waiting on you. You can book a trip to the Punta Cana Princess and rest assured that you will have a wonderful trip!

<Content>We loved it! No major complaints here! My now fiance and I went to the Princess last summer and had arguably one of the best trips of our lives. To start with, the staff was fantastic. We were making friends with all the staff members, which really gave the resort a personal touch. We felt that they knew us and treated us like VIP's. It really does make a difference when you go out of your way to treat people nicely, because a lot of times, they will reciprocate. The rooms were more than large enough for the 2 of us. The maids kept them clean and turned down our beds for us each night.I notice the bad reviews are picking on the food here at the resort. I personally did not expect gourmet meals, so maybe this is why the food did not bother me. I'll admit, their idea of pizza and hot dogs at the snack bar or not what most of us would get at home, but the restaurants and buffet did not make me sick or make me think that the food is terrible. The food was just above average. Not the best, but certainly not as bad as some seem to think. The beaches were fantastic! We upgraded to the VIP package and had access to the beach beds. Well worth the extra money in my opinion!On nights when we could think of nothing better to do, we would head out to the casino nearby. Someone from the resort will drive you in a golf cart off the resort grounds and drop you off right in front of the casino door. The casino had some black jack, craps, roulette, slots and a poker table. Perfect for any gambler! When you wanted to go home, just go out front and tell the guys where you need to go and if a Princess cart was not already there, they would call one in for you. Very easy and never felt unsafe.Some nights, we just felt like walking off our dinner, so we would just walk the resort and enjoy our surroundings. The resort contains unique plant and wild life. I do not fault anyone for writing a bad review if they had a bad experience. It is possible that sometimes we get lucky and encounter very few problems, while others do not get so lucky. So while I will not guarantee that you have a flawless vacation, but I will say that the Punta Cana Princess holds the potential for an amazing vacation!

<Content>Read before you go (and don't believe any bad reviews!) Let me start by saying that before leaving for this resort I was a little trepidatious because people had complained about several different things. However, upon the conclusion of my week at this resort I was left wondering if the people who wrote those bad reviews stayed at the same resort! The resort was truly one of the best vacations that my family has ever been on. I do not normally write reviews but was compelled to write this one in the hope that people will read this and not listen to the other reviewers who clearly have expectations that could not be met by any resort, much less one at this price point. I traveled with my parents, sister, her boyfriend and my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I are in our 20's, my sister and her boyfriend are in their 30's and my parents are in their late 50's/early 60's and we all had the same opinion about the resort. Beach and Pool:First and foremost, the beach was one of the most beautiful that I have seen. Between myself and my family, we have traveled pretty extensively through the Caribbean and Europe and still found it one of the nicest. The tanning beds were quite possibly one of the best inventions that was ever created for the beach and we never had a problem getting three, even when we slept in and had a late breakfast before heading to the beach. The sand was wonderfully soft and white and the water was beautiful and turquoise. There was very little seaweed and what little seaweed there was, was quickly raked up by the resort staff and removed. There was great butler service on the beach for drinks and unlike previous reviews we did not find that this service was non-existent. The pool was also wonderful. The swim up bar was great and there was plenty of activities if you wanted to participate. Again, unlike other reviews we did not find the Animation team annoying. They would recruit you for activities if you desired to participate but would leave you alone if you did not wish to do so. They did a great job keeping the guests entertained and really made an effort to have a variety of activities available. My boyfriend especially liked the beach volleyball!Spa:My Mom, sister, and I all had appointments at the spa and found the experience great. The massages were in a great hut near babbling water and the staff was nice. As a regular spa goer in a big city at home, I found the atmosphere was exactly what a spa should be and the prices were relatively reasonable for a resort.Food:Now this was the area that I was most worried about after reading previous reviews but those worries were misguided. The staff truly makes such an effort to provide a variety of food and excellent service. The morning and lunch buffets had a great selection. I think the key to the food at this resort is picking things that you know are fresh and have not sat out. The lunch buffet had a great pasta station where fresh pasta was made to your individual taste and the morning buffet did the same thing with omelets. I did not have one problem with any of the food and I normally have a very tempermental stomach and am also an extremely picky eater. We talked to several other guests and found they did not have any problems either. The a la carte restaurants were also great. My family and I ate at the Italian restaurants at our resort and at the neighboring resort and both were wonderful. They truly do special touches such as bringing bruschetta for the table or delicious welcome drinks. We also ate at the Mare Nostrum restaurant which had the most beautiful atmosphere right on the beach. The fondue restaurant was also a crowd pleaser and was my personal favorite. The shrimp there was fantasic!Room and Staff:Our room was truly lovely. The room was cleaned twice daily and we always had fresh towels and beautiful flowers upon our return to the room. Bottled water was restocked daily as well as Coke and beer. All of the water at the resort is filtered except the shower and sink water so that was never a problem! We did tip our housekeeper two dollars daily but she did such a great job, it was well deserved. The room is spacious and the beds were very comfortable. We were in building four and my parents were in five but both were close to the pool and beach. The staff all throughout the resort were so upbeat and always willng to help. You can really tell how much effort they put in to keep the guests happy. Resort Grounds/Check-in:The resort grounds were beautiful. The landscaping was well-maintained and always clean. The resort itself was spotless. The lobby was spacious and had a lovely bar. Our check in went smoothly with a cold towel and welcome drink to greet us. The bus ride from the airport was not nearly what other reviewers have written. Although it was a bit bumpy and the town you drive through is poor, this is neither the fault of the resort or the responsibility. If you have traveled to any other Islands in the Caribbean, you will find that most of them share this quality in that they are poor countries with neither the resources or the manpower to have the road systems we have at home.Overall, I have come to the conclusion that some people forget what the art of traveling is about and that is that you are experiencing another culture. In this same vein, this means that you should acclimate to their culture, not the other way around. The people who wrote bad reviews also seem to forget that this is an all-inclusive resort. Therefore you are never going to get five-star dining because you are not paying for five-star dining. The resort did a fantastic job getting as close to this standard as they could get and we were very appreciative. If you are going on vacation for five star dining then go to NYC and spend hundreds of dollars instead of an all-inclusive resort on an island in the Caribbean. My parents have stayed at several Sandals resorts which were triple the price of this resort and found the food to be the same quality. I hope this review helps those that felt the same trepidation as I did upon reading previous reviews. Don't listen to them! My boyfriend and I just completed the Bar exam two days before leaving for this vacation and needed a break from the real world after three years of law school and two months of 24/7 studying. This was the perfect relaxing, stress-free vacation!

<Content>A Perfect Honeymoon (although more vegetarian menu items would be nice) We are so happy that we chose this resort. Being adults-only meant that it was a much more mature and peaceful environment. Yes, people still had fun, especially in the pool area, but there were no screaming kids (and no turds in the pool! Yes, we saw a poo in the pool at the sister resort where we did scuba instruction). The sister resort was a couple-minute walk away, plus they had shuttles. There are more food options, nightly entertainment (moderately entertaining), a late-night disco, and nice grounds to walk around there. There are a lot more birds wandering the grounds over there. We took a random early morning walk along the mangrove path to the neighbor lobby and were delighted by all the birds and fish we saw along the way.The room was very nice. We were concerned about some little ant-like bugs when we first arrived. We told the front desk and they took care of it. We later realized that every time the cleaning lady put new flowers in the bathroom, the little bugs came out of the flowers. Harmless, and we happened to have a little natural bug repellent that took care of them. The cleaning ladies work hard and long hours. Sometimes they'd forget a towel or something, but if it was important enough to call the desk or ask her in the hall, we always got what we needed in minutes. Even when we broke a lamp late in the night, she was there in minutes to clean it up. She certainly deserved a little tip left daily.It does help to know some spanish. It will get you things you need much easier!The staff there was wonderful. There is even one guy on the grounds-crew that will take off his boots and shimmy up a tree for coconuts and cut them open for you to drink, and refill at the bar with more drinks! He did not ask for payment, but we tipped him decent for all the effort, and we loved our fresh coconut! Try to catch their names and you can fill-out a smile form to hand in at the desk and hopefully help your favorite staff earn incentives. (the forms are in your room when you arrive)The food was all good. The buffets always had good selections. The smaller buffet has a wonderful view of the ocean. My vegetarian wife always found decent meals at the buffets. The restaurants however are not vegetarian delights. Only the Italian restaurants at both resorts had vegetarian options. The fondu place was nice also, but for some reason we only got bread to dip in the cheese, no veggies like the menu said. The seafood restaurant did make a special dish for my wife by running to the buffet for a few veggies and cooking them. Nothing special, but at least she wasn't eating bread while I ate shrimp and salmon. It was sort of frustrating to be limited so much by vegetarian needs. Doesn't seem like it should be so difficult. Overall the grounds were immaculate and beautiful! The stone walkways did get hot so remember sandles. The VIP beds on the beaches were really great, and the other bungalows for beach chairs were great too. Another nice thing about this small resort is that you don't have to worry about reserving your chairs early in the AM. There are always open chairs. We never left blankets to reserve spots while we left to eat. We always found a nice place to relax when we got back. Granted, the VIP beds helped the cause a lot. I'd highly recommend this place to honeymooners and couples not looking for wild night life.

<Content>What a Wonderful Vacation!!! We just returned from a week @ the Punta Cana Princess (from July 25 - Aug.1). It was everything we hoped for - nice accomodations, beautiful beaches, a wonderful pool and terrific service.The room was exactly as pictured - we were in building 5 (room 5105). The building is the closest to the beach and to the pool - it was a little noisy in the late afternoon when the Animacion Team was at the pool, but not a problem. Our room was made up by early afternoon every day, and was turned down each evening, with clean beach towels left for the next day. The minibar was restocked every day, as well.The food was okay - not gourmet, but we didn't expect that. Breakfast and lunch are buffets, either at Casabe or at Mare Nostrum (this was a smaller buffet). There certainly was enough to choose from, even for picky eaters. Dinners can either be at Casabe (if you want buffet) or at the a la carte restaurants. We enjoyed the Tex-Mex place (the filet mignon was wonderful!) the most. The fondue place was very enjoyable, as was the Italian restaurant (food was a little salty for me, but I don't use any salt on my food!). We didn't like the seafood restaurant too much because everything was cooked in lots of butter. The grounds are beautiful - and looked after every day - the beach is cleaned, and there never was any trouble finding a lounge chair at either the beach or the pool. The resort is very quiet, without much of a nightlife.We went on two excursions - to Saona Island and the Truck Safari. Saona is beautiful, but the bus ride to get there is very long (2 hours each way!) The truck safari was great - very informative about the Dominican and the people.All in all, this was a perfect vacation - restful and relaxing, and very hard to come home and go back to real life!!!

<Content>I did not want to go home! We spent 6 wonderful days and 5 restfull nights at the Punta Cana Princess. The resort is beautiful. The lobby is open air and clean! The tile floors are kept spotless. Any questions we had were answered by the wonderful people at the front desk or guest services. They offer free internet service ,there was never a long wait. The tram service they offer to get to the other hotels are safe and smooth. Remember do not leave the hotel property!The grounds are kept spotless also. Every morning while most guest are still sleeping the staff are hosing the sidewalks down and sweeping. The pool is kept clean and a nice temperature. The bar has stools in the water to relax on. The pool bar is a great place to meet other travelers, try a Banana Mama, or a Coco Loco. The rum is awesome. Our room was top floor facing the pool and ocean. The view from the balcony was heaven every morning. The color of the ocean is nothing I have ever seen before. (The Jersey shore will never be the same) The whole room has tiled floors so do use the fluffy slippers they give you or you will be ice skating across the room! The flowers by the sink everyday and the turn down service at night is so sweet. The maids were great ,what ever you needed they gave you. All you need to do is ask. The beach is kept clean and is never crowded the VIP beach beds were so relaxing. The food was interesting. We were so afraid at first to eat anything. We were cautious and stayed to the basics, rice, bread, steamed veggies, chicken, fruit, lots of fruit, Then as the days go on we found ourselves trying alot of different dishes. The Italian place was not our favorite there is something different with the cheese???? All the other places were nice. You need to just pick and choose and do not pig out! We drank bottle water the whole time, coke with ice and the mixed drinks. We did not get sick. We did love the deserts. The half of coconut with coconut pudding at the buffet place was great, as well the cakes and pies and cookies!We did snorkle and parasail ,we booked it through the private boats on the beach. (Look for Pedro) It was great and a low price. I have been recommending the resort to anyone who is looking for an affordable and relaxing place to run away to. We did like that it is adults only. After visiting the other resorts next door with kids, wow what a difference to come back to ours. QUIET and CLEAN. All we said on our last day to all the great people we met was We do not want to go home!!! This is Paradise!

<Content>Punta Cana Princess My boyfriend and I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess in May and our experience was wonderful. It is a pretty quiet resort and a perfect getaway for couples, with lots of time to focus on each other. We were very pleased with our room, it was on the top floor and we had ocean view. the staff was very friendly and polite and we had no problems whatsoever. The food was good and everything was always clean and well maintained.I would highly recommend this hotel to couples who are not really into the party scene.

<Content>Go for a good time, just don't eat! I was a bit hesitant to write the following review based on the many excellent reviews I read prior to booking my trip to the Punta Cana princess. Many fellow reviewers stated that they had an excellent time, the food was wonderful, the beach, the beds, service, all of it wonderful. This is the first time that I stayed at an all-inclusive resort, so I had no idea what to expect and didn鈥檛 expect the Ritz. Due to the gut-wrenching illness I have endured for the past nine days, I will say this, go, if you love soft sand and clean beaches, excellent service, beautiful landscaped gardens, beach beds, clean pools with bars, and silly activities鈥UT DO NOT EAT THE FOOD鈥?or drink their drinks?I cannot pinpoint the exact cause of my illness, but nonetheless, the food was the worst I have ever eaten in my entire life, and I am not a food snob. The main buffet is open for all meals鈥ach of which have typical buffet menus鈥asta station, seafood, meat, salad (or the attempt at calling whatever it was they were serving), desserts and a theme station which, for dinner, could be sushi, Mexican, etc. It is true that restaurants close on certain nights and there is no schedule, so you are then forced to go elsewhere or eat at the buffet. By the way, you do not need a reservation to go to this resorts restaurants. If you must eat at the buffet, it is bearable, but eat simply. There were insects flying around the sushi, salad and hot buffet stations that are not covered. It is also an open-air restaurant, so bugs love it and items were never properly refrigerated. Stick to breads and perhaps the pasta with no sauces. The desserts are actually good, so if you are brave, go for it.The one plus about the food scene at the princess is that as a VIP guest you are allowed to share restaurant opportunities with the princess鈥?sister hotels. Caribe club and Tropical?? For use of these restaurants you must make reservations a day in advance. Out of the ones we tried, the Mediterranean was the best. The Mexican, much better than the buffet but DO NOT go near the Chinese restaurant鈥nless, you like super salty sauce鈥hink soy sauce with a half cup of salt. We left before our meal courses were over. The Creperie is decent鈥ow can you really screw up crepes, but be careful of the toppings you choose and you don鈥檛 need reservations to go to the Creperie.Luckily, both my boyfriend and I did not get sick until the last two days of our trip, so it is really hard to tell what it was that did us both in, and he is a vegetarian. It could have also been the water, but we were told that all drinks were safe because the water is filtered, even the ice. The bottled water they give you does taste off, but not horribly and we drank it anyways.Overall we did have a good time. The beaches there are amazing, clean, and the sand is super soft. If you are a VIP member (and I am not sure if everyone gets this right because it was the only option available when we booked), you get access to the lovely beach beds that line the beach. They are super comfortable and from time to time someone may ask you if you鈥檇 like a drink. You also have rights to premium liquor, but you really have to ask for it. Yes, the animation team can be really annoying, but not so much during the day unless you are around the pool area. Once they know your name, it鈥檚 all over and you will get dragged into their silly skits and games. We saw it happen over and over. The service itself is really great鈥he front desk, maids and most restaurant workers. And, the non-motorized water sports were decent, but did incur extra charges for certain activities.Do go on an excursion or two to get you away from the resort. We went on the Bavaro Runners tour of Punta Cana and it was amazing. You get to see how locals live and work, and also see the countryside, which is so beautiful. I highly recommend this tour if you are curious as how Dominicans live their life. The speedboat and snorkeling tour was good too, I just wish there was a little more time to snorkel.If you already booked your stay at the Princess, take my review for what it鈥檚 worth. As I said in the beginning, I booked my stay here based solely on the whole 鈥淚 didn鈥檛 get sick, had a great time鈥?reviews I read back in April. Perhaps the issue with the food is cyclical? We stayed during the week of July 9 鈥?6th, and I really hope that future visitors will not get sick too.It is a beautiful resort and everyone is super friendly. If you have a planned stay here, you will have a good time because we sure did despite the sick feeling the last two days. If you are thinking of visiting this resort, wait a few months and see if the 鈥淚 got sick鈥?reviews go away.

<Content>Take soft Toilet Tissue If you only read one part of my review...skip down to Illness.Resort in General: It was very beautiful. Grounds were well kept, pool was perfect with a swim up bar, beach was clean white  powdery and the staff was very friendly. Never an issue finding a lounge chair and many tiki hut umbrellas were available for shade. They don't seem to believe in wash cloths so make sure to bring your own or a puff. Rooms were a bit musty so a candle is a great thing to pack.Bar: If you upgrade for the platinum be sure to ask for those premium products. Also, they are only available at the swim up bar and lobby bars. The other bars did not stock premium alcohol. Also, you can't get these drinks after 12 as those bars are closed and the resort becomes a ghost town. They don't seem to encourage socializing. Besides the swim up bar, there were no bar stools around the actual bar to sit around and mingle with other hotel guests. Pina Coladas were like dish water but the Coco Locos and rum were tasty.Food: Only 1 sit down restaurant open per night but no schedule provided as to what it was. We missed our first meal and thought we were going to be on a French Fry diet the entire trip because the food at the 24 hour location was HORRIBLE. Tasted bad, not cold, not hot, mayo on cold meat left out in the heat...just bad bad bad. Fondue was tasty. Italian was less than desirable. Heard Tex Mex was good but never made it. Casabe buffet was the most decent (rice, bread and noodles are hard to goof up). We had one great room service lunch and one wretched room service late night.Illness: Became horribly sick 1 1/2 days into it. Toilet tissue in the washroom was not conducive for the illness that hits. I say this with humor but I'm also not kidding. I've been to Cancun and Jamaica and always get a touch of an upset stomach but this is something I've never experienced. Almost missed a planned excursion because I was fearful that between the doubled over pain in my upper stomach and the trips to the restroom that I wouldn't make it. Airport waiting and airplane ride were interesting but somehow I made it home. Read this site and found that it seems to be a recent problem at this resort. At the advice from another reviewer I contacted my travel agent and she is investigating it to see if the resort had made and efforts to correct the situation. Traveled with 2 others and although they weren't as ill as I was, they felt it at 1 1/2 days into it as well. We drank only bottled water (however, it was bottled in the DR so pack some water from home in your checked luggage) but we did have ice in our drinks. I really think it was the food that did us all in. The precautions for food just weren't taken...see the Food section above for examples. All I can say is luckily I was with true friends and they listened to me complain the entire time of this illness without making me feel like a whiner.It's a shame that the food and sickness were such big problems because the resort has so much potential with its beauty.

The views of the ocean, the breeze, the accessibility and help doing that , the pool, the pool bar and bartenders, the animation team who showed all alot of fun and did not force ya to do anything but watched people have a ball joining in the fun who wanted to. ,,,,,and Emilio at the lobby bar and the others also.....do you remember my name Emilio? It's not a common one..ha ha The resort 's location is INCREDIBLE! The views , the beach and to feel silky,powdery, white sand on your feet , the aqua, teal and blue, warm, calm waters and the breeze and with all your senses being used....and then ya add the beach beds ( all included in VIP and all well worth the little extra)and butler service..a seafood restaurant and two bars and showers and restrooms if need be and a pool in the near distance....what more can ya say about that???? As they say, LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! They got it going on there even with no resort...but the resort and it's staff are the icing on the cake and then some....When it comes to service they are TOPS! trust us on that one...we have worked in the hotel and cruise industry for many years in the past..at major world interantional hotels also..in FB and also as a concierge, and when it comes to this type of industry it is all about SERVICESERVICESERVICE and they sure know how to reach HIGH BEYOND EXCELLENCE.....hats off to ALL who work there! ..and MUCHAS GRACIAS! ....From ALL at the front desk including Diana in guest services who knows what excellent service is and how to do it .....to all who follow or lead along with her....to Karen and Carol and Steicy andeveryone else ...and for understanding when a person has disabilities and accomodating you and your spouse to ALL you need during your stay and realizing some people's needs may be different than others and it being an extra blessing for them accomodating you so your energy can be used on having A MOST MEMORABLE VACATION!!!....to All who greet you along the way ALL of the time..the gardeners and maintenance crew, who I may say keep the grounds sooooo BEAUTIFUL and IMMACULATE...to the people who drive you to your room and make sure all is well .to the rtrams you can use to get to and from the sister resorts and the crepes are great there I may add and also the Japanese/cniese rest as well and as well as the service.but I liked the Adults only idea here and the resort was excellent for people with disabilities and very undeerstanding about them also.....to the people who drop off your welcome basket and other goodies with a smile and a warm Hola as well and ....to the note we received for welcoming us and wishing us a Happy 10 yr Anniv and all from the staff...to the surprise platter of cheeses and caviar for our anniv too sent to our room as well..ths again all and Diana.....to the maids who ALL were WONDERFUL and hardworking as well and would help to make your stay comfortable and clean and having the conveniences of all filed every day to all cleaned everyday to turn down service to whatever you also needed.....to ALL in the FB/REST ...from Pedro and other FB managers who's performance ranks REAL high and are aim to please as well with warm hearts as well and including Louisa, Stefany,Hector, Sandra, Nelson,Serapio and ALL at the Seafood restaurant ( still waiting to hear from yas and we have pics we are gonna send soon which we love looking at remembering yas all too and miss yas alot! )and ALL others at ALL of the other restaurants .....and we went to ALL of them and had all the works..ALL were AWESOME from the servers to the prep cooks to the maintenance crew....you should ALL be proud of each other too.......4 course meals, drinks( both alcohol and not) and desserts too, of course!...and never ever were we ever sick and never had to take any meds from home for any stomach problems at all...(we took our antimalarial meds and used spray and all only as preventive to stay safe, that's all.)....to the MOST ROMANTIC and MOST UNFORGETTABLE private ANNIV dinner under the stars and on the beach in the pergola/gazebo with palm lined pathways with candles, warm smlies, our own private waiters, a 4 course dinner we could choose and drinks and champagne and a menu to keep and ALL decorated soooo beautifully from the food, and hat's off to ALL of the chefs in ALL of the restaurants, and the presentation to the most caring service we have EVER received! ...and even LOTS of pics to remember such an INCREDIBLE ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT....and more pics for the same to CHERISH FOREVER! All we can say is that if you want a MOST MEMORABLE and MOST BREATHTAKING place with EXCELENTE service than GO TO PUNTA CANA PRINCESS and if anyone has anything to complain about here than you shouldn't be on any vacation but stay home and stay unhappy ......cause this place itself just sitting at the water's edge makes ya forget all your troubles and adding the service and people here is , as I said, the icing on the cake,...who are sooooo down to earth I can't emphasize that enough, and who offer you the most incredible service imaginable ! Please tip all who work here ...ALL...they appreciate your appreciation!

PS the ONLY suggestions we have because one of us has disabilites ....and this place was great for them to begin me with the size of the resort etc.....is to put a small boardwalk/pathway from the beach to showers and seafood restaurant so if someone has trouble with disabilities and sand to get to beach beds, etc so if ya have an unsteady gait or a cane,or walker or wheelchair it could work for all and even without a disability....and another suggestion....for rooms close to the beach and who may be able to get a room that can receive an ocean breeze......it would be nice to have the option of opening the sliding glass dorrs with a screened door that locks too so that at night if ya wanted to sleep with the doors open you would have the natural ocean breeze and room fan too and be able to hear the ocean and feel the breeze and not have any bugs esp mopsquitos bothering you and talk about PARAISO!

<Content>Great Resort, Lousy Food! What a beautiful place! The staff was fantastic and the resort was in impecible shape! We read all the reviews before we left and we took all the advice that people had wrote about ie: take bug spray, etc. We didn't have any problems with bugs on the beach or at night. The rooms were very nice and the housekeeping staff was very prompt and courteous. However, during our second day, Montezuma swam across the gulf and landed at the resort. While we took extra caution to NOT drink tap water and only drink bottled water, Montezuma still found his way to the food and the buffett food was terrible and the selection was plain and not very assorted on each day. Fresh fruit was served with a cover and not protected from the local flies. I fell ill then my wife on the third day. After talking with at least 12 other couples, we learned that they had fallen ill as well and they had met even more couples that had attracted the gut wrenching sickness too. By the fifth night of our visit, we just wanted to go home. We couldn't pin point if it was something we ate or drank, but none-the-less, we all got it. The entertainment group was very pushy and didn't get the hint that we just wanted to be left alone while on the beach or at the pool. We just got up and relocated when they would show up. We weren't into the type of music that they played loudly every day. While most of the people at the resort seemed to be in their late 20's, 30's and 40's, the nerve wracking rap music and dance music was just very unwelcoming and would have suited a younger, single crowd rather than a romantic couples get-a-way. Other than the food and entertainment, the resort, the rooms, the staff, the bar staff, the pool and the beaches were very pleasent. Would I recommend this place to my friends? Probably not, due to the food and what the end result would be more visiting the bathrooms, rather enjoying the friendly people from around the world. Oh, one more thing. Guys....take a pants for the ala carte restaurants. Had it not been for the front desk clerk Julio Ceasar lending me a pair, I would have been regulated to the buffett for days! The ala carte restaurants were very average adn not really any different than what you would experience in your home town, and get there early. They don't have circulating air and it get's very stuffy and hot in there. Especially the Fondu restaurant. You'd think if they were going to give you an open fire to dip food into, they would at least have air conditioning and vents to pull the hot air out! When we arrived we were so looking forward to a beautiful vacation and it would have been had the food been better. We now have been home for 3 weeks and we are still experiencing stomach problems. This resort could easily be rated a 5 star place, but, as most of us know, we can be sitting in the most beautiful restaurants in the world, but if the food is bad, we won't be going back. The overall experience we had could have been a 5, but again, with the food and the sickness resulting from that, we rate this experience a 2.

<Content>Great Resort will be back My partner and I went to the Punta Cana Princess for 7 night at the suggestion of our travel agent. It was more then expected. Great people, good food and plenty to drink. We met guest from all around the world and every body got along like all good friends. You will need to pack Pepto-Bismol, amodiem and dont forget to take a large insulated mug for cocktails. The bar tenders do not mind filling them up. Your room gets cleaned between 2  4:00 PM. But that wont matter because you are at the beach, pool or a bar. Ride the trolly between the other three resorts and see the shows and disco. The food is a little better at the Caribe Resort. The jeep tour and the booze cruise tours were great also. I highly recomend these. Take plenty of $ 1.00 bills, no one will give you change back in american money. Credit cards only used in the resort at the tour booking or the front deck. You will not really know the exact exchange until you bill comes in. Go - Enjoy - and just lay back and relax.

<Content>Great Beaches!! We heard so many wonderful things about this resort but after staying there, we want to add a few items of interest for future travelers. We booked our trip through bookit.com. We had the Platinum Package which includes bottle of rum, fruit basket, unlimited room service and robes/slippers. For those who want to stay at a nice resort, for relaxation, quiet nights and beautiful beach views, all inclusive with plenty of variety of food, this is for you.. We stayed in the 4th bldg, on 3rd floor, near everything, our balcony view was beautiful, we could see the ocean and the pool along with the gardens. Food at Fish restaurant was fantastic!! Service there was awesome! Other restaurants were very good as well, however, the a/c didn't work in most and it wasn't much better at the buffet, always hot, not enough fans. Even the lobby area, with the main bar, was very hot at night, no breeze, not enough fans or ventiliation. Poolside bar was the highlight!! We made many friends there. Pool was immaculate. There were even ducks swimming in it every morning. Spa - a disappointment, asked for deep tissue, got a relaxation message instead. Therapist kept checking her cell phone for calls during the massage, ugh!! Don't go into town unless you want to be mobbed and insulted by vendors who want to take you for every penny. Distance from airport is about 30 minutes, rough cab ride will cost you $33.00 one way, no matter how many people need it. Service was excellent, front desk, concierge, maid, restaurants and bars. We especially liked, Jose, Elvis, Hector, Nelson, Altagracia, Ingrid, Anderson, Emilio. The beach was beautiful, white thin sand, you can walk for miles... awww!! Animation Team - RATING: poor. They should all be fired. They were more interested in their own activities and didn't do their best to interact with the guests. Volleyball games were fun, however one day we were given a damaged volleyball instead of another and we were told to use it, no one offered to get a new one. It was almost like the animation team worked for a 2-star resort... thanks to Fernando, we were able to get a volleyball and start our games again. Best Restaurant - Fish, Worst Restaurant - TEXMEX. Resort stores were WAY overpriced! There was really little to do on this property at night, we went to adjacent resort for shows, disco, etc. We want to say hi to Dave, Tiffany (thanks for the Tiffany Special), Todd, Adrienne, Bob and Terry. Lets keep in touch! Pura 'n Victor

<Content>great hotel! just don't eat the food The hotel is beautiful!The staff fantastic!The grounds immaculate!JUST DONT EAT THE FOOD!I just returned home after a seven day stay at the Punta Cana Princess (July 1 to 8 2008) My travel mate got severly sick from the food, along with several other guests from the hotel, and this review should not to be confused with any other travelers reviews who might also have experienced the same fate!The food is not kept at room temperature, thus inviting a potential for a real food born outbreak, which indeed happened. I was fortunate enough not to get sick, but I ate several yogarts a day, and stayed with rice and beans as the quality of the food was poor to low grade.I hate to write a review like this, but I feel managment should be made aware that guests are getting sick, with mild to severe stomache problems and the food issue should be immediately addressed for the safety of all concerned.Otherwise, this hotel is truly great and has the potential to be outstanding except for the food issues.

<Content>Beautiful Place Averaage Food Just returned from a 8 day vacation at the Princess...Having done my homework on ths resort , I really can't complain...I have to agree with most of the reviews...Beach is gorgeous..Rooms are very nice..Fridge is always stocked with water , coke and beer...Air Conditioning in room worked well and bed was comfortable...The food at best was mediocre ...I enjoyed the fondue retaurant the most....The buffet style breakfast and lunches got tiresome after a couple of days...My biggest complaint was that the MIlk was not really kept cold and I found the fruit not so special...The pool is great , especially the bar that sits in the pool...The beaches are gorgeous, the staff is friendly...I agree that the only thing stopping this from being a 5 star resort is the food...It is reallya beautiful resort so I wouldn't stop anyone from going there...Bring immodium and pepto bismol...Also bring sunscreen from home..bring more than you think you will need as the prices at the hotel store are high..So try to plan in advance any medicines or lotions that you need to bring with you so you don't overpay...Although I enjoyed the resort I probably would like to return to Punta Cana but I would spend a little more $$ and try to find a place with better food...

<Content>a wonderful vacation My Husband and I stayed at the Princess from 6/26 to 7/3 for our 15th wedding anniv. We had a great time! The resort was beautiful, our room was great (building 5, close to the beach and pool). We received a very nice welcome when we arrived, loved the fruit punch! We were able to get into our room early and we felt the room was perfect! The beach is fabulous and the beach beds......so comfortable! The pool was clean and refreshing. It would have been nice if the pool was open at night though..it's still hot and a night swim would be nice. We met some wonderful people....hi, San Antonio, Georgia, Virginia and Liverpool, England!! The staff was wonderful, we have no complaints....the girls/guys at the breakfast buffet, bartenders, animation team (Pablo, Luis, Celina...) were great!Our room was cleaned well, I liked that they knocked on our door around 6:00 pm each day to ask if we needed anything. We didn't get turn down service each night, but that's okay. The only (small) complaint I have is not enough bath towels. But if you could find a maid in the hall you could get more. The food was okay, not the best, not the worst. The best dinner we had was at the Shangay in the resort next door. It was definately my husband's favorite! The fondue restaurant was good, it's different......it's a long time in there. Fortunately, we did not get sick. We heard a lot of people talking about stomach problems. I actually gave Imodium out to people. Since we've been home our stomachs are a little off but nothing major. We did one excursion to Sanoa. Pedro from VIP travel couldn't have been nicer. He was very helpful, had a lot of information and booked our trip for us. Unfortunately it rained almost the whole trip! It was cold, wet and lots of mosquitos on Sanoa. If you go, bring your bug spray!! Miguel was our guide (from VIP travel) and he was very nice. He spoke very good English which was helpful when we had a sightseeing tour on the bus ride. We loved our vacation and we would definately go back to Punta Cana Princess!

<Content>Still sick!!! After reading many reviews on the Princess we decided to give it another chance. We were there 4 years ago and I got sick then. Not as sick as this time but my gut was not right for a month after returning home. The reviews seemed that there had been some improvement with the food but my experience was again, not good.  Yes, the beach,the rooms,weather are very good. Thats why we went back. The setting is beautiful,if only they could get their act together with the food it could be a 5 star resort. I was there one day and a half and I got diarrea. I was very careful and also had no drinks but bottled water and 2 beers. By thursday I had to go to the clinic. A very nice Dr. in the clinic on the grounds prescribed me anti- biotic, pills for my bowels, pepto bismol and intravenous drugs for 2 days, to the tune of $430. Nice vacation, I spent most of my time in the washrooms. I have never had anything like that in my life. I am back to work this week and still I'm on gatoraide for my electrolights because I'm feeling so weak.  It's not hard to figure out why people get sick. The buffet food is NEVER hot. It sits there room temp for hours. Sure there is plenty of food but all of it has no taste and is sitting there growing bacteria. I even tried a hard boiled egg,thinking that was safe. It was so over cooked,black yoke that just disentegrated it was so dry.My husband ordered a caesar salad at the Tex Mex and it came like soup with so much dressing on a hot plate.Don't bother trying to make a caesar if all you have is iceberg lettuce. The food is a joke. Will I go back? Never. I can spend my money in many other places with a nice beach and not get so sick ,it ruins my holiday. I went knowing it was not gourmet, I did not expect that. The only word I can use to describe the food is slop. By the way a wedding party had 5 sick people and another young couple from England were sick.My husband spoke to another lady that was ill also.  The animation team are so irritating. This is supposed to be a adult resort. I can make my own fun. I don't need someone pulling me out of my chair to teach me dance lessons or play volley ball. The music they blasted at the pool everyday was for their pleasure only. The same 4 songs every day. I did not see anyone else looking like they enjoyed it. as a matter of fact some people got very mad at them in the pool, they were so pushy and overbearing. People tried to ignore them but its pretty hard when the music is blasting and you can't get away from them, they just take over for 3-4 hours every afternoon. Go somewhere else!!!!

<Content>Lovely beach and resort grounds but that's it! We stayed at the PCP from June 18th throught the 25th and had the VIP package for what that is worth. We have been to many all-inclusives and consider ourselves not very picky or hard to please. Let me start out with the positives: Yes the gardens are well kept and we even tipped the gardeners for their hard work. The beach was nice, the water clear, the sand white and smooth. Expect to walk out about 15 feet and then it does drop off. The most beautiful beach we encountered was on our tour with the Dune Buggies. That beach was called Macao Beach. If you take this tour you will get extremely muddy and the mud doesn't come out of your clothes, so bring clothes that you don't care about. Do bring candy or treats for all the children that come out of their houses to bring you pictures and flowers. I gave a few of them a dollar, but wished we would have known to give them something else. Check in was smooth and you do get their punch and a cool washcloth which you will need after your very bumpy ride to the resort. Every resort I have been to has done the same thing though. It took about 45 minutes as you have to drop everyone else off and this is one of the last resorts. My advice would be is to get your own taxi to and from so you don't have to wait. Friends that we met paid 33 USD at night from the airport which is higher than their daytime fees. The conceirge service in the lobby was helpful, polite, took us to our room right away with our luggage. We did get the fruit basket, 1 small bottle of rum, 1 small box of 3 cigars, and the towel decorated with flowers. Yes the room stays moist as it is humid. Remember to bring a candle and it will keep your room smelling fresh all week long.The rooms need major updating. The bathrooms are very outdated. They were rusty. Our drain was always stopped up when taking our daily showers, wash cloths were only present on the first day, but we knew this and had brought our own. Maid service came in the early afternoon and late at night for turn down service which was a nice touch.We stayed in the 5000 building on the bottom floor which was nice since it was 20 feet from the pool. We are not early risers and we were never disturbed by any pool noise. Some friends had the third floor and said the high ceilings made your room feel larger and they could see the ocean. There were many channels to watch about 1/4 in English.The food: After reading the reviews I expected way more than what was spoken about. The Tex-Mex filet mignon I received was tough but my husband's was cooked just right but not anything to brag about. The plates always come out hot and so will your caesar salad. This is really the only salad to speak of here at the resort. Everytime you get a drink, make sure you ask for your glass to be filled with ice or you will be drinking hot whatever you drink. This is throughout the resort. Il Bacio, the italian restaurant was way below average. I ended up getting sick after eating the smallest portion of lasagna I have ever been served. They did serve my husband a second piece to compensate for him being able to eat it in 4 bites. Our friends said they had enjoyed it there and got big helping of the raviolis and fettucini. We never ate at the Fondue but heard it was good. Our friends said it took 3 hours and there was no ac in there and it became very hot in there once they served the different fondues to everyone.They also said the seafood restaurant was good, but we don't care for seafood so we didn't eat there. All the buffets were way below average. There is no taste to any of the food and it is very bland. Luckily I survived off of rice and bread all week. Everyone we met got sick at the resort including us and we could never pinpoint what we ate or if it was what we drank. The bar tenders were average and not very animated compared to other places we have been to. The drinks were just ok. And I finally had to make up my own drink for the week as they could never get it right. There is no cranberry juice here, nor coconut rum or real orange juice. The margaritas are nasty and they don't even carry any named brand tequila. The animation team is just plain annoying. The same stupid dancing and yelling of applauso throughout the day at the pool made you not want to be there. We had our everyday players for volleyball in the pool which was fun except we had to fight the animation team to get a decent ball everyday to play. Then once we were out there, they harrassed us to do their activity which we didn't want to do, so they would come over into our game and try to take over. The gift shop was way over priced compared to anything else. If you want to get deals you must go down to the beach about 1 mile to the left. You must heavily barter to get a cheapy cheapy price. They will give you the calculator and tell you what do you want to pay. We always ended up paying half of what they were asking. Don't pay more than 5 dollars for any shirt or hat. Coffee should be around $6 and windchimes $20.Paintings $20-30 medium sized. Make sure you bring pants and dress shoes for the guys as you can't get into any of the restaurants except the buffets without them. We thought this was ridiculous as the girls could come in with just shorts,flip flops and a tank top. Go figure! We went to to Caribe Princess for the shows. One day we had walked over there to find out no shows were going on even though it was advertised. Would we go back to the PCP or the Dominican Republic again? No. Just a note Our best waiter for the week was Serapio at the Beach Breakfast Buffet. He was so attentive and really went out of his way. If you go in to the Bavaro Shopping Center, expect to be called names and be insulted over trying to barter. They don't want to go down even a 1/4 and I guess they don't need the money even though it was one of the most poorest countries with trash everywhere, with dead animals on the side of the road waiting to be slaughtered. The roads were the worst I have seen and wehave been to many places. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me for an honest review. Hi to Victor, Pura, Adrienne, Todd, Terry and Bob. Shoot us an email we would love to hear from you.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess is Just Perfect! A group of 6 of us (mid-20鈥檚/early-30鈥檚) stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from June 16-21, 2008. We were all in Bldg. 4 on the 3rd floor 鈥?great views of the pool and ocean! The resort seemed only 陆 full while we were there 鈥?plenty of chairs on the beach and at the pool! Overall, we loved this resort 鈥?the size, friendliness of the staff, food, atmosphere, etc. The resort is smaller (less than 300 rooms), but still has the same amenities as larger resorts. We liked the fact that it is adults-only 鈥?not having to vie for seats at the pool bar with kids drinking virgin drinks! J This overall made for a quieter, calmer resort as well. Rooms 鈥?Beautiful, did not feel they needed 鈥渦pdating鈥?as some have mentioned. We liked the island-y feel and vaulted wood ceilings. We were platinum guests 鈥?thus had the rum, cigars, fruit basket, robes/slippers, stocked mini-bar, etc. I鈥檓 not sure, but this may be the standard. There was a note that we could upgrade to 鈥淰IP鈥?for $15/day with a 4 day minimum. I personally didn鈥檛 feel it was worth it, unless you really want the massage and special meal. Beach beds (actual beds, not the chairs under palapas) seem to be open to all 鈥?and they are HEAVENLY!!! (this may have been because the resort was not crowded and all and 戮 of the beach beds were not being used every day).Beach 鈥?Clean and beautiful. Beach beds and chairs/palapas are both nice. Water was warm/refreshing. Great breeze off the water. We did have a server on the beach, Francisco, who also manned the beach bar. He鈥檚 great! Excursions 鈥?While exiting the water our first day we were approached by Fernando, who was selling boat/snorkeling trips. We 鈥渂ooked鈥?a trip with him (he鈥檚 with Cayena we think 鈥?he had a yellow shirt on). This trip was AWESOME and only $25/person for over 2 hours 鈥?just the 6 of us were on a smaller boat. They took us to the big roped off snorkeling area in the water, passed by the sharks/rays/dolphins area, went to the natural pool (all 3 of these are parts of the 鈥渂ig鈥?snorkeling trips that are $70-$90), and then took us around the shipwreck (which we requested). 2 of us girls also got to sit up on the padded area at the very front of the boat for the ride and sun ourselves! It was a fun trip and I鈥檇 totally recommend it! The other commercial snorkeling trips take longer to get the 50 or so people on/off the boat, once in the water everyone is crowded and kicking each other trying to snorkel (we left soon after the big boat arrived), and the only thing extra you get is some rum punch and mamajuana! I鈥檇 definitely advise 鈥?GO FIND FERNANDO (he walks along the water in front of and to the left of the PCP).Food/Drinks 鈥?We enjoyed the food. Breakfast and lunch buffets were good. Breakfast 鈥?yummy omelets made to order, fresh chocolate croissants, lots of fruit, etc. Lunch at the main buffet was good too 鈥?they had a fresh pasta station, grill (chicken skewers were amazing!), and my favorite, the freshly tossed Caesar salad area. I really like all the made-to-order stations. Lunch at the beach buffet was OK 鈥?good for a quick pressed sandwich with the freshly grilled chicken! The fries (with the nacho cheese sauce!) and pizza at the beach bar were excellent. NOTE: All a la carte restaurants are not open every night 鈥?check with the front desk to find out which nights each restaurant is open. Dinner 鈥?we ate at 4 a la cartes: Swiss/La Petite Fondue (the Chinois sliced beef was delicious, shrimp app. fondue and swiss cheese fondue were both great, brought us a bunch of cold apps. too, chocolate dessert was yummy!), Italian/Il Bacio (florentine chicken was good, great bruschetta app., good service), Tex Mex/R铆o Grande (great food and service, filet was better than the other cut of steak offered, cheese sticks app. were the best we鈥檝e ever had, interesting 鈥渕argaritas鈥?, and Asian/Shangay at Caribe Club Princess (the beef dish and chicken/broccoli dish were great, fried rice was good, fried ice cream 鈥?AMAZING!!!). The boys ate at Brazilian/Rodizzio at Tropical Princess when the girls ate at Shangay and they said it was OK. One word of advice 鈥?if you go to the Dominican Beach Party on Tuesday night, go early or plan to eat somewhere else and then go to the party later. We went at 9pm and the roasted pig was pretty much gone and the 鈥渃old鈥?salads had been sitting out for hours (I ended up getting a stomachache that night). One thing I tried right before we left that I wish we鈥檇 went to more was the Creperie at the Caribe Club/Tropical Princess. As for drinks 鈥?they鈥檙e all great. If you want top-shelf liquor, just ask for it. I had many blended Absolut vodka/lemonades. The Caribe Club/Tropical Princess lobby bar had tons of top-shelf liquor 鈥?again, just ask. The usual blended fruity drinks are always good (but melt so fast!). Presidente with a lime is always a solid choice too! Nelson at the pool bar was great!Atmosphere 鈥?Our group loved the Anamacion team, especially Jose and Louis!!! They had fun activities/pool games during the day and Friday night was karaoke. They have so much energy 鈥?passing out sangria, organizing games, etc. Nightlife was pretty calm (except for karaoke night). We went to the Caribe Club/Tropical Princess (really 1 big resort) several nights for the Arieto disco and show (Lion King 鈥?surprisingly pretty good!). The lobby bar at Caribe Club/Tropical Princess was also pretty happening. We also went to the Tower Casino one night 鈥?fun atmosphere there! The staff overall at the PCP was EXCELLENT 鈥?so friendly! We never felt that tips were expected, but gave them because of such great service. So, we loved the Punta Cana Princess. The resort itself (grounds, rooms, etc.), atmosphere, staff, food/drinks, etc. 鈥?we could not have asked for more!

<Content>LOVED IT! Don't listen to the bad reviews! I'm a NY girl, I know my stuff! I stayed at this resort from June 14-20th. Let me tell you, this resort was great. Don't listen to the bad reviews of people complaining about the animation team, or the food. These people don't know what their talking about. The animation team is SUPPOST to be loud and get people into a vacation feel. What do you expect? I'm from NY so I'm a picky eater. The food wasn't the best I've ever had, but it wasn't horrible. There was always something I could eat.The grounds are beautiful, and the beach, breath-taking. The people who work there really go out of their way for you. Can we please keep in mind that this is a 3rd world country, so if your not happy with something, chances are it's because your so use to living easy in your home-town. My boyfriend and I visited Manati Park. If your thinking of swimming with Dolphins, that's the place to go. I've been wanting to for so long, however when we went we didn't have enough money on us. (I guess we just have to go back then!)The Fondue place, and Tex-Mex were the best resturants on the resort. The food was great, and the atmosphere was nice. Overall, please don't listen to the bad reviews, these are people who are probably high-strung, and are living in mansions LoL.

<Content>ONCE WAS ENOUGH I am in full agreement with the folks from Atlanta. They could not have described it better. We stayed May 31-June 7 and I was happy to come home. While the beaches and resort are lovely, there is nothing to make up for the inedible food and loud anamation team. It was nice to visit but once was enough. Oh! And the transfers to and from the airport? SCARY!!! Do not trust everyone's wonderful reviews. While the main buffet claims to have theme nights, every time it all looked the same. I don't go away just to eat but I do not want to starve either. ITS BETTER IN THE BAHAMAS!!!

<Content>This place is AWESOME! Don't believe the bad reviews this place is awesome. We just returned from our honeymoon May 30- Jun 6, 2008. I wanted to write a review as soon as I got back.  We arrived on a Friday, when we got to the hotel check-in was a breeze. We booked a Platinum package(definately the way to go). The hotels website didn't have any platinum packages available, but we were able to book one on Bookit.com.  I am in the food business, so good food is important to me! The food here was good. It's not great and it's not San Francisco or New Orleans, but the food is good. Even finicky eaters will find something they like here. The ala carte restaurants were better than the buffet, generally, but the buffet was good as well. We also got married at the resort. It was a wonderful experience. The staff could not do enough for us! Even when it was raining the day we got married they moved us from the beach to the lobby and made everything great. I can't say enough about the staff at the Punta Cana Princess. One thing we did was take alot of 1's and 5's in US currency and tipped everybody. We were treated like kings. What most Americans don't understand is if you treat people with the respect they deserve in THEIR COUNTRY, they in turn will treat you with courtesy and respect. I have traveled all over the world and the Dominican people are some of the best we've ever encountered. If you want to have a great no stress vacation book the Punta Cana Princess!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Do not go. They are running a bait and switch. We booked for adults only, small resort and paid for Platinum VIP service. When we arrived, we were there were no rooms available and they were transferring us to a sister resort. They tried to make it sound like they were upgrading us but we had paid for the upgrade already and did not want to go to a large resort. We personally met 4 other couples that had the same thing happen to them and were also very unhappy. We could not believe it - and that's just the few people we met. Imagine how many others it happened to. When you complain the staff just look at you and say there is nothing they can do. You needed to use a trolley to get around the resort. which is very inconvenient. The housekeeping was not good - once our room still was not cleaned by 5:30 and once by 7:00 pm - both times we had to call for housekeeping. We called for towels 3 times another time, and never got them. Food was OK but certainly not up to the rating. There was supposed to be butler service on the beach, but we never saw anyone the week we were there. Definitely not worth the extra money. We were very unhappy with this resort and would never go back or recommend it to anyone. We have been to 3 other facilities in Punta Cana, and would recommend any of them.We wrote Bookit (who we reserved through) to complain and never got a response. Once they have your money they do not care.

<Content>Great choice for adults-only Resort:The resort was very beautiful and well-maintained. It was laid out very nicely and not a far walk from anywhere. We stayed in Building 5 which is closet to the beach and looks out to the pool. If you like to nap in the room it can get a little noisy around the pool at 3 when the activities group plays games, but we were mostly at the beach so it didnt matter. We went the 1st week of May and the weather was absolutely perfect-it rained for 15 minutes total the first 2 days and that was it.Rooms:We had a platinum suite which i don't think is much different from the other rooms except you have a bottle of rum and cigars in your room upon arrival. Rooms were tidy and maids were great, especially when you tip them. You could tell a little updating was needed, The bathroom showed it the most and we had a mysterious leak by patio doors but it was only during the last couple days. Activity:I loved the fact this resort was adults-only. Having no kids running around the pool or crying at dinner was great. It was very peaceful. If you're coming to do a lot of activities this is more of a laidback setting. The 2 sister resorts had restaurants and a casino if you wanted to go there. Excursions are offered-my boyfriends parents went horseback riding and rode thru the towns to get to the ranch, which was a little scary.Food;We enjoyed the food and didn't get sick at all. We didn't drink the water they pour at dinner, just stuck to beer, soda or juices. The 2 restaurants at the Princess were good-loved the tex-mex one!People: The people who worked there were very nice. Communication was ok if you knew a few spanish words for the maids to understand what you needed (washcloth, soap).Overall it was an enjoyable and relaxing vacation. The first time we went out of the country to vacation-beach is more beatiful than I could describe. The tipping could get to be a little much but that is probably more my fault beause I can be a sucker. I might go back but most likely will try to visit other places

<Content>Punta Cana Princess Paradise!!!! My husband and I went with another couple to Punta Cana Princess. We stayed from May 21-May 28. This was our first time to an all-inclusive resort  our first time in the Dominican Republic  we absolutely loved it! I did extensive research before we booked this  our vacation was worth every penny we spent!AIRPORT:No problem getting through customs. I read that there was a $10 tourist entry fee at the airport, so we were prepared. A guide led us to our VIP Travel services rep  we got on an air-conditioned van. Then we were on our way to the resort.CHECK-IN:This went a whole lot smoother than I expected. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted with a cold cloth (which was a break from the heat) and a welcome drink. I requested rooms in building 5 (closest to the beach  pool) and our travel agent hooked us up with rooms in building 5, and our friends were in the room next door. ROOMS:Honestly, the rooms could use a decorative update, but we were only in the rooms to sleep  change clothes, so it wasn't a big deal. Our king sized bed was very comfortable! I have back problems, and it's hard for me to sleep comfortably in hotel beds, but I never had any back pains the whole time we were there! My husband enjoyed our free cigars and rum in our Platinum room. I liked the stocked mini-fridge (coke, sprite, beer,  plenty of water). The maids cleaned our room twice a day  we tipped them generously. Never saw a bug in our room.BEACH:This was my favorite part! They brag about the world's best beaches  I would have to agree. White sand  clear warm waters were wonderful. I really loved the canopy beach beds because you can control how much sun you get.FOOD:We didn't have any problems with the food at all. We ate at all the a la carte restaurants at our resort. We liked the Fondue (get the shrimp appetizer  meat variety enree)  the Tex Mex (highly recommend the steak, fajitas,  ribs) resaurants the best. We ate at the buffet (La Casabe) for breakfast  lunch most days. The buffet had more selection for lunch than the beach buffet. We ate at the buffet in the Caribe resort for breakfast once, but it wasn't much different than our resort. We did try the Brazilian restaurant at the Caribe resort, but we weren't impressed. We had all been to Brazil before, and the food in Brazil was much better, plus 3 out of the 4 of us had bad stomach issues the next day.SERVICE:This was one of the main reasons why we chose this resort over others. I read reviews here for months on this resort  everyone kept complimenting the service here. We prefer good service over luxury. All the workers greeted you with Hola  had a big smile on their faces. They were always busily working to serve the guests (which we rewarded generously with tips). Whatever you wanted, they'd go over and beyond to make sure you got it.BARS:The drinks kept coming. Ask for premium liquor because they have it. The lobby bar was the best out of all of them, but the swim-up bar was cool. We hit the swim-up bar around 4-5PM most days.The Presidente beer with a lime is good. Highly recommend the Coco Loco, Mamajuana (they call it Dominican viagra),  Blue Lagoon. OTHER INFO  ADVICE:*Bring around $50 in small bills to tip because most workers there work 12hr. days for little money.*Go to the tanning bed (or have somewhat of a tan) before you go. Three of us did  we never got burned. Of course, we applied sunscreen every so often too.*Bring SPF 30 and above sunscreen. We did and we didn't get burned, plus we got even better tans.*Bring Febreeze or another air freshener because it can be a little musty in the room sometimes. Keeping the A/C going helps.*Try learning some Spanish before you go. The workers will love to teach you  they like it when you speak Spanish to them. They appreciate your effort. It might help to bring a Spanish dictionary.*Drink more water than alcohol. I know that's a given, but especially because it is soooo hot there. Their water is filtered, so it's okay to drink (except the tap in the bathrooms).*Only the Fondue, Tex Mex,  Italian restaurants have air-conditioning. The buffet, seafood restaurant,  lobby do not have A/C, so keep that in mind.*The resort is adults only. We liked not having kids around. However, some people did go topless, but it wasn't a big deal.If you're thinking about coming to the Punta Cana Princess, I'd highly recommend it! We looked at other resorts  talked to others staying at other resorts  the Princess sounded the best to us all. For the price  service, it was worth it!

<Content>Great time at the Princess Our party of 8 stayed at the PCP from May 18th to the 25th. We were all in agreement that the week was a success.Check in was effortless. We were in our rooms and changed within an hour. The suites are good size and adequate for a weeks stay. Glad to have the mini-fridge and coffee maker. Off to a good start!The first sight of the beach and ocean was breathtaking! The sand was so soft. We got a drink at the bar and just took in the clean air and the peace and quiet.Our days were mostly spent at the beach in the a.m. (beach beds way cool) and poolside in the afternoon. We did venture into Bavaro plaza for shopping and found Steves Corner Bar. A must! Some of us did swimming with the dolphins at Manati Park, others did horseback riding, and the Carribean festival. All were enjoyed. Everyone was pleasantly surprised with the food. Alot of choices, as one guest doesn't eat red meat or chicken. Ate breakfast and lunch at Casabe and dinners at different restaurants. (La Cave, Shanghay, Mare Norstrum, Tues. night beach party, Tex Mex.) The only one we wouldn't have gone to again would be the Fondue. It just took way to long.We contacted guest services and had a private table and dinner on the beach for my friends 40th Birthday. It was spectacular. One that she will never forget. The wait staff, maids, guest services, etc. were proffesional and friendly. We had one problem with a dinner reservation, but guest services fixed it in no time. Do bring bug spray. Those buggers loved my sweet blood! I was the only one out of the 8. But I dealt with it and enjoyed the rest of my stay, bites and all!All in all, if we were to return to the DR, the consensus of the 8 of us would be to go back to the PCP!

<Content>A little piece of Heaven Early May 2008, I was given the wonderful gift of a week long vacation to your Punta Cana Princess Resort. As a first time traveller, I knew nothing of what to expect. I was accompanied by a very good friend  my daughter.It was the experience of a lifetime! Beautiful country with beautiful people. Amazing sunshine, beach, ocean, beds on the beach (a must have!)  pool. Truly wonderful Resort with exceptional staff, in every area. Loved the food offered at both the buffets  the restaurants. Great waiters/waitresses, bartenders  housekeeping staff/grounds keepers (so clean!) Staff was always smiling! Enjoyed the Disco  Casino. Animation team were fantastic on the beach, around the pool  in the lobby. Never a dull moment!The portion of the vacation that I least enjoyed was returning to Canada,  leaving your wonderful country, people  Resort behind. We will be returning to Punta Cana  hope to be bringing new faces along with us. Hope to see you next spring at the Punta Cana Princess Resort! FABULOUS!

<Content>WOW we loved it Punta Cana PrincessWe just got back on Sat May -23rd,and loved every minute of it,the reviews we read before the trip could not have been more accurate.First of all the sheer beauty of this place is unbelievable,the grounds are immaculate,and the beach was incredible,more than we had anticipated. We spent alot of time on the beach,always reserved a palapa by getting up early.The food on the resort was excellent,although some people are different than other's,every one has a bad day i guess you could say. Cold beer and pizza and nacho's for lunch,or go to the buffet.Excellent buffet breakfast in the morning,we never missed,the juices are a little sweet. Mare Nostrum was our favourite restaurant,lobster,wine ,beef ,mashed potatoes etc.There are so many things to list,and you problably have read all the other reviews,just go and check it out.Oh and one more thing..there were no bugs in our room,a few people had mosquitoe bites,but nothing to complain about,4000-5000 wings have the best ocean and pool views.DONT BE CHEAP! these people are very polite and helpful and extremely hardworking,tip them.Lobby at night for a good time.Lots of toplessness on the beach,its adult only and it is a mixed bag so dont get upset just go with it.We are going back next year hope we see the same people we met this time.KevBrenOntario

<Content>Punta Cana Princess, 5/18, 2008 The hotel itself is impressive in decor and spotless. Beautiful grounds, big pool, gorgeous beach with canopy beds waterside.Our room was nice, and a bottle of rum, cigars and basket of fresh fruit were there upon arrival.Maids were very efficient. Small fridge was stocked with Sprite, Coke, beer, and two large water bottles.Beach towels were included, so you did not to bring any.On to the restaurants- You need to make reservations, and can make as many as 3 ahead of time. Tried the Fondue place. Atmosphere was nice an intimate. The food was fair, and it took 2-21/2 hours to finish, due to the long waits for the fondue.Regular drinks are included. We decided to pay for two bottles of wine. While the meal is all included, we left a 20- (US) tip on a 90-tab for the wine. This was met with a rather displeased look by the manager, as if it wasn't enough. That turned me off to the restaurant for the rest of our stay. a 20% tip is generous, especially when tipping is not necessary in an all-inclusive.The Italian restaurant was excellent! The carpaccio, bruschetta, and Tartalle pasta were all delicious. Dessert was delightful, and the cappucino was wonderful.The buffet changes nightly and provides salads, breads, and themed nights for food. A lot of the food was of the greasy type.Pastas can be made to order. The breakfast buffet was quite good with fresh juices, fruits, yogurts, crepes, waffles, ham, bacon, and omelets and eggs made to order.The Mare Nostrum is open 24/7, and the bar next to it as well. The food is ok and standard: appetizers, salads, burgers, fries, pizza, and you can make a panini.BEWARE! You DO need BUG SPRAY! The mosquitos at night can be awful!For great meals, at an additional price, book La Cava and El Pescador at the sister hotel. They are 25- and 32- per person, but well worth it. THE ONLY PROBLEM is getting a shuttle from one hotel to the next. We waited for 45 minutes! This happened frequently, and was quite annoying, as we kept being told 15 minutes.The Disco Arrieta was a lot of fun. Opens at 11 p.m., and you drink free until midnight. Tower Casino was okay, ask for coupons before you go, to double your bet, or play 10- free.The shops downtown are sketchy. The shops in our hotel are OK. The Caribe had nicer shops.The sting ray and swim with sharks was worth every penny. BUT make sure you eat a good meal and bring snacks. They push the 151 rum, and Mamajawna. You can get drunk real easy. I would also bring your own snorkeling, as they do not clean it well.It was a nice trip, great with a bunch of friends.

<Content>Can't get much better. My wife and I are in our 50's and have been to the Islands several times. We just returned from the Punta Cana Princess and rate it as one of the best we have stayed at. We stayed at Sandals in Antigua a few years ago and we weren't as impressed as we were with the Princess. We read some bad reviews about the resort, but after staying there we just don't agree.The staff is what makes the difference. They are hard working, friendly and go out of their way to please the guests. The food was plentiful and good. The grounds are the best we have ever seen. The beach is cleaned twice a day.Don't get me wrong, there were monor problems but nothing to spoil a great vacation. I found we have more complaints regarding some of the guests. We witnessed some of the guests treated the staff like dogs, yelling at them and complaining they didn't speak english, (dah your in their country.) We saw another guest fill a dirty water bottle with juice at the buffet and another walking around the buffet with their fork picking at the food as she went along.In other reviews people complained about the mosquitoes. We found this to be false. If you want to fight a war with mosquitoes come to Ocean county in New Jersey and hang out at dusk on a humid July night.We would highly recommend the Punta Cana Princess to anyone who want to have a great vacation.

<Content>Great Stay Just return last night May 8, 08, from a 6 day stay here and overall it was an excellent break. If you want to relax just lay by the pool or on the beach this is the place, if you want to party and all that try another resort. They do have exchange privileges with some of their other properties that have a casino and disco, so you can always go there to get your party on.FoodAverage, it will get you through.PropertyNice and CleanRoomNice - top floor has vault ceiling, nice touch when it rains.StaffVery helpful

<Content>Didn't Exceed Expectations My husband and I went to the Dominican Republic as part of a larger vacation (we stayed in Florida for a few days prior and a day after our Dominican trip). We chose the Dominican because it was reasonably priced and was easy to travel to from the Florida area. We chose the Princess Punta Cana resort because it was an Adult Only All-Inclusive resort and had favorable reviews on the site.Accommodations: We stayed in a top floor suite and the room was beautiful. The high ceilings and large daybed were nice surprises. Housekeeping was not exceptional; everything seem to be done in stages and began early in the morning so after the first day we did not get new towels and were left without washcloths for the remainder of our stay (the towel person came knocking before we got of bed in the morning so we always had to turn her away). The in-room mini-bar was limited - two bottles of pop, two beers and two bottles of water all restocked daily and one bottle of local whiskey.Amenities: Pool was very nice, kept at a comfortable temperature and the swim up bar is always great. However, there were a limited number of chairs, daybeds, and tiki huts which all filled up by early morning. There was a rule about not saving spaces but who wants to get into a fight with someone over a chair when you are confined to the resort space with them for the next few days? The beachside huts and daybeds, when available, were fantastic. Huts were especially nice when it rained all day 鈥?allowed us to be outside but kept us dry. And surprisingly all of the nightlife activities were next door at the family resort so this resort was very quiet after dinner.Service: I have to admit that the service was below my expectations. I have previously stayed at all-inclusive resorts (Sandals begin the most recent) and resort staff is generally exceptional. One thing I was not happy with was tipping for everything was expected and didn鈥檛 seem appreciated. Also, while US $ was the standard in the resort, the resort staff was very limited in their English language skills. I have generally had a feeling of pampering when I stay at all-inclusive resorts and here I felt like I was intruding most of the time.Food  Beverage: Definitely edible, I certainly didn鈥檛 starve during my stay. The fondue restaurant was fun and it was nice to have options outside of buffets. I was disappointed in the 鈥減remium鈥?shelf liquor. As a VIP guest we were suppose to have access to the premium liquors however it was difficult to find any. I think they keep any name-brand liquors hidden in cabinets at the bars and you have to ask specifically for them when ordering drinks.Overall, the trip was very nice; the island was gorgeous, the resort was satisfactory and beaches were great.

<Content>Great trip but not perfect My husband and I along with two other couples traveled to the Punta Cana Princess the beginning of April 2008. Overall I have to say we really enjoyed this resort, however we did have some problems. This may be a bit long but bare with me, hopefully it will give a good honest review.Flight - We travelled down with the Regency Club through Air Transat. Flight was fine. It was very early in the morning and a bit cramped but I guess that is to be expected on these kinds of airlines. Bus to the resort was actually a lot of fun. Check in - Check in on the other hand did not go so well. If you go here and have someone by the name of Solomon serve you at the front desk wait for someone else. He was rude and just overall a jerk. We had requested to be in the same building as our friends and we had also requested king beds. They had us in separate buildings in two double beds. Also we had been told that Regency Club guests were in either building 4 or 5. This is not the case. You only get in building 5 if you specifically book an oceanview room, which was not offered to us at the time of booking. However if you kick up enough of a stink and maybe throw in a few tears they are pretty quick to try to accomodate you. They were not able to do anything for us the first night but asked us to come down the next morning and they would move us which they did. We also waited a long time for our luggage to arrive at our room got fed up and finally went and got our own. So once we were all situated in our final rooms for the week everything went much better.Rooms - We ended up in a king room in building 1. I was a little concerned about this but actually the room we were in was really nice. We were in 1009. It was very spacious and very clean. The bed was surprisingly comfortable and the shower had good pressure. May seem trivial to some but I like a shower with pressure. The rooms do however have a smell to them. Not a bad smell but I was wishing I had brought a scented candle or some room spray. I did brew some coffee and that helped. It is almost an over air conditioned smell or something but not so bad that it bothered you.Resort - The resort itself was beautiful. The grounds were so well kept and everything was clean. The pool was really nice with a swim up bar. We really didn't have much trouble finding a lounge chair but if you want a bed you had better plan to be out early, like 6-6:30 am. We really didn't care and really didn't want to get up that early so we just took what we could find. Although you are not suppose to, everyone does reserve with towels and books.A la Carte Restaurants - We ate at all of the a la cartes with the exception of Mare Nostrum in the evening. We really enjoyed La Petite Fondue. The Tex Mex Steakhouse was good as well. The Italian was OK for the main dishes but the starters they bring are delicious. We also tried two restauarants over at the other resort. We ate at the Mexican which again was good and the Chinese which I think was my favourite. The starters there were excellent as well and I really enjoyed my curry chicken dish. However we had two who had the pork and did not enjoy it and one who had the beef and said it wasn't very good either.Buffet - We ate primarily at the main buffet up by the lobby for breakfast and we alternated between there and the Mare Nostrum for lunch. The selection is better at the main buffet but I did enjoy the nachos and pizza down by the beach. The Mare Nostrum also had one of our favourite waiters, Sarapio. Another great person was Santa. We ate at the buffet one night and it was fine. You really don't go to an all inclusive for the food.I guess that is about it. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Punta Cana Princess. It was relaxing and quiet. The fact that it was adults only was a real bonus as we were there for a relaxing take it easy kind of time. Now I will warn that this is not a party resort. There isn't much in the way of night life. There were activities in the lobby at night that we went to but at the end of the day we were so exhausted we really weren't all that interested in night life. There is however a disco on the other resort you can go to if you want a party. So if you are looking to just kick back and relax in a quiet surrounding definitely consider this resort.

<Content>2 Weeks at the Punta Cana Princess We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess From April 7 to April 21 and our stay at the resort was for the most part enjoyable.This is a lovely well kept resort . The grounds are perfect and the pool and beach are spectacular. This resort seems to be maintained better than its two sister resorts next door.We found the food to be better than most resorts we have visited ( 4th time to the DR) and there were always lots of choice at the buffett each night. We ate at 4 of the restaurants are they were all good - Steak house, mexican, fondue and italian. The restaurants on the resort don't take reservations so you need to show up early (before 7PM) or you could be in for a long wait. The restaurants of the sister resorts next door need to be reserved and I like this better as you know there will be a table available for you.This is a very quiet resort with little night life - after 10PM everybody is gone to bed, Perfect if this is what you want but don't expect it to be party central. You can go next door to see a show or go to the disco (only has free drinks from 11-12) if you want a bit more nightlife.I had a few issues with trying to get a place to lie down at the beach or pool. People are up as early as 5:30 reserving their chairs and by 8;00 there is nothing left. Hotel policy says this is not allowed but everyone including the staff ignores this. They really could use more loungers on both the pool and beach areas.Service at the buffett is good but there were times that it seems the staff were overworked and it was difficult to get a second glass of wine or water.The biggest issue I had was with fly bites. The first week we were there it was windy day and night and we had a few bites despite wearing repellant every day. On our second week the wind died down and we were literally eaten alive. I was getting 3 or 4 new bites each day and the old bites would not heal. It came to the point I did not want to go out after dark as I could not handle getting any new bites. There were not Mosquitoes but very small flies that had a huge bite and did not seem to know that DEET was not the main course for their dinner..This resort and its two sisters resorts are surrounded by a huge swamp that is the perfect breeding ground for these pesky bugs. Their were alot of people complaining about this on our trip home. For this reason I would not return to this resort as the bites were very painful - enough that I could not sleep at night. The bites on my arms became infected and I am now taking antibiotics 4 a day for 10 days to clear this up.They really need to deal with this issue if they want people to return.

<Content>Great Resort, So Much Fun!! My sister and I went to this resort for our annual Mommies Vacation from March 28th to April 4th, 2008. We have been away every year for the last ten years to many different tropical resorts. This resort was definitely our favourite to date. The front desk staff were very friendly and accomodating. Our first room was on the main floor and we really did not want to be on the ground floor. When we went to speak with the front desk -Julio - a very handsome man - happily changed our room to a third floor room. The room was incredible. We had wonderful views of both the pool and the ocean. The room service is fantastic. I don't see many people mentioning it but it is available 24 hours a day and they deliver your order very promptly. (I really liked the salads on the room service menu - I acutally found them to be better than the salad at the buffet. ) The staff at the resort are by far the nicest I have ever encountered at a resort. All of them SMILE constantly and are very pleasant and try very hard to speak English with you. The bartenders are very nice - but I did find that they do not serve the international brands of liquor and beer unless you ask for it and it gets kind of tiring to always have to ask when you go to order a drink. The bars all close at midnight except for the beach bar and they do not budge on this. A group of us were in the lobby one night and they would not serve anyone a drink after 12:00. This is not a complaint - they still have one bar open 24 hours - but when you are enjoying yourselves in the lobby - it is a pain to walk all the way to the beach bar to get drinks. The animation staff are really this nicest I have ever met. Jesus, Jose and the rest of the animation team are very pleasant and try really hard. It was the perfect balance for me because I don't really care to get all involved when I am away - there is just enough to do and they are not in your face all day trying to get you to do things you don't want to do. (My sister, on the other hand, loves to participate and managed to keep herself busy all week joining in most of the organized activities!) I could go on and on about this fabulous resort. We met so many incredible people who will remember and think of often. Thanks again to everyone at the PCP and all the great people we met who made this a trip to remember!

<Content>Fantastic vacation at a fantastic resort My husband and I just returned April 11/08 from a glorious week at the Punta Cana Princess. This resort is amazing, we have absolutely nothing negative to say about it. I won't go into detail as the other reviews have pretty much covered everything. The resort is beautiful, well maintained, impeccable grounds. The beach is awesome, white sand, turqoise water. Everything is very clean, the pool deck is scrubbed every morning. Our room was always cleaned well everyday. The food was great in all the restaurants. The staff at all restaurants and bars were great, especially at the Mare Nostrum, which serves breakfast and lunch and then turns into the seafood restaurant at night. Would highly recommend this restaurant for a nice seafood dinner. We can't say enough about it. We religiously checked the reviews before we booked our vacation and even afterwards, and all that was said in the positive reviews is 110% true. It's a great resort to go to if you want to relax and unwind. There is not a lot of partying going on, you can get that at the Caribe and Tropical Princess next door to this resort. We found that people liked to get up really early, 6:00a.m., and reserve the palapas around the pool and the beach so.....if you're an early bird, we would highly recommend doing this, if not, chances are you will still find chairs or a bed. Bring mosquito repellant as there are quite a few in the lobby which is where the nightly entertainment takes place and people congregate at night to chat and have a few drinks. Ask for Emilio at the lobby bar, he will treat you well. Check it out for yourselves, you won't be disappointed. We would definetly go back to this resort.

<Content>Better than expected A couple friends and I stayed at Princess for a week in February 2008. I've been to a few all inclusive resorts in the last few years and this was my first time in DR. Punta Cana is a very developed tourist area and there were many resorts to choose from. I found it difficult to narrow down my choices, but ultimately it was the recommendations from TripAdvisor and the cost that helped me decide on Princess.The reviews I read all had good things to say about the resort and I don't recall anything bad standing out in my mind.With that being said, I was somewhat worried about whether everything would run smoothly. Because there were three of us staying in one room I was worried about whether we would get a room with the right number of beds, towels, etc. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find that, yes indeed, there were enough towels in our room. Sometimes it's the little details like that that make the difference between relaxation and stress.I wanted to write this review to point out that I feel Princess is well run. There always seemed to be help available, seating at restaurants, chairs around the pool, etc. The grounds were well maintained, the staff were friendly, and many staff made an effort to get to know us. I had a less than ideal experience with food in Cuba, but I found the food at Princess surprisingly good, especially the lobster tail one night.A final note about the resort. My friends and I range from 26-33 and while we found the resort to be an older crowd (adults only), we enjoyed the quiet, relaxing aspect of the resort. There were fun activities available, but what was great was that we had access to the two neighbouring resorts where the guests were noticeably younger and more interested in partying.

<Content>Great Resort My husband and I spent our 10th anniversary at this resort. We booked the Platinum Package through Vacations To Go which I recommend. We go somewhere twice a year, always all inclusive Caribbean and Mexico, so we are familiar with what to expect. Other that one minor thing this was a great resort. I would rate this a solid 4, maybe 4 1/2 out of 5.First the bad:When we got to the resort we were told it was our lucky day we were being upgraded to a Honeymoon Suite. When we booked I requested a regular room in Bldg. 5 by the beach. We were given a room in Bldg. 3. It is the building farthest from the beach and the room was on the top floor at the far end. I wasn't happy about the location but the view was AWFUL! We were overlooking the resort dump. Broken palapas, etc. The room was done in all white with a balcony and whirlpool bath. Being all white, it showed every scuff. It could have used a paint job. The next morning we switched to a room in Bldg 1. This was a regular room but was MUCH nicer. The front desk was nice about the switch.The good:Everything else. The grounds are very pretty. The pool is really nice, although a little cool for my taste. Wonderful pool beds and beach beds and palapas. Great beach. Lots of chairs.The food was about what you expect at an AI. The buffet was pretty good. The Italian restaurant had good food but the service was slower than most. The steak house was ok too. We really liked the fondue place. The seafood restaurant by the beach was very good. Excellent ceviche! We also booked a beach dinner on our anniversary. I was overwhelmed! I expected a table on the sand and maybe a tiki torch or something. We had a table in the pergola outside the seafood restaurant. The beach was lined with palm fronds, fig leaves,  flowers forming a pathway to the pergola. They took our arms and escorted us to our table while humming the wedding march. We were served 2 different wines plus a bottle of champagne. Had a 5 course meal with dessert. They really went out of their way to make our evening special. We were given printed menus to take with us, they took pictures for us, 3 waiters served us. All this for $50 US !!! Worth 3x that.The people in DR are fantastic. They are the friendliest, happiest, most helpful people we have encountered. They genuinely love tourists. Please understand that these people live off of their tips, not their salary. Even though tipping is included in the package we always take $100 -$150 in $1's and $5's. Let's face it. 1. The service is always better when you tip 2. They really need it and work their backsides off for it and 3. If you can afford the trip, you can afford the tips.For anyone contemplating DR or Punta Cana Princess, you won't go wrong with either.One tip: Watch out for the Mamajuana! It tastes pretty good, and a shot or two is fine. Just don't drink too much of it because it will give you the WORST heartburn you've ever had the next day. (Normally we never have it.)Also if you want to take it home make sure that it is in a bottle. Don't buy the stuff in the plastic bags - they confiscate it at the airport! We found out the hard way.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here! They Steal!!! It saddens me to write this report, as our vacation was great. HOWEVER, while my luggage was in the Punta Cana Princess' secured luggage lock-up for the day, my video ipod was stolen. Not my passport or money, but my ipod. The hotel is refusing to take responsibility for the theft and will not file a stolen property report in order for me to get compensation. Please be wary in trusting this hotel with anything.

<Content>A little slice of heaven! Paradise My boyfriend and I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from March 6-13, 2008. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. The front desk staff were very helpful and the housekeepers kept our room amazingly clean, never a bug in sight. The beds were comfortable and the room was always nice and cool. The grounds of the hotel were always kept in beautiful condition.We had full access to the sister resorts next door and you could either walk or take a golf cart. Those resorts were beaituful too and we also had access to the casino which was quite fun too.The beach is breathtaking, absolutely spectacular. The ocean is so warm, we found it warmer than the pool. The weather was fantastic. I had checked the weather before we left Canada and was worried because it said partly couldy and showers everyday that we were supposed to be there. Well...partly cloudy meant the odd cloud here and there and rain showers lasted about 2 minutes and then the sun was out again. It was HOT HOT HOT. It was only about 31 celcius but felt like 40 when you were away from the beach and didn't get the lovely breeze off the ocean.The service on the beach is great too, especially if you tip the server a dollar or two! He kept our drinks topped up all day :)The food was ok, the buffet was good and the steakhouse was great. The seafood restaurant was alright, but was a little disappointed with the lobster.The animation staff was great, always trying to get you involved in their activities but didn't pressure you. If you said no, they moved on to the next guest.No children...ahhhh! Bliss! This is one of the best features of the resort!!!The excursions were fantastic. We went on the ATV tour and snorkeling tour. Both half day excursions and they were well worth the money. Especially the ATV tour.I highly recommend this resort for honeymoon or couples looking for a romantic getaway.

<Content>Perfectly Pleased! My husband and I stayed at the PCP for the first two weeks in March and all I can say is that we'd go back again next month if we could! We've travelled extensively all over the Caribbean and have never experienced an all-inclusive and were somewhat apprehensive as to what we'd encounter even though most of the reviews we'd read were positive.First of all, let me say that the hotel staff is the most hospitable, helpful, friendly and accomodating group of people we've ever met. From the moment we arrived (two hours ahead of check-in) until the minute we left it was very obvious that EVERY maid, bartender, waiter, waitress, groundskeeper, maintenance man, guest service representative, etc. had one goal in mind and that was to make sure their guests were satisfied; they did an outstanding job (even when often times faced with a language barrier!)!The food was surprisingly good. Granted, it's not gourmet cuisine but the buffet strived to offer a large variety and the a la carte restaurants were a nice option. The salads and fruits were as fresh as could be and the desserts were amazing. We visited La Cava and Momma Mia's next door and would highly recommend both. Overall, out of the l4 days we were there we were only disappointed in maybe three of our meals (including breakfast and lunch). We never were hungry, we never got sick to our stomach and we never had to ask for a refill for whatever we were drinking; we enjoyed the service immensely!The grounds at the PCP are beautiful and maintained to perfection. The beach is gorgeous, with just enough breeze to make you feel comfortable. The sun beds are awesome and a welcome relief from the chaises; we never had a problem with having to be the first one to the beach to get either - there were plenty for everyone (be careful with those chaises, though; a couple were broken and are probably still there!). If you enjoy walking, I would encourage you to go out on the beach to your left; when you get to the flea market the view is breathtaking and that stretch of beach is magnificent.The rooms at the PCP are spotless, spacious and extremely comfortable. I especially liked the double sinks in the bathroom, as well as the outstanding water pressure. The towels were not the most plush but they were clean and plentiful. Our king-sized bed was super; my husband didn't snore for two weeks! We were also impressed that out mini fridge was replenished daily,along with our coffee; again, the service was superb!The entertainment, better known as the Animacion Team, was certainly not Broadway or even cruise quality. They provided a tremendous amount of fun, however, and encouraged everybody to participate, day or night. If you're looking for a lot of night life, I'd suggest checking out another resort or possibly going to the outside theater next door, the Casino or the Disco.Make sure to experience a massage or two in the Spa or on the beach; you'll want to pack your masseuse in your suitcase! We couldn't believe it was possible to be that relaxed!!Our vacation at PCP was truly one of the most enjoyable ones we've ever had; we met some really neat people from Canada, we had l4 days of perfect weather and the hotel was l00% to our satisfaction - who could ask for more?! !!

<Author>Fredericton81
<Content>Awesome!!!!! Hello All,All right, better late than never!!!! I have been meaning to post this for a month and I am finally getting around to it. It has been on my conscience because I read every word of every review every posted on this resort and feel I could bring something to others looking for some info. Im going to do this a little different than prev reviews cause it does get somewhat repetitive. Here we go. Food awesome. Service awesome. Room awesome. Resort awesome. Get the idea? It really is great all around. Now that that is out of the way here are a few less published facts and tips.You do not need a power adaptor. We bought one and didn鈥檛 need it. All of our stuff (hair dryer, camera, laptop etc. all worked off the electrical plugs in the room.Laptop does fit in the safe. I have a Gateway 2 yrs old and not small by any means. If you have a normal size laptop it should fit fine. No concerns with bringing it. Resort felt very safe. Safe if free also.Learn a little Spanish or get a pocket Spanish-English dictionary. The girls were all about this before we left and I though it was a waste of time. But at 3pm when you are all drunk trying to explain something to your new best friend the bartender, It is almost impossible. We ended up drawing pictures and using hand gestures to figure out that Andy lives in Santa Domingo, and is going home in a couple days to see his son and wife.Tipping is something you always hear about. Everyone asking to please tip cause they are soooo poor. Here is my take. The same people get all the tip money. The same bartenders, all the maids, and serving staff. We tipped very well to everyone, but in retrospect I wish we had of given a larger percentage to the people that don鈥檛 see allot of tip. (the gardener, busboy and the less traffic bars.) I really believe that the maids and popular bar tenders do a great job and deserve a good tip, but these people are really coining it. I bet you that they make up to 10 times there salary in tips. The guy that keeps the grounds in such beautiful shape may see a tip a week. Do as you please that is just my take.Premium drinks are hiding. If you get in with the bartenders, you will drink like a king all week. A good tip early, and some conversation with the bar tender go a long way. World famous Nelson at the pool bar is really great. Everyday, all day, I was at the pool bar and we had a great relationship. When I would walk by the bar on the way to the beach or somewhere and I would hear a whistle from 200 yrds away. Look over and there is Nelson arms in the air as if to say 鈥渨here do you think you are going, get over here and have a drink with me.鈥?As soon as my toes hit the pool Nelson had a big smile a wave and my drink was started while 3 others were waiting to order a drink. If the bartender likes you, you don鈥檛 have to ask for the good stuff. You just get it!!! Lots and Lots of BOOBS!!!!! Like it or not, I don鈥檛 care, but there is no way around it. I think it has something to do with adults only resort. The good, the Bad and the Ugly!!! From 18yrs old to 70 yrs old. Some really beautiful girls too!!! Sorry honey. A la Carte鈥檚 no reservation and unlimited visits. This is a real bonus. You could literally eat at all 4 every night. Grab a group of new friends and visit the Fondu restaurant. It was great.Drink water not just booze!!! One of our group got dehydrated and passed out. Off to the medical center on the resort (which is as good as any clinic in Canada!!!!) Into an ambulance (which is not a donkey and wagon) and off to the hospital, I.V. in arm. They said the hospital and service was world class. $1600 later she will drink more water next time. Luckily she had insurance through work.This is starting to drag on. I鈥檒l end this now. Hope this helps. Hello to all our new friend鈥ou know who you are. Hope to see you all at the weddings next yr.

<Content>It was great... This was our first visit to Punta Cana and hopefully not the last..we read all the reviews on the PCP and would say that they were very accurate. The hotel is quiet, small resort so very easy to get around, minimal walking distance to all services. The beaches were beautiful, lots of opportunities for long walks. Pool was great, swim up bar staffed with friendly courteous staff, very helpful. Rooms were clean and housekepping staff always had the room cleaned in a timely manner. Turn down service at night was a nice added touch. Hotel is appearing a little older, but still in very nice condition. Checkin and checkout were uneventful. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The restaurants were accesible but men did have to wear long pants. No reservations were required so that was also nice, as you could decide to go at the last minute and were accomodated. Buffett was good, lots of variety, different theme each night although some food was available every night..so you could stick to a specific preference if you liked. Desserts could have used a bit of variety..these seemed to be the same always..lots to choose from though so something for everyone. The beach grill was great for breakfast, fresh omeletts and great toast...less congested and right by the ocean so was nice to have breakfast there..very casual as well. Santa was a great waitress...Entertainment was ok, the Animation team tried very hard to get folks involved although there was not a lot of variety, there were disco's and other stage entertainment at the adjoing hotel so you could find a bit more action if you wanted. This is a great place to go if you want to relax, and stay fairly low key..a great vacation. We visited the casino and it was a lot of fun..they have a disco there as well that starts at about 11 at night...looked like a lot of fun. The shuttle was great to go back and forth on..took about 10 minutes and the wait was not too long. The Catermeran half day trip to snorkel and swim with the sharks and sting rays was great..the staff on the boat were full of energy and made it a lot of fun. It was certainly a good time, lots of rum and dancing...If you snorkel make sure to go to the Advanced side as the Beginners side does not have a lot to see. Advanced side was great..and it does not matter if you are new at the game...Try not to forget any essentials at home because they are very expensive on the resort and that is really the only place to purchase items..sunscreen, advil, cough medicine etc. Markets on the beach were ok and they do barter, but it was things like cigars, clothes, paintings, carvings..rum. vanilla, coffee...Cigars in the hotel store were just as reasonable. We did go to Nicoles jewellery store in town and it was small but had something in most price ranges...we were told by the travel rep it was a safe place to buy authentic jewellery and not get ripped off...we did buy some..This is a beautiful place to visit, the resort was very clean and the staff super friendly...made our first visit very enjoyable..

<Content>Great for couples!!! We just returned after a relaxing week at this very nice resort.We were there from the 3-10 of March 08.The grounds, rooms and restaurants were very clean!The bathrooms need to be updated.We had a bad experience at the sister resort next door at the entrance to the Disco didn't feel safe there. Stay for the entertainment at the Princess and you will be happy.The entertainment staff is great.Although we enjoyed it we liked the Excellence Resort up the beach that we stayed in last year better. They are opening a Palace Resort in the fall Moon Palace Punta Cana. I will try this one next as we always stay in the Palace resorts in Mexico they are wonderful!Palace and Sandals are still # 1 in our books.Hope this helps.

<Content>Amazing Vacation overall I just returned last night from a glorious week at the Bavaro Princess in Punta Cana, Dominican. There was four of us, me, my husband, my son (11) and his friend (12). I don't know what people are talking about when they bash this resort. We had a wonderful vacation. The resort is absolutely beautiful, the grounds are very neat and well kept, the rooms are spacious, clean and cozy , the food is good (there is always something to eat).and the people that work there are very friendly. We went to cuba last year and my son's stomach did not do very well. At the Bavaro Princess he had absolutely no stomach problems!!!!!!!The two boys had a blast playing soccer, basketball, pingpong, shuffleboard, swimming, pool, and fooseball. We didn't see them at all during the day. At night they have a kids show at 8 and an adult one at 10:00p.m. in the main lobby.Our favourite restaurant was the Japanese Restaurant. It was an amazing experience and the food was amazing!!!! The one we didn't care for was Bella Pasta. The food was okay. Other than that all the other ones were great.We will definitely come back again!!!!

<Content>Great beach, great staff and food, Quiet (that's OK though) Phil and JackieOntario, CanadaJust got back from 14 days at the Punta Cana Princess. It was great, maybe a 4 or 4 1/2 star... would not give it 5 only because it doesn't have an exotic pool and fantastic entertainment. We've been to Cuba(2), CostaRica, Cancun, Panama(2), Aruba, Barbados, St.Martin, Florida (5) and we're in our mid 50s. We're fussy about safe food, not musty rooms and gotta have shade without fighting over it.Bottom line:CLEAN, SAFE FOOD and GOOD FOOD, QUIET, lots of shade, Great Staff.-great beach that's cleaned every morning and has lots of palapas (don't have to get up at sunrise to reserve one)- very clean and orderly (just the way baby boomers like it)- halls, pool area and rooms cleaned AND RINSED every day... wow.... your feet don't get black like other places we've been-staff is great... about the best we've come across.... no complaints at all... only saw 1 waiter look a bit disgruntled one time.... not bad for 2 weeks-quiet place where everyone pretty well respected your privacy... if you are bunch of rowdy 20 yr olds looking to party-on all night, try some other place.... this place is a bit classier than that.. there were lots of young people but also lots of us more senior (50s) and older.... a good mix -FOOD - ranged from good to VERY GOOD and maybe even excellent at times. Most of the time I would say very good and VERY SAFE... that's a big deal !! We were pleasantly surprised since our daughter had gone to some other place 1 mile south a few weeks earlier and 28 of the group of 30 got really sick. So we came down expecting to only eat bananas and drink bottled beer. After about 4 days we were eating everything and no problems at all. Everything is fresh, spotless, as tasty as you want.. Ate almost all meals at the ala cartes without 1 lineup. Had to wait 2 minutes 1 night for them to set a table at the fondue place... Good variety... the odd meal was only just good but believe me, it was SAFE. Drank the water at the restaurants after seeing that my wife drank it for days and was OK ( I use her as my food tester then I wait for 2 days.... just kiddin). Sure, if you see lunch meat that may have been out for a while, I would stay away from it. That goes for anywhere. Really it's good food... some interesting items on the menus and you can go back as often as you want (I think.... well, we did). After 14 days we still had not exhausted the menus......close though. So I would recommend the Princess.... it's small, quiet and perfect for couples and small groups... lots of interesting European clients to give the place a nice flair. One word of caution (oh yes, there has to be one) is that ground floor rooms tend to be musty, but that's the case everywhere in the Caribbean and Central America... you can't get away from it on the ground floor. Get the 2nd or 3rd floor. We changed from ground to 2nd floor (no problem) and it was fine. The best buildings are 5, then 4 , then 3. Building 1 or 2 we did not care for too much. See other reviews for excursions, parasailing, details of restuarants, photos, etc ... I think I've given you the bottom line on this very nice place..... ENJOY.

<Content>Can sum it up in one word...Paradise We stayed at PC Princess from 2-27 thru 3-5 2008 and adored the resort. The Amimacion Staff was wonderful...Danny, Andre, Selena and Katrina made each day and evening fun filled with activities. We got involved in almost every activity they put together throughout the day and in the evenings. I would advise anyone to join in when they ask for volunteers and if you don't join in...get front row seats and be prepared to laugh.The restaurants were great. We really enjoyed the food at Tex-Mex. The Margaritas are also very good there. Le Petite Fondue was excellent and I advise not waiting till the last night to go there because you'll wish you had gone at the beginning so you could have gone back for more! The beach area and the pool area were clean and tidy. We never had a problem finding somewhere to lay out in the sun or rest in the shade. We did do an excursion to Saona Island and it was a great trip. Bring lots of sunscreen because you don't feel yourself burning. Although the bus ride to get there was long, it was worth it once you got on the catamaran and headed out to the Caribbean Sea. Our only bad experience was our deep sea fishing excursion. We booked through the resort and the company was Gone Fishing. The fumes from our boat caused severe illness/carbon monoxide poisoning. It was a terrible adventure and I would not recommend that trip to anyone. We had 8 foot swells and in the 4 hour trip only 1 fish caught the line. It was an expensive trip and not at all worth the $100 per person. We heard the Safari Trip would have been much more worth the money we spent. Overall I would say our trip was excellent. I would return in a second if I could.

<Content>Nice Adults Only resort My husband and I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess - Regency Package - January 7-14. We have been to a number of all-inclusive resorts throughout the Caribbean, including two Sandals resorts. This was my second time to Punta Cana, but my husband's first trip.When we first arrived we were surprised at how small a group we were - because the hotel has only 270 rooms (or so, I think), when we got off the plane there only was us and two other people destined for the hotel! We are used to be part of a huge group that is herded onto a large bus...then when they drop you off, it takes forever to check in! It was nice that we were only two groups - check in was a breeze, and then we were off to enjoy the day.Our room was great - decorated with flowers, and included beer/water/coke/sprite as well as bottles of rum/vodka/rye. This was probably the largest room we have ever stayed in, and thought it was great - lots of hot water, drawer space, electronic safe included. We tipped our maid with a few dollars and little shampoo/perfume samples every couple days, and she was great.The beach and pool were highlights. We never had a problem getting a pool or beach chair, or a beach bed (included in the Regency package). Towels were normally in our room courtesy of the maid (Regency package), so we never had to go get them. The one time that the maid forgot, though, the towel service were out of clean towels, so we had to wait a while. No big deal. The beach is beautiful and the water is warm. The pool bar is great - try the Mamajuana - it is the local drink - made with rum/wine and and herbs marinated altogether. The locals say that if a man and woman have two shots each, each night they will have a long and happy marriage (no doubt!)The grounds are beautifully kept, and everything is quite clean.The food was not the greatest though - the buffet is okay - we could find something to eat, but I wouldn't say it was delicious. The Steak House Rio Grande was the best meal of the week. My husband said he wished we could eat there every day (but it is closed weekends, and normally full). The Mexican was good, and the Italian places, Chinese, and Swiss Fondue were fine too, but nothing to write home about. Overall, the a la cartes were much better than the buffet. We aren't seafood eaters, so did not try those a la cartes, nor did we try the Brazilian. La Cava costs an extra $25 per person, and I was not willing to fork out additional money. Neither of us were sick, and we gained a few pounds (as one should when on vacation and at an all-inclusive), so all-in-all, not too bad.At lunch we ate at the buffet mostly - the restaurant on the beach would have a smaller version of what was in the buffet, but if you waited until 4pm, they serve really good sandwiches...only works if you book a late dinner though!!We did go over to the partner resorts - Caribe and Tropical, and they were a little bigger, but filled with kids. They do seem to have a better selection of fruit at the buffet, though. A negative point was our Air Transat rep Sonia. When we arrived we were told to meet our rep in the lobby the following morning for the standard briefing on the hotel/tours/etc. We showed up early, and the rep was no where to be found. There was also another couple waiting to hear the presentation. We asked the front desk if they could call, which they did....the Air Transat office indicated that the front desk should try Sonia directly, as she was supposed to be there. The front desk did so, and there was no answer....we waited around a little bit, and then left. The following morning we ventured to the lobby again, and the rep, Sonia was there. We made a comment regarding the previous morning and how we were waiting for the presentation - she quipped it was my day off. Oh - we didn't know - we were told to meet you....we asked if we could hear the presentation - I just finished it. No offer of apology for the inconvenience, no effort to tell us when the next pr! esentation was or if she could help us in any way. My husband ended up booking a tee time through her, but we didn't book anything else as she was terrible to deal with. The other couple we had met talked with her a few times about a possible outing - something they always have done while on vacation, and really wanted to this trip, but was so turned off by Sonia's negative attitude and lack of help, that they didn't. Hopefully you don't have an experience like this.We tried the casino - not the greatest - they have black jack, craps, roulette, caribbean poker. They also have a texas hold'em table - buy in minimum $200 up to $1000. Wouldn't waste your money there.Another disappointing thing is that there is only one hot tub, and it closes at 5pm. 5pm is when I would actually start wanting to go in the hot tub! As a result, we never tried it out.At the end my husband said that he would never pay Sandals prices again, as this resort was more than adequate, but I would - the food for me was fine - but if you pay the Sandals prices you get GREAT food, not just okay food. Besides that, everything was perfect.

<Content>Mosquitoes!!! Punta Cana had the most beautiful beach I have ever seen and miles of it! The weather was amazing and the beds at this resort were extremely unique and fun to suntan and read on. The beds were both on the beach and around the pool which was very nice if it was too windy near the beach you had the option to move near the pool.The food at the a la carte restaruants was great....if you can eat at them every night do so... it isnt necessary to make a reservation so you can go whenever you choose. The buffet food was pretty good and we really enjoyed the breakfasts. They really don't know how to make north american desserts so don't be dissapointed if you are a sweet lover like I am.The biggest dissapointment of the trip for me was the mosquito bites that I got in the gym at our resort....the workout room was swarming with them. I guess that they really enjoyed the air conditioning and I didnt even realize they were biting me as they are smaller than our mosquitoes here and you dont feel them bite. I had 110 bites on my lower legs and was very uncomfortable the entire trip. I became very aware of where and when they were around and found that in the lobby in the evening they were plentiful also. BEWARE!!!! I ended up having to take antihistamines the whole time and was very happy to get home and out of the mosquitoe zone! I also was happy that we had decided to take our antimalarial medication as some vacationers had not done so. Apparently malaria is quite prevalent and becoming even more common among the caribbean islands.This resort was well worth the money if you want to just chill out and are happy just hanging out at the beach or in the pool. There isnt much else to do in Punta Cana, I had been to Puerto Plata previously and found more activities/excursions offered there. The drinks were also TOP NOTCH and our room was the best. We stayed in building #5 on the top floor and had a view of the ocean. We read about it on someone elses tripadviser note so requested it and they were wonderful accommodating us.My girlfriend and most of the others did not get bothered by the bites like I did, so don't worry that this happens to everyone, there were only about 2 or 3 others that got bitten as bad as I did and not all the ppl got the bites in the gym. I just happen to be a person that mosquitoes love....both here and in the DM! Stacy Edomonton AB

<Content>why would you stay anywhere else We have never been to the Dominican Republic before. We had the best time we were honored to be there while it was the Domicican Republic independace day. the resort was so clean and the staff was so fun to be with they really made us feel welcomed and there are many things to do we recommend that you take the half day trip and do the zip line. Beware of Nelson he is the bartender at the swim up bar this guy will have you smiling from the time you get there to the time you leave. The grounds keepers are so friendly as well Raphel alway had a freash coconut for me each day. Would we go back again in a split second. The best thing was that there were no kids. and I love kids But this aloud us to just focus on the two of usThanks Punta Cana Princess Staff.

<Content>"Amazing Hotel/Staff" Just returned on Saturday Night from a one week vacation at the Punta Cana Princess. You can not go wrong with this resort. Staff are amazing, truly happy people always working with a smile on their face. If you get slow service it is because they are very busy not because they are not working hard.We did not suffer from any stomach problems during our stay the food was good to great. Highly recommend the Tex Mex, ate at this restaurant three times...........very good!I could go on  on regarding how much fun and how great this resort is however it would be repeating the other positive reviews. Should you have any question please feel free to email.What i would really recommened and was very surprised the lack of people who did not use it is Deep Woods Off. We all seem to know of the Malaria issuses in this area, the mosquitos are comparable to what we experience at dusk and dawn during the summer months. We sprayed before dinner every night and did not get one bite. The lobby bar, gym and computer area seemed to be the hot spots for the mosquitos however if you wearing the deep woods off you will not be bugged.We had no issues with bugs/ants in our room or around the resort.If you are into a quite relaxing and truly amazing vacation you will be very pleased with this resort, we would go back in a heart beat.

<Content>Disappointed! My husband and I and another couple (their first time at an all-inclusive  out of the US) stayed at the Punta Cana Princess for 5 nights. Check in was fine. We did have to go back to the front desk several times during our stay because either my card worked in the door or his - they finally got them fixed although neither of them ever worked in the safe - we had to share our friends safe.The beach  ocean was everything you could every dream of BUT the food was very disappointing. Dinner at the beachside restaurant the first night was good but went back another night and it wasn't. The buffet during the day by the beach was rather unfulfilling - I would have killed for some pretzels  chips or nacho chips to munch on. The service at the restaurants and the room cleaning was good but language barrier did come into play at times.My husband and his friend were playing golf at White Sands Golf Club on Monday  Wednesday. Monday's pick up went fine because we had a tour guy call on Sunday  arrange for the pick up. My husband arranged for a pick up after playing on Monday for Wednesday morning and that didn't go so well - after waiting an hour after the designated pick up time - my husband asked the girl at the front desk for help in contacting the golf course and after much frustration finally got someone to help. I will say the Golf was not part of the package but felt they could have tried to be more helpful. Remember just put your watch away because you are on Dominican time which is whenever THEY decide it's time.

<Content>Good Value Just returned from the Punta Cana Princess and had a great vacation. I will try to touch on what I felt others may have missed. First off, we spent weeks analyzing other reviews on Trip Adivsor and had a really hard time trying to decide on where to stay. I think we finally chose the PCP for the adults only, beach, and the fact that the reviews were about 90% positive, which is Very high if you read a lot of reviews.  We were not disappointed as we got exactly what we were looking for , beautiful soft sandy beach, gorgeous turquoise water, and a nice clean resort. I will now touch on things to be aware of : - Arrival off the plane: we got to our bus quickly, then sat on it for about an hour before it left. It stopped at about 5 other properties before getting to the PCP, which is always the last stop on any excursion. Our flight from Toronto left at 5:20 and we got to the resort at about 1:30 am. If I go again , I will take a taxi ride straight there, it costs around $35.Check in was quick, I had requested a room in the 5000 suites and a King bed but we didnt get it, the next morning after much coaxing, I managed to get a room in the 5000's on the main floor, better than nothing with a King bed.. After checking in we went to the 24 hr grill and ordered hamburgers, as I had read some reviews that raved about them. They were undercooked, however, we were so hungry we ate them anyway. We tried them once more the next day , again undercooked , this time with a hair in them. No more burgers for us. I cant quite figure out how people could have raived about them? Breakfast Buffet was boring and tiring, I couldnt imagine staying here for 2 weeks and having breakfast here all week. The egg station was good and that was it. Limited variety of cereals, good selection of breads, fruit was average and I found it odd that they did not offer any berries, or nuts , which I love to put on my cereal.There was no fish offered for breakfast, until the last day , I did notice some smoked salmon . Lunch was buffet as well and you could forget about getting a nice fresh sandwich, it was all precooked foods that sat in the troughs for the entire period it was open. To be fair , they did have a section that had processed slices of ham and turkey and salami , along with a decent assorment of cheeses, they just didnt look apetizing at all . They offered some types of fish, inlcuding sea bass, however, it was alway undercooked, a shame for a nice type of fish. al a cartes were decent, never outstanding with a couple of exceptions. The fried mozzarela sticks were excellent at the tex mex , as were their nachos and dips and the stake was good, again undercooked ( you can probably get around this by orering well done for medium). Best drinks we had were the frozen margueritas at the Tex Mex. They seemed to have them figured out there, which is strange as I think all the drinks come from the same place? The evening buffets have different themes everynight, which means 85% stays the same and they mix up some of the meats for the theme of the evening. The first one we went to was the seafoood Buffet , I was quite excited about it , as I love seafood, only to find the lobster to be about the size of a very large prawn and it was mushy, I decided to go the mare nostrum ( the seafood restaurant) instead of eating at the buffet and ordered the lobster there, this was very good, however again not very large, All in all I would give the food a 3 out of 5, probably the least favourite thing at the resort. You could probably order room service to get around the boredom of these restaurants. Cleaning of the rooms was decent , however , my girlfriend had a pair of her pants stolen by the maid service and forget about trying to report it, it was useless, this was the only problem we had with the room services, everything else was decent. You do get a good variety of tv channels, which are usefull , as the place is dead at night after dinner, they have some lame shows in the lobby and if you want to watch them , spray yourself for mosquitoes, particularly if you are female, they seemed to bite all of the women there but trust me tv is more exciting. The staff are very friendly and easily confused if you ask for anything out of the ordinary in English, ie. I wanted cream in my coffee instead of milk , they could not figure it out, so I order Baileys with my coffee and that solved my cream problem. I will not go over beach topics as they have all been covered, with one exception, you do not see the sun set so make sure you get up early to see the sunrise, it is absolutely gorgeous and it rises fast, this also ensures you can reserve a beach bed or lounge chair on the beach.  The wind always blows strong on the beach , so if you dont like wind , consider the pacific coast of Mexico, I quite enjoyed it , as it gave you relief from the heat of the Sun. We booked through Transat Vacations, which gave us the Regency Club ,which meant absolutely nothing, everyone had the same thing there. Oh yeah you got three bottles of cheap booze ( which we left, only one of them was sealed), and three cheap cigars. Please dont get me wrong , we had a wonderful time , I just wonder if we would have had the same good time at a less expensive resort, as the beach and Sun ( the two major reasons we loved it so much) are the same at every resort in Punta Cana. We would go back to this resort in a flash, IF the price were right , I would say at around $1000 this would be good value.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess - Excellent vacation I will not make this review too long because enough great things have been said about the Punta Cana Princess. Excellent resort. Very quiet, adults only and that is great if you want total relaxation. We tried 3 of the restaurants and all were quite good. Buffet was repetitive but food was good. Staff is very friendly and cheerful. Most could speak English quite good and some even spoke French to us.What can I say about the beach, fantastic. We walked that beach every day for about 2 hours and it is superb.We were lucky to get a room in building 5 on the third floor as I had requested in an e-mail. Other people that I met had also requested building 5 but did not get what they had requested. But frankly, the resort is small enough that all rooms are quite close to the beach. I saw the sunrise every morning from my balcony while having my coffee......exquisite. We went 3 times to the casino (we took the free shuttle) that was fun for a few hours.If you want total relaxation go to this resort. I truly recommend it.Thanks to all of you that have answered my questions since last October. Your reviews and/or comments on this resort were really helpful once I got there.And yes Nelson at the pool bar is the best.

<Content>Perfect Vacation, Perfect Resort We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from February 8-16,2008. This was our forth trip to Punta Cana and our first stay at this resort. This resort is the smallest we have ever stayed at. We loved the size of this resort and the adults only policy.We upgraded to VIP-Platinum when we booked our trip. The upgrade is worth every penny to stay in building 5000. This is the best building on the resort. You are maybe 50 feet from the beach and you have a good view of the ocean from your balcony or terrace. We stayed in room 5013 which was on the ground floor on the end by the beach. The room was great, we had one problem when we first got there, the lock on the sliding glass door was broken, we notified guest services and it was fixed promptly. The beach is beautiful, warm blue water with small waves to play in or body surf and powder white sand. The waiter service on the beach is hit or miss, he serviced the beach bed area more frequently than any other area. Tipping him did not change the service, but the bar is so close it was no big deal to get your own cocktail. There were plenty of beach loungers and huts available everyday, we never had to worry about finding a spot on the beach. We did not go to the pool during the day but from what we saw there were plenty of loungers and huts available there also. Because the resort is small its not over crowded and being adults only you dont have kids and teenagers running all over the place. It is quiet and peaceful. This is the perfect place to unwind and have a relaxing vacation. In my opinion if you are looking for a place that has a lot going on during the day and looking for nightlife this resort would not be for you. But like other reviews said, the 2 sister resorts are a short walk away and they have shows at night, there is a lot of activity and were very crowded I was very glad we were not staying at either of the sister resorts. You can also take the shuttle to the casino, it was maybe a 10 min ride to casino from the Punta Cana Princess. The food we thought was good for an all inclusive, its not gourmet but its plentiful and you can always find something to satisfy you. The specialty restaurants were good, they have a no reservations required policy. We never had a problem getting seated. We ate at all the specialty restaurants and were happy with the food and the service except for the fondue restaurant it was OK, we liked the shrimp appetizer but we were not too happy when they brought out the main course and they had raw chicken,beef and sausage all on one plate. But like I said the food was good and prepared well in the restaurants and buffets. There is always fresh fruit and plenty of choices.The resort is kept spotless, and the grounds are beautiful.We went on 2 excursions, deep sea fishing and the bavaro splash where you drive a small speed boat and go snorkeling. The fishing was OK, the bavaro splash was a blast, very much worth going on.I would return to this resort without hesitation and I would recommend it to anyone. The only thing I would like to see them change would be make the minimum age to stay there be changed from 18 to 21. If you have any questions feel free to e mail.

<Content>Better Than Cancun First of all, Air Transat sucks!!!!!!!!!!. We departed from Edmonton, Ab, Can on Jan 31/08.We decided to take our golf clubs on this trip .Upon checking in that morning, Air Transat tryed to charge us extra for our clubs because they said that the allowable weight was 15kg.Their website clearly states 20 kg.I'd expect this kind of treatment in Cancun, but not in Canada.I also think that it is very rude for flight attendants to be speaking in French to each other on a charter that leaves from Western Canada.On the flight down, not one hot meal .They serves a cold bagel breakfast and an hour before landing , they gave us a cold fist sized burrito.Unfortunately if you want to stay at the Punta Cana Princess, you have to fly Ait Transat.The peolple at this resort try very hard to please you.The maid service is good, not always excellant but good.If you need extra water, beer, or towels, they don't take all day like in cancun.Usually within 15 minutes.The resort is exactly what it looks like in the pictures.If you want to go lay on the beach for two weeks, this is a good place to go.The food is what I expected it to be.Average at best.Afterall, you are in a 3rd world country, don't have high expectations.The service in the al'la'cart's was terrible, we spent most of our time at the 2 buffets offered.The food and service at the sister resorts was horrendous.I wouldn't recommend them at all.Unlike the mexicans, these people are always smiling and happy to have you around.The flea market on the beach was fun to shop in just to haggle down prices.Don't go into town to shop, it's all the same stuff and the merchants are very aggressive in getting you into their store.Overall, with exception to Airtransat, the trip was 100% better that Cancun last year.The flight is long, 6.5 hrs going and 7.5 hrs coming home.If your planning on golfing, don't take your clubs and don't use the online golf registration service offered via the internet.They tryed to screw us out of a golf reservation at La Cana.They didn't pick us up at the resort and we had to call them to straighten it all out.If you want to golf, book it when you get there and rent clubs.La cana is a very nice coures , Cocotal, is an average course at best.This was the only time in my golfing life that a marshall made us skip a hole.They started a group on the back nine when we were golfing our 11th hole.He claimed we were going to slow and made us skip the 12th hole.Also, there are no washrooms on the front nine, and we seldom saw the refreshment cart.At La Cana, we saw the refreshment cart on the 2nd hole and not again until the 13th hole.Not a big deal, but when your golfing in 30 celuis weather it's nice to have a cold drink now and then.Punta Cana Princess: could us an upgrade to the rooms, beds and such.No frills, just better service than mexico and nicer people.

<Content>Not Worth Its Money Definitely NOT worth its money. We should have booked at the Tropical Princess instead. Bigger, better, cleaner. So there are children. Children keep us alive.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess , A great adult resort! Punta Cana Vacation Review Nancy  Jim - OntarioWhen: Feb. 4th 鈥?11th 鈥?2008Where: Punta Cana Princess 鈥?Regency Suites-Transat Holidays packageFlight from Hamilton, ON- flight from Punta Cana was late so our flight was delayed 1.5hrs. (6pm). Pilot made up about 30min. of this.- flew Skyservice for the first time and they are very good.Arrival/ customs- got through customs/luggage and sitting on the transport bus in 30-40 min (Transat rep. Ready  waiting)Check in- as we were the only people checking in at 1am, everything was taken care of in 5min.- given a room in block 5 ( rm # 5008 main floor ). Had previously requested an upper level room in blocks 3,4 or 5. but none available that night. Works out we were satisfied with this room  remained there for the week. Bags arrived quickly to our room- I was hungry so we went to the 24hr. beach bar/grill and had a freshly made grilled chicken on a bun/fries/salad/Presidente and it was very good and Andy on the bar was a riot. What a great view as we sat on the outside deck of this beach front restaurant listening and viewing the wavesRoom: - King bed in a very large room that has separate bathroom with two sinks, bathtub with shower.- electronic safe in closet.- Step down into a large sitting area that had a sofa with large cushions  trundle bed under it. coffee table, TV  fridge stocked daily with water, pop  beer. Patio doors open up from here to a nice patio with two chairs  a table.- Rooms were cleaned daily usually before noon. Nightly turn down was a nice touch and generally room was made up with fresh flowers.- Usually received daily clean beach towels to our room, bath towels, 鈥渁鈥?hand towel. Face cloth hit  miss. (but no problem as we have learned to bring our own face cloths)Food- this resort has good to great food at all the A la carte鈥檚 , buffets and beach grill. The seafood restaurant was very good as was the Italian. Punta Cana Princess recently dropped the reservation requirement at the A la carte's and we think that this works very well. The buffet always had plenty of selection to suit our tastes. We did not go to any restaurants off the resort at the sister resorts but I was told that they were very good. You will need to call  reserve at those restaurants.Beach- Punta Cana Princess has a large beach for a resort of this size. They offer plenty of beach cots both under the beach huts and in the open. If you want one of the beach huts in the prime locations you better get there by 8:am. They also have about 30 beach beds in a roped off area and they usually go early. We didn鈥檛 try them because they don鈥檛 allow for you to sit up. The beach is cleaned  raked early in the morning. - (I find it amazing by how much trash [ empty cups straws etc ] is left behind on the beach each day by some guests. Shame on them!!- They have drink service at the beach although spotty at times.Pool- the pool is about 4鈥?deep all over. It really is a good size for a resort this small. It has plenty of cots and a few beach beds. As with the beach the earlier you get there the better your location. The towel on the cot game is in play here even though signs are posted to refrain from this practice. (Early bird gets the worm.)- The pool has a swim up bar  waiter/waitress service at poolside.- Lots of organized activities by the animation team at the pool site in the afternoonEntertainment The lobby offers some form of entertainment most evenings. Lobby is large and always a good place to sit and people watch. They also have evening events at the beach weather permitting. You can go to the sister resorts for nightly entertainment.Animation- all very nice and work hard to get people involved in variety of activities.Staff- we found all staff very friendly and appreciative of our efforts to speak Spanish. They were always very polite and often replied in english.ConclusionWe have stayed at two other resorts in Punta Cana, one of them a family resort the other an adult resort and they were both very nice 41/2 鈥?5 star ratings.We prefer Punta Cana Princess for its size and the general layout of the resort. It is really easy to find you way around.The food was great and staff very friendly.We will return here as soon we can  would recommend this resort to anyone looking to kick back and take it easy.

<Content>I have never been to a place where i felt so welcome and invited I have never been to a place where i felt so welcome and invited, the staff treated us with respect and kindness.This was my first trip ever. When we arrived to the resort, my mouth droped it was beautyful. The bus ride getting the was short and comfterable. I had dectied on this place after readind review after review. And i shure made the right decision. Ill start with the food. NO and i mean NO reservations needed for the a la cart resturants this is a total plus.I foun the food to be a little greasey at times but for the most part good 4 a la carts 2 buffates, no need to rush to get something to eat there is always a table somewear. there were 5 bars and the wait to get a drink well there was no wait. The thing that impressed me the most is the fact that the entire resort except the wasrooms and showers HAS PUIRAFIED WATER, so dont be afred to get that extre ice cube or glass of water with your dinner I was'nt.I think we had one of the LARGEST SAND BEACH OF ALL THE HOTELS, and this was somthing out of a post card. night life a little quiet thins seamed to shut down after midnight, but if you wanted to keep going all you had to do was step on to a shuttle and go to the casino or disco and thies were open till 5 am. The disco was loud but I liked the music it had a bit of dance mixed with cariben sound.The rooms looked just liked the broshure bee nice to your maid we got 6 pellows and extre water and pop. when you get to your room you will get 4 bottles of booze i mean a 40 0z 2 26 0z and a mickey plus 3 stogies.pretty cool. I am 30 rys old and I had the best time I think I could have I did not party much ,but took in a lot of RR. You still have 24 hr drinks yes rum and beer as well as fried chicken, hotdogs and hamburgers so if you want somthing to eat at 5 am go ahed. daly actives were good tenis, archery, vollyball, darts,pool volyball. lots to do. This was not the cheapest for me but It was one of the best moment of my life I WILL GO BACK WITH OUT A DOUT.I hope this gives you a little more in fo and thank for reading

<Content>Heaven on earth! We were at another resort in Punta Cana last year. It was big and impersonal. We decided to try a smaller resort this year and booked at the Punta Cana Princess for 10 days. It was heaven on earth.Check in was smooth and pleasant. A cold drink of something pink and sweet from the bar, and a cool damp towel to wipe off the travel grime. A quick trip on a golf cart to a room with a fabulous balcony view of both the pool and the ocean. A chilled fruit basket and cold sodas, beer and water in the fridge. Since we booked as VIP's, there was also a bottle of rum, whiskey and vodka awaitng (full size bottles), as well as 3 local cigars. A quick change into shorts and then we walked around the complex.The grounds are beautifully maintained, with music piped in along the walkways. We found the food at all the restaurants to be wonderful, especially at the a la carte restaurants. And I can't say enough good things about the wonderful dominican coffee. The beach is beyond compare....white sand, turquoise water and friendly people everywhere. We were able to use the beach beds (you can't even imagine how wonderful this is unless you have been there), and the waiter service on the beach was great. We met lots of great people, includng the staff. When you spend 10 days in a small resort, you get to know everyone. We met folks from far away, and are actually planning to meet them there next year. I would have booked my next vacation with them before we even left if I could have!If you go, please tell Julio, Louisa, Serapio, Emilio, Celine, Jarol, Alberto, Felix, Santa, and Danny that Rosa says hello and will see them proximo ano!

<Content>We Found Paradise!!!!!!!!!! Hola!! The Punta Cana Princess is the best resort we have been at so far in our travels. We loved it so much we tried to stay an extra week but they were totally booked up and we couldn't stay- we even offered to sleep on the beach if we could stay! This is the only resort we have ever been at where we weren't ready to go home! The food was excellent with a fresh pasta bar at lunch, omlette and pancake bars at breakfast and usually fresh fish bar at the evening buffet. For breakfast they also have yogurt, toast, cereal and all the usuals you would find at home. The 24 hour snack bar makes the BEST hamburgers- even better than I would find at any restaurant in Alberta, Canada. The fruit was always fresh and plentiful and was always my favorite food! The baked tomatoes are very, very good, too!The a la cartes are now reservation-free so you can enjoy them on any night and as many times as you want during your stay. This was fabulous cause when we met new people and wanted to go for dinner with them we could go to the a la cartes for a special meal on a moments notice.The beach party on Monday night is a whole lotta fun even though ours was moved inside due to windy, rainy weather.The nightly shows in the lobby are fun and we went to almost every one. We got to know the Amination team very well so we had fun with them during the day and at the shows at night. We ended up in the show one night, much to my husband's dismay!Kelvin, Danny, Jarol and Celina are a very energetic group of people!!! This show ended about 11:00 and then you could go over to the disco if you still craved more excitement or you could go for a quite stroll on the beach. If you chose to retire then, it was nice and quiet and you could get a good sleep.The staff at the Mare Nostrum Snack bar are amazing! Give a big hug to Serapio if you go there- he bends over backwards to make sure you are taken care of. Daniela is an excellent bartender and will make whatever you ask for, even if she's never heard of it!!We were part of the VIP group and had access to the beach beds. They are fabulous!!!!! Talk about a fanatasy- falling asleep on a bed on the beach listening to the ocean and dreaming of paradise.....and waking up actually IN paradise! There is also butler service on the beach for the VIP's- another amazing perk of being a VIP. There is also a fruit basket in your room, a 26 ounce bottle each of rum, whiskey and vodka and a stocked mini-bar. We also had a little box with 3 cigars in it. There were bath robes and slippers also for us to use. The maids were fabulous and we had nightly turn down. We also had free internet access.The beaches here are out of this world and unlike any we have encountered. It's like walking in icing sugar and the sand never gets hot! Amazing! As you can see, we are very taken with this resort. We have already made plans to go back next January but it will be for 2 weeks this time! Hola!!

<Content>quiet paradise my wife and i as well as my brother in law and his wife just got back from the princess and thought i would write this while it was fresh o in my mind In one word terrificwe arrived late in the day half hour by bus ,check in was fast and efficientgot our luggage to our rooms in quick time and went looking for food .it was noted that beach bar was the place to go but for whatever reason was closed that night .But the staff told us to go to the main buffet .it had the beach bar menu and was very good and the beer was cold.tired,we went to our rooms and were greeted with a large suite with king bed, fruit basket ,free rum and three cigars.I normally have trouble sleeping in a strange bed but had no trouble here at all,slept like ababy.We were in building 5 on the ground floor and we overlooked the pool,with the bar straight ahead.unlike other people we had no trouble getting the same 4 chairs every day by the pool , usually by 8.30am.the beach was very clean and the sand was soft and pleasant.allways chairs available, and the beds were a nice touch.Though you needed v.i.p. for these it was well worth it.Food the buffet was always with a different assortment, and at night had a new item on the carvery. my only complaint would have a better variety of desserts.of all of the a lacarts we only went to 2 but enjoyed them so much we went twice to both. The tex mex did a great steak, just dont order med rare it came out mooing ,but the corrected it and the chef even came out to check, again great service.mare nostrum is great we had lobster and it was very good.Also the when you are finished you are offered afterdinner liquers the pool bar is terrific during the day ,and i found nelson and fransico very friendly and well versed in mixolagythe lobby bar is nice at night with the animation team getting people involved . a great server there was dayanra? she was always friendly and fast. dont forget these folks live for tips so dont shy.all in all if you wish a vacation that is quiet and laid back, then this spot is for you .

<Content>A Wonderful Holiday This is one of the smallest hotels in Punta Cana and because of that there is a wonderfully intimate feel. The absence of children means that it's a very calm, peaceful environment. The hotel, the grounds and the beach are kept immaculately clean. You very quickly get to know your way around and the staff become like old friends.There are less facilities and activities on offer than at other hotels but you can always visit the other Princess hotels if you're feeling bored. Similarly the choices at the buffet restaurant were more limited than we're used to but the quality was excellent throughout. When I mentioned to the restaurant manager that I was vegetarian I was overwhelmed by the response. The Head Chef came and spoke to me every day to ask whether I would like something special in addition to what was available in the buffet.We visited two of the a la carte restaurants and both were very good. We also heard good reports from everybody who visited the other two. There were a further six a la carte restaurants available at the Caribe Princess hotel as well as a larger buffet restaurant but we were more than happy with the food at the Punta Cana Princess. There are three bars and the choice and quality of drinks was very high.The animation staff do their best although the entertainment , particularly in the evening, is very low key. Again you can visit the Caribe Princess next door for a wider choice of activities and evening entertainment.The beach is stunning and there were always plenty of sunbeds available.I can't praise the staff highly enough. There were too many special people to name individuals but everybody that we came into contact with was friendly and helpful.The rooms were large, clean and very comfortable with all the facilities you would expect and need in a holiday hotel.Overall, a wonderful holiday in a fantastic hotel!

<Content>Awesome!! We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from Jan 7-12, 2008. I'll I can say is we can't wait to go back. I travelled with my husband, my son and his girlfriend. We all had a great time and can't wait to go back. From the staff to the accomodations, everything was perfect. I liked that this resort is adults only, no kids jumping in the pool, etc. Very relaxing, the staff cannot do enough for you, from helping you decide on which excursion to do (we asked the staff for alot of advise on what to do, they were extremely helpful) to climbing up a tree to get you a fresh coconut! The food at the buffet was pretty good. We never went hungry, but we definately enjoyed the al a carte restaurants more. The Tex Mex Steakhouse and La Cava were incredible. Bring a sweater for the restaurants, they are air conditioned. The swim-up bar with Nelson was great. He makes the best Coco Locos, as well as BananaMamas. Once he was off shift, I stopped ordering Coco Locos, no one else can make them like him! Also, don't forget to visit Emelio at the Lobby Bar. He puts on an awesome show, as well as pouring some really good drinks.We did a sport fishing excursion, using Mikes Marina as our contact. We booked a half day, and though the fishing was pretty slow at first, we ended up catching 3 Dorado (Mahi Mahi). My husband is still smiling thinking about the experience!Our kids did a sunset horseback ride on the beach and said that it was great! Overall, no complaints. We meet alot of wonderful people from Canada, which we hope to keep in contact with. Americans were certainly in the minority here, but that was not a problem for us.If you are on the fence about this resort, don't hesitate. The only thing keeping me from booking again right now is we have told so many people about it, and they all want to come down with us, we are juggling too many schedules at this point. We may just have to book it and say to the rest come if you can!

<Content>Third Stay Loved P.C.P. Even More This was our third stay at the pcp 2003,2004,2007 I think this time was the best due to the fact the resort is adults only now.We requested the same room as the other 2 stays and we received it 5107.The food was great never a problem finding something tastey.The room was always clean,always hot water,fridge restocked. If you want extra water just leave a short note asking dos agua por favor and leave a dollar if you want they deserve it.We keep returning here because we also love the location on Bavaro beach, we love to walk 1-1.5 hrs per day,1 day turn right next day turn left.Always feel safe as there are resorts all along the beach.Can't wait until April we're going back to pcp with 2 other couples.Please please please DO NOT be afraid to be generous with your 1 dollar bills the staff try very hard to make our vacation enjoyable a small tip does make a big difference.

<Content>Couldn't have been better We stayed at the PCPrincess All Suites from Dec 8-15 - even with the tropical storm Olga passing through we had an awesome time. We have no complaints - great front desk service from Julio and lobby bartender Emelio and the most happy guy at the pool bar Nelson - all very friendly and can't do enough for you. We ate at all the a la cartes except the fondue - as well as a few at the Tropical and Caribe- all excellent. The buffet was really great for breakfast and lunch - huge selection. We had the Regency Suite package and the rooms are gorgeiou, huge with a king bed and double sinks - lots of storage space and a lovely balcony. The beach beds are great and there are also lots of palapas and a huge beach. We would consider going back - great to have adults only.

<Content>Descent Resort, update needed. We booked through Sunwing Vacations.Price was good but they almost hide the fact, that you fly into Santo Domingo, which is a 3 1/2 -4 hour bus ride from the Airport to Punta Cana.Trust me, make sure you fly right into Punta Cana. Hotel Good points-great beach, good restaurants, good food, great drinks and descent service. The variety of restaurants are good and the service was quite good. The grounds were perfectly manicured and spotless, thanks to the mostly Haitian workers.( who deserve a tip for sure) Negative points, check in was slow. Smoking seemed to be everywhere, even though there are designated smoking locations.(mostly because of the Europeans)Rooms could use an update, they need new beds and new plumbling fixtures. Overall it was a good trip with good food and good weather.I would recommend the resort, but make sure you fly into Punta Cana.

<Content>Nice Hotel but The Food is below average Me and My new wife stayed here for our Honeymoon.Overall view of the hotel - very clean and great pool and beach but the food is not the best - dont expect great food here you wont get it.Check in - Very good - cold towels and drink are nice touches. When we checked in they asked for the copy of our marriage certificate and took it away and photocopied it. We expect a upgrade or something else but when we got to the room it was just the same as all the others - excepet they brought a basket of fruit and a bottle of rum to the room later on.Pool and beach - Brilliant, If you like lying aroung the pool all day then this is the place for you. The swim up bar is great and Nelson will put a smile on your face straight away - hes always smiling. Try the coco loco's they are superb. You wont go thirsty with Neslon serving you as soon as you coming to the end of your drink another one is placed in front of you- Great. The beach is very clean and I loved the sea - great waves.The staff are very friendly , not one member of staff whilst passing failed to say ola. We didnt tip much , just the maid for the room which she kept spotless and the lobby bar waitress who kept sure our table was never wanting for anything.Food - The biggest disappointment at this Hotel. The buffet is OK but not great and the Restaraunt are only slightly better. We Eat at the Italian and were very Disapointed and the Chinese was OK. We did have fun at the Fondue cooking our food at the table but again the food is just passable. We did eat at La Cava and that was very nice - the best meal we had all two weeks we stayed there.The entertainment is very poor for a Adult only resort and a 5 star hotel. They all try their best but I expected better.Me and my wife were ill with bad stomachs and spent most of the first week on the Toilet but we were much better the second week - Not blaming the Hotel for that just Bad luck I suppose.But overall very nice hotel and resort but dont expect great food or you will be very disapointment

<Content>Great Property, Great Staff, OK Food Returned from a week at the Punta Cana Princess on 08 November 07. Best vacation value for the dollar that I have experienced. Loved the 'Adults Only' policy. The property was beautiful - large and lush with a great pool and an excellent location on the beach. Staff were very friendly and always responded to any requests for information, assistance, etc.We traveled with another couple. E-mailed ahead and asked for adjoining rooms in building #5. Received a quick response and our request was granted. We were right beside the pool and very close to the beach. Lots of loungers and beach beds, both at the pool and on the beach. Not crowded at all - not sure if this is a slow season or if this is typical year round. Anyway, it was great.Only down side to this resort is the food. If you looking for cruise ship cuisine you will be sadly disappointed. Food is plentiful and more than adequate, if you are not a picky eater. Food here was better than at AI's I have stayed at in Mexico and Cuba. However, food is not the 'strength' of this resort (and I suspect of any Caribbean AI resort).While the food wasn't great, it met my expectations of an AI resort. However, in all other areas (rooms, pool, beach, grounds, staff, etc.), the Punta Cana Princess exceeded all my expectations. I would not hesitate to recommend this property to anyone looking for an economical 'laid back' vacation on a beautiful tropical beach!

<Content>Don't waste your time or money let me start by saying I'm from manhattan and have traveled EXTENSIVELY...all over the world. This was my first all inclusive. I've stayed in hotels in Indonesia for $4 per night to suites in Paris for $5,000 per night so I have a very broad traveling history. I went to the princess with my boyfriend.I wasn't impressed AT ALL!!! Rooms:We had to change rooms 3 times...I know that I shouldn't expect strong water pressure in a third world country but I also didn't expect a trickle of 3 drops of water at a time. I couldn't wash my hair for 3 days. The rooms were clean. The decor was okay. Buildings 4 and 5 are the best ones, they are very close to the beach and pool. Forget about buildings 1 and 2. Terrible location. The last night we stayed we got a free upgrade to the honeymoon suite. It was very nice. Duplex, jacuzzi and daybed upstairs-very romantic.Staff:The best part of the trip. Everyone was very friendly. I suggest tipping well. Food: Disgusting. I ate toast and cheese everyday. None of their food was edible. Very difficult for vegetarians. We had to book 3 days in advance for an a la carte restaurant, which wasn't worth it. Did I mention DISGUSTING? I would have rather eaten toast and cheese. Chinese restaurant was awful. Italian restaurant was awful.Mexican restaurant-after the meal I went to the room and threw up.Guests: Not many Americans. A lot of South Americans, French, etc. I met a Siberian couple who had traveled 21 hours on a plane to get there. My only question was...WHY???? None of the guests were very friendly.Beach and pool: The water was a bit rough for me. I prefer the placid water in Martinique or St. Martin. But if you like waves then you'll enjoy it. The beds on the beach were great, was worth upgrading to the VIP, though many non VIP guests were using the beds. Plenty of seaweed all over the beach. Not very clean.Shopping: Nothing. The flea market was nice. About a 10 minute walk down the beach. We bought a lot of beautiful painitings there. Plaza Bavara was ncie too. Bought some great wooden carvings and more paintings. Only go there if you know how to bargain. they harass you. They will start at $400 but will eventually go down to $60 if you know what you're doing. My boyfriend couldn't handle the haggling and pressure the people put on you to 'come look'. I didn't mind(used to it) but after a few days it became very draining. The hotel has one lousy gift shop. Major rip off. On my last day I bought a painting for $80 which I could have easily gotten at the flea market for $30.Nightlife: Be careful. That's all I have to say. I went to Mangu discotheque one night(off hotel groinds). Nothing special. I wasn't impressed. I didn't go to any shows at the hotel. I was so bored by evening I just wanted to go to sleep. A few times we played connect four in the hotel lobby.If you have the extra money(maybe $50 a night more) I suggest staying at the paradisus next door. It was GORGEOUS!!! Upscale, gorgeous tropical grounds. we missed out. I have no idea how this hotel(the princess) was rated #10 in Punta Cana. Probably one of the most boring unoriginal places I've ever stayed at.Good luck.

<Content>relaxing vacation We stayed at the princess Oct 26 through Nov 2 and had a lovely time. We were there through the tropical storm, which limited our sun time. The resort grounds were very well kept. We were in the 4000 building and had a good view of the pool and ocean. The beach was beautiful and the sand felt like powder. The food was not bad, our best dinner I believe was at la cava. The only problem we had the whole trip was that we did not speak any spanish and it was hard sometimes getting answers, but I can say that they tried very hard to understand and get you what you needed. We booked the VIP and upgraded the massage to 70 minutes which my husband and I enjoy very much. The only thing I did not like was the 1 hour boat ride, the driver was traveling to fast and the ocean was ruf, I did not think we would make it back so when visitors at the tropical princess got off the boat we got off also and walked back to the princess. One young girl was crying. Overall it was a relaxing vacation.

<Content>Great Honeymoon We went to the Princess for our honeymoon and had a wonderful time. The rooms were clean and well kept. The A/C was ok but we would have liked cooler. When you came in from outside you could feel the difference but it was not a big difference and when we both showered it made the entire room hot. That is our only complaint about the rooms.The beach is WONDERFUL, The sand is never hot and the beach is very well maintained. It is breath taking the first time you see it. The pool was our favorite spot and Nelson the pool bartender was GREAT. We liked the pool because it was not salty, for some reason the salt was really bothering my skin so we stuck with the pool. Being able to swim right up to the bar was great and we loved the pool side and beach side beds. It makes such a difference when you can layout all day and be comfortable.The food was good most of the time. Breakfast was a little tough, we had a hard time finding food that was hot, specifically the pancakes, waffles etc. The eggs and that type of food were warm but not hot. Lunch was great we went to Mare Nostrum for the buffet everyday and the grilled chicken was very yummy! Dinner was also great we ate at the buffet as well as the specialty restaurants. Our favorite was the Steak House, but we also tried the Italian and Lacava and all were very good. We would suggest making a reservation for a specialty on Monday nights as I highly do not suggest the Dominican Night buffet. We heard from alot of people that they got sick from the food (we were there for 2 Mondays and that was the case each time).Overall the resort is wonderful, well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. We plan to go back and would suggest it to anyone. My only suggestions would be to improve the breakfast food and have better A/C.

<Content>Loved the Punta Cana Princess Suites  We stayed at this resort from Oct. 19-26th 2007. We absolutely loved this resort. We were in block 5000 and had a great view of the ocean as well as the pool. We had a king size bed with a step down to a small sitting room which in turn walked out on to the balcony. Our room was always clean and the fridge was well stocked. We did the VIP package and would recommend it. Not only did it get you the premium drinks we also got the 20 min massage, small snacks at night that were delivered to our room and a free meal at the Le Cava or the Seafood restaurant as well as some other bonuses. The filet mignon in the Tex Mex was to die for as well as the lobster dinner at the Le Cava. We had heard negative things about the Fondue Restaurant but 6 of us went and it was great.Nelson at the pool bar always makes sure you are looked after as well as Kenya up in the Lobby. The Catamaran/Speedboat excursion was a great trip. I ran into a problem with my camera but the Manager was great about and even sent a huge fruit basket to our room. We did a lot of tipping but that was because the workers that got the tips were the one who made you want to come back. We also met great people from other cities from Ontario as well as Texas and they also made it a memorable holiday. We will definately put this hotel on our return list.

<Author>travellerkittie333
<Content>Had a great time My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 nights last week (15 Oct 07 - 23 Oct 07). We read loads of reviews before going and found a great cheap deal with DirectHolidays.co.uk. We were unsure on what weather to expect but we had glorious weather all week with only one day of clouds. It was hot all week (day and night) but the rooms had air con so it was lovely. It probably rained every day but didn't cause a problem and was only ever a quick shower.I have mixed opinions on what we found compared to some of the other reviews I've read. We weren't mad keen on the 'animacion' team. The americans and spanish seemed to like them but they took over the pool at the same time of day everyday playing games that I never ever understood.....I tried to work out what was going on but it was mostly in spanish so had trouble. People seemed to like them though! The americans and spanish also seemed to enjoy the cheesy music (eg abba, ymca, grease).....sorry bit of an over-generalisation there....just our observations! At night the animation team took over the lobby bar a couple of times with another weird show which we didn't get....they do it so with rather loud speakers so did take over quite a lot.Which brings me on to the nightlife......or lack of to be honest. The resort does lack a little after dinner time. There are a choice of 2 bars (lobby or Mare Nostrum on the beach) which are both nice but quiet (if the animation team aren't there). We struggled a little to entertain ourselves in the dark.....we did go next door to the Caribe a few times and they had a beach party one night but other than that seemed quiet too. We're not party animals so didn't want a rave or anything but it was lacking a little something on this front.....On the food topic......a mixed bag. We tried all restaurants on the resort. El Rio (tex mex and steak house) - food was ok, quite nice, nothing to write home about. Fondue (good fun although service a little slow both times we went there....best place to eat on the resort in our opinion). Mare Nostrum......gave me a bad stomach for just over a day.....I blame the seafood crepe - can't be sure though I suppose. The seafood was dissapointing to be honest and we didn't go there again. El Bacio (italian)....not great food and didn't go there again. El Sombero in next doors resort was good and the food was nice there - a close second favourite.During the day the buffets were good. Breakfast was in the Caribe every day and was good. Lots of fresh fruit and fruit juices (including a favourite to all the women....banana milkshake.....they couldn't refill the jug quick enough!). There's a guy on the egg counter cooking omeletes and eggs - really great too. There was a pancake counter with waffles and stuff for the americans no doubt ;). Too sweet for us brits in the morning I think. There was all sorts to eat - I'm sure everyone would be happy with something.The all-inclusive part was great. Free stuff - woohoo! it was a great feeling. Beer anytime you like and refills you don't even have to ask for....great. I'm sure some people took advantage but we didn't ask for more than we really wanted. One tip - learn some cocktail names as we didn't know any and expected the barmen to make you something exciting if you asked! If you ask for a cocktail with rum in it.....you'll most likely get a shot (albeit a large one) of rum and ice. All drinks come in a plastic cup which was fine by us. Presidente beer was great too. Cocktails that we learnt about: Meringue (has a banana liquiore and orange juice and rum I think - one for the girls :) ), coco loco (a white milky one with chocolate sauce).Our room was in 4000 and faced the pool. It was ok but did smell progressively worse as the week went on. It was generally damp and musty which we put down to the fact that the room is in a humid island on the carribean! All the same, I found it more and more unpleasant (but my boyfriend was less bothered). They did clean the room everyday and the aircon worked well. No other complaints really. The second day we left a note in an attempt at spanish for more water and Presidente beer (rather than the standard stuff which isn't as nice). We got it but just the standard beer and water from then on. We left a nice tip when we left as they did a great job.On leaving our flight was delayed by 16 hours (MyTravel......). The hotel were wonderful and let us keep our room without question. The even brought us a plate of food on our last night. We didn't pay an extra penny and had all-inclusive all day. Can't thank them enough for that.I found the resort to be really nice all in all. Very clean always, the staff were so polite and friendly and cheerful always - lovely!! There could have been more to do in the evenings and the food wasn't great to be honest but the pool and beach were great. We didn't go on any of the excursions and we didn't find the water sports place until the last day so didn't do that either - maybe we should have.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone with the caveat that I have returned home feeling as though I've been on a butlins holiday camp and that I really didn't see the true domincan republic at all......perhaps our fault for not doing the excursions but a lot of them were a long way away and we didn't fancy spending our time sat on a coach. I recommend the people and weather to everyone though!!!

<Content>wonderful just returned from a long weekend at the punta cana princess.what can i say but it was wonderful. The resort was beautiful. The people who work there from the front desk employees to the gardeners, and everyone in between were some of the nicest people i have met. The hotel itself is not a brand new resort. It does show a little wear and tare. It is kept very very clean. Hotel staff are always out and about cleaning and making you feel so very welcome. The beach is beautiful, white powder sand and no sea weed or trash. The water is that carribean blue that just takes your breath away. The pool was great. It was clean, warm and had a swim up bar. The food at the buffet was good not great. Had plenty of choices for everyone. Never felt any stomach upset. We ate at the Italian, chinese and La Cave specialty restaurants. All were delicious. WE did the vip package, so we got the massage, cigars and rum. Was it worth the extra charge. Yes.. the view from our room (4000 block) was to die for. What can i say.. reasonably priced, wonderful people (who speak English) and no children, what could be better?

<Content>Fab Time I have decided to write this review as I have religiously checked trip advisor for the past 6 months and have found all the reviews for the punta cana princess very helpful, so on my return I thought I would try and help some fellow potential travellers. One word of advice-if you are thinking about going to the PCP... do it! My boyfriend and I travelled to the PCP at the end of September for 2 weeks, we went to relax and enjoy the sunshine-this holiday met and exceeded all our expectations. I have travelled to the DR 3 times previously, I have visited Sousa, Cabarette and most recentley Playa Dorado-out of all these places I would definatly rate punta cana as being my favourite destination-it is just as you imagine the Caribbean to be- white sand and clear blue sea. The PCP is fab-it has beautiful grounds that are kept immaculate and throughout it has speakers which play quiet chill out music (not quite the ear deafening sounds some other reports have suggeseted!?!). The pool is large and kept very clean, there was always plenty of chairs and shade around the pool-the swim up bar is great and has a very friendly bar man (Nelson). The beach is gorgeous. it is kept very clean-there was plenty of chairs here too. Whilst on the beach or by the pool we were never really bothered by sellers or staff-the first few days we got approached a few times but once we made it clear we weren't interested in the activities we were left pretty much alone. It seemed to us the staff were very good at spotting who was up for their games and who was more interested in chilling!We were allocated a room in the 4000 building overlooking the pool-the room was lovely, nice and large with 2 large beds and a sofa a nice big TV and clean bathroom. The room was kept very clean by housekkeping and the mini fridge stocked every day, we did leave the maid a tip every other day but I do not think this made a differnce-on the whole the hotel was of a good clean standard. There was some previous comments about the water temp. and pressure, we had no issues with either, but I do think some people should remember they are in the DR in a reasonably priced resort so somethings you kind of have to expect not be the same standard as a 5 star resort in the States. There was also a safe in the room to use (free of charge).The lobby area was lovely and had the best bar man (Emilo) who made some lovely cocktails. The best thing about this resort for me was the food. I have not got a strong stomach, I usually avoid meat on holiday and normally have atleast a day or two of being unwell. However I was absolutely fine at the PCP! We ate in the buffett for breakfast (and yes there WAS cereal every day-see below?!?) there was tons of fresh amazing tasting fruit and lots of hot selections inc, pancakes, waffles, eggs cooked to order etc. For lunch we usually ate at the beach buffett, again no complaints here, yes it was similar food everyday but to be honest its usually too hot to eat too much anyhow in the middle of the day, we did go up to the main buffett a few times and this was nicer (but further to walk from the beach :-) ). Dinner time we varied between the buffett and a'la carte restaurants. the buffett was a hit every time, always loads of different stuff and always hot food. We ate at the Tex Mex which we had no complaints about, Mare Nostrudam (seafood) which again was lovely and the fondue-which was by far our favourite, mainly for the novelty factor-you have to try it for the chocolate fondue alone! We did not upgrade to VIP and I still struggle to see the real benefits, we already had a lovely room, once you have one rum who knows if its premium or local brand and who wants to spend their holiday surfing the net!! But it is a personal choice so I guess its good to have the option but you def, dont have too. One last note about the PCP-the staff. They were some of the nicest, most helpfull and happy people I have met. Yes it helps if you make an effort and try and speak a little Spanish (even if its just Ola!) and yes it helps if you smile back (you'd be amazed at the amount of miserable people we saw on holiday!!!) but I can not fault them, they all (especiially Emilo) helped make our holiday. A couple of other things-do the Jeep Safari (it will open your eyes to the real DR), try the swimming with sharks trip (not as scary as it sounds they are nurse sharks so no teeth), try out the spa ( we had massages and they were lovely) and go to the disco next door if you want to get a bit lively for a night, we went on a Friday and it was packed and really buzzing.So to sum it all up, go to the PCP if you want to chill out enjoy the sunshine (although we did have some rain!), let your hair down and drink rum!

<Content>Our 20th Wedding Anniversary Trip Toms River, New Jersey We arrived at the Punta Cana Princess All Suites Resort  Spa the day of our 20th Wedding Anniversary and it was beautiful from the moment we stepped foot in the lobby. We were greeted with a tropical drink and our check-in went very smoothly. Then we went to our room and were greeted with a beautiful room with lots of fresh flowers in it. We opted for the buffet restaurant the first night and was kind of disappointed. This was the only complaint we have with our entire stay at the hotelThe next night we went to the Caribe Princess and ate at Mama Mia's and it was delicious with very good food and drinks along with dessert.The third night we ate at the Rio Grande Tex Mex Restaurant and the ambiance was nice along with the food and everything to go along with it. The last night we ate at Mare Nostrum and had lobster. It was fantastic and the view was beautiful. This restaurant is right on the beach with a view of the ocean.For breakfast and lunch we also ate at Mare Nostrum for the buffets and they were great. No complaints at all.The beach was so clean and the water very warm and clean. The beach was cleaned daily.We enjoyed the nightly entertainment. They put on a different show every night and was very entertaining.The week we spent at the Punta Cana Princess is one to remember always and will visit again sometime in the future. Thanks for making it so special.

<Content>Absolutely fantastic My husband and I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from the 18th Sept - 2nd Oct. From the moment we arrived we were made very welcome. Our room was spacious and clean with lovely furnishings. My husband is very fussy about his food and I can honestly say he had no complaints, there was so much choice - even the fussiest person could not fail to find something they liked. Presentation of the food was excellent. Choice of buffet restaurants and a la carte was very good. The pool and was very clean and plenty of sunbeds around it. The beach was kept clean - each day the staff cleared the seaweed!!!All the staff were extremely helpful, courteous and very caring, genuinely concerend that you were enjoying your stay. Always smiling and it was a pleasure to be around them. The entertainment team were great and worked hard, if you didnt want to participate then they did not pressure you. With the limited resources available (small stage on beach) the team put on enjoyable and entertaining shows in the evening. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and will be back.

<Content>Disappointing We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess (PCP) from the 17th - 24th September.Good points: 1) Check in was smooth and speedy and the staff friendly and polite (the welcome cocktail and cold towel were nice touches)2) Rooms are a good size (we had twin queen beds) and the bathrooms, while small, are well appointed (the double sinks are great when you're sharing with a friend)3) The resort is nicely laid out with everything within easy walking distance and low-rise buildings. All rooms are within 50 yards of the beach, pool and lobby.4) The location is gorgeous - the beach really is that white and the sea really is that blue :)Not so good points:1) The noise! Firstly, the resort has a sound system wired up throughout the grounds and gardens. From 7am till 11pm, music is piped EVERYWHERE at quite a considerable volume. It's like being trapped in a lift with muzak playing ALL day. This non-stop background noise is supplemented by music playing at the pool bar, in the lobby and in all the restaurants. By the way - every location plays a different CD...Secondly, the entertainment staff offers activities during the day (aqua-aerobics for example) on the beach or by the pool. When these activities are running, they set-up a sound system which would make the Rolling Stones envious - the volume is quite something! Unfortunately, the other sound systems playing around the resort are not switched off during these activities - so it all becomes quite a cacophony. Then, just to put the cherry on the cake, every night at 10pm the entertainments staff put on an hour-long show, either in the lobby, by the pool or on the beach. Out come the Rolling Stones speakers again...2) The entertainment. The PCP positions itself as a 5* property. This seems to me to be at odds with their entertainment policy, which is more like Butlins. I don't want to be harassed at the pool by people wearing blue and yellow uniforms trying to get me to participate in water polo, pilates or anything else. If I'd wanted an activity based holiday, I'd have booked one :) Equally, when enjoying a drink at the bar after dinner, I don't want those same people interrupting my conversation and shrieking at me show time - by the pool - 5 minutes!!Overall I'd class the PCP, at best, as a 4* property and wouldn't return.

<Content>Wonderful...AGAIN.. We stayed at the punta cana for 2 weeks again this year. Still a wonderful place. After contacting the hotel direct, i asked if we could have the same room as last year, we got next door !! thats not bad is it. we stayed in block 5000. this year it was a little on the noisy side, there was a beach party going on from around 10pm till midnight over at the mare nostrum restaurant that wasnt active last year, its not to noisy, but they have also built another hotel next to the punta that has discos till around 1am. so if your a light sleeper, try to get rooms in blocks 2000 or 3000. again the staff were fab, nothing was to little or to much for them. i firmly believe in the chuck a buck approach. if they do something out of their way for you, a dollar tip will make your stay special. Food was again excellent, ricardos coco locos are out of this world, and a big hand for the pool guy who works is socks of to keep the place tidy. Also a special thanks go,es to the lady doctor on site who looked after my g/f when she got an ear infection. Would i go there again ?? prehaps not for a 3rd time. maybe we would move down to the bavaro princess if we went back, just for that extra bit of luxury. But if its your first time on that coast,and like things not TOO quite, you,ll love it.steve and sarahwales

<Content>Loved it! Reading some of the other reviews I'm not sure they are talking about the correct Princess resort. This one is an adults-only so there was no issue with children. The pool was clean, uncrowded and refreshing. I am a swim lover and used the pool everyday at all hours (also swam in the ocean everyday!) One of the ladies we met did have red spots on her legs. She figured it was from sand fleas or something - her husband didn't have any. No one suggested bed bugs. Found the staff very friendly - we made it a point to say hello, get to know their names and got a big hello whenever we entered the dining area. Tried to use a little Spanish even if it was only Si! Grounds and beach were spectacular. Room was always clean. Sometimes had to be careful about food choices in a la carte restaurants. Beef is not going to be like what we have in Canada. Buffet had good selection. Very relaxing week - had many activities if you wanted to participate. But didn't make you feel you had to do things. We are considering going back in 2008!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation My wife and I went to the Punta Cana Princess Resort about a month ago for our 2 year anniversary. After we departed the airport we were both pretty shocked about how bad the country looked and felt. This is obvoiusly a third world country, but there is a ton of construction showing that the country is getting better.The hotel itself was very nice. The one problem we had is when we got to our room we noticed the patio door wouldn't lock all the way. We had to wait about 2 hours for someone to come fix it, but they did fix the door. The room and bathroom was bigger than we expected and everything was very clean. We stayed in the 5000 block of the hotel. The room did smell when we first got there, but my wife sprayed some body spray and within a few hours it didn't smell anymore. The grounds were kept up very nicely from the lobby to the beach. We stayed during hurricane Dean and after the hurricane everything was pretty dirty, but within 24hours they had just about everything looking very clean again. The food was ok. My wife really liked the mama mia italian place and I really liked the mexican restaurant at the sister resort. Everyone highly recommended the fondue place, but we were unable to get reservasions for this, which we were dissapointed with. The buffet was pretty good. We made sure to take pepto tablets after every dinner and this helped settle our stomach from the different kinds of food we weren't used to. Both of our stomachs were pretty upset the last two days, but I'm not sure if this was from the alcohol or the food. The drinks were very good. We tipped the bartenders a dollar every other drink. We were one of the few people tipping, which I found very suprising. Because we were tipping though, we were always the first to get refills and we normally didn't even have to ask! I would highly recommend tipping a few dollars ever now again for much better service. We also tipped the maid the first morning we were there and asked for extra beer and she left a 6 pack in the mini fridge :)Don't forget to try the mamajuana! It is just a shot of rum that has been soaked in some kind of bark for a few a days. Be sure to ask the bartenders what it is to enjoy a great resonse.We stayed for 6 nights, but because hurricane Dean ruined one day we felt that it was to short. I would highly recommend this hotel. I hope that we can someday go back, but next time we will be won't be going during hurricane season and hopefully staying longer.

<Content>50/50 rating for Punta Cana I spent 4 days in Punta Cana and the resort is really a pretty place, but overall I would rate it 50/50. The people there are nice, but don't speak great english at all. The games that were played, were played in Spanish which unless they were doing little stunts that didn't require any speaking, then you didn't understand what was going on. I really thought the food would be better than it was. The best place that I ate at was the Italian resturant and I had chicken and mashed potatoes. Other than that place, the food was disappointing and I am not a picky eater at all. The beach was beautiful, the bar and pool were really nice. The massage/spa was great. I had a great time b/c of the people I was with. I am undecided if I would go back there again.

<Content>This resort is overrated! Having been to Punta Cana numerous times, we've never been so offended and disappointed after leaving a resort. The problems were numerous and in retrospect, we should have taken heed to the reviews posted by previous guests. To name a few issues: 1. Upon arrival, the key to the room did not work.and no one seemed to care. After waiting for approximately 2 hours, we walked back to the reception desk and found that our problem was never addressed.2. We requested a honeymoon package, which we never received. Our initial king-sized bed was two single beds joined together. The room was filthy, bathroom contained mold/mildew, towels were ragged/dingy, walls were dirty and furniture old and unkept. 3. The advertised mini bar contained beer, soda and water...there was no hard liquor as advertised. 4. The staff was dismissive/impolite/unattentive. 5. The larger of the two pools was filthy with leaves, straws, and had an odor of feces. It was gross! The bartender at the swim up bar seemed bothered when a guests requested service, to which they were entitled. Alcohol was extremely limited and totally off-brand (cheap liquor). It was NOT top-shelf as advertised! 6. We did not have A/C for three days and it was extremely hot and unbearable.7. The bathroom faucet was broken, but in fairness, fixed the very next day.8. On our last day, a water main broke and we were essentially told to either wait or do without. Luckily, we improvised and showered with bottled water, in order for us to catch our flight on time.9. We observed one staff member scamming a European tourist by selling him a bottle of wine, which he was entitled to as part of his inclusive package. My husband understands Spanish and became aware of the scam.10. Did we mention that the waitresses lacked manners?11. THE BEACH WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THE LANDSCAPING WAS FABULOUS! We figured they cannot mess up the natural beach. 12. The staff selling VIP membership to Princess hotels was aware that the resort was crappy and used that as his selling pitch. For example, we were approached by one staff who stated, I know this resort has alot of problems, but if you purchase the VIP membership, those problems will be addressed effectively. Is this a set-up for failure? The APPLE representative even expressed that this resort was by no means a 5-Star resort, but that was the rating for it...Ghee, Thanks...13. The animals around the resort compensated for the resort's shortcomings and they (animals) seemed friendlier than the staff. Go figure!14. The scenery is beautiful, especially the landscape (superb)...our pictures were very lovely, but the negative experience is not worth the photos.Not to dwell on the worse vacation we've experienced, but I would not take my pet to that resort. Really, it is not child/family/people friendly! On one day, the poolside entertain required that a participant/tourist touch an entertainer's gential, as if turning off a faucet. It was funny to us, but if our kids were there, it was have been totally unacceptable and inappropriate. Some of other entertainment were great, but that was a bit too lewd.There are so many beautiful resorts in the Dominican Republic...this is not one of them, especially as a family vacation.

<Content>Hit and Miss Well unfortunately there was a lot more misses then hits, but anyway here it goes.Hit- Awesome landscaping and cleanliness of resort overallMiss- We were put in a room that had joining doors with the one beside it, you could hear every single thing in the other room, even a drawer closing sounded like it was right in your room. Not to mention the sound of a couple of hyper ladies. You can鈥檛 blame them though, they were on vacation just having fun but the resort should not put people in these rooms unless people traveling together request them.Hit- We could seen the ocean from our balcony, literally steps to the beach and pool, this type of room placement would set you back a lot of money at other resorts.Miss- VIP seemed like a big hassle to the workers, you were made to feel as though you were putting them out by asking for bottled beer or premium liquor. Room service was a joke, first time we used it, and it actually never even came! Were pretty easy to please and don鈥檛 complain much so we just went to bed and let it be. Tried it again a couple days later and it took about an hour and a half and they only brought the calazone and forgot the two cokes and the pizza, he was very apologetic but it took another thirty minutes to get the rest. We tipped every one from the bartenders to the maid to the gardeners, about $150 in total and another $100 in gifts for the maid like kids baseball gloves and makeup and such. some were seemed grateful others not so much, but I tip to get something extra or because I recieved good service not to feel like a hero for tossing around a few ones.Hit- Massages with the VIP were great, paid extra to get the 45 minutes, very happy with themMiss- Hard to get the maid to even leave a couple of Presidentes in the mini fridge, she did a couple of times but man we had to work for it., towel were ratty, shampoo bottles and such looked like they had been used several times over.Hit- Spacious rooms, beautiful beach not to hard to find a chair or bed at the beach or the pool, nice and peaceful resort, never felt crowded at all..Miss- Sometimes we had to wait 10-15 minutes just to get some one to come over and ask us if we would like a drink, while other times you would have someone greet you almost immediately and then come back three or four time to see if everything was okay, it was like every day you were in a different place with two totally different levels of service.Hit-Emilio, Lobby Bar this guy would make a killing in tips if he bartended in North America.Miss- This is the big one here. The food is dangerous to eat. That鈥檚 right dangerous, lots of it was tasty like La Cava and some of the other a la cartes, and even the buffet had some very good food like the omelet station and the pasta station. Now some of the food was crap as well and I am by no means picky ( I could live on pizza and burgers and such for a week and be quite happy) but you should never have obvious leftover hotdogs covered with a yellow sauce (hollandaise maybe) on your breakfast buffet.. Anyhow back to the dangerous part. I was sick for about one and a half days and then was better ,but not a hundred percent for a day and then I got sick again for another two days. When I say sick I mean nasty stomach pains, nausea, and lay in bed this really sucks sick. Luckily I brought all medical marvels like Imodium , pepto etc though I鈥檓 not sure if they even worked but you never know maybe it would have been twice as bad if I didn鈥檛 take them. I know not everyone will get sick but when it happens to you its brutal. I work in a restaurant so I know how to be careful but It didn鈥檛 seem to help me at all. But in between my sick days I saw what I was up against when I had a burger from the beach grill and took a bite into it and it was raw inside, I went back up to get another and asked him to cook it longer and he did but then just after grabbing a bunch of raw chicken to put on the grill with his tongs and spatula he grabbed my burger for me to put on my plate and the raw chicken juice was dripping all over my burger and plate if this is what goes on right in front of you, trust me what鈥檚 going on in the back is ten times worse. Also at the Tropical next door I saw the bartender at the lobby bar grab a dirty glass rinse it under the tap for two seconds and serve up a new drink in it, not the end of the world but still who wants to drink from that and like I said if their doing this pretty much out in the open you know its not any better in the back. Just a note I am by no means a picky person but when you get sick you start to think of all the negative things that happened and you don't tend to overlook them as much as you would had you not been sick. But really its 2007 and if you can build a rsort that is as nice as this why can't you have food that won't make people sick.So in conclusion it doesn鈥檛 matter if its one of the most beautiful places on earth ( and the Punta Cana Princess is) if you can鈥檛 enjoy any of it because if your sick it just not worth it. Remember as well that once you get sick like that even when you get better you can鈥檛 help but to be very scarred of eating anymore of the food that made you sick so you end up eating bread and french fries for the rest of your trip because you don鈥檛 want to miss out on what little time there is left on your vacation. If you like to gamble with your vacation go here, chances are you won鈥檛 get sick (my wife didn鈥檛) but if you do you鈥檒l be laying in bed pissed off that you spent your only week of vacation and a few thousand dollars to feel like crap and watch VH-1.

<Content>Very relaxing and beautiful We've recently returned from a 7 night stay at The Punta Cana Princess (PCP). There were 3 couples ages from late 30's to late 50's in my group. Five out of six of us had stayed at other all inclusives so we had something to compare the PCP to. We all had the VIP package so after a quick check in, we went right to the VIP desk to pick up our information. I highly recommend the VIP package. It was well worth it.We went to our rooms and had our luggage about 5 minutes later. The rooms were a nice size and perfectly clean.  The grounds were amazing. They were well taken care of and spotless. The pool was the perfect size for a small resort and also spotless. The pool bar was a fun and friendly atmosphere. The beach was beautiful. The waves were big enough to have fun in yet small enough to just float around. The water was a pretty blue. Having the VIP package allowed us to use the beach beds and gave us bar service on the beach. That in itself was worth getting the VIP package. We also did the 1 hour boat ride that was included in the VIP. It was a lot of fun. The mini spa was perfect for our complimentary 20 minute massage (vip package). Having a massage while hearing the waves break behind you was so relaxing. The entertainment staff kept people having a good time with volleyball, aerobics, softball... but I was just there to relax so I chose not to participate in the daily activities. The nightly entertainment was silly but again, I wasn't there to be entertained. We enjoyed the music and the cocktails. We met a lot of nice people and had lots of fun with the bartenders and cocktail staff. By 12:00 am things got pretty quiet but you could always hang at the beautiful beach bar 24 hours per day. The food... Here's where my review will get more negative. As a self proclaimed foodie, I thought the buffet food was mediocre at best. There was always something that I liked but it was just ok. The a la carte restaurants were better (except the Asian place, it was awful).La Cava (also included with VIP) was amazing. The atmosphere was great and the food was even better. The Italian and the fondue restaurants were also good. The Dominican beach party was very nice. Don't forget, men must wear long pants to the al a carte restaurants. We saw a lot of people get turned away in shorts. If you are going on vacation for gourmet food, this may not be the place for you. I would highly recommend The Punta Cana Princess for anyone that wants a quiet and relaxing vacation. We had a great time and can't wait to go back again.Debbie from NJ

<Content>A pleasant surprise I just got back from a week at the Punta Cana Princess, and I had a great time. We booked through Bookit.com, which had the cheapest price we could find, even though there was a airfare increase in the last step of booking. I concur with some other reviews, Americans were definitely the minority here, and English the 2nd language, spoken by the staff when needed. We were VIP, which is worth it if you can get it for a good price. It would not be worth it for the $25 a day the resort charges. We paid $50 for the whole week when we booked. You get top shelf liquor and beer (through sometimes a hassle) 2 free hrs of internet, 20 minutes massage each, mini bar in the room, turn down service, a bottle of rum, 3 cigars, 1 hr each of watersports, and other things.The breakdown:Arrival:When you arrive to the Punta Cana airport, you immediately get your picture taken with some local women. Then you stand in lines to buy your $10 Tourist Card, which seems like a huge rip off. Immediately after customs, you hand in your card.After you claim your luggage, there will be a lot of guys yelling out the names of various travel companies in an effort to carry your bags. DO NOT LET THEM. They will only carry your back out a door to the booth you are looking for, only about 20ft. And then of course, you have to tip them. Luckily we had this experience before, so we didn't fall for it this time.The resort is only about 20-25 mins from the airport, so not so bad.Check-In/Room:Yes, it takes longer than it should. I don't know why...we were the only ones checking but it still took about 15 minutes. But no big deal, a fresh cool towel and a drink helped. When we got to our room, we saw that we had 2 double beds. We called back to the front desk and asked for a king bed. Julio was very nice and told us that they are booked up for that day, but tomorrow they will give us a new room with a king bed and a better view. Ok, great. My girlfriend was happy because she thought our room smelled. Both rooms did have a musty smell, but you have to remember that you are at the beach with high humidity.The next day we were moved to our new room around 2:30. It was in the 5000 building, which is the closest to the beach and the pool, great location. If you think you might complain about the noise from the pool, then don't stay in the 5000 building. They often do dance lessons and aerobics at the pool, so the music might wake you up if you like to sleep past 10am.If you are VIP, you get a mini bar with 2 bottles of water, coke, sprite, and Soberana beer. USe it up, as they will refill it each day. The Soberana beer might be one of the worst beers I've ever tasted, but what can you do? Well, I heard all you have to do is call the front desk and request Presidente instead, but we never did.The grounds:Very well kept and pleasing to the eye. I really like the color scheme and layout. It's a bit of a walk from the beach to the lobby though.Pool:Very nice and big, with a swim up pool bar. Very often the chairs and beds at the pool are taken all day. You can usually get a spot if you hang out for a bit and keep your eye open, but there were times when everything was taken. If you see a chair with a towel that has been un attended for a while, just take it.Beach:Well kept and very nice. There was a lot of washed up ocean plants because we just missed a Tropical Wave off shore, but they cleaned it up a few days later. There is a VIP section of beds on the beach, which is real nice. There was always a bed available, if not 5 or 6. And someone will walk around and take drink orders. ***NOTE ON THE BEDS*** The beds have a retractable cloth roof to help keep you out of the sun, but THEY DO NOT BLOCK THE SUN COMPLETELY!! I made the mistake of laying on the bed for 2 hours mid-day, and got very burnt. Always wear your sunscreen!Food:I didn't have any problems, and I eat and drank everything in front of me. But I am always like that. There were people that said they had some stomach problems, but I've come to realize that they were people that don't have a very adventuress appetite. If you don't normally eat different foods, don't try now. Over all, the buffet was good, and there is something for everyone. If you can't find anything, you can always (at lunch and dinner) get pasta prepared with several choices of toppings and sauces.We only ate at one of the restaurants, the Dominican restaurant called Pilon. This was a really great meal and I am glad I went. The problem is you are expected to wear pants at all the restaurants except the buffets. I was so uncomfortable and hot the whole night that we canceled our reservations for the rest of the week. Also, I just didn't want to have to follow a schedule on my vacation. Also, the sister resorts are crazy! They are very nice looking, but there is way to many people (and kids) at the other resorts.Bars:Yes, there always seems to be a problem with the VIP and getting top shelf liquor, but I wasn't so worried about it. Most of the good liquor is at the lobby bar, where you would hang out at night. They do have it, you just have to request it, and usually add a tip. There is always somewhere to get a drink 24hrs. Usually the beach bar is open all night, and you can get food there too.Staff:For the most part they were very friendly. You will almost never be spoken to in English unless they know you don't speak Spanish. Some staff, including bar tenders don't speak much English at all, but here is your Spanish lesson: Dos Coco Locos mas por favor mmmmm.....coco locos...I wish I had one right now! The first night I did have a run in with one of the chefs that knew I didn't speak much Spanish, and I think he was taking a few shot at me to his buddy who was laughing. Oh well, I've seen many Americans do that to foreigners in our country too.Over all, a great time, and I would definitely go back. If you need pampered and every need catered to, this report is not for you. If you think Americans are better than everyone else, stay home. If you want excellent food, this resort is not for you. If you are an easy going person looking for an inexpensive, relaxing break from the norm, I would definitely recommend the Punta Cana Princess.Oh, and you are not allowed to take Mamajuana (the drink) out of the country, as it had leaves and branches. So, either pack it in your suitcase and lie to the USDA, or don't buy any.

<Content>Beautiful but somewhat disappointing I booked our reservations through AAvacations for me, my husband, my sister-in-law and brother-in-law for July 8-14, 2007. We chose the PCP because it was all adults and a smaller resort and from all the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor. The plane from JFK in NY left on time and was a pleasant flight. We arrived at the Punta Cana, were greeted by lovely ladies and island music and had a bit of a wait on line for Prieto Tours for our transportation to the PCP. The other lines for tour companies were much shorter. When we were finally assigned a bus, there was no room for the four of us, so we were taken off and put on another bus, hoping that our luggage was also being moved, and it was. We had to wait until this bus was full before it finally left. The bus ride was close to an hour and made numerous stops at other resorts to drop off people. The PCP was the last stop. The ride was a bumpy one, but it's good to see that they're working hard to improve the roads. The transfers were part of our package, but if you have a choice I would suggest taking a cab. Going directly to the resort would have been a lot quicker. Checking in was quick. We were given a warm fruit drink, no cool towel as some have written. We booked the VIP, but other than the great dinner at La Cava, it probably wasn't worth it. We requested rooms in the 5000 building, but were told there were none available. We were given room 4114 and my sister-in-law 4l08 on the second floor. I requested a king size bed and that too was refused. We were given a map of the resort and other information and told to go to our rooms and our luggage would be brought by shortly, which it was. The room was very spacious, had a sitting area and a balcony overlooking the pool and the air conditioner worked fine. The bathroom was a nice size with double sink and vanity. The towels, as many have written, were worn, thin and have lost their whiteness. We had beach towels in the closet which also were in bad shape. These were never replaced, which I thought was part of the VIP package and we always had to go to the hut to replace them with dry ones. The refrigerator had water, soda and beer, there was the small bottle of rum, which was part of the VIP and three complimentary cigars. There were also robes in the closet for us to use while there.As the days went on, we did have to go to the front desk to report some problems. The frame around our mirror in the bathroom came off and we were afraid the very large mirror would be next. The toilet kept running at one time and wouldn't stop and there was some water accumulated on the floor and we couldn't figure out where that came from.I would say that our main problem was trying to communicate. I know it would be hard to learn the many languages of the guests that stay there, but I don't know if they try. They gave us one very small bar of soap. When I saw the maid in the hall I asked her for some more and she didn't know what I was talking about. After a lot of had gestures and finally another maid who figured it out, our maid finally got it, although there was no soap on her cart and she had to go upstairs somewhere to get some. Same thing when we needed another box of tissues. A couple of days later, our used towels were taken away, but not replaced. This time we called the desk. We did generously tip the maid after she brought us the soap, but I wouldn't say it made much of a difference. One other disturbing thing that occurred was that we never got phone messages. One of our daughters and a friend were staying at another resort that week. When we tried to contact her to make sure they arrived safely we were told that she wasn't registered. Since our cell phones didn't work there, it took calls to NY to our other daughter to track her down and we learned that she was registered at that resort and she had called and left a message at the PCP for us. We never got that message or another that my daughter in NY left for us. When we checked with the desk they said there were no messages. This bothered us because if there was an emergency we would not have known. Also phone cards that we brought with us were useless there and we had to charge our calls to NY on a credit card - beware the average 5 minute call cost about $42 and then you were charged $2 by the resort.I must say the resort is beautiful and the gorunds are well maintained. The pool was great, never crowded, there were lounge chairs all over but covered with towels from early in the morning. It appears that people put the towels down to reserve them and then go off to the beach or on an excursion. Some were never occupied by people. Since we spent most of our time at the pool we wanted to make sure we had a spot so my brother-in-law did what everyone else did. Made sure he got down there early and put towels on 4 lounges. The swim-up bar is always fun, although they usually had only one bartender who cared for the people in the pool and on the upper level for those who just walked up to it. We went down to the beach a couple of times and the beach is beautiful. The sand is white and soft and they do their best to keep the seaweed away. As for the food, it is pretty average. There is a variety at the buffet so you will find something. We ate breakfast and lunch there and two of our dinners. The other nights we went to El Sombrero (Mexican), Shanghay (Chinese), Mare Nostrum (Seafood) and La Cava, also seafood, which was included in our VIP package. La Cava was our favorite, but I must say it's very dark and very chilly. They have to keep it that way because the room has bottles of wine everywhere. The grilled lobster I had was outstanding. My in-laws ordered steak at the El Sombrero and had to send it back. It was so tough they couldn't cut it. We weren't too impressed with the Chinese restaurant either but being from New York it's very hard to find Chinese food anywhere else that compares. As for nightly entertainment, there is very little at the PCP. The animation team does try, but the space in the lobby where they perform is limited, with very little seating. Isabel the waitress is very sweet and we had fun speaking with her. I do believe that We never went to the other resorts for entertainment because it didn't start until 9:45 p.m. After having dinner and walking around in the heat and humidity, by that time all you wanted to do was go somewhere cool. We did go to the casino a few times which was fun but small. We went to Manatee Park where we met up with my daughter and she and her friend and my husband swam with the dolphins. Well, it's not acutally swimming. You get into a pool with other people, the dolphins come up to you and at one point a worker directs you to hold onto the dolphin's fins and it pulls you to the side of the pool. Sorry this is so long, but when I was looking for a resort and spent many hours reading reviews (mostly positive), I decided that I should share my thoughts and our experiences at the PCP. I hope my review was helpful. It's not my intent to scare anyone away from staying there. It is a beautiful resort and the fact that it's small and adults only is definitely a plus. It's a quiet place to get away from crowds and kids, if that's what you want. Wherever you go and wherever you stay, I hope you have a safe vacation and a great time.

<Content>Enjoyed Our Stay at the Punta Cana Princess! We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from July 18-25. My husband (30)and I (27) went with another couple, who are also in their late twenties/early thirties. My husband and I have been to an all inclusive adults only resort before. All four of us really had a great time, but there were two things that we found to be disappointing. 1)Desserts- every dessert that we tried at either the buffet or ala carte restaurants were not good at all. 2)Drinks- of all the reviews I read on this site, I had heard some people say the drinks were not consistently cold and I would have to agree. Sometimes we would order a nice tropical drink like a Pina Colada for example, and it would be nice and cold and slushy like, but sometimes we would get one and it would be like drinking Pina Colada juice, it was all liquid and not very cold/icy. When I think of a Pina Colada or Daiquiri, I think of a nice icy cool refreshing drink and I did not get that very often. Although we were not happy with these two things we would actually still return to the Punta Cana Princess. And now onto all of the positives about the resort: Check In- We had no problem with check in. It was nice to be greeted with a cool towel and a glass of yummy tropical punch. We were then off to find our rooms and when we got there our luggage was there. Room- Our room was great, we stayed in 5107. It was the perfect location, we were on the second floor and loved that our building was so close to the pool. The room itself was very big, we had two queen beds and then there was a little sitting area where the tv and fridge were. The bathroom was also a nice size, I loved the double sinks, it was great cause my husband and I each had our own space to get ready. Also the AC worked really, really well, it actually got pretty cold in our room the first day and the rest of the time there we stayed plenty cool by turning off the AC and just having the ceiling fan on. Food- I thought the food was really good. We at at the Caribe buffet twice. Our first night, Wednesday, it was an Asian buffet and we definitely found enough to eat that we liked there. We also ate there on the Domnican buffet night, Monday, which was really good too. They had music playing while we ate too and it was just nice to get a little taste of Dominican culture. The rest of the nights we ate at the ala carte restaurants. We tried Il Pilon, Domincan food, Il Bacio, Italian food, La Cava, the fancy retaurant and Tex Mex restaurant, I forget the name of it though, anyway we enjoyed the food at all of them. La Cava was very nice, I had the lobster. It came with two lobster tails, my first one was really good but the second was overcooked. At the Tex Mex restaurant, when we got there it was super hot in the restaurant and they sat us right near the kitchen. My husband went to talk to someone at Guest Services and right away the manager came in and was over at the thermostat checking on the AC. We were pretty happy that they took care of it so quickly. Our meal was really good and I loved the margaritas they gave out there as well as the guacamole and chips. Staff- We found the staff to be incredibly friendly. From the Anamacion staff to the hostess at the buffet to the bartenders, everyone we met greeted us with an Ola! and was happy to help us. I have noticed that some people that have reviewed this resort has said the staff was unfriendly. I am wondering if it is just the language barrier. I was not really able to speak Spanish much, I really tried though, and I did feel that I wasn't as connected to the staff as those guests who could speak fluent Spanish. I don't think it has anything to do with being not friendly I just think it is harder to connect with people if you do not share the same language. I feel like I tried as much as I could to talk with the staff and they tried as much as they could to talk to me. And that is all you can ask for. Beach- was beautiful although actually we did not spend too much time here. We did do a few activities on the beach like ping pong and pilates, but beyond that we really just liked being by the pool. Pool- We loved the pool! It was huge, had a nice pool bar and each day we found a nice palapa to sit under in the same spot near the pool. There were also lots of activities at the pool, we did aerobicos a few times which was a little silly but fun and also played pool volleyball. Cleanliness- The resort was very well maintained, I would daily see people at work clean up the debris on the beach as well as working on maintaining the gardens around the resort. Overall: We all really enjoyed our stay at the Punta Cana Princess. Although we were not too happy with the consistency of cold drinks and the below average desserts, everything else was wonderful our nice, spacious room, good food, friendly staff, beautiful beach and pool. We would go back again!

<Content>The food is TERRIBLE! I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess for 5 nights too long. The hotel was beautiful, overall, the service was good. However, the beds and pillows were very hard. It almost seemed that the pillows were made out of rubber. Finally, for a 5 star hotel, the food was by far the worst I have every had. There were 6 of us in our party and we were all sick with an upset stomach every night. Good luck if you're planning on staying there. By the way, the food at the other hotels in the Princess chain are just as bad, especially the Dominican Restaurant, El Pilon, at the Caribe Club Princess. Oh, and be prepared for a long wait at the restaurants!

<Content>Princess resort We arrived at the resort and got checked in pretty easy. There were 16 of us and we all stayed in the VIP. The rooms were great. The bottle of rum was small but that made it easier to pack. The pool is really nice but it closes at 8pm. We played volleyball and it would have been nice to do more at night. There is not alot to do at night. The casino was smaller then I thought it would be and we were treated very rude. We didn't leave our place anymore. The food was good for the most part but there were times we were not sure what we were really eating. Advice for anyone going is to book your night meals the first day you are there. We were there for 4 nights and only got in restraunts 2 of those nights. The seafood places had great food. There weren't alot of people there but they said they were booked. Maybe we had problems getting reservations since there were 16 of us but we always saw empty tables. I wish there were more things to do at night. This is a adult resort so it really sirprised us that there wasn't more going on. Room service was good but it takes 45-60 min. We didn't have a menu in our room but the lady I talked to helped me on the phone pick out some food. Most of the staff was nice but there were a few that didn't seem like they liked americans. We really tried to to speak some spanish but it had been several years since I took it in school. Take a book with you and it will help you. One of the things that we were disappointed in was the one hour free motorized water sport. things were booked up and the only things available you could only get 15 min because they said that was equal to one hour on the boat that was booked. The banana boat only had half of the straps that worked and that made it hard with 8 people on it. The driver kept whipping us off and after about 5 min riding we were done. The spa was good and we had no problems getting in. The VIP was nice but I guess we thought it was going to be more. There were some miss leading things that we thought we were going to get and didn't . The only beer was presidente and budwiser. Over all it was a nice trip but this is not a place I would return to for a vacation

<Author>PortugalLost
<Content>What can i say?? My wife and I (ages 33 and 31from Portugal) stayed at the PCP July 15-21,2007, but NO VIP guests. This was not our first all inclusive. After reading ALL the reviews, our only concern for our much anticipated stay was the weather. Allow us to thank all of our fellow trip advisor members for taking the time to share their thoughts. Here's ours, we will try to be as brief and thorough as possible.CHECK IN: smooth although I was denied room requested in building 5000 or 4000, because I was not VIP guest, I found that hard to believe, because I read that other guests with no VIP were in building 5000 or 4000, so we went to 3000. I quickly realized that begging and pleading was getting me nowhere.  We were instructed to find our building and room without assistance. (our luggage would follow). Not that we would have had difficultly, but we expected to be escourted with our luggage and shown to our room properly. We are not uppity people, but we have been to enough resorts to know and appreciate quality and class. We settled into our room 3124, slightly disappointed, but happy to get our vacation underway. THE ROOM, was very accomodating, although, the AC worked quietly only on low fan speed. The fridge was warm.THE BATHROOM was spacious with double sinks, one drained very,very slowly. Hot water, good pressure at all times. The bath towels are a disgrace, 2 stars at best. They were small, some frayed, rough and tinted gray.. We regret to inform you that the FOOD IS BORDERING ON AWFUL in the buffet!!!!. Just as a recent reviewer stated, the ala carte restaurants are a pity. We came to realize that there is something not quite right , we went to 鈥淚l Bacio鈥?the Italian (Lasanha was good), 鈥淢amma Mia鈥?other Italian in Tropical (porc with hot sauce was good), Tex Mex (the best filet mignon ever!!), El Sombrero the Mexican in Tropical (with nice porc and beef) and the Chinese that I don麓t remember the name as also good鈥?Despite these shortcomings, we are actually looking forward to returning because the beautiful beach, R  R, no kids and hopefully better weather is what it's all about for us. When you stay at the PCP, please keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The major disappointment, all things considered, would be the food. The weather is always a gamble.  In conclusion, the beautiful grounds, white sand beach, gorgeous turquoise waters, pleasant service people (front desk not included), spotless  spacious rooms were the highlights that couldn't be ruined by the afore mentioned drawbacks.We would recommend this resort for those who can temporarily put aside their culinary discretion to enjoy the otherwise positive benefits. As for us, we will re visit the Trip Advisor web site in search of true Luxury Resorts, because overall, many little disappointments add up to one large disappointment .Last Note: The resort is Emilio (from Lobby Bar) and Emilio is the resort鈥?if you don鈥檛 understand please ask for Emilio and you will see!!

<Content>Had a Great Time We stayed at the PC Princess from July 7th to July 14. We were 2 couples - Tommy  Joanie and Bobby  Denise. We were in building 5 #5106  #5004. We requested to be near each other but on arrival there was a problem. Bobby  Denise stayed in building 4. The next day we again complained  they moved them into bulding 5 to be near us. Of course we tipped the front desk. The rooms were clean  the refrig always stocked with plenty of beer. Even Budweiser that my husband requested along with Presidente  Soberana. We overlooked the pool  ocean view. We had the VIP plan which allows you to make reservations ahead of time for the restaurants which is a great idea. That was worth it. We did upgrade our 20 minute massage to 55 minutes  it was well worth it. The beds on the beach were great and the huts are too. Never had a problem getting a spot - plenty of space. The beach is gorgeous as is the ocean. Sometimes you did get sea weed but it never bothered us  the cleaning crew was always cleaning up. We did try to book the free motorized sport which was a boat ride but they told us it was booked for the week  we did this our 1st day there. So we weren't that happy about that. Our husbands went deep sea fishing  caught a marlin which made their trip great.We have been to the DR 5 times and love the people and the hotels. This resort was great because it wasn't too big like some of the others. You have the option to use all the facilities at the other 2 sister hotels which we did. We met people from all over the country (Atlanta,Georgia (Andrew , Nicky  friends)  Saratoga, NY. Also our friends from Canada - Sav  Leanne  Lena  Tom. Wonderful people. They made our week wonderful. The casino is nice. We had some fun there too. As for tipping - I noticed at this resort they were looking for tips all the time. We are all tippers but it seemed to be at times too much. Hands out a lot more than usual. But we tipped anway  made the best of it. The Pool was beautiful  again met great people there every late afternoon after the beach. The tram ride to the other hotels was a lot of laughs. Sometimes the driver went to fast  other times nice  slow. The food was average at this resort. Plently of food and a lot of choices. The lobster everyone said was great - me not liking seafood ate steak which was okay. You had plenty to eat and enjoy. I didn't care for the mixed drinks so drank plenty of water  once in a while a rum with diet coke. We agree we would return to this hotel in a few years because we did have soo much fun  liked mostly everythig about it. If anyone has questions, please fell free to e-mail me at trip advisor. Joanie from Bergenfield, NJ

<Content>Beautiful, quiet resort, left much to be desired My husband and I (ages 51 and 53) stayed at the PCP July 14-20,2007. VIP guests. This was not our first all inclusive. After reading ALL the reviews, our only concern for our much anticipated stay was the weather. We were so sure we would find our personal paradise here, that we booked another week for 4/2008, sight unseen. After reflecting on the week we just had, we MIGHT NOT have considered going back to the PCP. BUT, for the price for a week in April, ($2000.00 USD) we could not resist. Next time, being forwarned, we will have lower expectations. We need to say that the AFFORDABILITY of the PCP is one of the FEW ATTRIBUTES this resort has to offer.  Allow us to thank all of our fellow trip advisor members for taking the time to share their thoughts. Here's ours, we will try to be as brief and thorough as possible. CHECK IN, smooth although I was denied room requested 5215 or any third floor in building 5000 or 4000, Monica said with a frozen smile, they had none. I found that hard to believe, it being July. I quickly realized that begging and pleading was getting me nowhere. When it comes to room location, I am known for trying all theatrics to get my way. Didn't work at the PCP. Upon arrival, we were given a cool towel and a 1/4 full glass of warm juice. We were instructed to find our building and room without assistance. (our luggage would follow). Not that we would have had difficultly, but we expected to be escourted with our luggage and shown to our room properly. We are not uppity people, but we have been to enough resorts to know and appreciate quality and class. We settled into our room 5106, slightly disappointed, but happy to get our vacation underway. THE ROOM, was very accomodating, although, the AC worked quietly only on low fan speed. The fridge was warm, it needed to be defrosted. After 2 calls to the front desk, to no avail, our housekeeper took care of it the next AM, because she spoke to someone and they understood her language. We were instructed to leave the fridge door open when we left the room for the day. THE BATHROOM was spacious with double sinks, one drained very,very slowly. Hot water, good pressure at all times. The bath towels are a disgrace, 2 stars at best. They were small, some frayed, rough and tinted gray. (Meant to be white.) For those of you who are in need, they did supply face cloths.  We regret to inform you that the FOOD IS BORDERING ON AWFUL. Just as a recent reviewer stated, the ala carte restaurants are a pity. Even La Cava, which hides behind an intimate atmosphere and pretentious service. (Ladies beware, it is freezing in there, we asked to have the AC turned down, they did so begrudgingly). We came to realize that there is something not quite right with the beef at the resort (or perhaps in this Country). We found this mystery meat to be dangerous to our digestive tracts. We never cared for buffet style dining, but that was the only time we felt safe. The weather did not help our overall sense of disappointment. We were there for 5 full days (not counting 2 travel days). The first day was partly cloudy, second day, cloudy, no rain,the next day, pouring rain until 2PM, the next day... total washout. The last day of our vacation was picture perfect weather.  Despite these shortcomings, we are actually looking forward to returning because the beautiful beach, R  R, no kids and hopefully better weather is what it's all about for us.  When you stay at the PCP, please keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The major disappointment, all things considered, would be the food. The weather is always a gamble. Oh yeah, speaking of gambling, The CASINO, we found it to have a sleazy feel to it and I did not feel safe on the tram going on the public road. The SPA on the other hand was one of the nicest I have ever visited.  During our vacation, I celebrated my birthday. The staff delivered a fruit plate to our room, nice thought, except the delivery person helped themself to our complimentary cigars!!! I reported the theft to guest services. I was more concerned that in the future, more items would be missing. Nothing was done about the incident for 3 days. I reported it again and the guest relations manager said she had not heard of the incident. Our cigars were replaced x2 but the management never apologized for the dishonesty of their staff (which concerned us much more the the cigars.)  In conclusion, the beautiful grounds, white sand beach, gorgeous turquoise waters, pleasant service people (front desk not included), spotless  spacious rooms were the highlights that couldn't be ruined by the afore mentioned drawbacks. We would recommend this resort for those who can temporarily put aside their culinary discretion to enjoy the otherwise positive benefits. We hope that the management responds to the complaints and resolves some of these problems.  As for us, we will re visit the Trip Advisor web site in search of true Luxury Resorts, because overall, many little disappointments add up to one large disappointment .

<Content>A little disappointed My husband and I stayed at the PCP from July 1-8th. We were not able to reserve VIP before arrival and we chose not to upgrade for $44.00per day after arrival. We did not see any premium liquor at either the swim up bar or Mare Nostrum which are the areas we were in most of the time. The resort is kept clean and our room(4108) was fine after being moved from one with water leaking from the bathroom ceiling(4016). We tried a variety of restaurants and they were all okexcept Shanghay. We arrived 5 minutes early with about 15 other people and we were all told to wait. They then rushed around to take off the food orders without even offering a beverage. They brought usan eggroll/wonton appetizer which was cold. The main course was better but the service was terrible. Service was great in all the other restaurants, we left this one before they could bring dessert.The resort was fairly quiet which was great. The beach was nice and easy to walk on. There was quite a bit of sea grass though. We have been to many all inclusive resorts and non A/I in the past. I would probably not return to the PCP unless it was quite a bit less than wepaid. I called guest services to make a manicure appointment. I asked to be transferred to the spa and was charged $2.00 to do so. I was not told in advance this would be the case. Upon checkout they said I owed $6.00-$7.00 for using a calling card from the room. I do not own a calling card and we spent about 20 minutes waiting while the manager (in the back) decided we did not have to pay for that. I

<Content>how about english as a 2nd language Where do I begin......Well besides being bumped off our flight from JFK and losing our luggage for three days, after day 3 it was ok for my first all inclusive trip.Suggestion................................My suggestion would be to have the hotel assign a person to help guests (BILINGUAL WOULD BE A PLUS) for special situations like arriving at the hotel with no luggage. I do understand that it is not the fault of the resort, but alittle compasion goes along way. Possible have a LOST LUGGAGE WELCOME BAG which could possible include toothbrush/toothpaste, deordorant, razors and maybe a couple of tee shirts (with Punta Cana Princess advertising of course). After travelling ALL DAY and checking in with no bags, we ended up going into the Gift Shop and purchasing 2 toothbrushes, a small tube of paste, 2 razors and a small thing of deordorant and it cost us $26.00. Since the front desk could not help with our baggage situation, I had to contact AA bagage claim in Punta Cana. This venture involved purchasing telephone cards and paying $2.00 for a outside line every time I made a local call. Fifteen calls later (@ $2.00 a call = $30. + the two telephone cards at $10) , I finally was able to locate my luggage and it was delivered Tuesday morning. Other than that, beaches were beautiful, service was good, food, well that's a whole nuther story. They should also hire an entertainment director. We shuttled over to the sister hotel for that cuz ours wasn't too great.The room was beautiful. Never saw the gym or jacuzzi (probably someone at the front desk could have mentioned it at check in).ALSO....never new there was a refrigerator in the room until day 4. (oops....something else for that front desk to do).All in all, a good trip. Probably would go back to Punta Cana but would try another resort.

<Content>MOST amazing honeymoon EVER My new hubby  I went to the Punta Cana Princess Resort from July 3 to July 9th and we had the BEST time!!! We took the VIP package (since so many ppl raved about it) and it was absolutely, completely, one hundred percent worth it. Just the 24-hr free room service made it all worth it!!! One night, around 2 am we ordered 3 desserts, 2 sandwiches  salad (we were famished from doing honeymoon activities ;) and the guy brought it to us with a smile!!! Even though the tip is included  they don't expect tips, we would always tip ones to the maid, room service guys, the customer service men  women, and the bartenders. Everywhere we went staff smiled at us, shook my hubbys hand, patted him on the back - it was fabulous! One thing we were amazed about was that there were no bugs! We couldn't figure it out! They must spray for them all the time (altough we never smelled anything chemical) but when we got back home to Texas, we found more mosquitos in our back porch than on our whole 7-day stay!! Another perk is that it is adults-only and a lot smaller than the two sister resorts (although it was fun to go there for the shows, the a la carte restaurants, and walk through their park with random peacocks roaming the landscape! ). At night it's much quieter  most of the time, in the evening, you have like the entire beach to yourselves to take romantic walks, with our toes in the wet sand  hear nothing but the roar of the ocean waves... it was amazing. Also, the VIP beach beds ROCKED. It didn't matter what time we woke up (8 am or 11 am) there was always one available! All the food was AWESOME, especially all the fresh fruit  I loooooved the grilled chicken! My bubby loved the burgers  DEFINITELY loved the size of the steak at La Cava. The only problem we had with the food was that we always ate too much! Also, my hubby (from Brasil) thought that Rodizzio (the Brasilian a la carte) was good food, but not Brasilian by any means. The drinks were amazing too. I should note though, that neither of us drink alcohol so it took some convincing of the staff that we really, truly wanted our drinks sin alcohol, virgin . At first, many thought we were kidding. and I had to throw away a few drinks (I just can't stand the actual taste of alcohol, I know, it's weird) but they'd always make me another one without alcohol, laughing in disbelif ;) We did the parasailing (not included) and it was totally worth it for my hubby  I thought it was really neat too, but I got kind of motion sick towards the end  I felt gross on the boat ride back. We also went to Manati Park (not included) and swam with the dolphins! That was AWESOME! We also loved the other shows! It was all GREAT fun! We really had a great time  it was always easy to book the a la cartes for dinner by phone in the mornings. But truthfully, I really liked the all day Casabe buffet the best!!! There was just so much variety  you didn't have to choose just one thing! That probably relates more to my personality preferences than the actual food itself! They were both about equal in quality (for my middle class taste anyways! ;) but I enjoyed the variety and flexibility more of the buffet. We only have one warning for fellow Americans who don't travel all the time (like ourselves) , the Europeans are very flexible with their bodies  exposure! Even the old men (...in string thongs!) it was funny, but awkward to see at first... lol - we got used to it by the end of our trip though. Overall, we want to send every honeymooning couple there - it was AMAZING.

<Content>Ok, but wouldn't return My wife and I recently spent our honeymoon at this hotel, after reading all the positive reviews we couldn't wait to go. Unfortunately our stay was a bit of an anti-climax.Check in was fine, the receptionist was really friendly etc. As honeymooners we asked about a possible upgrade and were told yes this was ok as long as we were willing to pay an additional $100 per night.........we didn't take her up on her kind offer!!! (the brochure states honeymooners get a free upgrade when available)The room was lovely, very spacious, air con VERY good and the fridge had beer!! We did notice several damp patches in the ceiling though, so did the maid when she was cleaning one day when we were in there! Apart from that we have no complaints, apart from channel 96 only showing adult films on one day!! :-)The beach is lovely, probably the best we've ever seen, spotless soft white sand and clear blue sea. It is picture postcard stuff and it really took our breath away when we first saw it.The grounds are immaculate, the friendly gardeners will offer to climb up and get you a coconut too which is a nice touch.We found a few problems though which put us off ever going back to this hotel, maybe not the DR but definitely this hotel:THE STAFF:Whilst most were very courteous and friendly there were the odd few who gave you the impression this was too much like hardwork! The pool bar gentleman is one, also the gentleman who works the lobby bar was only interested in serving you if you were lining his pocket with dollars. There is a certain favouritism to Spanish guests too, whilst I have no problem with the Spaniards I object to waiting at the bar and then a Spaniard appearing from nowhere and being served immediately. It's not as if we didn't tip on a regular basis, much more generous than most but it didn't seem to matter. THE FOOD:The buffet is probably your safest bet, I found the food pretty good in there although my wife didn't and subsequently lost half a stone on our trip. There is a different theme every evening and I found the food to be of a pretty good standard. I never eat veg at home but the veg here was amazing, so was the rice and all the meat dishes. (if you're a very fussy eater then perhaps this hotel isn't for you) The a la carte restaurants aren't worth going to, the Chinese is pretty bad, Tex Mex steak didn't taste like steak to me, the Mexican in the other hotel is average but the Italian is probably the worst meal I've EVER had.My biggest problem of all was certain cliental, for a so called 5 star hotel I find it disgusting that people smoke in the pool and flick their ash in the water. I also don't understand why people took the time to walk to the lunch buffet at the Mare Nostrum (beach restaurant) and then walk back and eat their burgers, pasta, sausages etc IN THE POOL?????!!!!In my eyes the hotel consisted of 80% Spanish, perhaps 10% American and the remaining 10% a mixed bag of other nationalities. The staff seem to favour certain nationalities, one in particular and I find this pathetic in this day and age.To sum it up, nice beach, beautiful weather, the sea and pool water are like a bath, the buffet very good, and the rooms are very spacious but a little TLC would make them immaculate.My review is honest and to the point I feel, please feel free to get in touch.

<Content>Fit for a Princess!!! We arrived at the Punta Cana Princess at 6.30 pm and check-in was quick and easy. We were given room 5004, attached a label to our luggage and then walked to find the room ourselves. The bags were delivered within a very few minutes of our being in the room. We did not upgrade to the VIP package but had a ground floor room near the beach overlooking the pool. We had bath robes provided and also beach towels were in the room even though we had been given towel cards. The room was very pleasant with two double beds and separate seating area. There was a coffee maker and a digital clock, ample storage space and hangers, and also a TV with a good number of channels in English. We were also pleased to have a room safe provided free of charge which was programmable with your own numerical code. There was also a fridge containing soft drinks and beer. We never touched the soft drinks and only had a couple of the beers so I am not sure how often the fridge was replenished. There was a 2L bottle of water which we used in the bathroom for teeth cleaning and also to make coffee. We left a note on the first morning requesting extra water and always got it after that. The room was kept spotlessly clean each day and fresh towels provided. We tipped a small amount each day and had flowers and towel sculptures left by the maid. As other reviewers have said, the beach is fabulous. There were a great many people playing the 鈥渢owel game鈥?and although we are early risers and were actually sitting on the beach by 8 am all the palapas near to the ocean were already reserved. No big deal, we found a place we liked and sat there every day. The towels provided for the beach are collected from the aquatic centre which was only open from 9 am 鈥?5 pm which I did not think was quite long enough. Also the actual towels were often in really poor condition 鈥?thin and even holey! Let the hotel down in my opinion. The pool is really nice and because the hotel is for adults only, never felt crowded. We always moved our 鈥渃amp鈥?up to the pool mid-afternoon and never had any trouble finding beds and shade. The reason we moved from the beach was that we received a number of insect bites in the late afternoon on the beach. I was badly bitten around my face and eyes and even ended up having to see the hotel doctor. One eye was so badly swollen, it was almost closed. I looked ghastly! The doctor is located 24 hours at the Caribe Club. I spoke to him by phone and then the bellboy took me over to see him on a golf buggy. The doctor spoke excellent English and was thorough in his treatment. This incident was the only thing to mar a really excellent vacation. We had breakfast everyday in the main buffet restaurant. We liked the fact that a young lady meets and greets and shows you to a table. However, we did find that service in the buffet was erratic. There was no shortage of staff or willingness but the waiters and waitresses seemed to rush around a lot and not achieve all that much. They were not very good at topping up water or wine at dinner but this was just a minor irritation. We found the food to be hot when it should be or cold when required. The variety was not huge but there was always something acceptable. We preferred to eat dinner at the a la carte restaurants when possible. Lunch was taken at the beach bar. The setting is superb and they did a really good job of keeping the sand out. The food was always the same but varied and enjoyable. The waiters went to the bar for drinks for you. Some days they did a barbeque on the beach and provided a delicious sangria. On Monday night, they move all the chairs out of the buffet and on to the beach. The Mare Nostrum becomes the buffet for the night. Now this is just my personal opinion but WHY???? We absolutely hated it. You had to walk on sand in your good sandals, it was too dark to see, could not find a table and it was impossible to get a drink. The food was not very nice either. They also allow traders to set up stalls on the path to the beach and they were unpleasantly persistent.. We resolved not to go to the beach night on our second Monday and were able to book the Tex Mex that night. We had no problems booking a la carte restaurants. We went to the lobby in the evening to Guest Services and never waited more than a couple of minutes. We could book 3 nights at once. We went to all the a la cartes at the Princess twice and once to the Dominican at the Caribe. The Dominican was by far our least favourite. The staff were surly and the food tepid. My friend had an upset stomach after we had dined there. That was the only tummy troubles we had. We enjoyed all the restaurants at the Punta Cana Princess. Le Petite Fondue was fun and the melted chocolate dessert was to die for. The Italian was good but portions huge. I had a pizza and could only manage a couple of slices. They were very worried that there was something wrong with it and wanted to get me something else. I was just stuffed. The Tex Mex was excellent and I can recommend the Fillet Mignon. I am not a big meat eater but I enjoyed this. We only went on one trip which we booked via the aquatic centre. It was the catamaran trip. The cost was $84 each for the whole day. We walked along to the left of the hotel to get to the boat but were brought back by Jeep on a 20 minute drive which was fine. The catamaran was much smaller than the ones we had traveled on around Puerta Plata but this was nice. The day was varied with a trip around the wreck located by the Iberostar, snorkeling time, a big beach slide, a visit to a shark/ray sanctuary and then to a natural swimming pool. The bar was included and a light lunch. A lovely day. In the evening, the animation team put on some kind of a show in the lobby. We did not like this. It was very unsophisticated and not in keeping with a 5 Star Adults Only resort. It would have been much more preferable to have say a pianist playing there each night. There was not a great deal of seating in the lobby and this could be much improved. The only other alternative is the beach bar. This is a beautiful location but all the drinks are served in paper cups which is not great at night. In conclusion, we rated the Punta Cana Princess very highly and would return. The fact that there are no kids is a huge bonus. We walked around the two sister hotels and found the atmosphere manic. We were glad to return to the calm of our own hotel. We have been to quite a number of hotels in the Dominican Republic over the last ten years and nowhere is perfect but without doubt the negatives at this hotel were far outweighed by the positives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<Content>You will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will love this resort! The resort is really beautiful and gorgeous. The grounds are impeccable and really pretty. It is so clean and pristeen. The staff really goes above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. They always say hi and are so friendly even if they do not speak your language. A smile even goes a long way. We had VIP and we felt it was worth it as you get the extra perks. We stayed in room 5213 and it was great. Our room had a cathedral ceiling and we overlooked the pool and the beach. Our mini bar was stocked at all times. We walked down the beach and the PCP was truely the nicest resort around. The beach is just beautiful and there are plenty of chairs to go around and if you are VIP you get the really comfortable beds as well to use. We usually went to the sister hotel for dinners and entertainment and it was fun. Going there was a snap as it is a short walk if you want or the trams comes every 10 minutes or so that drives you there. The other resort is for families so it is more crowded and has kids everwhere. The PCP is so quiet and serene and you really feel like you have the whole resort to yourselves. We have never been to an all adult place before and it was really nice, you don't miss the kids at all and it is really nice. We would definitely recommend this place and would love to go back again someday. We took the all day excursion on the big truck and went to a sugarcane platation, a private house on the mountain and saw a typical family and we went to a private ranch on the beach and rode horseback on the beach, swam in the ocean, and in the private pools and then they served us all lunch. It was a very nice way to see the real Punta Cana and surrounding areas and it will really give you an appreciation as to what we have in our own homes. The only things that were not mentioned anywhere before we chose this resort was that there are no elevators as in most of the hotels there are only 3 floors. The main large buffets are open sided and not air conditioned so it is hot. We just booked a different specialty restaurant each nite and they are air conditioned and have really good food as well. It gets really hot and humid all the time and I am a sun lover and love to sunbathe and I will tell you to bring alot of sunblock (the higher the better) as you will be looking for the shade as the sun is extremely hot. Also bring aloevera for sunburn as you will need that too as you do get burned even with 50 sunblock on you. Other than that we have nothing bad at all to say about the resort. You will enjoy it! If anybody wants to ask me specific question I will be happy to answer you. My email is linbad2@msn.com. I am sad to be home and back to the grind but I have lovely memories of it.

<Content>If you want food posioning and horrible service, this is the place!! First off, the AC did not work in the room. It was like pulling teeth to get a room change. You would think with the number of American tourists that vacation this place, that the locals would learn some English. But no. Huge Language barrier. Numerous times would I have to ask 3 or 4 times for something as simple as a refil of my coke. The humidity was herendous, not to mention you are eating dinner outside almost all the time. No air in the lobby either. You also have to ask for the chefs to recook the food, because almost always is the food either undercooked of sometimes raw. A number of people had food poisoning. The entertainment was sub par. The beach needs to be cleaned badly, with cigaratte buds and trash everywhere. On several ocasions at this all inclusive resort (tipping is optional) we tipped the waiter or bell hop, only to get a snide ungratful remark, thats it!! I would never go to the DR or recommend this place/'country to anyone.

<Content>best all inclusive resort ever first do yourself a favor and don't even bother reading the review by LITTLE BUNNY 06 ,MONTREAL .my husband and i stood at the PUNTA CANA PRINCESS june11 to june21 and totally loved it . Last year we went to St.Lucia and stood at the Sandals resoert, well let me tell you we loved that resort alot , but the Princess topped the Sandals resort .We thought that the Princess was all the five stars that it claims it is. The place is so clean and beautiful . everyday and all day long you would see workers and staff keeping up with the place, and a great job they did. As of speaking the language well we don't ,granted my husband is portuguese there may be a handful of words similar , but as for me i'm german born american citizen . so we would ask some phrases mostly used and learned them before we got there. but i did not thing there was a problem if we didn't know something in their language and spoke english .they would also do their best to understand what we were saying.what travelers have to remember they are poor people thry were born there work their butts off, they should not be expected to speak our language nor anybody elses.oh and by the way the food is great , there are so many selections at every seating wether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner.all those critics that say not much of a selection or not too much food or even the vegetarians who complain about no selections,all i have too say is were the hell do they go to eat to get satisfiy their hunger.you mention it and i pretty much think they had it. i will leave you future travelers with a heart warming thought .you need to remember your going to the caribbean, this means be on vacation enjoy the view the people and learn to relax , you will get your drink and your will get your food and your room will be cleanned and made up by a maid. just smile and relax greet the people in whatever language and they will smile and greet you back in their language and they are there to please you however thay can.LOVE SABINE , GO TO THE PUNTA CANA PRINESS!

<Content>Better than Hawaii!!! What a wonderful trip and hotel!! We just got back June 18-22, Friday and can't imagine how anyone could ever say anything negative about the Punta Cana Princess. The staff was WONDERFUL, friendly, generous, thoughtful and all of this with no additional tipping!!! The food was all wonderful, there was always something great to eat! Breakfast is spectacular and a most enjoyable meal. Lunch out by the beach was terrific with sandwich items, hot items, fruits, desserts, salads, salad bar, barbeque grilled hamburgers, chicken, pork and steak. There was a delicious rice dish with lots of fresh seafood at lunch also. At night, all of the a-la-carte restaurants were great but the grilled lobster at the Mare Noistrum was fantastic, anything we raved over, they bought us another one. If you walk over to the sister resorts, you really appreciate the quiet atmosphere when you return. Romantic music was always pumped thru the speakers in the gardens in the evenings and very pleasant island music in the daytime. No kids! We left 6 at home so it was a nice change for some romantic , stressfree time away. I honestly can't say enough good about this resort. Beach was beautiful! Everything was very clean and immaculate ALL OF THE TIME our room, the grounds, buffets, restrooms, beach, everything, much cleaner than the US. Couldn't believe that we got all that for such a terrific price! If more people knew about this, Hawaii would go out of business! Enjoyed it so much more and can't wait to go back again next summer!!!!!

<Content>God! What a disappointement! After reading so many good reviews...I was sure this would be a great hotel!Boy, was I mistaking...I'll get to the point:The good:-the beach-the weather-the rooms ( good size, very clean, working A.C) The BAD!!!:- service: terrible !! We had never been treated this way anywhere...If you didn't speak spanish ( andI do, but my husband doesn't ),nobody would give you the time of day when tryingto ask for an information...they just turned their backs and pretended not tohear you...It was as if our being there was an inconvenience for them, they weretoo busy laughing and joking with each other...As for getting something to drink during any of the meals...well, good luck!Tipping didn't help either...Total disrespect !- food: horrible!!! disgusting...lack of choice...and whatever they had wasgross...the only time you could actually eat something was at breakfast (eggs bacon)Yes, you could go to the sister resort and eat( they had a larger buffet )...butit was really crowded all the time !!! We tried the Mexican restaurant and waited for about an hour to get served aFajita (was ok ) Chimichangas (gross)...At our hotel we tried El Mare Nostrum ( everything was either burned or coveredin some weird sauce...) We love trying new food, but this was just NOT GOOD!We also ate at the Italian restaurant Il Bacio which was ok...We didn't get a chance to try the Tex-Mex...you can only make reservationsbetween certain hours and it was all booked by the time we got there...This was our fourth all inclusive resort...we had been to Cuba 3 times and wewould NEVER EVER return to this resort...We loved Cuba each time and were superdisappointed with this trip...We still enjoyed the beach  sun but the staff disgusting food made us never want to hear about this resort again.There are plenty of great hotels in Punta Cana...please don't chose this one!!

<Content>Nice time at the punta cana princess My wife and i, both 49, stayed at the Punta Cana princess for 14 nights from 4th June 07. Overall we had a super holiday which we booked last minute 4 days before departure. At 拢1150 for two of us we thought we had excellent value for money. Clientele mainly Canadian, American, German odd French and a few English.I have tried to be honest and critical where i thought fit in this review, but must emphasize, we had a great time!!!!Accomodation; Generally good, although our first room 4018 was rather damp and musty smelling, we requested a change of room on day 2 and were given an odourless room without argument, but on the ground floor again. Fellow guests were also complaining of damp smelling rooms on the ground floor. Guests with British tour operators who we spoke to all seemed to be allocated ground floor rooms.Pool area; Nice pool and swim up bar, good water temperature and seemed pretty clean, although we always avoid late afternoon swimming in the pool as we feel pollution is at its highest then. A small army of cleaners washing everything down, loungers, patio area at 7.00 a.m every day. Poolside loungers were a disgrace though, nearly all of them being broken underneath and virtually collapsing, very uncomfortable. Replacements were made on some days but these were also used and also broken.I cannot understand the management mentality which allows something like this to mar what is generally a great pool area. Blimey, youv'e gotta lay on em most of the day after all, we don't all wanna come home with sciatica do we!Beach; Great beach area, as good as anywhere i've been.Gardens; Wow, manicured and tended to perfection to make this resort a natural paradise, one of the high spots. These gardeners deserve a medal, spare em a buck or two there worth it.Food; Good all round. Casabe buffet good always, found something good to eat, whether it be from the carvery, griddle or selections from the hot plates. Could be a but repetetive but hey where isn't on a 2 week holiday. Quality control regularly probe testing meat temperature etc which has to be a good sign.Steak House. Good, nice tender steak, Petit Fondue. Good again.Mama Mia at Tropical Princess Very good. La Cava a la carte at Tropical Princess, excellent . I found the beach restaurant to be the least appetizing so only ate there twice. I would rate the food at this resort highly overall and say it was a high spot of the holiday.Service; Generally very good, happy faces from most staff and a willingness to give good service whether tipping or not.Drinks; Presidente beer o.k. cocktails pretty good, local spirits leave a lot to be desired but are drinkable. We upgraded to v.i.p package for last four days of our stay, this made a lot of difference. At 22 u.s $ about 拢11 a day per person this was well worthwhile as it entitled you to premium brand drinks, a dinner at la cava ( very good) which would cost $25 per head, A massage $35 per head, internet access, an hour motorized watersportsand use of vip double beach beds and other little extras. I would reccomend doing this even if for only part of your stay.We did have a problem with one of the lobby bar staff trying to give us local drinks after upgrading to vip but we soon put him straight and had no further problems, just be aware.Entertainment; The animacion team were fine during daytime doing usual stuff, volleyball, aerobics etc, and were a nice bunch.But the evenings were a big disappointment, childish games, shouting down overloud microphones, this was the pits. the worst evening entertainment i have experienced in 5 trips to the caribbean and countless holidays in europe. Totally out of context for a laid back over 18 resort, the only big disappointment of this holiday. You could go to the Tropical Princess and watch the shows there if you wanted to though.We booked 2 trips during our stay, one to Saino island, through airtours via coach catamaran and speedboat, a long trip 11 hour round trip but i thought worthwhile and enjoyable, a beautiful island.The other a deep sea fishing trip, from the marlin fishing co, booked through airtours. We were ripped off, 9 on a small rundown boat for half day, stayed close to shore caught 1 fish, gave us a glass of coke though,well it was only $95 each and managed to cram 13 of us into a vehicle with 10 seats for the trip there and back.Obviously no one could belt up. Are these trips meant to be vetted by the tour operators ??????? Avoid this company MARLIN, I would research a company online before i went next time and book independentlyTo conclude, we had very little in the way of stomach / rear end problems, myself suffering one morning which i put down to an excess of mamajuana rum the night before. This is a very clean and well kept resort and i heard nobody complaing of any stomach problems.Did we enjoy our holiday? Too right we did. Would we go back to the Punta Cana Princess again? Too right we would. Would we recommend it to you ? Yes we would . Enjoy !!!!!!!!

<Content>Best Vaca Ever! First off The PCP was GREAT!My girlfriend and I stayed at the PCP from June 10 to June 17. One week is not enough. The flight there from Toronto was not bad about 4hrs, left T.O at 10:20am and arrived at 2:10pm. We were a little late checking in so we did not get to sit right beside each other on the plane. They did give us seats together but we were separated by the aisle, no big deal. When we arrived in Dominican customs was fast, there were those guys in white you hear about ready to take our bags, but we only had 1 piece of luggage each so we did not need their help, but they were not aggressive at all, as some people stated. Bus ride to the resort was a little longer than I would have liked but they had to drop other people to their resorts first, so nothing much to complain about. When we got there check-in was a breeze, the only thing we had a little problem with was, when my g/f booked the hotel we wanted a king size bed but when we got there they gave us a room with 2 doubles. The concierge told us the king size bed room was on the ground floor without a good view, but the 2 double bed room was on the 3rd floor and it had a pool/ocean view. So we checked it out and stayed with the double room. We were in room 4221, great view of the whole pool area and a pretty good view of the beach. After we got settled in we went to the service desk to get our tickets for our massage, 1 hour motorized sport, and internet access. While there we also decided to book what restaurants we wanted to eat at. It was a bit confusing as to when we have to book the restaurants, because there are certain times you can do so, but in the end it was ok. We tried to book for the same night but we couldn鈥檛 but luckily the guy there had a cancellation so on our first night we ate at Shangay, at the Caribe. The food there was pretty good, we both had lobster. It was dry but free so we really didn鈥檛 care about it too much. The other restaurants we tried were La Petite fondue (Very good), Rio Grande (O.K, but they messed up my order), and the other Seafood place at the Caribe (Very good but couldn鈥檛 finish because it was too much food), but I forgot the name. We also made reservations for Sombrero, and La Cava, but we ended up not going, and just eating at the Buffet. The Buffet had almost the same stuff all the time, with a couple of different dishes. It was good though nothing really to complain about.We went with the VIP package, and having access to the Beach beds are fabulous. Our first night there we stayed up really late, and on Monday morning we woke up really early had breakfast and just slept on the beach beds for a couple of hours getting tanned. Throughout the whole week we never had to wait or look hard for a beach bed. There was always one available. And even if you leave like your towel or a book on the bed and go away for awhile no one will take your spot no matter how long you鈥檙e gone. The beach at PCP was so nice and clean. If you were to walk over to the neighboring beaches they had seaweed all over the shore. But at the PCP they always kept it clean. We walked to the market on the beach but that was probably my least favorite thing to do there. The vendors there are so aggressive and they all have the same stuff. And when you do go into there stores they try and give you a deal but they end up asking for a price that is ridiculous. But you should never agree on the price they ask for. ALWAYS bargain, if they ask for 90US you give them the most 15US-20US, nothing more.  My g/f and I did a couple of excursions; we did the 1 hour boat ride to the ship wreck and along the shore line. That was fun, but they said the boat comes and picks us up at 2pm; they came at like 3pm. We also went parasailing, we did the tandem one so both of us were in the air at the same time that was OK, but we had to wait on the boat for 3 other couples to go first so we got a little sea sick, so that made the parasailing not as fun because we felt sick. And then on Friday we went to the Marinarium. That was an experience everyone should try. Forget swimming with Dolphins. Go swim with Sting Rays and Sharks. We went at the sunset trip that is when they feed the Rays and there aren鈥檛 as many people who go on that trip, so it is not that crowded as if you were to go during the daytime. When we went at sunset there was about 10 people, plus the crew. When you go during the afternoon there could be up to 30 people plus crew, so going at sunset is way better.Every night at the Caribe Resort they would put on a show at 9:45pm. We went to all the show except one. The performances were OK. Some performers were really good they can really dance and stuff but some looked like they did not know what was going on. If you go and check out the show try and see 鈥淕othic鈥? 鈥渢he MTV show鈥? 鈥淏efore鈥? and there is one more but I forgot the name.This trip was our first all inclusive trip and going to PCP made it a great experience. I hoped this helped anyone who is thinking of going to this resort, because honestly now that I am home I want to plan another trip there ASAP.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever! I know this review is kind of late, seeing as how my mom, brother, my best friend and myself went almost two years ago. But when I saw this hotel on the review page I knew I had to comment.This was my first tropical vacation, and I became hooked. The only bad part of this trip was the flight and bus ride, and that is ONLY because I get motion sickness quite easily and I am really not good on planes.Aside from being beautiful in just apperance, I would have to say that I met beautiful people as well. My brother became frends with Micheal he was an amazing guy who kept him entertained, my brother who was 15 at the time had lots of fun teaching his basketball tricks etc. It was good for him to have someone to talk to especially since I had brought my best friend with me.Rooms:The rooms were absolutely beautiful, they were MUCH bigger then i had expected, we had a standard room and it was lovely. The beds were a bit hard but that is to be expected anywhere you go, this happend to be a good thing for me because it helped my back quite a bit. The fridge was always stocked every day, we always had towels, and when we came back to our room our maid always left us a flower on our bed as well as two in the bathrooms, one by each sink. Although we didn't really have money so we couldn't tip, we always left a thank you note and when we left we left some perfumes and stuff behind for her. Food:The food was really good, we ate at the buffet as well as all the specialty restorants that they had. I loved the chicken fettucini alfredo i had it almost everyday. The deserts were always good, and the staff always made sure we had fresh drinks and were doing well. Beach: The beach was amazing you could walk forever it seemed in both directions. when you go onto the beach if you turn left and walk for about 5-10 minutes there are local vendors who are willing to bargin to give you a good price... we got lots of stuff and spent only a little. The beach was clean and there were always chairs available. Warning. It is a topless beach, be prepared for that, it suprised my 15 year old brother quite a bit, and he always blushed and looked away when a topless women would walk by. So if you have small children prepare for sunless tanning not only on the beach but by the pool as well.Day Trip:My mom took us all on a day trip as well. This included a bus ride through the town. it is beautiful and colourful, but it saddend me... I tend to take things to heart to much, and when I saw the size of the houses and the surroundings it made me feel bad for being at a big luxurious hotel. After the bus ride we ended up at another hotel where we went down the beach and boarded a speed boat, which took us to a huge Catamaran. Once boarded there were drinks and dancing, it was so much fun. We ended up going to a private protected beach where we had lunch and spent 3 hours swimming in the warm crystal clear water. We bought some necklaces from the local vendors and had a great time. After that we boarded a speed boat and went out into the middle of the water, way off the shore where the water ended up being only waste high, we saw starfish as well as other fish and it was amazing. It was really worth the extra money spent, I would recommend this to anybody! After that we boarded the catamaran again and went back to our hotel. Overall:This was a fantastic vacation and I would recomment anybody go to this hotel, I would love to go back, the staff was amazing, the rooms were spotless, and I had the time of my life! This hotel definetly got me hooked on vacationing, and I hope to someday go back! This really turned out to be a lot longer then i thought it would be.. but its such an amazing vacation that I just had to comment!

<Content>Garden of Eden This resort is the very best we have ever stayed in. My husband and I stayed here from 9 June - 15 June. We are in our mid 40's. The staff is friendly and helpful and the resort is kept as clean as a hospital. Checking in was only a 10 minute stop and checking out was even easier. Eat at the Ala Carte restaurants and you can make up to 3 reservations at a time. Men must wear long pants to these restaurants. Buffet areas are open to swimsuits, shorts, skirts, tank tops and wraps. Buffet food is pretty good with a different variety at the Casabe and pretty much the same everyday at the Mare. Mondays is when they do the beach buffett but it rained and it was cancelled. I really suggest upgrading to the VIP status. The rooms and beachside beds are worth it alone. VIP's also get a 20 minute massage and 1 hour of motorsport use (although this only consists of the banana boat ride or a boat ride to the sunken ship (which is just a rusty ole boat). Only problem is that the 1 hour ticket can only be used once and the banana boat ride only lasted 15 minutes. You do not get a credit of 45 minutes. The same with the internet use. You get an hour pp but must use it all at one time. Our one off resort dinner (free for VIP's) was at the La Cava. This meal was absolutely fabulous. My husband had the NY steak and I ate the grilled lobster tail. A lot of food. The beach had about 30% topless women but most are European so no biggie. Only the American men seemed excited about it. Same at the pool. Swim up bar was a nice addition. I recommend this resort to anyone looking for a laid back place to enjoy one another. We can't wait to go back.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous!!!! My hubby and I stayed at the PCP from 6/2-6/9 and we had a wonderful time. I am going to try to organized in this review, but I tend to ramble. Firstly, the trip from PVD was fine to Charlotte, but then we waited 40 minutes on the tarmac due to traffic congestion and then 25 for someone to come and opoen the door to the plane. No biggie, our flight to PC was delayed 90 min. Still on vacation, no worries. We arrived in P脟 at 4:30, got our bags and went through customs in about 15 minutes. We were asked if we had food, and then waived through. Hubby agreed to let someone carry the bags 20 feet, because he's a nice guy!! Told Prieto tours were taking a taxi and 25 min. later we were at PCP with a glass of cold punch in our hand. We were given room 5209 with a cathedral ceiling and a larger balcony than the others. Plenty of drawer and closet space. Bathroom was large and I found lighted well, as others have not. The bed was a King with lots of pillows and very soft. The fridge had plenty of beer and soda. The maids cleaned morning and night and restocked everything. We tipped her $2 am and pm. VIP get towels in their room daily. You can go up to the dive shop for more during the day, By the end of the week we had 3 each!!We had a great ocean view!!! Our VIP envelope was waiting for us as was the items in the room. At check in, we made a reservation for that night. One was made before arrival, but we decided against italian and went for Mare Nostrum. After settling in, we went to the beach. Absolutely beautiful. We took a quick nap and then went back and made the rest of our restaurant reservations for the week. No problem.Mare Nostrum - good seafod, right on the beach,Brazilian - our least favorite. It is really buffet with them bringing different meats to your table.Dominican - good, and a fun place. I'll note that in the Brazilian and Dominican, people had on shorts, T's and even bathing suits!!La Cave, nice place, good food, slow. But, again..who cares!!!El Pescador, we paid to go (32pp) and it was probably our favorite. Less formal than Le Cave and really good seafood. Right on the beach and fun staffThe beach party is Monday nights and they have vendors come in. The buffet is in Mare Nostrum and they have tables and entertainment right on the beach.We ate breakfast at the buffet every morning and lunch either there or at the smaller buffet at Mare Nostrum. We did try the Creperie one day. Bad mistake. I know people have raved, but.... The chicken and cheese was orange cheeze wiz and some very dark meat chicken with lots of gristle.. Coouldn't eat it.Drinks were plentiful and we used our bubba keg, but saw NO ONE else with them. The bartenders kinda joked about them. We did tip with each drink order and left $2 at Breakfast and Lunch for our drink server. $ dollars at dinner and $10 at El Pescador, because they were so nice, In all honestly, we saw tipping VERY rarely.We did our excursions with the hotel. $20 for snorkeling. Unfortunately, the water was very choppy and not great. The free one hour boat trip was fun. We had booked the sunset cruise, but 3 days in a row it was cancelled. The boat driver was tired!!! Hubby did parasailing.We spent most night in the lobby or at the beach bar. We did see the Italian's show over at Caribe, but never ventured to any of their other shows.We only got top shelf liquor once in the lobby at PCP, everywhere else they don't have it. At Caribe, they lied and said they gave it to us, but we saw what they poured. Received and saw no one with bottled Presidente. None of this was a big deal to us.We used our free 20 minute massage and purchased additional 55 min. and it was well worth it. The spa is lovely and would recommend it over the mini one at PCP. Caribe and the spa is only a 2-3 minute walk away. It took longer to wait for and take the trams.I did have to see the doctor while there. My eyes were a bit swollen from too much sun. She gave me some shots and meds and checked me for the next 2 mornings before breakfast for additional meds. overall, it was $350 which my private and trip insurance will cover. Well worth it.We did not bother stopping at the beach markets, because they were just too aggressive and the items looked too much like stuff I didn't want. I found nice T-shirts at the resort for a reasonable price and we bought jewelry, a painting and rum from the vendors the night of the beaqch partyl.Overall, our stay was great!!!! The beach was wonderful..loved my floatie. The pool was never crowded. It was hard to find a palapa after 6am, but we managed. The food was good, not excellent, but not why we came.Unfortunatelly, the trip home was not good. The flight out of PC was 4 hours delayed, so we missed our connection in Charlotte. Found a hotel at 1am, got up at 4 to go back to the airport to come home the next day. Luggage was lost, and when it arrived, the rum had broken and the bags were ripped. Kudos for trip insurance, once again.Please feel free to contact me with any questions!!!!

<Content>Great Resort! My husband and I just returned from the Punta Cana Princess on Sunday, June 3rd. We traveled with 6 of our friends. Our experience was great! I feel I can say that for our entire group. We traveled from America. I must say, that we were some of the few Americans at this resort. That was interesting to say the least. We met several people from different countries. The diversity was great! We had not problems with immigration going into and leaving the Dominican. Once we arrived at the resort, the staff was very helpful. All of our rooms were spacious, very clean and stocked with a great mini bar. We took the advice from other reviews and tipped the maids each day. They always left us extra bottled water and drinks in our rooms. The food at the buffet was okay. Our group tends to like more spice and we found in this country, more sweet spices are used or none at all. But, we always found enough to eat! We ate at the Caribe twice. Our group upgraded to VIP. I strongly recommend this. You get the perks of the beds at the beach and the pool. I usually took our towels down to the beach around 7:00 am to save 2 to 3 beds and 8 lounge chairs. We never had a problem with enough space. The beach is large and very beautiful. Unlike another all-inclusive resort that my husband and I visited, at the Princess you could walk for miles up and down the shoreline. The sand was white and baby soft. The weather was great. Only one hard rain storm and a couple of afternoon showers. We took advantgage of our VIP motor sport package by taking a speed boat up the coast toward Dolphin Island. The driver stopped beside a Rum-Runner boat which was cruising the coast. Two words: BUBBA-KEG! Those in the know, will know what I mean! Overall, our experience was great. The one thing that was hard to adjust to was the topless beach. As Americans, we are not used to that. However, after the first day, it was not a big deal. I know the guys enjoyed it! We are all ready to go back. Definitely a world class resort. As many reviews here have said, your vacation is what you make of it. We certaintly made ours FUN! Oh, please say HI to Carlos if you visit the resort. He made the week alot of fun! THE LEGEND LIVES!

<Content>loved the princess we just returned from the pcp on june 5th, we had a great time, the hotel is nice and kept very clean. rooms are large and stocked with soda and dominican beer. the pool is large and never crowded. there never was a problem getting a lounge chair as some reviews stated, we did not need to go down and save a chair at 6am..same at the beach there is plenty. the food is average at the buffets, ala cartes are very good, we ate at all of them at the princess and 1 at the caribe...never disapointed.as far as the vip goes, if you want it for the upgrade on the drinks only, dont bother they use the i dont understand you when it comes to asking for something premium, my husband got maybe 3 budweisers while there and they always had to go find it. but everything else was well worth the vip. the room alone was worth the extra cash/ we had room 5211 beautiful pool and ocean view and all the extras beach towels, cigars rum....all in all it was a great vaca spot . the beach is beautiful to say the least and the staff are excellent, very very nice...friendly...this is a very nice resort not a 5 star but a close 4 star in my opinion.

<Content>Awesome honeymoon !!!! We went to the PCP for our honeymoon from may 13-20.What a fantastic place.Everything is immaculate,lobby,grounds,rooms,pool,restaurant,beach...just great.Employees are great and the service is top notch.Don't forget to bring $1 bills as they will be really appreciated at the bars.Don't forget the maids either,they work extremely hard.A far as food goes,no complaints here,buffet was huge and it was basically impossible to not find at least a couple of things to like.A la carte restaurants were also good(we did La petite fondue,(which is excellent),tex mex,which is also very good,and the italian at the sister resort.What more is there to say,just go and enjoy,you won't be disapointed.If you ask for a room in the 5000 building,you will be minutes from the pool and beach.But the resort is small so everything is a very short walk.

<Content>forgive us we strayed! we visited punta canna princess in may for five days and four nights, the room was very nice , the concierge service was confusing and very abrasive . we were dealt with very short patience and non accomodating service ,we found trying to get hotel and dinner information for same day arrival and or to make reservations that we thought were needed for the remainder of our stay was almost impossible , everything was booked and booked and booked .we were able to get two dinner bookings after a second visit to the help desk or concierge desk .we felt intrusive to the staff . and the pressure to tip was strong even thou it was an all inclusive , would we go again NO ! Never! No

<Content>Wonderful Vacation Experience Two friends and I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from May 17-May 22, 2007, what a beautiful resort! The front desk staff was exceptionally friendly when we arrived and we were given an excellent room in the 5000 building (best location)...we were steps from the pool and beach as well. The grounds are kept immaculately clean and the staff is always friendly and eager to make your stay enjoyable. VIP is definelty the way to go and worth the few extra dollars. The beds on the beach are extremely comfortable and always kept clean. Some of the staff that deserve a notable mention are Nelson (bartender from the beach bar)...he was extremley friendly and made the best drinks! The whole animation staff was great but Super Carlos was definelty super with us, he always invited us to participate in all of the activities and made us laugh the whole trip! Alejandro from the buffet was very friendly and always made sure we were satisfied at the buffet. The buffet offered an excellent variety of food...breakfast was excellent....if you plan on tipping during your vacation don't forget the omelete guy and the juice guy...they will be extremely grateful, as was everyone else who we tipped during our vacation...they make very little money at the resort and they work 11 days straight before getting 4 days off...and most of them live over 4 hours away!!!!!If you plan on going dancing; Areito was okay but not a great mix of music...oh yes and if you are planning on paying with American $$$ take plenty of singles....BEWARE OF ADA the bartender at Areito....she caught amnesia when I paid with a $20 bill...she implied that I never ordered a drink from her, then she claimed I paid with a $10 bill.....at the end of it she made of with $14 for herself....not to ruin my vacation I let it go.The beach is absoluelty beautiful, if you plan on taking an excurssion the half day snorkeling trip held by Carribean Festival is the best....great time on the boat and swimming with the sharks and stingray.Overall the resort is excellent and the staff make the trip all the better....I would definetely recommend this resort !!!!

<Content>A Wonderful Holiday My husband and I are seniors (in fact he is a senior senior) and although we seldom go on all inclusives this one was truly wonderful. As he has some difficulty with stairs we asked for and got a ground floor room in Bldg 5 the closest to the beach and the pool. The room was large and clean BUT very musty smelling. We turned the AC off and opened the patio door ( and main door when we were there) and got a lovey breeze which after a couple of days cleared the air. We believe it is the air conditioner that causes the smell . We found the beach to be lovely ( very much like the beaches in Antigua where we go frequenlty. ) However being as it is the Atlantic and not the Caribbean, the sea is farily rough..you can certainly swim, and we did every day but it can be quite a challenge!!! I am not sure if it is ever calm. But great for sailing !We thought the food was really quite good. The buffet was great with a lot of variety. Breakfasts were wonderful!!!The a la carte restaurants were good too . As other reviewers have mentioned, if you want to book one of the exclusive restaurants at the other hotels that come with the VIP package, do it immediately upon arrival or the best one (La Cava by all accounts) will be taken.We went to El Pescador instead which was ok but not great. Staff are so friendly. My husband speaks Spanish and I can stumble along in it and they realy liked that!!! They were always chatting and smiling and nothing was too mcuh trouble for themWe did find the DJ at the pool very loud around noon each day as he gets people to do aquacises in the pool. and the music (and his voice) is deafening and pretty irritating actualy. . He does it again aroudn 4:00. But it only lasts half an hour or so. We just closed the door!!!At no time did we have any mosquitoes and we had our door open all day long including the evening...No did we have any stomach or other upsets..I strongly believe those are caused mainly by over eating, over drinking and too much heat!!!This is a small (270 rooms) hotel with nothing more that a three or four mintue walk away. This is good for us older folk!!!I would recommend it highly to anyone. I think if you want a really lively nightlife you woudl need to go elsewhere.

<Content>Wow... you won't be dissapointed at the Punta Cana Princess !!! That is a promise.... So.... I was obsessive about reading the reviews and checking out the forums for the PCP for weeks before my trip and all I can say is this resort is fantastic. If you go with the attitude that you are on vacation and leave your expectations at home, you will have the time of your life. That being said, there are some areas that will exceed your expectations.Rooms: Very nice, clean, clean, clean. a/c worked exceedingly well and the maids were fantastic. Don't forget to tip... They work from sun up until very, very late at night and make next to nothing. Pool : Beautiful, well kept, lots of shade and the swim up bar was great. No kids, no loud music and if I had to offer only one morsel, it was that there was no pool side drink service. You had to either swim up or walk up to get served.Staff: These people are the hardest workers I have ever seen. They work and work and work to make this resort clean and comfortable. They are quick with a hello and the hugs are a plenty. Tip, tip, tip and you will not be sorry. A buck goes a very long way. Beach: Not much to say here but lovely. One of the most beautiful I have ever seen... Food : Well ........This is the only negative experience that I can speak of. Although there are many choices, don't go with an expectation that you will be having a fine dining experience. The fodd was tolerable and I always found somehting to eat, but honestly it just isn't very good. From everything that I have heard and read this is not just at the PCP, but at most of the resorts too. The cuts of meat are different and they try very hard to have something for everyone. To me (and I am a foodie from SF) this is not a deal breaker. Drinks: Unless you like really sweet drinks, you might want to consider bringing your own mixers.. I know that sounds crazy but even the mixer were a little odd. The soda was odd, the tonic was odd and the OJ tasted like tang. There really is no good wine choice and if you are a wine drinker, bring your own. The beer is okay when cold (don't forget the bubba keg) and there is always a very happy and gracious bartender to get you whatever you want. I love my morning mimosa(s) !!!! Bottom line - this is a terrific place. I would not hesitate to return or to recommend the PCP to anyone. Go with a good attitude, plenty of ones and fives (100.00 of both), a couple of good books, ton's of sunscreen, bug spray and a bubba keg and a good time is assured !!!

<Content>Love the Princess We were at the Punta Cana Princess May 11-18. I wish we could have stayed longer. The staff went out of their way to make our time there absolutely perfect.We did the VIP upgrade, and it was worth it. The room had everything we needed and more. It was very nice to have the option of room service, however the restaurant choices were more than ample. Even the buffet provided such a nice variety, it was hard to decide where to eat. Believe me, we didn't go hungry!The drinks were all good. The bartenders would make anything you wanted - and made it well. I'm sure some people may have thought the drinks were weak, but all you have to do is say something. All the staff wanted the guests happy and they would do anything you asked.The grounds were kept immaculate. The beach area, and pool area were constantly maintained. I never saw trash laying around and the bathrooms were constantly being cleaned.We loved that this was Adults Only, and it's a small resort which makes it feel more intimate. Everything was a short walk away. We visited the sister resorts Carbe-Princess and Tropical Princess, and they were nice too, but we were so glad that we booked at the Punta Cana Princess.I have nothing bad to say about this resort. It was PERFECT.

<Content>Loved the Princess! We traveled to the Punta Cana Princess from Apr 29-May 3. We had a fantastic time at the resort. We booked it through [--] and although we had to wait about 20 min for our driver, we made it to the resort with relative ease. Our room was not ready, but we were able to enjoy a nice buffet lunch at the restaurant. The food at the buffet was pretty good. There was always something you good find to eat. We also ventured mainly to the pool buffet for lunches since you could eat while still wearing your bathing suit. We really enjoyed the a la carte restaurants for our dinners, particularly the Mare Norstrom and the Fondue restaurant. We also enjoyed the Creperie at that neighboring resort for lunches and snacks. We found a range of quality at the bars. We found the pool and lobby bars to be the best. As for the resort, the grounds were beautiful. Our room was spacious and we were able to easily switch from two double beds to a king-size bed. The only issue in the room were the mosquitoes that were sometimes let in from the housekeeping staff. I would recommend bringing some bug spray. The pool and beach were beautiful as well and we didn鈥檛 have any trouble finding huts to sit under. We had thought about the VIP package, but ended up not getting it and were just as content. The Princess is the 3rd and newest (built 2003) resort in the complex of Princess resorts. They have trams that take you to the other 2 resorts and the casino. You sometimes have to wait a bit for the trams but the walk is not that bad (about 10 minutes to the Caribe). You cannot walk to the casino, but it is really not worth the trip there despite how much they promote it. (but we aren鈥檛 gamblers)They have shows every night that occur in the theater by the Caribe. If you have an 8:30 dinner reservation it is hard to make the start of the show at 9:45, but we caught the end of a few shows (magic, carnival, etc)During the day the staff runs activities such as archery, darts, ping pong, volleyball, etc. The staff is very nice and will teach you how to do anything. It was, however sometimes hard to find where the activity was meeting when it was supposed to be occurring. The staff at the resort was super friendly and extremely hardworking. Overall, a great resort, very reasonably priced for this quality!

<Content>Paradise! I have just returned from a two week stay at the Punta Cana Princess. If you are planning on travelling to Punta Cana I would most definately recommend this resort. I travelled to Punta Cana with my finace and two of our friends. For the first two hours of our arrival we were all simply awestruck by the beauty and perfection of the resort. Within minutes of our arrival we were greeted with drinks while we waited to check in. Our room was by far the nicest hotel room that we have ever stayed in. Not only was it huge, it was immaculate and air conditioned to perfection. The mini fridge was stocked every single day with sprite, coke, beer and water. One day we asked the maid if she could supply us with two bottles of each and she did so without any hesitation. We did tip the maids $3 a day which we found extremely fair. They work so hard all day long, it doesn't really matter when you leave the sign out to have your room cleaned, wether it is 8 a.m or 3 p.m. it is guarenteed to be finished within an hour. Every single member of staff that we encountered were extremely friendly. From the maids, maintenence people, bellboys, and security, to the guest service representatives, enteratiners, bartenders, waiters, waitresses and cooks, all the way to the manager and medical team we were greeted with a smile. The staff are willing to help at the drop of a hat and will go out of their way to satisfy you. We were shocked at how much variety and how good the food was. There was definately no shortage of food and it was always kept warm. Obviously, if you go for breakfast at 9:45 a.m the food is in worse condition than it was at 7a.m. However, we did eat breakfast at this time on many mornings and the food was still excellent and plenty of it. As for the lunch and dinner buffets it really didn't matter when you went, the food was always great. The resuraunts that you have to reserve were excellent. Once again the food was great and the staff were outstanding. Remember though that you do have to reserve for the specialty resturaunts and reservations go fast. The sister resorts next door (Caribe Club/Tropical Princess) also have extremely good food. In fact, not to take away from the food at the Punta Cana Princess because it was also outstanding, but the sister resorts had even more variety. We ate at most of the resturaunts and have no complaints about any one of them. All of the bars are great. The bartenders are so comical and a small tip goes a long way! The Beach and Pool areas are kept in excellent condition, the maintenence people work so hard to keep the seaweed out of the water and off of the shore, and the sand is groomed nightly. As for the pool the area is also in spectacular condition. Heads up though, there are a ton of shaded areas on the beach but we found that since were are younger (early 20's) we woke up much later than the other people, and were hard pushed to find shade on the beach when we rolled out of bed at 11 a.m. This was totally our own fault though, if we had got up earlier I'm sure we would have had no problem. Even with that being said, we always found somewhere to sit. Tips for travelling to Punta Cana/ staying at Punta Cana Princess:1) Bring bug spray (oh my goodness, we got eaten alive. This could possibly be due to the time of year but it sucked. We had to by bug repellant from the resort store which cost us a whopping $14 for the smallest bottle). 2) Stay hydrated! Unfortunately my finance did not do this so well. This was a combination of being over excited for free beer and beautiful sunshine. He learned his lesson after a two day stay at the hospital. Thank god we had travel insurance. 3) Tip the staff. They work so hard to please everyone, $2-$3 goes a long way. It might not mean a lot to you but it really does to them. Plus, it gets you fast service. 4)Bring medicine like pepto bismal, immodium, advil, gravol etc. Travellers stomach bugs and diarahea is really common there. 5) At the airport as soon as you arrive they charge you a $10 airport tax. We were unaware of this and were scrounging for our money.6) Don't buy from the store on the resort. It is a huge rip off. Walk down the beach a little and there is a market. They will try to way over charge you. Usually you can talk them down to less then half of their original offer.

<Content>great resort We stayed at the Princess May 6 thru the 12. The resort is fantastic,rooms clean, staff friendly and drinks are great. The only thing that I would even say was a little bad was the food selection, you need a wide pallet to find something to enjoy, what they had was always fresh just a little different. The pool is beautiful and the swim up bar great. I have never seen such lovely beaches, the sand is so soft you just can't belive it. The only problem we had was with our airline, DELTA. Take my advise and avoid them like the plague. They delayed us leaving Nashville and we missed our flight out of Atlanta and when we got to Atlanta we got more stories than Mother Goose wrote as to why the delay. No help from respresentives just a gate person who listened to us but could not do anything. On the way back same problem this airline does not seem to know what it is doing. Punta Cana is still trying to develop itself for tourist but be prepared the tours are nice but not quite organized as I would like to see them. As far as going back I would to the resort but will give the country a few years to catch up with development.

<Author>PooandSat
<Content>Best Place Ever! Poo and Sat- London EnglandWe stayed here from 30th April-7th May 2007 and loved it!This place is FANTASTIC!! The 9 hour journey from London was worth it. The Punta Cana airport is a sight in itself with its thatched roof, musicians and traditionally dressed woman to greet you on your arrival. To make you aware- when these ladies grab your arm, they arenot crowd control- a photograph is being taken. This will be made available to purchase on your departure for 10$. Nice little touch. The beach is the best we have ever seen- and we have seen a fair few. It was long, wide and clean. You could walk miles and miles. Gorgeous!The resort is self contained with everything easily accessible. We loved riding the shuttle bus through the beautiful grounds.The nearby Casino and Palma Real (the shopping centre) arrange their own shuttles to and from the resort. We did kind of get addicted to Blackjack thanks to the gentleman from the Casino who kindly taught us how to play in the lobby. Bavaro Plaza was great for shopping. Find the right shop and you can get everything you want at a good price. Always offer much less than the original price quoted and pick up some bargains. Disappointingly, the rum was not as inexpensive as we thought it would be.Nightlife wise- there is a club- Arieto- within the resort and this has free entry and drinks until 12am. We did go a couple of times and whilst we enjoyed it- they could do with more non spanish music. The staff were friendly and helpful. Language was a bit of a barrier but everyone managed to communicate somehow. The food was excellent and cannot be faulted. We easily managed to overeat at every meal every day. We mainly ate at the buffet restaurant but there are a number of al a carte restaurants available so we tried out the mexican and italian and found them to be very good. Drinks wise- as the other reviewer mentioned- the mixers were very sweet and so there are only a certain number of cocktails you can stomach. So, stick to good old rum and coke. We checked the weather forecast prior to travelling and expected rain however were pleasantly surprised as we had sunshine every day and it was HOT HOT HOT!There was a good mix of other nationalities particulary Canadians and Americans. We made some good friends from Newfoundland and Quebec City (you know who you are ;-)) who we will keep in touch with and hopefully return to PCP with. The resort manager took care of the guests and the resort. Always very friendly and eager to please and even personally secured us a reservation to an already full al a carte restuarant.There are many excursions available but we did not book any. We did parasail though and that was an enjoyable experience. Can't wait to return to this place and can't see us wanting to holiday anywhere else ever again!

<Content>Treated Like Royalty Treated Like RoyaltyThe Punta Cana Princess is by far the nicest Resort my husband and I have ever been to.The warm welcome upon our arrival was just the beginning of our 2 week vacation in Paradise. The Friendly Staff went all out and made us feel as though we were family. Walking along the paths of the resort we found the beautiful gardens and landscaping to be flawless. Our room was kept spotless and whatever we needed was always delivered minutes after we asked. We found the selection of restaurants and their delectable meals to be just amazing.If you are thinking of visiting Punta Cana, visit the Punta Cana Princess and see what it's like to be Treated Like Royalty. You will never want to leave.

<Content>Beautiful Place to Vacation We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess Resort May 5-12 with friends from IL and CO. Traveling to and from the Dominican Republic was fine. Our check in to Princess was easy and the room was very nice. We were all on the 2nd floor of the 4th building (it overlooks the pool and you can see the ocean from there). The beach was probably the nicest sand that I have been on and the resort does a good job of removing the seaweed compared to the other resorts. The resort facilities and landscape are nicer than the sister resorts, Tropical and Caribe. The food was kind of hit or miss. We found that the buffet style restaurants varied between the two resorts. Ours (Casabe) was better for breakfast and the one at Caribe (El Higuero) was better for lunch and dinner. I think most of that had to do with the Caribe being a much larger resort with more variety in food. We did run into more difficulty with vegetarian options than we did in the Mayan Rivera. The a la carte restaurants do not list all of their ingredients on the menu and often times a dish would arrive to the table with meat on it. The staff was accommodating once we explained vegetarians don't eat meat. We ate at La Cava for our speciality dinner and it was the best meal we had. The desserts were a bit bland and wish I would have brought some chocolate with me. The staff is amazing, very hard workers, and always smiling.  They have basketball, tennis, ping-pong, shuffleboard, bocce, archery, volleyball (beach and pool), fitness center, and mini golf available.I would definitely recommend Princess Punta Cana. The adults only was a nice change from screaming kids. I would also recommend the VIP package. The VIP area on the beach was great and you did not have to arrive early in the morning to get a spot. VIP package included 20 min massage, premium drinks, 1 hour of motorized watersports, 1 SCUBA dive for certified divers, a complimentary dinner at a speciality restaurant (others are charged a fee to eat there), 1 bottle of rum and 3 cigars in your room, 2 beach towels in your room per day, nightly turndown service, 1 hour free internet service, room service, bathrobe use and access to VIP area at the beach and poolside. The VIP 1 hour of motorized water sports (as it is stated on a ticket that the VIP desk hands you) is only valid for 15 minutes for some reason and only includes the banana boat, tubing, water-skiing or a boat ride (this one lasts 45-60min). It does not include the other activities they advertise at the booth. We did do the free SCUBA dive that was included in the VIP for certified divers and we were glad it was free. Unfortunately, the Pelicano dive operation is poorly run and the health of the reefs are poor. If you SCUBA dive I would not hassle with bringing your own gear down with you like we did. We planned on diving several times, but after the huge dissapointment with the first dive, I wouldn't waste my time.We all tried to speak Spanish as much as possible to locals. I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling there as it was much appreciated by all the staff. We also brought little gifts (books, crayons, nail polish, toys, etc) for the staff and their family which was also very much appreciated.

<Content>Relaxing Resort filled with Friendly People This is the most comprehensive review. It's long, but it's worth it. These are my views and hints for traveling to this resort. I traveled with my boyfriend to this resort from May 4-8th. When booking this trip we were very worried about whether we would find a good place. When we looked at the reviews on tripadvisor we were amazed at the great reviews. We were still a little skeptical and thought that there must be something wrong with the place since we got such a great deal. Boy were we wrong. We had an absolutely wonderful time at the resort. The lady at the reception desk was a little rude when we checked in, but the receptionists after her were very friendly. We quickly noticed that there was a language barrier between ourselves and the staff. Everyone spoke Spanish, but very few people spoke or understood English. We didn't expect this before we arrived so we didn't prepare ourselves by bringing any type of translation dictionary. I think this would have been handy at times when we wanted to ask something, but had no idea what to say. As we walked through the resort we were constantly greeted by the employees with a cheerful Hola!. Everyone was so friendly. our room did smell a little musty, but that's expected for a sealed room in a tropical resort. I would suggest bringing your own pillow or an additional pillowcase since some of the pillows also had a musty smell. The room was very clean and spacious. If you're a late sleeper (ie. past 9am) I would suggest putting the Do Not Disturb sign on your door before you go to bed. We were often awoken by the staff. It did take until mid afternoon to have our rooms cleaned, but I think that was because we kept returning to the room and changing the sign. When we wanted our room clean we contacted the front desk and it was done within the hour. We also received a call from the management asking us whether our room was cleaned to our satisfaction.The food at the resort could be considered hit or miss. The restaurant food was amazing. You have to make a reservation at least the night before for the restaurants on your resort and 2 days in advance for the restaurants at the neighbouring resorts. This was a disappointment since our stay was only for 4 days and we were not able to eat at the restaurants our first night. Also, some of the restaurants are not always open so make sure you check with the receptionist to see which days they are closed. The lunch buffets were usually the same and were not very good, but the dinners more then made up for it. The breakfast buffets were enormous and usually your stomach got full before you could try everything you wanted.We wanted to take advantage of the activities that were offered and found that we got the best deal from the beachside business. Snorkeling was very cheap and only $20 a person for 1 hour of snorkeling. Parasailing was a little expensive at $45 a person for only 15min, but it was well worth the money. The helper on the boat even took tons of pictures for us since by the time it was our turn most of the people were taken off the boat.The beach was absolutely beautiful. The sand was powdery white and felt so soft on your feet. The lounge chairs under the huts tended to be taken up very quickly in the mornings and usually covered with towels, but no people. The neighbouring resort had a no reservation policy and I would have preferred that since it seemed as though no one returned to 'their' chairs past noon. Beach towels were available for free everyday and you could exchange them as many times as you liked, but don't lose them otherwise you'll pay for it.One big this to note. Do NOT use the international calling from your room. We were charged 50 pesos for just using the phone and then my boyfriend was charged $30US for a 1-2 minute call to the US. I would instead bring a calling card and use the payphone in the lobby. You might get a better deal that way.US currency was widely accepted along with credit cards. All items for sale in the little stores were in Dominican Pesos, but when it came to the purchase they would convert the amount to US dollars and put it on your credit card. I don't know if this was the best rate, but there were no additional charges on my card. There is an ATM onside, but the rate along with the fees your bank charges is worse then what you would get at the front desk. My suggestion is to either bring Pesos with your or exchange them at the front desk.One suggestion to the resort would be to have better maps available for each guest. We often had no idea where we were going or where anything was. All 3 resorts are within walking distance of each other, but I would take the free trolley the first time so that you get a feel for where everything is.Well, I hope you've enjoyed my thorough review. I hope you enjoy your vacation as much as we did!!

<Content>rock out at the princess! My boyfriend and I stayed 10 days at the PCP 5/4/2007-5/13/2007 and we loved every single day. The resort itself was very well polished and much, much prettier than in the photos!Next door to the resort is it鈥檚 sister property, where children are allowed. And you are welcome to make reservations for dinner at their restaurants, and use their facilities as well. I never saw a child at our resort; they are very good about being strict on that policy.Behind the resort there is a huge stretch of marshland where you can see practically every type of bird the Caribbean has to offer!We did tip our bartenders and maids, which I think accounted for our drinks being just about as strong as you can make them! But it seemed that everyone was getting great service all around. Neither my boyfriend or I speak Spanish, but most people at the resort did perfectly, some more than others. Aside from a few awkward moments, we had virtually no language barriers.For the downsides to the resort, well there were very few. It is important to make reservations at the specialty restaurants for dinner. They are very quirky about this policy. You can make 3 reservations at a time, but you can go to each one as many times as you like. If you, hypothetically, get way too drunk at the swim up bar and miss your reservation, it鈥檚 ok, because the large buffet always has something great cooking. HUGE plates of pasta where you can add in your own mix-ins, a grill cooking up different fish, and meats, and chicken, sometimes they had a Caesar salad station, and that was phenomenal!. During the day they have a huge buffet as well, but also a beach buffet where you are allowed to enter in your bathing suit. They make the best fried chicken of all time!The breakfast buffet is open from 7-10 and they have a huge juice bar with 10 different types of fresh juices and juice blends that they make right there in a blender. So good!The beach was great, like a caribean post card! You could swim out or snorkel a little ways, but you couldn鈥檛 go too deep because there is a lot of boat traffic right off shore. People doing motorized sports, and taking speedboats out to snorkel and such like that.They have snorkeling everyday at the beach at 11am and 3pm, its 20$ and they take you on a 15min speed boat ride, out to a section of coral, and let you swim around for about an hour and then they zip you right back to the hotel. It was really nice and we saw a lot of fish.We never made it out to the disco, but we could hear the one next door at the LTI and it sounded like an extreme amount of fun.So all in all our room was always clean, our drinks always strong, and the beach always an endless, soft, white strip of inviting fun. We鈥檇 recommend the PCP to anyone!

<Content>Muy Bien! My husband and I just returned from Punta Cana Princess All Suites with VIP package for 6 nights, May 2 - May 8. We had the most relaxing vacation of all vacations.Having travelled extensively elsewhere in the Caribbean and Europe, this was our first visit to Punta Cana. Our experience with Punta Cana was fantastic. We had no problems nor issues thanks to all members of TripAdvisor for their shared experiences of which helped us in our travel plans and what and what not to expect in Punta Cana.We booked our airfare directly with Spirit Airlines and did hotel separetly because Spirit did not offer Punta Cana Princess in their vacation packages. This trip was our first for booking with an online travel agency and we used bookit.com and I have to say we were very pleased. Three days before we were to leave, I sent an email to bookit asking for a reconfirmation and Nicole responded that everything was okay on their end. Experience with bookit.com was very pleasing. Checkin at Punta Cana Princess confirmed this, uneventful and quick. We had our voucher and they had our wrist bands and room key ready.We arrived at 2:00 p.m. and were in our room by 2:20 p.m. Luggage wasbrought up by the bellmen minutes later. It was now time for a cerveza.Our room was wonderful. Our welcoming gifts (part of VIP) greeted us as we entered our room, cigars and a bottle of rum. Flower pedals were adorned in the bathroom. Fridge had cold soda, water and beer. We had a nice step down sitting area that led to a nice sized balconywhich overlooked the pool and the beautiful ocean. There is a safe we used. A shower with hot and high pressured water. The room was very comfy for the week. Our 6 nights were wonderful, very, very relaxing. We never really left the resort except for a night to the disco, casino and our gourmet dinner at La Cava at the Caribe Princess.The beach is awesome. We hung out there most of the time except for the time we walked to the beach bar for mas cervezas, which was quite often :)Never ever had a problem finding a VIP bed by the beach. The cabanas seem to all have been taken daily, but we really didn't notice because we were happy with our beach bed. The pool, what pool? We were there for the beach. But have to admit a dip in the pool before noon and a Bloody Mary at the swim up pool bar did the trick.The beach is awesome. No shells, no rocks, no nothing. Just sand and aqua clear waters. Sunbathing topless for woman seems to be acceptable and did not deter wifie from doing, it is quite relaxing.Make sure you have plenty of sunscreen for the areas that don't see the light of day much and leave some for the rest of your body. The sun is strong! We aren't buffet eaters so our dinners were at the al a carte restaurants. Tex Mex was the worse. La Cava (gourmet, Caribe Princess) was great except we had to wait over an hour just for our appetizer, but it appeared everyone in the restaurant that night did as well. Not sure what that was about and didn't ask.We had breakfast two mornings in the main buffet area (we are not early risers). Not bad. Loved those fried bananas.Lunch, we always found something at the beach bar, all day. As a matter of fact, the beach bar is open 24 hrs, so if you are thirsty for a cerveza or hungry at 3 a.m. and want some chicken, they will cook it for you.Not once did we get an upset stomach or even have a feeling of getting an upset stomach. We weren't afraid to try anything and ate different foods such as burger, fried chicken (yum yum!), fish fritter, shrimp, lobster, fruit, different salads, caesar salad, ice cream, crepes, sandwiches and pizza.We have read so many different reviews of people getting upset stomachs in Punta Cana (not necessarily the Punta Cana Princess) and from what others have stated, we believe it is from overdrinking and too much sun. When the sun is cooking and you are drinking alcohol, dehydration comes into play. Remember to drink water.Went to the Arieto disco one night. It was okay. Five dollars for a cerveza. Locals come here after work as well as tourists. All we can say is be careful and watch your back. Not saying we had a problem, just saying be careful. This disco is not managed by any Princess resort and you are on your own..Another night we went to the casino. If anyone should decide to go here, please email us and we will give you our address so you can just send us the money instead of dumping it there.Two nights we went to the Caribe Princess, just for dinner. La Cava and the Brazilian restaurant. Other than that did not spend any time at the Caribe.There is a tram that takes you to all three places above, the casino, disco and Caribe. This was nice. Even nicer was walking back from the Caribe on the beach. Banana boat ride is a must (included with VIP). We did a snorkel trip as well for one hour, twenty dollars per person. Well worth it.For both they pick you up on beach. Reservations can be made at beach activities area.For transportation to and from the airport we prepaid with Rafael Silvia for private transportation (no sharing). On arrival to Punta Cana Airport (PUJ) there was no representative for T.S.Silvia there as stated per our voucher. There were other drivers holding signs similar to this name, but someone approached us and we told him we had a voucher and he called for us and someone was there in fifteen minutes, no biggie, our flight was early anyway. When getting off the airplane, a souvenir picture for purchase on departure is taken then you step forward and pay ten dollars per person (US$) for a tourist card of which you hand in steps away. Departure was just as easy. Our driver was prompt at picking us up at Punta Cana Princess and we picked up no one else on the way to PUJ.No problems or issues at airport. Of course we did purchase the souvenir picture!Our experience overall with Punta Cana Princess was wonderful. Hector at the beach bar and Amarillo our room maid made our trip very comfortable and relaxing. The employees here go out of their way for you and for this service we tipped appropriately. We rated our experience as a five star, because everything went perfect. If you go, remember to take a minute and notice all the beautiful flora that grows there; beautiful colors and the greenest foliage. Whatever we missed to relate of our experience we are sure someone else has experienced and shared.Ed and LoriP.S. - We brushed our teeth everyday and night with the tap water. No problema.

<Content>Wonderfully relaxing A group of 42, 55+ just returned from a week stay (May1-8). We had a great time. Relaxed, tanned, and no one went hungry. Some had VIP, some not. We did and would have had a great time without. The beach towels in the rooms were nice but it was no hassle to get fresh ones at the beach. As everyone has said, the resort is very clean. We stayed in the 5000 bldg and would recommend an upper floor. We visited a few ground flours and they were musty smelling. Everyone was very friendly and made us feel welcomed and took care of every need. I do have some issues with the VIP liquor. I like Absolute and couldn't get it at the pool bar. At the lobby they had to send to the beach bar for it. They did, but I felt like they only had one bottle for all the bars. Also, it seemed like they only had sweet mixers. I couldn't get cranberry juice. As you can see, no big problems. We found food to eat. We ate at the El Baccio and the La Cava and The Fondue place. We enjoyed them all. The sea food at La Cava was very generous and good. Don't expect to eat and run at the ala cart places. Dinner is usually 2 hours. We enjoyed the Animacion team. Fun and friendly. We went to the shows at the Caribe. Sometimes long, but not bad. We went to the Casino. Not large but fun entertainment. Watch the water. I took Pepto Bismal every day and had two days when I didn't feel like drinking, but didn't stop eating! Overall we really enjoyed it.

<Content>Good All-Inclusive - not luxurious but nice I required a 2 nt stay to attend a wedding held in Punta Cana area. I choose this resort because it didn't have a minimum stay requirement and also was adults-only no rugrats running around.The check-in and room process was simple. The room had some small ants in the bathroom but I was in the Carribbean so didn't complain or think of it as a problem. Room was furnished with bed, sofa/bed, tv, ceiling fan, balcony, fridge (stocked with beer, coke, sprite  bottled water), and iron board. Beach was great, adequate number of bars (none were full or long wait) and VIP section was nice. I didn't venture to the other properties available via the same wristband.The buffet area for food was okay - nothing to write home about as I would've like more Dominican flavor meals (plantains, mangos, etc.) but I guess they must cater to a wide range of palettes.I found the staff nice but most didn't speak English beyond their basic functions. A good place just for relaxation and a few beverages.There is no major nightlife at this resort and things are very quiet after 10pm.I attended a wedding a Majestic Colonial which was much larger and nicer accommodations (each room had a shower  huge jaccuzzi tub) but they had a 3 nt minimum, but if I were to return to this part of DR I would choose this facility. I would probably not stay at this resort again but not because of anything negative just think there are better places available.

<Content>Wish I was still at the Punta Cana Princess April 21-28We enjoyed a glorious week at the Punta Cana Princess. Our experience went way beyond our expectations as we'd read a lot of negative postings. We are actually considering returning. Arrival Sunquest states in their brochure that the hotel is a 20-minute drive from the airport. What they fail to tell you is that we had to stop at 3 other hotels on the way which makes the drive last just over an hour. Our arrival at Punta Cana airport was very quick and very well-organized. We arrived at the resort around 10:30 p.m. and check-in was quick. We bought the VIP package and the front desk clerk gave us our VIP bracelets and asked me if I minded coming back between 9:00-12:00 the next day to pick up my package which was locked at guest services and she didn't have a key. I really didn't mind because I wanted to make all our a-la-carte reservations the next day after breakfast anyway. They tagged our luggage with our room number and it followed about 5 minutes after we'd let ourselves in our room. Overall Cleanliness  Layout One word - spotless! From the rooms, to the lobby, to the grounds - there's always someone cleaning. Also, the proximity of every service at the resort is pretty close. In our opinion, this was definitely one of the advantages to a smaller resort. Rooms We had room 5205. Third floor, king size bed, full bath. We'd requested Bldg 5/3rd floor and got it. Our view was beach and pool bar. It was cleaned every day in the morning and towels and beverages were replaced/replenished around 6:00 p.m. every night. Each room has a big golf umbrella and bathrobes that you can use during your stay. The safe requires you to program it with your own 4-digit code. We had no theft problems while we were there. Guest Services Arrived at Guest Services shortly after 9:00 a.m. on Sunday morning. There was one couple in front of me waiting to make reservations while another couple was finishing up. My total wait time was about 15 minutes so no biggie there. I was able to make 4 reservations at once including La Cava which was part of the VIP package. She told me that I could reserve another if I'd like but only later on in the week and at least 24-hours prior. She also informed me that the opening of 脿-la-carte restaurants varied from day to day. I found this out while making our reservations. For example, I would ask for Brazilian for 8:30 on Monday and she would reply they're closed on Monday but I can give you Brazilian on Wednesday and Tex Mex on Monday. FYI - all the 脿-la-carte menus are on a rack next to Guest Services and you can look at them any time which makes it much easier to make your choices. She then gave me my VIP envelope which included two cards for massages, two for one-hour Internet service, two for motorized water sports and two for La Cava. Restaurants Just one word of advice: if you like wine with your meal and plan on drinking from the wine list, the prices are very high. We knew this before leaving so bought 3 bottles at Duty-Free and didn't regret it. For example, a bottle of Yellow Tail Shiraz was $15 US and we only paid $10 CDN at Duty-Free. House red and white are available. The red isn't too bad if it's a little chilled.Dress code: the Buffet insists that you wear a t-shirt or some sort of cover up (males  females) at breakfast and lunch as you will be refused entrance if you're just wearing a bikini top and pareo, if you're wet or in your bare feet. Dress code for all the 脿-la-cartes stipulate that men have to wear a collared shirt and long pants. No restrictions on footwear for men. Hubby wore leather sandals. Men were allowed dress shorts at the buffet for dinner. Breakfast was always at the buffet and was always good. Yes, it can happen that all the silverware isn't on your table but we never experienced a staffer not setting the table for us or not coming back when we requested a missing piece. We can't understand why others had such a problem with this. I can understand vegetarian posters who've complained of lack of choice, but I'm also under the impression that it doesn't matter where you go in the islands, you're pretty much out of luck if you're not a meat or fish eater. On the other hand, if you're not vegetarian and can't find anything to eat, then you should rethink travelling anywhere. Hubby actually heard someone complain that he couldn't find anything to eat because he was a meat n' potatoes kind of guy, yet there were meat and potatoes on almost every menu and at buffet. Yeesh!!!!! Makes you wonder what they eat at home. We, on the other hand, love to try new things. On Sunday, we had a reservation for the Mediterranean restaurant. It's on the beach next to the 24-hour beach bar, therefore an open-air space. Then the torrential downpour came at about 5:30 that evening. We retired to our balcony to wait out the storm which never let up for the rest of the evening. Guest Services called to advise us that the Mediterranean restaurant would be closed, however they were moving us to the Tex Mex and still offering us the Mediterranean menu. Great service indeed! Hubby had steak and I had lobster tails. Yum! We brought our own wine and there was no problem whatsoever. Monday night we ate at the Tex Mex. We both had the filet mignon. After reading a lot of reviews on this site about overcooked beef, we decided to order medium-rare (we both like medium) and it was cooked perfectly (medium). Again, no problem having our own wine served. Tuesday night we had buffet* which was terrific. There's a lot to choose from and like breakfast, everything is replenished accordingly. The food is fresh. What's supposed to be cold is cold and what's supposed to be hot is hot. We lucked out that night as they had whole suckling pig at the roasting station. Desserts were very good too. Wednesday night we had Brazilian. This restaurant is on the beach at the Tropical Princess, a 4-minute walk. If you're a meat lover, you'll love this place. There is a small side buffet open for sides like salads, veggies, etc. Then a waiter comes out 5 different times (courses) with meat on skewers which he carves on to your plate. The order being, chorizo sausages, chicken, fish, pork ribs, turkey and finally beef. Needless to say, we were stuffed when we left. Thursday night we buffet again and it was just as good as on Tuesday. Friday we went to La Cava at the Tropical Princess and it was really good. Hubby had beef carpaccio and I had shrimp and lobster cocktail. We both had lobster tails which were huge. Dessert was good too. Again, no problem bringing our own wine. Wine was very expensive here but they had an impressive wine list. Be warned that service may be a bit slow for some of you. The whole meal took about 2 1/2 hours, but we're used to it so it didn't bother us. Just wish we'd brought two bottles of wine. Also, on the night of your reservation, Guest Services will ask you to present yourself at their desk 1/2 hour before your reservation. They then print out an invitation to which they staple your card to and you bring this to the restaurant. They will also arrange for transportation but we opted to walk over. It's only about a 4-minute walk. *Note: We went to dinner around 8:30 p.m. every night and there was never a shortage of food at the buffet. Lobby Bar This was one of the highlights of our trip. Deyonera (?) and Emilio were the best. Always friendly and fun to be with. Try a Coco Loco. They're amazing. Deyonera makes the best shaken Margaritas I've ever had. There was animation every night at the lobby bar which generally started at 10:00 p.m. A lot of it was funny and it was loud as other travellers have posted, but it lasts until about 10:45-11:00. Then it gets quiet again. If you want quiet, go to the beach bar which is open 24 hours, weather permitting (open air). It seemed to only close on our 2nd and 3rd night due to rain. The disco and casino were at the Tropical but we never went. Pool We didn't use the pool at all. Since our room overlooked the swim-up bar, we took the opportunity to observe, more than once, guests who sat there for a very long periods time and drinking heavily. Draw your own conclusions. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm sure the ocean water is much cleaner. The pool is attractive and there never seemed to be a problem finding a lounger. Workers hose down the sidewalks every day that surround the pool. Beach The beach at the PC Princess is one of the less congested we saw on all our walks. It didn't matter what time one would get to the beach as there were always palapas and loungers available. We stopped setting our alarm after the first day. The water was warm and we had quite a few waves during our week which was fun. We tried the VIP beds once but ended up under palapas all week. We only saw butler service twice during our week but to be honest, we weren't really paying attention as we read and walked the beach a lot. Animation I disagree with some posters who've said that they cater to the 18-30 crowd. Not so. If you want to participate, you can. For example, after animators invited us to play volleyball twice and turning them down, they did not ask us again. Can you blame them? I looked at this as being courteous and not disturbing us. As far as guests entertaining guests, I disagree with that too. They tried hard to get people to participate in the lobby bar, but they also respected people who weren't interested. Guests who did participate were having a great time. If animation and shows are important, walk over to the Tropical for the show that starts at 10:00 p.m. every night and go to their disco and/or casino. There's plenty to do if you really want to. Spa There are two spas - one at the PC Princess on the beach and a more formal one shared by the Princess and the Tropical. I was given the choice for our massages and I picked the formal one because it was so quiet. The massages were wonderful. They're usually hit or miss in the islands but these were really nice. We'd booked 8:30 a.m. and it was a great way to start the day. Tips We tipped the maid $1 US/day. We also tipped at restaurants and the lobby bar staff, who, I will add, never looked at the amount - very professional. So it didn't matter if you were tipping them $1, $5, or $10; everyone got the same friendly service. Skyservice We were scheduled to depart PC at 8:45 p.m. this past Saturday (Apr. 28) and land in Montreal around 1:00. Unfortunately for us and about 200 other passengers, this did not happen. First of all, our flight was one hour late taking off which should have landed us at Trudeau International Airport at 2:00 a.m. The pilot announced the usual we're sorry for the delay followed by the reason for the delay. Allegedly the plane originated in Cancun. Which to us meant it flew from Cancun to Montreal, then Motnreal to Punta Cana. Well, almost at the end of the flight, the pilot announced that due to strict noise regulations, they could not get clearance to land in Montreal or in Toronto so we were being re-routed to the Hamilton, Ontario airport. What a treat! Not! We spoke to one of the flight attendants and he told us he'd attended this same flight over the past 4 Saturdays and in the previous 3, not only were they late every time, they were able to negotiate clearance into Montreal. So we were the exception. He was under the impression that Transport Canada got fed up with them being late all the time. Upon getting off the plane, a flight attendant told us that we would get our customs over with and would probably leave for Montreal around 5:30 a.m.Now, you would think that a Skyservice representative would have kept us informed as to when our plane would leave Hamilton. No such luck. And to top it all off, nothing was open at the airport. All they ended up offering us was a free Tim Horton's coffee around 6:00 a.m. before we finally got to check in.IOHO, Skyservice offered no service whatsoever as far as keeping us informed. We feel that Transport Canada is very much to blame in the sense that they should not offer landing schedules so close to a curfew and should re-think re-opening Mirabel International Airport (no noise restrictions). We will definitely be writing both agencies to express our disgust as well as try to get someone to pay for our extra day's parking at the Trudeau Airport. . Vacation OverallOverall, we can't wait to go back but not with Skyservice. If you have any questions, please fee free to address me in the Forum.

<Content>The Best Holiday Yet! We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess Resort April 23rd to May 2nd - 8 nights which was just so right. Not too little as you wish you had more time there, and not too long as to make you feel your homesick. We travelled with My Travel there and Thomas Cook on return. We paid extra for the Premair service. In fact any flight over 3 hours long I would recommend paying the extra for the better service. And Yes, it is better service. We had a slight problem on our outbound journey. Apparently, My Travel double booked seats at Gatwick prior to arriving at Manchester and therefore before we boarded, we had our seats changed. Not too happy a start but hey , we were going on holiday !. Quite a bit of leg room and comfy seats on the flight, plenty of food and drink and attended to really well. we arrived at PCP at 8pm ish, we then took a bus ride to the hotel which is one to be experienced. Definately not like the roads over here, no no, I must admit they do take the ' joy riders' very seriously as there were a whole lot of sleeping policemen ( road humps ) a couple of miles nearer the hotel. Part of the journey we all heard the loud bang, we think the driver had a blow out - but he carried on going. Arrived at the hotel at 9.15 pm rushed to get some supper before the buffet closed. Weather for the first couple of days was rainy then sunshine, and when the sun shone - it really shone ! So hot there you forgot it was raining 30 minutes previously. The hotel rooms were so clean and spacious. the best hotel room we have been in and we havent stayed anywhere less than 4*. We were in Block 4 room 4004. The most central accomodation to everything.( just be carefu when walking on the tiles corridors - can become rather slippy ) The maids came in each day to change the towels and make the bed ( and dressed the bed with flowers and petals - wonderful ) In fact there were 2 king size beds and a bed settee in the lounge area of the room which turned also into a bed. So much storage space too. The shower is fantastic - really forceful and you can change the style of head too. The Hairdryer is brilliant. I tool mine but never used it at all. I also took straighteners and they heated up fine. You have a coffee machine in your rrom with coffee and tea and creamer and suger which is replace each time you used it. There is a fridge inside the cupboard which the TV sits on. That is always stocked with lemonade, coke, and water. The TV channels arent too bad - Dont turn on channel 96, you will now wont you ? ha ha.  Now to the Food halls. We used the Caribe buffet each morning and evening. The omeletts are so lovely, and plenty to choose from . Smoothies, Juices, Cereals, toast, Oatmeal, Fried food, doughnuts, croissants, fruit, yoghurt, - Im starviing now. At lunch time we went over to the snack bar by the beach, again, salad, fries ( not very hot tho ) chicken, lamb chops, pork chops, burgers, and then each evening they had a different theme night on. Failing you like the theme night choice you could always back up with fries - potatoes, soup, salad, and they usually had a roast on in the corner. The Turkey is to die for ! Fantastic. The restaurants on site I believe are very good, we only went to the Tex Mex - Mexican - That was fine, the margarita they gave us was awful tho. Entertainment on in the Lobby in the evenings began at about 9.30 till 11.30, the animation team are full of energy and the games and re-enactments they try and get you to take part in are so funny - quite adult watching in some cases. Good job theres no Kids allowed. If you want to learn Merengue dancing - go there in the evening, and the boys and girls will get you up and give you a chance to try it out. ( theres music piped through the gardens and round the pool all day - can be a bit noisy by the pool) If you need internet access there are 2 computers for your use. $10 for 60 minutes which is quite good. Bit of recommendation tho - Get a hotmail address and you can MSN Messenger to you friends - so much cheaper than Mobile calls. Each day they have a photographer coming onto the beach and then onto the area by the pool. Each day they bring a different attraction to take the photo with, I have a Snake Phobia, so I was always on my guard when on the beach watching for what they were bringing with them. i have since found out, they bring the snake on a Sunday. they have a tiny monkey, and a chameleon too. Now onto the beach area. Well what can i say, the beach is extremely soft white sand - so clean, the sea or as I have been told to call it - the OCEAN is like stepping into a bath of turquiose radox bubble bath, so soft and creamy and luxurious. Yes that describes it well. I dont normally like going into the sea, but it was wonderful. Sometimes the waves were a little rough but you need to enter the water till it reaches you chest and then you move with the waves and they dont push you back to the beach. Make sure you have lip block on all the time - sore lips are not to be laughed at - in fact you cant laugh - it hurts too much. We walked both ways from our hotel along the beach if you are looking out to sea and turn left - you walk about 10 - 15 mins and you will come up on the beach huts where there are plenty of lucky lucky men behind their stalls trying to vye for your attention. Walk through the middle of the huts and you wont be bothered too much by them and at least then you get a chance to see what each of the stalls have to sell, then on your way back you make up your mind. Beautiful jewellry, I bought 2 necklaces, 1 pair earings and he asked for $75 I bought them for $40 so always say you only have ' X ' amount of $'s and they will take that instead of losing the sale. We had a beach party on Monday night and they had some stalls on site then too, same products being sold, but as least if you have dollars to use before leaving PCP you can spend them then. There werent many British visitors to PCP plenty of canadians where we met 2 lovely couples there, but the other canadians were also so friendly. I know now where people from spain and germany go on holiday to. Dom Rep. I took some spanish phrases off the internet before I left for the holiday and hopefully intended to try them out - only found the phrases as i was packing to come home. So if poss - get some phrases ready to use - the staff love to hear you ask how they are in their native launguage.  If poss leave one of your card keys in the electricity recepticle which is on the right hand side as you open you room door. This then ensures your air con is on when your out of the room and keeps it lovely and cool for your return from the beach ahhhh. I had been receiving updates off Tripadvisor a few weeks before we travelled on this hotel and looking at the photos, when i got there I felt like i knew the place very well. I promise you wont be disappointed holidaying here - We are definately returning - we have been to the Gran Ventanna in Playa Dorado - north coast - this is far superior to that holiday - And you know what I thought the best part of it was - NO KIDS ! - until you experience a holiday with no kids running round - splashing in the pool - crying and being under feet - you dont realise what youve been missing. I could go on forever , but I bet your fed up now and just itching to get on that flight ! I do hope you found this review helpful, I thoroughly enjoyed typing it and reminiscing. Have a lovely holiday,. Fionna  Dave

<Content>PCP The Place to be--Judi fron NJ Returned home May 5 from the Punta Cana Princess-- What can i say, It was a very nice, relaxing and fun vacation. The resort is very nice, totally clean at all times and very, very friendly. I am from New Jersey and very hard to please--but I have really NO complaints. Arrived on sat 4/29 at 1pm and was able to check in right away. Went with the VIP plan--which was worth the extra $$. The 20 minute free massage alone covered the extra cost. The beach is absolutely gorgeous-and extremly clean. There are sun beds for VIP only and let me say that made my vacation-they are clean and comfortable and enough for all. The pool area is well equipped with chairs and shade huts. Many other reviews that I read complained about the food-Myself and friends thought that the food was good-of course there were a few things that we did not enjoy, but there was always something else to eat. Dinners at the restaurants were very good, my favorite was the italian restaurant at the PCP. Chicken Parm excellent!!The staff could not be more accomadating, always friendly and and sweet!! The best bar is in the lobby with Emilio, he works the 3pm to 11pm shift, great personality and lots of fun.The only thing i would have liked to see was alittle more music in english-mostly spanish playing all the time-but you do get used to it. The animation crew really tries to bring entertainment to you all day and night, but to no avail-not there fault-most people want to just relax.I would reccomened this hotel to anyone-LOVED IT -will return!!p.s. if you can try and fit a noodle or a blow up float in your suitcase(deflated of course)do so, good to have for both the pool and ocean.

<Content>Wonderful - Loved Everything We stayed at PCP from 4/22-4/29. After a very rough start - we were to leave Boston at 9:30 am - didn't get off the ground until 7:30 pm - Apple Vacations - that's a whole other review - poor service.We arrived at PCP at 1:00 am - even at that time everyone was scrambling to accommodate us - they were very sympathetic to our situation. We ended up going into the main buffet at that time for something to eat and drink - Merengue's for all - great drink!Our rooms were really nice, comfortable bed/couch, clean and spacious, maid service was terrific. The sun was great, rained every day pretty hard at times and the wind was blowing pretty hard, so we opted for the pool most of the time which was wonderful! Loved the swim up bar. Only problem we had was being VIP (worth the up-grade) we had access to the day bed's (worth the up-grade very comfortable) were that regular guests would occupy them it is not posted at that pool that the beds are for VIP only - the beach area is. The resort was filling up as the week went on, so we did find ourselves reserving a day bed. Food was very good, good assortment in the main buffet (Marina night was not so great), Mar Nostrum was our favorite restaurant during the evening (beef with stuffed lobster in wine sauce A++++ can't say enough about that). The Fondue restaurant was a lot of fun - it was our daughter's birthday and they went all out for her. We went over to the Caribe Club for their buffett one night - similar in food - but it is very, very hectic and much larger. We couldn't wait to get back to the PCP! The night entertainment was a lot of fun - tequilia funnels! OMG! Emilio at the bar was so funny - ask him for a bikini! Bernardo  Jose at the pool bar - were just great - lots of dancing, singing and fun. This resort was great in that it is small and intimate, but that is what we like - we met the best people from all over the world during our week; something you don't encounter at a large resort as easily. My daughter and her boyfriend got engaged while we were here and they will go back for their honeymoon. Overall, my husband and I would definitely go back to the PCP we had a great time. Would definitely do the upgrade to VIP again as well, it comes with some really nice extras.

<Content>Awesome for a 1st trip Wow, where should a start.... it was our 1st trip ever for me and my boyfriend and we would go back in a heart beat.The staff is awesome, i have never seen people enjoy their job so much. They are always smiling and at your service.The buffet at the beach kind a sucks, its always the same thing every single day. But its really practical because you are right on the beach and you dont need to be dressep up, you can just go in your bathing suit. So thats pretty cool.The a la carte restaurant were pretty good we thought, we tried the Tex Mex, Mexican, The sea food place, and the very best one is La Cava'' the one we had included on our VIP package. We had the lobster and it was absolutely devine. And also its pretty much the only place that you can buy decent wine instead of the crapy house wine that they serve you and all the other restaurants.The resort is so well kept, they are always busy cleaning. Our room was on the top floor, which was nice cause we had the cathedral seiling. The fact that its an ''adult only'' resort is awesome, not that i dont like kids cause we have a daughter but its really nice to get away and be only with other adults.Anyway i am probably forgetting some stuff, but the main line is.....its awesome. If you have questions you can ask me.Ciao

<Content>Very Nice Resort.... only one thing.... Just returned from my stay @ the Punta Cana Princess from 4/22-4/29--- The resort is very nice, always kept clean with tons of workers, working on the landscaping, cleaning the pool, etc. The room was definitely amazing, we had a direct view of the pool, and the beach.. room 5211. I would definitely say to not stay on the ground floor because at night the amount of bugs is crazy, and I would not want the milipedes crawling into my room. The pool was kept in tip-top shape, and cleaned a few times throughout the day. The bars, I would honestly say the nicest people are at the lobby bar.... and at the ebach bar at night.... other than that, some of the people working there looked like robots, even after you tipped them-- I am not expecting a song and dance, but when i order one or two drinks and give 2 dollars everytime I at least expect a thank you. Not all of the workers were like that, there were definitely some who were very gracious to recieve the tips. The Food. #1 I am a New Yorker, who has access to the best restuarants in the world, and I will say that it is nothing like food in the United States. I would say it is decent. #2 I am a vegetarian and there was honestly not much for me to eat... I know people will say oh you could have had pasta.... but when you come from New York, and an Italian family... you cannot eat Tomato Sauce that was made in the Dominican Republic... it tastes like Ragu. There were some things I could eat, which kept me going... They had a very small salad bar, and once during the week they had vegetable soup.... In the A la carte restaurants, I had asked if there was anything they could make that did not have meat in it, and they said NO... so I was a little upset about that because I had stayed at RIU, Iberostar, and Breezes before, and all of them helped me out with my food issues. My fiance said that he enjoyed the chicken that they made daily. Out of all the a la cartes, he said that RIO GRANDE tex mex steakhouse, was the worst because the meat was very tough(he ordered filet mignon.. that is not supposed to be tough), He loved the Chinese! He liked the italian because he had gotten pork filet which he said was very tender. The mexican was very good -- I order chicken fajitas, and just ate the peppers and onions out of it .. they had a very nice taste. You are definitely better off booking all a la cartes. The buffet at the Caribe is huge, but extremely crowded with kids who are sneezing on everything, which is always lovely. overall, I would say is was an average place to stay, 3 stars.... definitely not 4 or 5also, the bavaro shopping mall..... unless you want to be hassled and being begged to come in and check out their stores ... stay away.

<Content>Quite and Relaxing I have been home 24 hours now from our trip to the Princess. I have travelled for several years and never have I stayed at such a relaxing resort. I have 3 children and love them dearly but Adults Only is the way to go. The restaurants, pool and beach were NEVER full. I was amazed that no matter what time you went to any of these spots you would get a chair. As for being clean the grounds are immaculate. The rooms are clean and bright. Very comfortable beds and all rooms face the pool and everything around it. Small amount of odour of must but a scented candle works great.The food was good. Your not at home so remember these people can not please everyone. Book the restaurants as soon as you can they go fast.We shopped in town for our gifts. The Bavero Plaza is 10 minutes from the resort and has everything you would need. My husband bought his cigars there and was amazed at the price.No night life but it was nice spending time with the man I love.I don't know if I would go back but I would say this was the most relaxing trip I have done.Always remember your not at home your in paradise and only you can make it beautiful. Have a great trip. Honeymoon

<Content>great vacation We stayed from 4-15 to 4-22.Arrival was easy and smooth. Breezed through the airport. Ride in wasn't bad about 1 hour as we were the last drop off. Check in was fast was given keys and the bell boy took us to our rooms.Room: Beautiful room. Prob the best we have stayed in. We had a king bed sunk in living room spacious bathroom. We went vip had the perks in the room cigars rum bathrobes. The room is spotless and kepted that way all week always had clean towels. We tipped $3 a day with a candy bar and a present for the day maid and $2 and a candy bar for the night. We always got extra for our fridge. We were in building 5 had a view of the pool and could see the ocean. Resort: It was well groomed and beautiful small enough so you would walk to the lobby or resturants and bars nice if you want to make a quick trip for something. Staff is the best the bartenders are very good and fun. We met a couple the first day who were a blast and made our vacation. My husband and hers got up at 5 in the morning and they went down and got the beach huts and spent everymoring at the beach bar gearing up for the day. the beach bar is open 24 hours and the bartenders there are great. The food I thought was fair. All others in our group thought it was horrible. Out of all the resorts I have stayed in, it was the worst. But the pasta station was good ala carts were good. La Cava was really good. Drinks were really good. We had access to Cribe/tropical but really didn't go there. We took a short walk in there but basically stayed at our resort.We did one tour Saona Island it was alot of fun and worth the trip even with the long ride I am really glad we did it. It is not a snorkle trip though. The island is absoultly beautiful meal was really good and was fun.We had a prob the last day we were waiting for the bus at 11:30 and after a 1/2 hour I asked the bell boy if he know when the bus was due. He said sometimes they are late and to give it some time. We waited for another hour then I had the front desk call the apple rep and there was a mechinical prob with the plane which didnt leave boston and would be a 14 hour delay. No problem so we threw our bags in our friends room went to the beach it was cloudy all day no sun but was still nice. We were picked up at the lobby at 9 pm never flew out till 3 am. There were a lot of angry people at the airport but there is nothing you can do about it and I would rather be delayed on the departure then the arrival and we made the best of it.Beach: Best yet. Have to get up early to get a hut. we didnt use the vip beds but they are really comfortable. There are vendors a short walk as you look at the ocean go left. Good buys. We walked the beach each day and it really is beautiful.Weather: Had a nice week but had about 3 days where it rained for 3 hours or so mostly in the later afternoon which was ok as the sun is really hot and we came back with super tans.All in all we had a great vacation with the exception of the food. We went to Pureto Plata in 05 and prob will not come back to this island. If any one has any question pm me and I will be happy to answer.

<Content>Wonderful trip! What a wonderful trip! We just got back on April 20th after a 6 day stay. I can't say enough good things about this resort. The grounds were so beautiful, the staff was so good to us and treated us like family. The Animacion Team was fun and entertaining. The beach was absolutely gorgeous! Crystal clear warm waters. The waves were fun. The sand is so soft under your feet and there is a nice breeze most of the time. It rained one day while we were there but not until in the afternoon. The food was good at every restaurant we ate at. I liked the Pescador the best and had lobster there. The best drink, I think was the Coco Loco, yummy! We had the VIP package, and was well worth it. We stayed in the 5000 block. Very nice room, good air conditioning and the bed was so comfortable. Fridge was stocked well and drinks were cold. My husband liked the beer. I drank the diet coke. If you like strong coffee you will like their brand. I kept watering mine down. You get used to it after a couple of days though. We didn't do any excursions, our choice, but had plenty to do and mostly we just wanted to relax on the beach. Be forewarned though that even if you like seashells and want to buy them from the locals, it is illegal and you may get arrested. I almost bought one before I read in the Punta Cana brochure that it is illegal. Glad I didn't. You won't see any shells on the beach but they have them for sale everywhere. I could go on and on about all the wonderful things at the Punta Cana Princess. If you have any questions please write and I will be happy to help.

<Content>Better than Expected!! My husband and I (both 50ish) stayed at the Punta Cana Princess for 1 week March 30-April 6, 2007 and have absolutely nothing negative to say.Transporation to and from Airport was quick and pretty well organized however don't expect to be at hotel in less than 45 minutes once the bus gets underway. Roads aren't good so can't go very fast, sit back and take in the locat way of life. Check-in: Quick  friendly (didn't get the welcome cocktail but checked in at about 945pm  bar was still open so were able to get our own)Lobby: Large, clean, a great gathering place after dinner with a bar and lots of seating.Rooms: we were in building 4, ground floor, location central to everything. Rooms were spacious, clean and nicely decorated. Air conditioning worked fine and was needed to keep out dampness (unavoidable given the climate and humidity). Mini bar always stocked with soft drinks (my husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven when he saw the coke was in glass botlles! ) Did say the beer in the fridge was disgusting however we met a few who didn't mind it. Grounds: Beautiful, well maintained and constantly manicured. Pool: Large, clean, refreshing with plenty of chaises available in or out of the sun and a swim up bar with plenty of cold Presidente` beer and Banana Mamas. Beach: Beautiful, we are walkers and we never ran out of beach in either direction, able to buy souveniers at either end and also available at the hotel. Always lots of chaises availability at the beach. Both the pools and the beach area were far more crowded and noisy at the sister hotels where kds were allowed. Much more relaxcing and quiet at this 18+ hotel. Food: Very good,. The al a cartes were very nice, presentation great, decor very nice and food very good. We ate at Mare Nostrum (seafood), Tex Mex (steak) Shanghai (chinese) and both Italian restaurants, one at this hotel and one at next hotel over. Buffet was also very good always a couple of good meat choices (much larger and more variety at the hotel next door, worth the 3 minute walk! ) Entertainment: Day time activities around pool and on beach were good and well organized, however night time activities in our lobby were a bit silly. There were shows at both the sister hotels and both the ones we saw were quite good entertainment. They didnt start until 945-1000 and most nights, after long days in the sun we were just as happy to stretch out on the bed and watch a little TV at that time. We did hit the casino one night, very small, most slot games unfamiliar, lasted about 20 minutes. Didn't do any excursions so can't comment on those. Tips: Bring lots of suntan lotion, bring a face cloth if you use one, bring insulated mugs, bring lots of ones for tipping. (We started tipping restaurant  bar staff but toward the end of the trip we started tipping the guy who cuts the grass, the man who cleaned the pool, the omelette maker etc these are the hard jobs and unlike the others probably rarely get tips. Tips are not shared so whoever picks it up keeps it for thmselves. I did get several bites during the week, never did figure out what was biting me, could have been no-see-ums however strangley enough my husband didn't get any and half the people we met got any bites, mostly the women, guess we're sweeter. They were very itchy so pack some after bite or equivalent.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess - "Why not, baby?" My boyfriend and I (35 and 33) visited the Punta Cana Princess from March 13-19, 2007. We booked air, hotel and transfers through a TA and paid $130 extra for the 2 of us to upgrade to the VIP package. Here is our (very long) review of our trip:FLIGHTS AND TRANSFERS:We flew US Air from Boston, connected in Charlotte, no problems with out flights. Transfers were prearranged through VIP Travel (no relation to hotel) and we quickly found our shuttle. There were no other passengers to drop off so we arrived at the resort in about 25 minutes even after a small traffic tie up due to a truck broken down.CHECK IN AND WELCOME:Our bags were unloaded and set aside. There was no one else waiting to check in so we walked right up. A bartender from the lobby bar showed up within moments with a delicious fruit punch served in Champagne glasses. After quick check in we put ID stickers on our bags and visited the VIP concierge who explained the perks of our package and gave us the rundown on booking dinners, etc. We moved quickly to the lobby bar for another fruit punch, this time with rum.After about an hour at the bar we moved on, with our luggage, to our room.THE ROOM:Our room was on the top floor of building 4. To us this would be the 3rd floor, to them it is the 2nd (ground, 1st, 2nd). The room was spotless with a cathedral ceiling of wood and a ceiling fan. We never turned on the AC our whole visit but did use the AC fan and the ceiling fan. We had 2 queen beds; there was a large dresser/vanity and the closet had plenty of space for hanging clothes as well as shelf space. There was an umbrella in the closet along with an iron and ironing board. The safe was in the closet and measures about 12鈥漌x6鈥滺x12鈥滵. We did not pay additional for the safe which was controlled by entering a code you pick rather than by using a key. There are two steps going down to a living area with couch, trundle bed underneath and bureau. I fell down the stairs the first night we were there and would recommend placing something in front of them overnight as we did going forward. The room is dark at night with the curtains drawn, leaving a light on is advisable. The bureau has a couple drawers and houses the fridge, water glasses, ice bucket, etc. The fridge was stocked daily with 2 liters of water, coke, sprite and beer. As part of the VIP package we also arrived to a bottle of rum and box of 3 cigars in the room.The bathroom was clean with a double sink, full tub and shower. We always had hot water and plenty of water pressure. There was a hairdryer and makeup mirror in the bathroom as well as a bottle opener attached to the wall (handy!). There is little room for your stuff though; just counter space and the lip around the tub; there are no shelves and only one hook on the wall. For us, this was sufficient though.The patio is off the living area and the view from our room 4219 was out over the pool (pool bar area) with the ocean beyond. The noise from the pool was never an issue for us and at night the pool lights with the ocean sounds beyond were very nice. If I were requesting a room I would ask for an upper floor room in buildings 4 or 5 as they would have the best view.THE RESORT:This is a fairly small and compact resort. The lobby is furthest from the sea with the buffet and 2 ala carte restaurants in front of it.. Shops are to the right of the lobby coming out towards the pool.Rooms run down either side towards the water with the pool in the middle of the area. There are walkways with lots of green space and palm trees between. Throughout the property are large sculptures of birds, animals and tribal figures making for interesting strolls around the grounds.The pool area has plenty of palapas and beds surrounding it and a pool bar/swim up bar that played latin music though never too loudly. The pool was large enough that the volleyball net could be left up constantly with plenty of space for a quiet dip elsewhere.The beach is lovely - wide and white and the water warm. Most of the time we were there it was quite windy and the waves were fun to play in. The breeze made our time in the sun much more pleasant than it would have been. There is a separate area roped off with beach beds for those who have upgraded to the VIP package. The beds had retractable awnings over them, approximately 30 in all. We never had a problem getting one, even when arriving to the beach quite late in the morning. Outside the VIP area are lounge chairs and palapas. The chairs were comfortable and the palapas plenty. On the beach was the watersports center, also where you exchange towels, and animation area. We cannot comment on the watersports but they were friendly when we exchanged towels. The animation staff led aerobics, dance, volleyball and more on the beach. The beach bar has several tables in both sun and shade. Butler service on the beach was convenient. We brought two Bubba Kegs, one we kept filled with ice water, the other Santo Libre. Yum. The restaurant next to the beach bar had food available from late morning until dinnertime, then late night snacks. Mid-afternoon was 鈥渢ea time鈥?at the beach bar 鈥?sandwiches, salads, fruit, etc. One afternoon we were there we were treated to a BBQ lunch at the beach which was one of the best meals we had there.THE STAFF:These nice folks work HARD to make your visit enjoyable. We can鈥檛 figure out how they remember everyone鈥檚 names but they do. Everyone greets you with a happy 鈥渉ola鈥?as you walk by and there is always someone there with what you want when you want it. The maids and the groundskeepers spoke little English but were always happy and would attempt to engage you. The waitstaff, bartenders, etc. were providingfirst class service and the language barrier was easy to work around. Learn even a little bit of Spanish and it will go a long way. We found the bilingual staff to be extremely helpful and eager to teach you more Spanish if you just asked. If you speak only English you will be fine with the staff you need to interact with most. Overall, the friendly staff made our visit. 鈥淪pecial for you鈥?is heard often but still seems sincere.THE FOOD:We ate breakfast at the buffet daily. The omelet bar was good and you can never go wrong with bacon. There was a variety of pancakes, French toast, fresh fruit and some other, less appetizing, sausages. The coffee is delicious and the mimosas just the way we like them 鈥?lots of champagne and a little o.j.Our appetites were generally small while we were there, probably because of the heat, so we usually skipped lunch and grabbed late afternoon snacks at the beach bar.We ate once or twice at the buffet for dinner. Very average. We ate at 3 of the ala carte restaurants: Italian, Tex Mex and Fondue. The fondue was a good meal and a ton of fun. We had the shrimp app., meat (in oil) main course and the chocolate fondue dessert. All were excellent with dipping sauces on the side and fun fun fun! We both had Filet Mignon at the Tex Mex which was good, but not as tender and tasty as we get in the states. The Italian was disappointing but we heard others who had ordered different dishes praising it. We both had pasta dishes 鈥?my boyfriend the ravioli with Bolognese and me the spaghetti with pesto. His could have been Chef Boyardee from a can. Seriously. Mine okay but not nearly pesto-ey enough. We were going to go for our complimentary gourmet dinner at El Pescadore the last night of our stay, but it burned down. No, actually, we decided to operate on island time our last night and just missed our dinner, but it did burn down, so good thing we spared ourselves the disappointment and had decided to skip it anyway.OTHER STUFF:We went to a show at the Caribe/Tropicale which was a Broadway review. We had fun. Short ride in the golf cart train with friendly folks we tried our best to communicate with. With our VIP package we got complimentary 20 minute massages. They will try to get you to pay for an upgrade to a full hour. I'm sure for the extra $30 or so it would be worth it but we stuck with our freebie and enjoyed it very much.We tipped about $200 in the 6 days we were there. We felt it was appreciated and might have got us a little extra attention but we saw superior service provided to those who didn鈥檛 tip at all. Those who don鈥檛 get tipped so frequently, like the groundskeepers and beach cleaners, were appreciative as well.As mentioned above, I fell in our room. I actually hit my head harder than I ever have before. We called resort medical staff and there was a doctor (or nurse?) in our room within 10 minutes. I ended up agreeing to go by ambulance to the local clinic. Care was fine all around, the clinic clean and well staffed though maybe not so well equipped. I had x-rays taken there and the option of a CAT scan which I declined. Be aware that if you need medical care you will have to pay for it out of pocket. The ambulance wouldn鈥檛 roll out of the resort until I paid them ($155 US) and the clinic wouldn鈥檛 call me a taxi until I squared up with them ($420 for exam and 2 xrays). Both took credit cards and I will get full reimbursement from my stateside health insurance. Care was fine overall though.SUMMARY:This is a beautiful, quiet, adults-only resort. I would give it a 5 star rating if it were not for the food. But I would not hesitate to go back.

<Content>Loved It!! We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess hotel from March 8th-12th. When we left Chicago it was 20 degrees and we had winter coats on. When we got to the Dominican it was in the 80's the whole time. We had a great time there. Everything is so clean, and everyone is so friendly. Check-In was a breeze. Saloman helped us, and he was very nice. Most of the staff speaks English so we didn't have any problems. We stayed in building #4 and left the maid a few dollars everyday. We still got the turn-down service and we were not apart of the VIP package. We did request more towels one day, and they sent them up in no time. The beach and the ocean was beautiful. There are some little shops on the resort, but everything is way over priced. They also will not bargin. If you walk down the beach about 5 min, there is a little market that you can get things really cheap. Stick to your guns about how much you are willing to pay. They eventually will give in! A friend of mine got two necklaces and a braclet for $10, and the guy kept insisting $20. We got it for $10! We did swim with the dolphins at Manati Park for $75. It was fun, but not worth the money. They said we would be able to do it for 20min, I think we were in the pool less than 10. There is another place that you can do it, that is $95 and you can swim with them longer. I would have rather paid the extra money for the better one. We booked through VacationExpress.com and had the option of paying $15 per person for hotel/airport transfers. That was worth it, you didn't have to worry about getting a taxi. This resort is also connected to two other princess resorts and you can take a tram to the other resorts and make reservations at their restaurants. We ate at the Brazillian and the Italian Restaurants which were very good. Get the chicken dish at the Italian. We heard the steak house was really good, but they are not open on the weekends. If you want to check it out, make reservations during the week. Wish we would have known that. The adult only resort was the way to go. No annoying screaming kids around. No splashing in the pool. A very relaxing and restful trip!! I would definitly book here again!

<Content>A little bit of perfection We stayed at the PC Princess March 3-10th...not a drop of rain for 7 days...it was so hot we sought shelter under the majestic palm trees for a little relief. We stayed at this resort 5 years ago and loved it so much we returned to the adult only side. The buildings and their warm bold colours stand out amongst the regal green palms and beautifully and immaculately groomed gardens. Everyone is busy working each day to clean walkways and the gardens...it's really breathtaking. We had a second floor room in block 4 ~ 2 double beds, sunken living room with day bed, lots of storage for clothes... computer in your room if you want internet access ($40 U.S. for the week) ~ Fridge filled with beer and water etc, large bathroom...it's all so clean and comfortable, but how much time do you really spend in your room anyway? The beach is like a photograph...warm turquoise waters...little seaweed...waves that encourage even the most timid to rent a boogyboard and try bodysurfing...it's so much fun. What can you say about the drinks...their pleniful, tasty and quickly catch up with you...before you know it the sun is going down, you've spent the entire day enjoying the hot caribbean sun and it's time for siesta. We tipped the bar tender each day a couple of U.S. dollars ~ this goes a long way to encourage quick service!! We used the buffet on the Caribe side...it's much bigger, better selection of food and a 5 minute walk....Al a carte were good...we tried Italian, Tex Mex and Chinese....everything is beautifully presented and taste excellent...not a wine drinker but I heard it was not very good...stick to the bahama mamas. Lots of activites around the resorts...tennis, volleyball, archery etc...staff is amazing...always friendly and smiling ~ the Dominican people are so welcoming. This was our 11th time to Punta Cana...no wonder we keep coming back. I would highly recommend this resort.

<Content>Loved the Punta Cana Princess!!!! We just returned from the Punta Cana Princess. It was amazing! The resort was so clean and beautiful!!!!! There are gorgeous palm trees everywhere. The pool is beautiful and so clean. The service is amazing!! Everyone is so friendly. The beach is absolutely gorgeous. The sand is so white, there are no rocks or shells and they clean the seaweed off every morning. The water is pretty warm and a beautiful color of blue-green. The weather was perfect. The food is ok. The buffet is ok, there is always something you can eat (bread or fruit). The restaurants are pretty good. We ate at the Bacio and the chicken was good there. We also ate at the Brazailian one and it was really good. We were told the Rio Grande is good also. The rooms are very clean and pretty. The maids are wonderful. They clean it every day beautifully. It's no problem to get extra towels for the room or for the beach. The massages are great, we used the spa outside. There isn't a whole lot to do so if you're looking for an exciting vacation, this might not be for you. But if you're looking for a relaxing vacation, this is the perfect place. It's not too busy, you almost feel like it's just you. It's nice that it's an adult only resort, it makes it even quieter. The staff is so accomadating and friendly. We had a great time and would definitely go again. We did one excursion, swimming with the dolphins at Manitee Park. It was fun, the swimming was less than 20 mins and there wasn't much to the rest of the park. I don't really think it was worth the money. But the resort was definitely worth it!!!

<Content>Fantastic Resort - Jim  Just returned on March 11th from a two week stay at the Punta Cana Princess.You could not ask for a better resort to stay at in the Caribbean.We have been to numerous islands and resorts over the years and this is the first one that we have decided to certainly re-visit.The resort is relatively small which makes it easy to access any part of the facility and the fact that it is an adults only resort means that it is quiet and relaxing. The resort is maintained super clean and you could not experience a more firendly and helpful staff. Eveyone goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and to assist you in any way that they can, from the administration staff to the servers, maintenance crew and the cleaning staff.We took the VIP package and would certainly reccommend it to anyone. The main perk of the package is the use of the private beach area that has tanning beds that are worth the cost of the upgrade in themselves.The food in the alacarte and buffet restaurants is not gourmet style however it is more than exceptable. The specialty restaurants on the other hand are excellent. The VIP package provides you with a complimentary meal at one of the specialty restaurants and we found the experience at La Cave so great that we returned for another meal at our expense. The meal we had would blow your socks off!One piece of advice........lunch is served at the beach-side buffet and for the most part is repetitious from day to day but is acceptable. Make the effort and go to the main buffet for lunch and you will have a much better selection and quality of food.We left a couple of dollars ever other day for the room staff and that proved to be very beneficial as a simple request would give you anything that you wanted.Can't wait until we have an opportunity to return to this bit of heaven.

<Content>Great Place- Mar 4th to the 8th Just got home and had a great five day stay. The resort is spotless and very clean. The food is good. The TEX-MAX is the best and the Italian is good. However, the buffet always had things everyone can like. We had a choice of either the Pescador or La Cava. Unfortunately we picked the Pescador which is a very limited menu. If you do not like shell fish. This is not the place for you. We had a very enjoyable meal at the Sombero, Mexican Restaurant, at the Caribe. Remember you can go to any other Princess Hotel to eat and they can't come to the Punta Cana Princess. The real joy is the adults only. Just go to the other hotels and you will run back to this one. We had a problem with check in. Apparently they overbooked and told us that we were cancelled. No one told us about this. However, once we showed them our paid vouchers they got us a room in a hour or so. While this was in building 2 at least it was on the second floor. Everyone says that building 3, 4  5. are the best. Unfortunately unlike airlines when you are overbooked you get upgraded this did not happen to us. However, the rooms are all the same and the cleanliness makes up for alot of things. They are constantly cleanning. Now for some tips. Definitely, get the VIP. The price is worth it. You get the beds on the beach in your own area. It is the envy of everyone. You get premimum liquors and a choice of specality restaurant. Plus many more things like internet, turn down bed services etc. Thanks for the reviewer who let us know about wash clothes. They do not have any. The natives don't use them. Glad we brought our own. The beach is beautiful and the resort is the envy of all other resorts at Punta Cana. The house wine was a disappointment. They wanted 6 times the market to purchase for named wines. They really need someone to teach them about wines. Watch your luggage on the way home. The bell captain put ours on the wrong bus and we had to have him get it back for us. We were lucky that they returned with it. Bring alot of singels and use them. They are very appreciative of a dollar or two tip. We brought a hundred of them and didn't bring many home. I know that it will be harder to make reservations here again with all the good reviews but they deserve it. We had great weather and only rained one evening. The entertainment was to loud and appeared to cater to a younger crowd.

<Content>Well worth every cent!! This was our third trip to the Dominican Republic but our first stay at the Punta Cana Princess. We took the VIP package and it was well worth it. It included top shelf liquors, a 20 minute massage, motorized water sports, one hour internet for each of us, use of canopied beds on the beach, etc. We truely were treated like Very Important People. All employees were incredibly cheerful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.... and they succeeded. The grounds were beautiful. The food was just okay but it didn't seem to matter since they have so much else in their favor. I will go back and I will recommend this little piece of Heaven to all my friends.

<Content>Best Resort we've stayed at in Punta Cana We just returned from the Punta Cana Princess after a wonderful 2 weeks of r and r. Ditto all the positives as reported in the previous reports - the front desk staff was exceptional to us!! The Dominican people have a contageous joy - we constantly asked them what made them so happy - They loved their job - they loved their family and country, and were CONTENT with their lives. Plus, they had the merengue!!! :) Thank you Emilio and Kinya for the last minute merengue dances as we waited for our shuttle to the airport. The resort was CLEAN, rooms were spacious and beautiful, food was excellent - We've done a lot of travelling, and know what's out there - this was the perfect place for us. Adults only was a bonus. The most beautiful beach in the world - lots of hot water, everything worked - If it needed fixing, they fixed it right away. Thank you Karen, Julio, Jesus Super Carlos and all the staff for making our stay a memorable one. We hope to come back again next year.The McConnells from PUNTA CANADA :)

<Author>SixtiesLady
<Content>Wonderful vacation We just returned from our first 'get away from it all holiday', in 23 years and cannot rave enough about the Punta Cana Princess. We are both in our sixtys, and just didn't realize what an all inclusive, adult only vacation could be. Although my husband ended up with the flu, the size of the Punta Cana Princess was just what we needed. The Princess is a smaller resort and was so easy to get to the pool or the beach without a long walk. Just what the Dr. ordered. There is lots to do if you are wanting adventure from swimming with the dolphins, snorkeling, tubing. We could lay around the pool and tan or sleep in the shade, we could always find a spot at the beach and watch the people or swim. The service was beyond expectations. It didn't matter if it was water, or a drink, the friendly staff was always there to assist. The ala carte restaurants were an adventure in fine dining. Although the language was a small barrier, it was not hard to explain with gestures and a small dictionary that we had a bad stomache and they adjusted my husbands meals accordingly. We had alot of fun at the Domincan Restaurant at the Caribe. The staff was fun to be around and they certainly enjoyed their work. The Steak at the Tex Mex at the Punta Cana Priness would give our good Alberta beef a run for the money. The amount of ala cartes allowed was terrific but we found that we enjoyed eating at the buffet as the food there was also great. The work and effort put on by the resort was greatly appreciated. The whole buffet area was moved to the beach for a beach party one evening and the meal was to die for. The cleanliness of this resort is at least 10 **********. It didn't matter if you used their public washrooms or your own suite, they were spotless. The grounds were gorgeous and the grounds keepers just fade into the landscaping keeping it in beautiful shape. Although my husband was ill for the first 2 days I felt right at home wondering around the resort on my own even going for meals in the evening and never once was worried about my safety.  We took the trip to Manaiti Park and were treated with the same hospitality as the Hotel. And so handy being picked up at the door and returned in fine style.If we had a negative comment to make it would be the helpfulness of the lobby staff being able to communicate on arrival. As this was our first holiday in along while, being tired from a long late flight, very hungry from lack of eating due to a poor airline, and in a new country, better explanations of what is going on would have been a great help. The staff knew what they were doing we just didn't. And don't remove the card in the wall when you get to your room. It does not work in the safe, and you will be in the dark in about 15 minutes and trying to locate the phone. But after calling the front desk and trying to understand their explanation of what we had done the situation was righted promptly. I would also reccommend taking a face cloth as they aren't supplied.All in all we had a wonderul holiday filled with many good memories and lots of wonderful pictures. We will be recommending this resort to all our friends and family if they want a wonderful vacation. If it wasn't for the terrible plane ride, we would be thinking of going back real soon.

<Content>Loved it! We stayed February 5-12. The hotel is adult only which is a huge plus for us. We had access to the 2 other resorts, but the screaming kids drove us back to our quiet home. We went to get-away and totally relax - and did just that. Finding a beach chair is no problem in either sun or shade. Drink service right at the beach, and food available from 10:30 a.m. on at the beach made relaxation easy.We highly recommed this hotel. The staff work HARD to make you feel welcome and comfortable. If you try to speak a little spanish, they'll turn somersaults to serve you. Small tips (2-3 dollars) cause huge smiles and are certainly appreciated - not expected.There is little to do as this resort which is why we went there. Sometimes you just have to sit on a chair for a week and not move :-)For those that crave activity, there are activities run by enthusiastic staff. You can play, or watch.

<Content>Will Return to Punta Cana Princess We just returned from a group trip to the Punta Cana Princess Feb 2-10. The resort is absolutely beautiful! The rooms were spacious and clean, the beach was incredible, beautiful pool and grounds. The restaurants offer a good variety and you can always find something you like. The highests marks go to the staff, who are friendly and caring. The Dominican people are wonderful and made our vacation very special. I was concerned about some of the negatives I read in reviews prior to our trip. It turned out that the resort exceeded all of our expectations. We will surely return to the Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>beautiful resort,very quiet just got back from puntacanta princess, hotel was beautiful,grounds were so clean pool was clean and plenty of room to swim and relax. if you want a good spot on the beach or pool its best to put a towel over your chair to save it and try to do it before 9:00.our room was the best we were near the beach and pool so we had a great view and close to everything. they said no tipping for drinks but to get good service best to tip $2each time you get a couple of drinks to get better service we also tipped the maid each day she always supplied us with plenty of drinks and clean towels. the food was the biggest let down the 1st 2 nights we made reservations at the mediterraneanmare nostrum we had surfturf not like at home my lobster was smaller than a golf ball and my husband did not even get any and the steak was like rubber. the next night we ate at the rio grande everyone said this was the best ,appetizer was chicken very good steak was horrible after that we ate at the buffet which was okay we never tried the caribe food because it all looked the same. all in all i would return to this resort if they keep it all adults it was so peaceful that you have to overlook the food. if you wanted to see shows you had to go to the caribe, we did a jeep safari ,ride definetly,would recommend you get to see beyond the resort area and its very safe you travel with about 10 other jeeps. so if you want a nice relaxing vacation and you are noy a picky eater then i would suggest this hotel.

<Content>Never again!!!!! Rude personal, never available to customer needs, limited English and no sense of responsibility. Extreme liberties are the best description. They may offend the customer out of blue and disrespectAmericans. My son was trying to reach me on the phone for several days. Nope, never happened, especially difficult to communicate to service desk after 9.00pm. Whoever is at the desk don't bother to transfer all incoming calls, they don't listen to youas soon as you try to speak English and don't make any effort to understand.They deliberately cut the line as soon as they have to speak English. I've never seen this kind of service nor behavior around the globe and I travel frequently. I had a problem with A/C in my room, I tried to reach for service, but they never get back to me. I gave up, taking in effect my soon departure. The bottom line it is their room to take care of, not my house. What do I care? leaking A/C may get fixed for the next customer if they are demanding type.The food is not good at all. Out of all restaurants inside resort I found the buffet is the only place where you may get a salad or sometimes breakfast a decent meal. Anything else- forget it or try on your own risk if you have good medical insurance.Anyway, I will never again visit this hotel, certainly will not recommend to my friends, family and coworkers. Please stay away!

<Content>enjoying our vacation We are still here at the Punta Cana princess and very much enjoying ourselves, we have another week to go.The VIP upgrade is worth it and we enjpyed our complimentary massages . Also being able to book the a la carte restaurents by phone instead of waiting in line is a bonus. Also we have a private area on the beach and use of the beach beds and drink service. We have yet to try the scuba and watersports included. The rooms are very nice, they have a step down couch and tv area. Coffe makers, bathrobes and beach towels in the room and 24 hr. room service with the VIP.One recommendation prior to coming is you should be taking an anti malarial drug as this area, bavaro beach is on the travel advisory for malaria, which is transmitted by a dusk to dawn mosquito. To check this out refer to the CDC website. The medication needs to be started 2 weeks prior to travel and is taken once weekly.The PCP is smaller but we are able to enjoy privileges at the Caribe and Tropical princess next door. There are a variety of restaurents between the resorts, we haven't tried them all yet. Mamma Mias italian was quite good, but the steak place wasn't quite as expected. The buffet next door also offers a wider variety of food. A couple of our friends were down for a couple of days with stomach ailments, but that can happen anywhere. All in all, very nice. The entertainment next door was good. The lobby bars close at midnight but the beach bar is open quite late as is the disco. They do charge for drinks at the disco after midnight though. Pool is ok, needs some upgrades, but swim up bar is great, sometimes a little slow if busy. They do seem short of staff here, but they are all vey friendly and helpful. Glad we booked here, probably would try another resort next time, but worth the money.

<Content>Luxurious Peace Booked this hotel as a last minute holiday, hence had very little time to research our options before we booked. The hotel was a class above many of the other hotels in the area (we went exploring and had a little nosey around some other pool/reception areas). The hotel's ground are split with its older sister hotels - this makes for a nice walk in the evening when visitng some of the speciality restaurants.This hotel mainly catered for the Spanish. Most of the evening entertainments was for them, but was in fact quite small comapred to the main events that occured in the sister hotel.The rooms were very nice (split level), we had a slight musty smell when we arrived so the hotel installed a dehumidifier in our room which stayed with us for the week.The room was cleaned daily although initially this did not happen until very late in the afteroon when we were returning from the pool area. A quick word with guest relations resulted in earlier service.The food in the restaurants were very good. The all-inc choice was limited compared to some other hotels we've been to, but the quality was far superior. The speciality restaurants were slightly dissapointing, especially the ones in the other hotel. Superb fish restaurant, don't waste time with the itallian and chinese.Staff very courteus, getting served at the bars was easy and the drinks were of a high quality (fizz also available on request).Pools were clean (and constantly cleaned).Beach was the same as the rest of the area - very nice, and nice to stroll allong - shame there's no sunset visible from this side of the island.If you go with Airtours / MyTravel from the UK you will get a ground floor room - its what's been agreed/contracted for with the hotel.My final thoughts on this hotel compared to the Riu's/Iberostars (which we have prevsiously experienced) is that it is smaller, more relaxed, more luxurious, quieter, better buffets - but am not sure which I prefer. It doesn't get 5/5 as it was lacking something - hard to say what - possible character / identidy - something that was strong in the Riu's for instance.

<Content>Nicest People We just got back from a week at the Princess and I was very impressed with the resort. If you love the beach then this is the place for you. Get VIP and then you can lay on these great beach beds, the lounge chairs and fine too. The pool is very clean and there are little huts for those of you who cannot handle the hot sun all day. The resort as a whole is immaculately clean and the rooms ave very comfortable. I was most impressed with the staff, they make you feel like you are royalty. We tipped a bit and made a point of getting to know some staff and I was sad to say goodbye to them. This is a quiet resort with no kids and no disco but down the street is the sister resort which you have access to and a shuttle goes to and from regularly. My only complaint was the buffet was sometimes not the greatest, there was nothing wrong with it but if you are used to gourmet than you would probably be dissapointed. The A La Carte's were good though. I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for a very clean, beautiful, and relaxing place to vacation. Again, the beach is unreal. White sand and aqua water as far as the eye can see.

<Content>Poor Food We just returned to Canada after 1 week at the Punta Cana Princess resort and are glad to be home. It was listed as a 4 star but the only thing about it that made it this way was the rooms which were the most comfortable we have had in 3 stays in the DR. The beach was great and the pool was nice but the food was horrible. The buffet was the worst I have had in 5 Caribbean trips and made me violently ill one evening which has never happened to me before. The a la carte's were ok but did not make up for the limited poorly prepared buffet. The staff were polite but were understaffed. We did like the entertainment crew but not enough to return to this resort. We will pay the extra money and go to the Gran Bahia Principe or the Grand Paladium Bavaro again, both of these resorts are 2 or more stars better than the Princess.

<Content>I really liked it! I went for the week starting the 30 of december until the th of January 2007. I had a really great time. The food was great, I must have gained pounds. The buffet was varried and the items were fresh and tasty. The lunch time BBQs at the beachside restaurant was fun.... especially yummy was the luncheon Paella party! The a la Carte restaurants were easy to get reservations to and the quality was good. I was actually pleasantly surprised with the Fondue restaurant--yummy. Oh my god the drinks were out of this world. You so have to try the Banana Mamas and the Coco Locos; now I know what heaven tastes like. The pool was great, and the swim up bar was like wow! The only thing is there are some people who stay in the in pool bar all afternoon and don't get out, but where are they peeing!!! lol Another great thing is the fact that there are no kids there, 18+ all the way. the common areas, the pools, the bars are all nice and calm. The bach is super, it is clean and no sea weed, they have people raking it and upkeeping the sand. The animation team is small but they are so full of energy, and they are reall nice people. The best bar is the lobby bar, the bartender to get is Dyanara(? I think thats how you spell it) she is super friendly and nice, she will make you laugh and she puts on a great mini show of her own. The housekeeping staff is oK THEY DO WHAT IS REQUIRED AND NOT MORE, the room is clean but little extras like swan folded towels (like i have grown accustomed to in Cuba are not luxury here). The front desk is ok, not the best customer service but not the worst either. Do not use your credit cards, we had a situation and we used it they were unable to reimburse us, big deal!!! Bring cash good old American dollars or else they try to swindle you ith exchange rates that fluctuate depending on what you are buying and who you are buying from. I loved it and had a great time but then again with the friend that i was with how could i not have the time of my life ;)

<Content>relaxing My husband,daughters ages 12 and 16 and I stayed the week of December 5th,2006. We have been to many islands throughout the carribean, and this was by far the most relaxing. The resort is so vast, that you can easily find your own solitude. There was not really a night life, but then again we are not nightlife people. Tours are available if you want. We did snorkel and parasail and that was fun. The food is what you would expect in a poor country. Remember you are not in the states. Breakfast was great every morning on the beach. It consisted of eggs anyway you want , omelets, and great variety of breads and fruit. The coffee was strong and the milk is Goats milk, but you get used to it.Lunch we had again at the beach every day. Frenchfries hotdogs hamburgers and a great variety of hot dishes. My husband loved the salads, but there was no dressings only oil and balsamic vinegar. So remember to bring your own, he wished he did. For dinner we tried most of the restaurants. Chopin was an Excellent buffet, Italian was good, and The Steak house was excellent. The Seafood was so so. Remember you can always go to the buffet and eat if you are still hungry. The dinner buffet in the lobby has just about everthing you could want. Great hot entrees (some were strange like rabbit and bob white but hey you are on vacation BE DARING), a pasta station, salads, fruits and great deserts. The rooms were clean staff was great and super friendly. The language is mostly spanish, hardly any english, so brush up on your common phrases. My 16 year old loved the bartenders because they kept giving her alcohol in her drinks, so watch that with the kids. The beaches were beautiful and spotless. Get a hut at at least 8 am or they are gone. Also most of the guests were European, so remember is is not uncommon to be topless.Some extra tips1. Don't expect to get an American paper, there is none.2. When you turn your beach towels in get new ones for the next day. The Towel cabana doesn't open till 9am.3.Bring perscription Lomotil for diarrhea. Goats milk can be rough.4 . Be prepared to barter when shopping. They are very pushy and never give them what they say start at half or less.5 HAVE FUN AND RELAX!!!!!

<Content>Great Value Just got back from 2 weeks at the Punta Cana Princess ( Dec. 5 to 19) and thought I would share my findings with anyone looking for reviews. We had a great holiday. Along with the fact the resort is a little smaller (at 270+ rooms) than some and is adult only (according to staff this may change back in Feb.) it is a very quiet and relaxing setting. On the other hand, if you want more action  activity, you have the option to go next door to 2 large sister resorts and use the amenities and restaurants there. The rooms, resort, pool and beach are kept very clean.The food is fairly typical what you find in most D.R. resorts but plentiful and lots of variety. One would be hard pressed to not find something they like. The D.R. often gets a bad rap for people getting sick on the food or whatever but my own observation is that it is generally over consumption of sun, alcohol,  food, in that order. As is the case with traveling to any strange country, you might get thrown off a bit (and yes, I do) but this can be minimized if you 鈥渆ase into it鈥?slowly and don鈥檛 go at it too hard at the start.The staff is great. While predominantly Spanish, they always seem to be able to communicate or will get someone that can. One has to empathize that they are dealing with English, French, German, and a host of other languages. Most important, they are a friendly (if you are) courteous, congenial people who seem happy to do for you what ever they can. I tip the occasional dollar out of appreciation (and also because they don鈥檛 receive gratuities as most operators suggest in their brochures) but it is not necessary in order to receive good service. A smile and simple 鈥済racias鈥?will go along way.The beach is rated by some travel magazines in the top 10 beaches in the world for a good reason. It is white, wide and long.To summarize, the 5 star rating by some operators might be a bit of a stretch but it is definitely 4+. Good bang for the buck. Go and enjoy your holiday.

<Content>Absolutely fab!! The Punta Cana Princess is a fine example of a really good all inclusive package. We arrived as a large group, check in was as swift as it could possibly be, bell boys take your suitcase, I thoughtthe hotel was well signposted so you could find your room easily. We were in block 1000, close to bars and pools slightley further to the beach.Granted, not all the restaurants are as we would expect at home, but we aren't at home,we are in the Carribean, and a very poor area of it, so taking that into consideration the food was excellent. My favourite restaurant was Mama Mia at the Caribe and the Rio Grande at the PCP. Avoid the fondue restaurant, the food is not good and you end up raiding the buffet afterwards!!The pool area was extensive and kept spotlessley clean. All of the bars were kept well stocked (except they kept running out of tonic water!!) and drinks were kept flowing. Soon as you put one down another replaced it!!The beach is breathtakingly beautiful, and is cleaned daily. There are very few beach sellers that come an pester you, you have to really invite them as security guards keep a low presence.As we were only there for a week we only did one trip, which we booked through the watersports center, it was a day on a catamaran, swimming off the reef with tropical fish (fantastic) onto a large inflatable slide (way down the beach from the pcp)(my husband loved it!) and then swimming with sharks and rays (again fab) Then lunch was salads and burgers (simple but good) and onto a lagoon, we were provided with a floating bar and as much rum and coke as we could drink. Altogether a wonderful day.Our only problem was on the 6th night there was an almighty tropical storm and our bathroom ceiling caved in !! We were moved to an identical room oppsite and other than the inconvience of having to repack, all was dealt with quickley and satisfactorily.The entertainment staff are a credit to the hotel, having so many nationalities in one place it could have been difficult but it was done with such enthusism you couldnt help but get caught up in it all. The barman in the lobby bar was a mad as a box of frogs and kept us entertained well into the early hours.All in all, a great holiday, highly reccomended to all travellers.

<Content>ideal for a relaxing holdiay RACHEL  JAY GREEN LIVERPOOL ENGLANDwhat can i say! This was the best holiday i have ever been on.Me and my Husband (age 24, 23) arrived here on 30 Aug 2006 For 2 weeks and loved it. Our hotel room was lovely and i could not believe the size of the bed it was massive!!! This hotel is so clean it is unbelievable i have never been to one like it before. The pool is also cleaned twice daily and was really nice, not to hot or cold just right. here is a little list on what we thought of this holidayFOOD-some people would have a moan about the food and i honestly dont know why. Breakfast was so good, you had so much to choose from it was my favorite time of the day.Lunchtime was the worst, the buffet selection for lunch was not good, me and mu Husband used to go to the beach bar for lunch which is part of the hotel and right on the beach. It serves burgers, pizza, chips stuff like that. Whilst on our stay we went to three of the restaurants which i must say werent great. Tex Mex was quite nice,the best out of the three. Chinese was apalling and Italian was worse.The buffett at night was quite good and that was were we eat most nights. The Spaghetti dishes in the Buffett put the Italian to shame.Night Life-this was virtually none existent at the PCP you had to go to the hotel next door for the show and the disco, this was no problem what so ever as the little bus(golf cart) comes every 15 mins and it takes 3 mins to get to the hotel. The shows were not our cup of tea as when the people on stage would talk to the audience it was in so many different languages you got really confused. When thay did speak English you could not understand a word that was said.the night club was ok, we went there 2 times and had a good little boogy. The beach bar in the PCP was our little local and it was really nice sitting there of a night time, the breeze was lovely and it was nice to just chill and have a few weeks.Overall-even tough some of the restaurants were not very nice it did not put us of our holiday, this is a lovely hotel and the staff are lovely too. Anyone one going to PCP will enjoy it and it is for all age groups, Me and my husband would deffinetly go back to Punta cana, and i would certainley recommend this hotel.

<Content>It was good for relaxing but the food wasn't My Husband and I (We are newlyweds) went to DR and stayed at the PCP July 26th - August 3rd, 2006.The rooms were nice - we got block 5000 - it's a must if your staying there - it's by the pool and beach and has ocean view.The people are friendly as can be - Dominican Time translation 10 minutes can mean an hour - things are slow paced there. The grounds and the rooms were always kept clean. Weather great! Beach Great! We did the snorkeling tour and it was nice.The downside - THE FOOD IS NOT GOOD! You can eat it but it's not good -breakfasts were better than the rest of the day's meals for sure. Room Service Menu is very limited and the food on it stinks. The pool is big, beautiful and clean - wasn't crazy about the way the staff takes monkeys on leash's for the people to take pictures with - the monkeys are treated badly.Rio Grand - we ate there twice the food was better there. You have to make reservations MUCH MUCH in advance or forget it! Do all your reservations the first day you get there! Italian Restaurant was horrible (Mama Mia or something like that)Seafood wasn't that good either. Buffet or Rio Grand - whenever we went to another place to eat we would end up going to the buffet anyway cause we were starved! It wasn't a bad vacation but we wouldn't go again.

<Content>PCP Very Good Experience My daughter and I just returned from a trip to Punta Cana.We loved thePCP. I was a little aprehensive reading past reviews,but our experience was wonderful.The room was large and clean. We stayed in the 5000 block,so we had a lovely view of the beach and ocean. The resortis very well kept, the pool was large and not crowded. Thebuffet had a great variety of different foods, so even if youate there regularly, you had many options. We only triedthe italian restaurant ( did not like it), and Rio Grande ( tex-mex)which was very good.We were very careful about the water, and we had no problemsat all. The weather was hot but very breezy. The ocean waterwas a little rough and murky ( due to the seaweed), but wasstill very enjoyable. The beach and pool have a large quantityof palapas and chairs. I never had a problem getting a good spot.Staff is very friendly ( single girls sometimes receive too muchunwanted attention from the male staff).Overall a very good experience, excellent place to relax.

<Content>Don't Waste Your Money We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess in the Dominican Republic just recently and it was the worst vacation of our lives! Seven out of the eight people were all violently ill with vomiting and diarrhea and the staff was unfriendly most of the time. We tried this resort for the first time, and we WILL NEVER go back. Our entire trip was ruined. The food at the buffet was HORRIBLE - Don't waste your hard earned money! Many other people were sick as well - they can keep the princess!

<Content>Clean, friendly  July 8,2006 2 weeks in beautiful Punta Cana. The resort is kept immaculate. Of course all the workers are friendly  helpful, expecially Carlos one of the animators, he always came over to say hello and to ask about our daughter who he included in all the games and shows. (She is 17). The best thing was eating at the specialty restaurants. You need to make a reservation in the morning, but it never costs you extra and you can go to the other resorts as well. Book early (8:00am) We always ate at 6:30 and were usually the only ones in the restaurant until 8:00pm. TEX MEX Grill ...Awesome! Mama Mia.....great pizza  lasagna  soups. Tipping is always enjoyable for us so we bring $150.00 in $1 US bills and tip everyone from the conceirge, maid, porter, bar tender, lady who comes around with coffee at breakfast etc. We also bring old clothes, toys, candy, toiletries, medical supplies and make-up to give to the people who work at the hotel. They truly appreciate it and always give us special attention. Everything about the hotel was great. We never had to put towels on a chair to reserve a spot, there are plenty at the beach and the pool. It is great to have the trolley to take you around the 3 properties even if you just go for a ride after dinner.Beautiful spot for a Wedding if your looking they have it right on the beach in a Gazebo with palm covered arches leading the way with flowers and covered chairs with bows. The bride is brought in on a horse drawn large white carriage. No Complaints.

<Content>Heaven here on earth!!!!! My daughter and I booked this trip a few days before going. We couldn't have made a better choice. The people that worked at the PCP were very friendly and efficient. We were waited on hand and foot with such beautiful smiles. They really went out of their way to make sure we had a great holiday!!!!We took lots of US one dollar bills for tips and they were very much appreciated. Many people did not tip and the staff still gave everyone excellent service. We especially loved the fillet mignon at the Tex Mex Restaurant. The theme nights at the buffet were excellent. We couldn't believe how much variety there was at the buffet during the week. On our last night there we enjoyed the Beach party or Dominicana night. It was heavenly to sit on the beach with the cool ocean breeze, sip Banana Mamas and eat such delicious food. We enjoyed the excursion to Dolphin Island. Although the one macaw tried to eat my daughter and she got quite a pinch on her shoulder. Swimming with the dolphins was a lot of fun. We also went on the sunset horseback riding excursion which was amazing. We got to explore some natural areas along the beach that hadn't been invaded by resorts. After an hour they stopped to give the horses a break and one of the guys climbed a tree and brought down coconuts for everyone. It was nice to have the opportunity to taste the milk. The resort couldn't have been cleaner. In the mornings the staff actually scrub the walkways. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and they had a ton of lounge chairs under grass umbrellas.

<Content>Punta Cana, Yes! Bravara Princess Never Again! This was my 4th time in Punta Cana  I find it a beautiful island country with friendly people  I hope someday they will be able to afford to live in comfort. However, this time the resort was way below every other one I've been to. The Apple catalog advertises it as a 5 apple. I was talked into going to it because the travel agent said it was on sale. I had another resort in mind. On the way there, the apple rep told us it was not a 5, maybe a 4. In any case, it was so large you're always on a shuttle to get somewhere. We had been in Punta Cana at the same time 4 yrs earlier at another resort (our weding was there)  my husband picked gorgeous flowers for my bouquet. This resort was neat, but no flowers! The food was disappointing, even though I didn't gain as much weight as I had feared, when I'm on vacation, I want good food! Even the ala carte restaurants were lacking. The drinks were VERY weak! When tips are included, you shouldn't have to flash $ to get a decent drink. I'm on vacation  not driving for gosh sakes! When you think you're getting a suite really you are getting more sitting room, which is not necessary when you're on a beach vacation! We had more amenities at the airport hotel in Cleveland. The beach was beautiful  you make the best of it--after all, it's vacation! But I would NEVER recommend this resort!

<Content>Loved It! My husband and our kids stayed at the PCP, from June 27 to July 11th and it was AMAZING! There was always something to do, like getting a massage, going touring, snorkeling, lying and lazying around on the beach, swimming in the HUGE pool, pigging out at the restaurants, visiting and having and wild night at the casino, walking down the beach and buying some souvenirs, at night time walk down the beach and look at the beautiful view and plenty more. The hotel was always clean! Beds made, Bathrooms fixed, ect.. Whenever we left our room, when we came back it was clean. The room service was quick and great too. The food was pretty good. There were some time's that the food wasn't the right temperature. For example what should be hot was warm or cold, and what should be cold was hot or warm. But that happened rarely, not to often. On the other hand, most of the restaurants were clean and had great food! Definantley recommend the italin cuisine and the Tex Mex. Chinese food buffet had a lot of variety, something different for everyone's taste. The snack bar had a lot of variety too. The swim up bar had great service, recommend you visit it more than once.  The beach and pool left me speechless! In the morning the beach would be cleaned and at night. The pool was clean and not to crowded. Before I went to the resort I thought that there was no way I could go to the pool because it would be packed with people and if you swan you would bunp into someone constantly. But I was wrong. There was always room everywhere, on the beach and pool. Probably because most of the people there are trying the activities most of the time. Definantley recommend scuba diving with sharks. It was so fun! The sharks were pretty friendly, although I didn't go near to many of them.  The massage was so soothing. I live in the busy world of sitting on a computer all day and being stressed all the time. While being massaged I forgot about everything. The masseuse I had was really good!  The hotel has a club for kids and teens. My 16 year old daughter had a great time going to the teen clubs. I felt comfortable knowing it was supervised. My son who is 8 went to the kids club and had a blast! He still talks about it! While our kids were at these clubs that left me and my husband alone. Alone for a romantic night. We would go to a restaurant, and walk on the quiet moonlite beach. Then go to the hotel and have some a lone time. Something we've both been to busy to have. Then our kids come bac and tell us about their night. The staff was kind, accomodating, and more than willing to cater to your every need. A few words of advice and some reccommendations...:- Don't go to the casino often, maybe once on your whole trip.- Go scuba diving! A lot of fun!!- Make sure you don't miss out on the Tex Mex, Chinese and Italian restaurant! Highly recommend it.- Don't waste a moment there because you won't want to leave, and when you do you feel you should have used that moment better!- Take walks, clears your mind of stress... trust me!!- Tips are not needed to be left, I did, but some of my money was returned... This is a resort I would recommend to families of 4 or 5 the most, and hneymooners. Very romantic and fun.

<Content>Will not return Stayed at the Princess resort for 6 days in May and although the resort was beatiful and well maintained they have some serious flaws. 1-Hardly anything is done or spoken in English. How can you understand songs or entertainment when everything is in spanish, even the poolside entertainment.2-None of the restrarants are air-conditioned, they try but when you walk out with sweat dripping everywhere, it makes for a bad dining experience.3-Beware at the buffets, especially the main one. While wating for it open for lunch one day I watched as these birds walked along the salad bar helping themselves. Do not eat anything unless it's cooked!!! and Yes we both got sick. You have to bring your own ketsup and salad dressing.4-Don't know why you can never get reservations in the restruants since they are never more than 1/2 full.5-Found out after 3-4 days that you have to ask for liquor in your frozen drinks. This was only after waving a tip in the air.6-upgrade to platium service. It is well worth the small amount they charge.7-You are warned not to go outside the front gate. it is definetley a third world country.had somebody tell me he wanted my camera at the little Plaza outside the front entrance. Lucky for me a policeman was walking by because we quickly left and ran across the street to safety.8-The casino, a joke spent every bit of 5 minutes in there and luckly only lost 5 dollars.9-Don't even ask for a ocean view room. There are not any. Did hear the honey mooners had a decent view.Well I could go on forever but I'm sure you get my point. They do not like Americans and our next vacation will be back at Cancun where they appreciate everything you do for them.

<Content>2yrs in a row and still love it!! Above all I have to say the service was awesome!!!! Anything you want or need the staff was more than willing to show you where to get it or even get it for you!! The staff was very attentive to every need! We did the Vip package and it was worth it. With the Vip pk. you get a free massage, free room service, and domestic beers (budweiser), plus more! The resort is on the smaller side compared to some of the others. However, it was very well manicured and relaxing. No nightclubs on this resort makes for less night traffic in and out. The other princesss resorts next door have nightclubs that you can take a trolley over to. The pool bar service was great! It does get crowded at times but the bartender does a good job getting to everyone!

<Content>"Going back", and bringing more friends. From start to finish was a pleasure, the people from the resort were outstanding. service was perfect in all ways; the food in buffets, (very good), the food at the resturants, (excellent) we had the VIP package which I suggest anyone get when visisting. night life was great, the bar in the lobby was very fun. during the days on the beach Edwardo treated us all like we were family.  Rooms were kept clean buffets were well stocked, we weren't even on the plane home and started to plan the next trip. there were 6 of us this year and now we have 26 going next year.  Relaxing and carefree, Met alot of interesting people from all over the world, and the staff in all of the areas were awesome great people!!!. Beaches were clean w/white sand and clear blue water. I think we have found the perfect get away that is affordable clean and fun. can't wait until January.

<Content>Wonderful Resort for Relaxing Vacation Just got home from a vacation at Punta Cana All-Suites Resort and spa. Stayed from June 26 to July 3rd. Went with my husband and 2 children (3  12 y.o.) . Went to Punta Cana last year. We stayed then at Breezes. We enjoyed both locations, but PCPrincess is a muched more relaxed location. There are only about 250 rooms compared to Breezes with over 700. There were fewer activities for the kids, but they could do the kids club. Additionally, if you book the VIP service you have access to the other two resorts next door owned by Princess. They have many more activities. However you will notice the difference when you visit there. It is quite busy and loud. It is was too noisy compared to PCPrincess. We only went over there to go to La Cava italian restaurant (excellent).The beach at this location were absolutely beautiful. We were able to walk in either direction to the local vendors. This was fun, but they are very aggressive. I am not the type that enjoys a tough negotiation (I felt they got annoyed when you didn't buy). Only go if you are up for the challenge of trying to negotiate a bargan. Most of the time I felt I was being ripped off. Still they had some nice jewelry, and beach cover-ups we wore the entire stay. The beach offers all types of water sports, banana boat, snorkeling, parasailing, etc. We chose to relax at the beach. You can buy sand toys at the PCPrincess Minimarket, $9 US. The kids liked the pool the best. We could barely get them out. We were there from 9am to 5pm most days. They loved it. Rooms were clean and of good size. Checkin was smooth.Food was good. It is not what you are commonly used to eating at home. We made the most of it. They were more than willing to try to accomodate any special requests. As a matter of fact they brought out an entire cake for my son's 3rd birthday while we dined at the Tex Mex restaurant. They turned down the lights and sang with music piped in to the whole restaurant. It was lovely. We did have a few bad stomach days. Not sure if this is due to the food or the water. We didn't get sick the last time we were in Punta Cana. We would definately go back. Had a great stay. We heard from another traveler, however, that the resort is going adults only Nov. 1. Too bad for us with kids. Have fun!

<Content>First Class - Well Almost! We booked a week at this resort flying from Manchester. The other guests were mainly American with a few Europeans. We loved it! It was clean and everyone was really friendly the rooms are big and nicley furnished. The food was good especially the Chinese restaurant. The buffet is always a good bet but the restaurants are a hit or a miss not awful just not always great.There is a VIP package you can arrange on arrival I would say if you want room service and you like diving go for it otherwise why bother you get a mini bar with soft drinks water and beer as standard and there is a 24 hour snack bar.We found it no problem to get a sun bed at the beach or by the pool even as late as 12 noon. Definately investigate the other hotels the disco is good and the Casino not bad. The only thing that got a bit much was the Bingo every night at reception!This was our second trip to the Dominican and we would highly recommend this hotel bear in mind this is a third world country and things are maybe not as 'polished' as you would expect back home. We would book this hotel again ideal for total relaxation!!

<Content>Fifty fifty Stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from 19th to 27th June 2006.On check in we were told they had no booking for us and blamed our tour operator. Our tour operator later blamed the hotel. Eventually we got our rooms.The accomodation was ok. Big, well furnished rooms that had a musty smell. This was explained by the flooding of our rooms on the ground floor a couple of days into our stay. We left a tip for the maid most days but found we actually got a better service when we hadn't left any money. Go figure.We thought the food was pretty foul in the restaurants but the buffet was bloody good throughout the weeks stay and cant fault it (Gala night was great).The female staff were friendly and polite but the majority of the male employees were unfriendly. We experimented with the bar attendant at the beach bar who was really rude for the duration of our stay. We got our wallet out at the bar one time and the next thing he was high-fiving us.The drinks were good, but you coudn't get to the pool bar due to the american contingent that set up camp there for the week. The pool was good and very clean, with not too much competition for sun loungers.The beach was breathtaking and really hot. We visted some of the other hotels which we found to be much busier than the Punta Cana Princess and not as landscaped. Had a massage which was really great and you can haggle them down too. Went swimming with sharks and rays at the Marineaquarium but be warned that they turn this excusion into some kind of ibiza party, nightmare trip with awful music and irritating staff. The sharks and rays are good though so go for that experience at least. We heard that the safari excusion was total crap where you visit an authentic Dominican household where all the kids have no shoes but each has a brand new mobile phone.The last thing is that there's the photographers that go around each day with snakes, parrots, monkies and iguanas. This is cruel and we saw him hold the monkey out over the pool by a leash as a joke. I dont know why people condone these guys by having their photo taken with them each day. Shameful.

<Content>Beach is the best I've seen My husband and I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Princess Hotel - Punta Canathe week of June 17-24 2006.The very Bad news is that I got very sick (symptoms of food poisoning) andhad to have the Doctor come to the room to administer meds through an IV.I was in bed for 2 days and didn't feel well until the 4th day of vacation.Many people were sick at this hotel. Not sure if sickness was due to the food, water or stomach virus. * I had Never been so sick**I didn't drink the water but did have a Pina Colada which had crushed ice in it.The beach is beautiful here, service was good, room was clean and nice butI wouldn't go back due to sickness.(I had read the reviews before we left and knew some people had gotten sickso I was trying to be careful)

<Content>Wonderful and Relaxing If you are looking for a beautiful hotel, large, spacious rooms with sitting area and balconey then this hotel is excellent. Very inexpensive all-inclusive. Grounds are well groomed and maintainted. The ocean is clear-blue; beaches are white, warm and wonderful with a cooling breeze (it's quite hot with out it). If you are going to the Dominican for a culinary experience-- don't. The buffets are good: The fruits and vegetables are fresh. The meat and fish was always dry and slightly tough. Breads, pateries, cakes and ice cream were okay but little flavor. Lunch meat was fine, but the cheese is not good. Three restaurants on premises were hit or miss; same goes for the five restaurants at it's sister resort next door which is much larger and much, much busier.Tex-mex: good entrees, not apps2 Italian: non-meat filled pasta is good with any of the saucesChinese: horrible all around, except the fried ice creamDominican: by far the best of all. As the saying goes : When in Rome, do as the Romans.If you are looking for a relaxing, uneventful holiday with lots of sun then this is the place. My wife and I would definately go back.

<Content>Good place to lose weight My sister and I (both seniors) just returned from a week at Punta Cana Princess...We were very disappointed with the food.Our accomodations were acceptable, but the resort, while beach front, goes very deep so from the main lobby to the beach is a walk of at least 2 city blocks.Beach towels are only available at the activities center on the beach, so if you are only going to the pool it is a long walk for a towel.Our sheets were not changed for 5 days and only after we requested the service.We were told if we wanted our sheets changed we should strip the bed!!!!!We ate at the Rio Grand for Tex Mex...it was the best food we had all week, but the Cesaer salad was made with head lettuce and swimming in dressing.We also went to the Oriental Restaurant...the worst food we had all week, altho' it was a l carte, we really could not order from the menu, the courses were just delivered.Nice beach, friendly staff, lots of birds and mosquitoes.

<Content>Nothing could be better We stayed at the BP May 21-28th. We went platinum and our room was 2 minutes from the beach. Upon arrival the perfect vacation began. Rooms were fabulous, service at both the bars and restaurants were exceptional and of course the beach - well what can I say this was our second time to Bavaro Beach and it has to be the most beautiful beach in the Caribbean. The weather was hot hot hot - not one drop of rain. I was down on the beach at 7:30 every morning to get our Palapa (not supposed to but everyone else does) and we stayed on the beach until around 4PM. Never saw the pool. Arrived back at our room and would call room service for bottle(s) of wine and beer (no charge for platinum guests) and within 5 minutes they arrived- ice bucket- glasses etc. Sitting out on the balcony overlooking the ocean and gardens - what more could one say for a more idyllic setting. The only small disappointment I had was with the food. We mostly ate in the buffet restaurant as all other of the restaurants required the men to wear long pants (I really think dress shorts would have been suffice) and when the temp is 95 in the evening it is really not fair to the men. We ate at Licey and it was so so - was supposed to be airconditioned but was not. The Piano bar in the main lobby was beautiful. We also ate at Bella Pasta one night and the food they served was the same as what you could get at the Pasta bar in the buffett restaurant in the lobby and the service at Bella was very rushed. Other than that, 5 thumbs up for El Gaucho in the morning for breakfast. Made to order omelets a glass of wine and toast and sitting outside overlooking the beach - heaven.All in all we had a great time and would recommend this resort to anyone.Ola

<Content>Awesome Awesome would go back every vacation My husband and I stayed at the PCP FROM APRIL 21ST TO THE 28TH FOR OUR HONEYMOON. I CAN DEFINATELY SAY IT WAS THE BEST VACATION WE HAVE EVER HAD. The hotel was amazing and the service was exceptional. The VIp package is definately worth it even if only for the room service. This was better then the buffet. We ate at all resteraunts at the PCP and at the Princess Bavaro. The best resteraunt was at The Tex Mex Steak House at the punta cana princess resort. The service was amazing and food was better then home. The resort was clean and everyone was friendly even the groundskeeping. There was plenty of entertainment both daily and nightly. It was also very quiet and romantic at the same time. Please don`t listen to any bad reviews about this hotel. It is awesome and definately a perfect honeymoon spot.

<Content>Beautiful Honeymoon First of i would like to say to all the soon to be honeymooners reading this- STOP READING REVIEWS! I say this becuase i did the same thing, i read every review and made myself insane... Dont worry pick a place based on the location trips they offer and accomodation, and leave the rest alone! Believe me you'll have a great time....Now for my review...The Punta Cana Princess is amazing, the grouds are beautiful and the people are amazing.. Its a great place to stay for a honeymoon you can have peace and quiet at the Punta Cana and enjoy the lively atmosphere and shows at the sister hotel the Tropical and the Caribe..Do some excursions, they are alot of fun... all in all nothing bad to say, your on vacation, lay back and relax enjoy and have a great time, and if you go say hello to Gladys in the lobby bar, she's so sweet!

<Content>Great place to relax! We traveled to the PCP from May 5-May 11, 2006. A family affair, myself, my sister and her son, who is 13. Having read almost every review, we went with the VIP package - definitely a must! Well worth the $60 pp for the week. We were in 5207 - right by the pool and the beach with a fantastic view overlooking the property and beach. The room was very spacious with a vaulted ceiling, two queen beds, and the living area with the trundle bed and TV, not to forget the balcony. If you're a smoker, you're definitely not in the US. You can smoke almost anywhere you like in DR. ( Even the airport). As a guest of PCP, you also had access to the Caribe and the Tropical, we hit on the Caribe for the buffett one night, the La Cava, and the Sombrero. First, the hotel is very clean, both inside and out. We left small items for the maid in the AM with a few dollars and had everything we needed. We found out on our next to last night that you actually have 2 maids for your room. One in the morning and one in the evening for turn down etc. We were only leaving items for the day maid, and aplogized to the evening maid for not knowing. Gave her a few dollars once we realized our error. The staff, in general, were extremely helpful and friendly. They definitely remember you when you have tipped them a dollar or two! I did find, however, that it definitely helpful if you speak spanish. There is a trolley that goes from each sister hotel if you perfer not to walk, but it is also extremely difficult to know where to go as the maps at the PCP are not legible. Once you're in the Caribe, to find your way back is a maze! There are no posted maps and while they have arrows pointing you to different places, find one first! The not so great - the food, most definitely. Breakfast was the best buffet meal at the PCP. Don't expect an American hot dog or pizza! At lunch, the freshly cooked chicken or pork cutlets were your best bet, the rest of the food was not kept hot when it was a hot dish. The Caribe had a buffet that was almost three times the size of PCP. Definitely worth going to one night, otherwise, do the a la carte. With the VIP package you can schedule your dinner reservations ahead of everyone else. We did the La Cava and the Sombrero at Caribe. Unless you like a lot of heat, stay away from the Sombrero and their menu was misleading. The La Cava was great! At the PCP they have the Tex-Mex which we went to twice - great beef! The filet mignon was excellent.The casino - let's say I went every night - came home a winner a few times, but as with most casinos, they want your money and they will get it. Met a couple of really nice people, and a few hard-core gamblers who need to realize this is a vacation resort - not Atlantic City or Vegas.The market by the Red Tower Casino - let's say I didn't buy much on the island. Found their prices too high, even if I did barter it down. I don't particularly care when I'm followed around or coerced into someone's store. You find it in one, it's in all the others. I bought another bottle of rum and a box of cigars at one place, only because I wasn't harrassed when I walked in to look around.Overall, the location was excellent, very quiet at night. Security was around and checked that you were a guest at that specific hotel before you went through the lobby. You have access to the other hotels if you want to party, or you can stay in to relax. If I ever decide to go back, would I stay at this hotel - most definitely.

<Content>Puta Cana Princess - Excellent Place To Stay My wife and myself stayed at the Punts Cana Princess the last week in April 2006 We made the right choice and took the Platinum Club option. Check in was at the Platinum Club lounge. It was easy and no line ups to get in. This lounge featured breakfast and drinks throught the day everyday. The Platinum club rooms are all down clost to the beac and pool. The shuttle around the grounds is great but we did not have to use it to go to the beach or pool. because we were right there. The dinners at the ala-carte restaurants were the best. We are both fifty and have travelled throught the Carribean. This is one of the best all-inclusives that we have stayed. A1TWTT@aol.com

<Content>Thank you Trip Advisor authors - place was awesome... This was our first trip to the Carribean and our first all-inclusive resort and we could not have been more pleasantly surprised with the Punta Cana Princess. The resort was beautiful, clean and just the right size for a relaxing family vacation. The rooms were larger than expected and the friendliness and attitude of the entire staff was EXCELLENT...it made the trip. The beach is beautiful and the food selection, quality and availability were very good also. It was hard to think of a complaint and we hated to leave - we will be back. Try a 'Punta Cana Princess drink at one of the bars - it quickly became a family favorite! Thanks to everyone who wrote reviews on the PCP as it was the sole reason we chose this resort over other properties.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess Just OK No major problems, but not real impressed.VIP - A great deal for the right price, but be careful. Loved the massages, dinner at La Cava, and some of the other benefits. Here's the problem. The Travel Agent couldn't get it in advance, PCP told them it wasn't available. Price quoted in advance by the TA was $50 per person. Travel agent suggested asking at check in. We did and INSTANTLY were told fine, it was $17 per day per person, which came to $68 each, which was still a good deal. If you do it this way, GET IT IN WRITING. At checkout, they tried to bill us something over $100 per person. Luckily, the person who checked us in was there and remembered what she quoted us and said they would fix it, but it took over AN HOUR to get a manager to do that. We had to enlist the help of our contact from Coco Tours, who was GREAT (see more on that below). So it worked out fine, but was a big hassle. Felt a little like a scam.The Room - you MUST get the top floor with vaulted ceilings. Gives the room a much more spacious feeling. The layout is fine, but the 'suite' description is bunk. The 'sitting area' is great if you have kids, it is really a trundle bed, and is VERY uncomfortable as a sofa. Room is very clean, no bugs. The Property - beautiful, very well maintained.Beach - positively beautiful, the best. Very limited equipment for 'non motorized water sports', we have had much more available at other resorts. Also limited choices for the 'one motorized' that is included with the VIP. We chose the catamaran and it was great because there was a staff member to steer. The other choices were with groups, one is riding a big 'banana' that is sort of a thrill ride, we watched and they always went very fast and knocked people off. Probably fun for the spring break crowd, but not for us.The Staff - all super friendly, not one will walk past you without a cheerful Hola.The Bars - the bartenders were not trained to do anything well except pour beer. The worst Pina Coladas I ever drank. We stuck to Bloody Marys or Margueritas, thinking they were 'standard' and couldn't be messed up. Those drinks were OK, but almost EVERY time, they were OUT of some ingredient, and had to hike somewhere to get something while we waited. Pain in the you know what.The Food - the buffet was fine, not great but more than sufficient. It does get a little boring every day. What saves it is the omelets to order at breakfast, carving stations at lunch and dinner, those things were the best. The Italian restaurant was just OK, the cheese bread there was fabulous. La Cava over at the Caribe was GREAT, order the lobster which is included as part of the VIP, it's twin lobster tails and was great. Bread at La Cava was good too. Funny, while the bread was SO good at the speciality restaurants, there's a BIG bread station at the buffet, which was worthless, nothing but various white breads - boring!!!Casino - awful, the worst, don't bother.Guest Services - wish I could remember her name, she was delightful and very helpful with dinner reservations, which was part of the VIP deal. You MUST make your first reservation as soon as you arrive, they have some system where they turn them in WAY in advance, so be aware of that.Entertainment - almost non-existent at PCP. Hubby went to the Caribe, and entertainment there was inconsistent. Once it was awful, he said everyone was walking out. Another time he went, he said it was pretty good.Bottom line - we would not stay there again.PS - we traveled with Vacation Express on Xtra Airways from Sanford FL, it was GREAT and I will definitely use them again. $50 bucks per person gets you upgraded to First Class, with free drinks and FOOD (sandwich or great chicken caeser salad). They were on time in both directions. The transfers in PC were through Coco Tours, and our 'guide' was Domaso and he was OUTSTANDING. He was at the hotel every day, just to be helpful. We didn't book any tours, but he didn't care. He was very helpful with the VIP overbilling problem that I mentioned in the beginning. We were really appreciative of his assistance with that mess.

<Content>peaceful, restful holiday Several mothers and their senior high school daughters visited this lovely place over Easter and spring break. We all had a wonderful time. We upgraded to the VIP package which was well worth it. The staff at this facility is unbelievable! We have never seen people work so hard and be so pleasant all of the time. They are also very helpful. It is amazing that they can take care of people that speak so many different languages too. They don't make much money, so we tipped them regularly. The beach is very beautiful and the water sports available are lots of fun. The water is shallow and clear quite a ways out. The pool was also very nice and like everything else, very clean. There are bars everywhere offering free drinks of all kinds. There are also many restaurants. You can always find something to eat, but we felt this was the only area that was lacking. The food seemed to appeal to the Europeans, but the Americans......we just didn't care for most of it. The Italian restaurant was pretty good. The cheesy bread and the pizzas are ok. Also the chef at the morning buffet made eggs to order. The french fries and grilled chicked are pretty good. Our girls lived on room service, which is free with VIP. There is very little shopping, t-shirts, caps, necklaces, trinkets. There is a casino, we never went. and a discoteque, our girls went every night. The spa turned out to be fabulous!!!! We all loved it! Our Punta Cana, Princess All Suites experience was a good one. Cincinnati, Oh.

<Content>Beautiful Setting, Terrible Food! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess in August of 2005. The trip was amazing but there were a few things about the resort that were not so great.First of all let me start of with the GOOD:The resort location was beautiful! Though small, the resort was very cozy and convinient to get around on because it was very small. The pool was warm and spacious. The beach was incredible, not a rock in the sand, and the water was glorious; hot and clear. There was never a problem getting a chair at the beach or the pool. The weather was great all week, very HOT and it never rained. We had the benefit of using the facilities at the other two resorts, which was great, and they were easy to get to. Reservations were never hard to make at the restaurants and the food was much better than at the buffets.The best part of our vacation was the wonderful people we met. In our first five minutes we met a couple from Toronto, Steve and Keisha, who we spent the whole week with and now we're planning our next vacation together. What a BONUS! Along with others, such as the nicest couple from Florida, Pete and Lynne, who we had a great time chatting with in the water.Now, for the BAD:Check in was quick but we got a double bed room and they did not accomodate us by changing it to a King size bed. Then they brought the wrong luggage to our room. The rooms were nice, but felt dirty, sometimes even stunk, so that wasn't to pleasant and of course the worst part about the rooms was that the balcomy doors did not lock!The food was awful! We all lost weight because we barely ate, we lived mostly on fruits (Mango and salt, as our new friends reccomended) The drinks were OK...but nothing special. The nightlife was horrible....there was nothing to do. The disco was not even worth going to and that was pretty much the only option. So we ended up sitting at the beach bar or lobby most nights, with very few people there. The casino was usually empty and pretty far, so there was no reason to go there either.There was also nothing to buy, there were a few shops but there was nothing worth spending your money on, and they were also extremely over priced!Oh....and if you like to relax and be left alone on the beach, don't count on it, because we were constantly taken away by the resort staff to go dancing on the beach or take pictures....so watch out for them, because they will get you!This was our first trip to the Carribean, and I have to say that I would absolutely return to Punta Cana, because it was stunning! But I would not go back to the Punta Cana Princess. We had a great time, mostly because we met such fantastic people but if you are looking for luxury and delicious exotic fruits, this is not the place to go!Happy Travelling Everyone!Martyna and AndrewToronto

<Content>Very Nice My husband and I have been to Punta Cana three times (we have stayed at the RIU Palace and Sunscape the Beach), this time we decided to tried the Punta Cana Princess (4/1/06-4/8/06). We upgraded to a VIP status and definitely suggest everyone to do the same. First, as a VIP the Tropical Princess and the Caribe resorts were also yours to use (stay at one, play at three). We also received a free 20 min. massage (each), free internet use (1 hour each), reservations to any of the restaurants in any of the three resorts (which was taken care of for you by the hotel), your beach towels were placed in your room every night, 1 hour free scuba diving, and 1 hour motorized sport of your choosing, all this for upgrading to VIP status. The PCP was very nice, pool (and pool bar) beautiful and the beach always great. Never had any problem getting chairs or drinks. The food was outstanding, especially the Italian restaurants. We decided to take the Catamaran Trip. This was great. You start on the catamaran to a private island, have lunch, swim and then take speed boats to a place in the ocean (about 3/4 mile off shore) where you can stand in the water (waist high) and look for starfish. We can't say enough about Punta Cana and will be back again (to another resort) in November.

<Content>Great resort, beautiful beach I read many reviews of the Punta Cana Princess before our trip so want to add mine for those considering going. We were a group of 10 adults and 9 children of mixed ages. A great time was had by all. We all booked the VIP package but only two of the five groups were given an ocean view room. The VIP package without a room with a view isn't worth it in my opinion. The massage, internet etc. you have to have a coupon and it is more trouble than it is worth. The rooms overall are spacious and well kept. Again, we were VIP but didn't get the nightly turn down service most nights. Food overall was really good. We tried and enjoyed all of the al a carte restaurants and especially liked the Italian and Tex-Mex. The buffet was also good some nights more so than others. Room service was an added plus even with a limited menu. Staff was AWESOME. Very friendly. Emillio in the lobby bar was the best and the animation staff kept all entertained. My husband won a contest and was crowned Mr. Punta Cana Princess so of course we had fun. The beach is the prettiest I've ever been to. I would return here over Cancun or the Mayan Riveria for the beach alone. Constant breeze and beautiful water. I hope to return same time next year. All in all a great value for the $$.

<Content>A great place to enjoy a quiet holiday, or party @ sister hotels. We just returned from our trip from April 8 to 15th, 2006. We attended with 3 other couples, however we went down the second of 2 weeks, where the other 3 couples were down for 2 weeks. We all had a great time. Heres a synopsis.Rooms: We were a Super VIP which gave us an Ocean view room. What a great view of both the pool and ocean. We had a second level unit. The rooms were clean and surprisingly not musty smelling as I usually find and accept at these very humid counties. The A/C worked well, the rooms had a great bathroom, very clean, keeping in mind, this resort is only 2 years old. The mini- bar was stocked every day, with bottled water, Sprite, Coca-Cola, and a beer, which was disgusting. We simply asked the maid to put in Presidente in a bottle and it was done. That is a great beer, but is better bottled than on draught. We had VIP and as such they changed our towels twice a day with a nightly turn down service. It may not seem important but it was nice. The rooms were also big suites. Another good VIP feature is the beach towels are right in the room, and as such you don't need to get cards to redeem them at the towel room. You do however have to exchange your towels as needed at the towel room. At the end of your trip, you just leave the towels in the room and do not need return the cards to the front, as opposed to trading in your towels to the towel room, getting the cards and returning them upon your departure to the front desk.Beach: What can I say, excellent. The Bavaro beach is amongst the best I have ever seen. Also, no one is allowed on your beach except PCP guests. This is not seemingly an important thing, until you go over to the Princess Caribe and Princess Tropical, (sister hotels), and see how crowded their beaches are. We have security constantly turning non guests away from the beach and property as a whole. It keeps the PCP population quite low. Also, we can go to the 2 sister hotels, but they cannot come to the PCP.Pools: Only one large pool with a swim up bar. Very nice and clean. This is because of the relatively low population at this resort compared with the sister hotels.Grounds: One word, immaculate. All publice toilets are clean and new. The layout is small and you can walk from the beach to the front lobby in 5 minutes.Lobby: Small but quaint with a nice bar.Bonus: You can use all facilities at the sister hotels, and can take a tram at the PCP or just walk over, (5 minute walk along the beach, or 15 minutes if you don't take the tram from the front lobby of PCP. You will find the food selection better and sometimes tastier at the sister hotels, but the population at these hotels is significantly larger and is more crowded and it's a bit of a feeding frenzy as a result.Buffet: Basically good quality food for all meals, at the main buffet, especially the pasta bar, but you do get tired of it, which I find with most all-inclusives. Very good deserts.Ala-cartes: We went to the Tex-Mex and I had the filet mignon 2x, (we went twice), and it was delicious. We also went to the seafood, of which I am not a big fan and I had an excellent bonless chicken. The others had the seafood which was said to be good. Both are on the PCP grounds, and one couple also went to the Italian, which they loved. There are others, but we did not attend.Drinks: At the PCP, the base beer was Presidente. As stated earlier the bottled was better than the draught but both were good. For VIPs, they had bottled Budweiser, and Presidente. IMHO, the Presidente is a better beer. At the sister hotels, they had Miller High Life and Heineken in bottles, but not at PCP. I found this strange as the PCP is supposed to be a better class of hotel than the sister hotels.The rum was good, and there were very good rum drinks. I recommend you try a Tropical. Most bartenders can make it nicely, some can not do any better than pour beer, which is tough to screw up.For liquors. VIP gets you Drambuie, Frangelico, Grand Marnier, Kaluha.This was a good trip, and if you are looking for a very good resort, clean, this is it. I have also been at the Occidental Grand Flamenco, Princess Bavaro in the last year and would recommend them all. (all on the Bavaro beach.) I liked the quiet of the PCP the best.

<Content>you'll love it we just got back and thought that since I found the reviews to be so helpful that I should also write one. It has got to be the cleaness place I have ever been, considering once you get outside the resort , this is like an oasis in a very poor country. The resort is quiet which we really liked and there were many families with small children which was great for them also. One thing that I had noticed that the beach is so hard that many of the families enjoyed walks on the beach with their strollers, yes it was so hard that strollers moved around very well. There was lots of food and you always found something to your liking to eat. Our favorite resturant was the Italian one right at the resort El Blanca.There were theme nights at the buffet every night so actually staying right at the resort was just so convinent . The Caribe was much larger and we only made it over there once during our 2 week stay and when we did there were alot of people smoking so we didn't stay for the whole show. The people work so hard there and are always singing or smiling.We really enjoyed tipping them as we knew that it is what they needed the most.If you are looking for a nice small resort that you almost walk out of your room on the beach then this is the one for you.

<Content>One week stay April 4-11/06 at the Punta Cana Princess Just back from a week's vacation at the PCP - relied on reviews before our travels. Overall, a nice holiday - the beach was beautiful - the resort was very clean - we upgraded to VIP and the room was lovely with vaulted ceiling and fan - beautiful view of both the ocean and the pool. Food not the greatest but managed to survive - a little difficult for the kids - they ate a lot of pasta! We were looking forward to the Tex-Mex Restaurant due to other reviews but must have been there on an off night - ordered the filet mignon which was more of a brisket that could not be cut. Enjoyed the Mexican Sombrero Restaurant, the Brazillian and La Cava. A good suggestion from other travellers was to bring face cloths - your own beach towel for comfort is also recommended. My husband on day six fell ill with food poisioning and our girls not well on our last evening - the flight home was a little rough for them as well. We would return for the beach and the glorious sun - the weather could not have been better - a constant breeze keeps you comfortable from day to night!

<Content>Well worth searching for My boyfriend and I stayed at the Punta Cana princess from March 4th-March 11th. We had the best time. We spent some time researching where to go, and this hotel had everything we wanted. We booked the VIP package, and that was the best idea. For an extra $60.00 pp we had our own personal concierge-Sandra, who took reservations for us at any time of the day and generally looked out for us and provided us with information. We had access to premium alcohol (although the presidente was fine), one hour each of free internet, one hour free of motorized sports (a boat tour for 1 hour)bathrobes, cigars,rum, a free dinner at La Cava,--- which was a beautiful gourmet restaurant. I have never seen such an ornate and classy place on an island before. The service was incredible. We had steak and lobster. The nightly turn-down service was great, because it was the second opportunity each day that our mini-bar was stocked. We left our housekeeper a dollar on the bed every morning, and a dollar in the fridge every morning, and that worked great.We ate at the buffet the first night. It was fine. Other than that, we booked every night at an a la carte restaurant. We ate at all the restaurants at the hotel (super) and at the Tropical, we tried the chinese (not that great) and the Brazilian restaurant which was fantastic! The only tour we took was the tropical snorkelling tour, which was a lot of fun. Snorkelling in 2 places (including a shark pen) and then basically a booze cruise after that. Shopping was expensive we found, even after we cut their prices in half. They were very insulted when I low-balled and were not that apt to negotiate lower (on the beach anyhow).The highlight of our night life was the tower casino. My boyfriend and I are card players, so we spent a few nights there. We won every night, and ended up leaving the island with more money in our pockets than what we came with! All in all, we had the best vacation ever. We planned a lot, and really took advantage of everything the hotel(s) had to offer. I would definetely recommend the VIP package to anyone. When we checked in, the first thing that I said was that I wanted a room in the 5000 block on the second floor, and because we had the VIP package, we were put exactly there. Our view was amazing--a combo of the pool and beach.Yes it was hard to get a chair in the morning. But all you had to do was go down early, put your towel on a chair and maybe a magazine and it was yours for the rest of the day. We walked on the beach quite far, and passed around 7-8 hotels and none of them looked as nice as the princess hotels.I would definetely recommend this hotel. I have been to Puerta plata 2 times, mayan riviera, cuba, bahamas.... and this was definetely the greatest experience.

<Content>Lovely but... Punta Cana Princess Lovely but..Having just returned from our 2 week holiday at the Punta Cana Princess, we experienced good food, lovely room, great service and a relaxing holiday. However....we had 2 laundry bags of smaller garments,ie: t shirts, shorts, 1 pair of pants, 1 sun dress and the rest small stuff=$72.00 US. We accidently broke the 2 cup carafe for the coffee machine in the room=$20.00 US. A few added expences that we felt were out of line. Overall, the vacation was great, with great hosts and hostessess and I must mention Little Joe on the Monster Truck Safari. He was very informative and we came away from that tour feeling satisfied with the knowledge we acquired from him about the country.Dale and DonnaBritish Columbia, Canada

<Content>Great Place I had the best time of my life there. I met the friendliest people that work there. Nelson (bartender), Santa (bar, restaurant), Sonto Brito (young fellow), and the man we called Brown (beach entertainment). All these people made it a great place to be. I'll be back. The lobby staff were great too. The rooms were always a clean, warm place to go to. The food was great(I gained 8 lbs) and the Pres. beer was great too. Everything was great. The only complaint I have is some of the Foreighners I noticed think that your staff are their slaves. I respect the workers and ask them politely for things. I expect service, not slaves to be ordered around. I was offended by the way these people bud in line and think they are gods. Thank you for a great Vacation,  Ron and Tracey Sheppard David and Sherri MateriBattleford, Saskatchewan WE ARE CANADIAN

<Content>Beautiful Hotel with such an unconsciencious guest services staff We checked into the PCP on 3/07/06, and the mayority of the staff was very nice and courteous. The rooms were spacious, gorgeous and super clean. The grounds of the hotel were very well maintained, I found the buffet food to be very good (except for the Italian restaurant Ill Baccio, that food has tragically tarnished my husbands perception on Italian cuisine eternally), the pool was very clean and the beach was needless to say incredible. The nightlife is non-existent on these grounds, to find good entertainment you must go to other resorts. I recommend club news on the Caribe Princess grounds. Now the reason why I rated this hotel with a 2 instead of a 5 is as follows. On the first day we arrived, we headed straight for the beach and were lured by the staff to participate in some motorized water sports. The beach is swamped with hotel security virtually in every area of the property and they advised us that there wouldn't be any dangers if we left our belongings under the beach chairs. I was traveling with my husband and my friend, we went parasailing, so like the majority of the other guests we listenened to the guards advice and we left our belongings under the chairs we were using near the security stall. Upon our return from our activities, all of our belongings had been ROBBED!! (Amond them was our bag, with our room keys, my husbands cell phone, our prescription glasses, cash, and disposable cameras) The worst part of all this, when we went to file a complain to guest services, they just told us that the hotel wasn't responsible for lost articles out of the safe in the guest rooms. So we just asked them to make a report just in case the bag turned up. We also asked them if we could make a phone call to my husbands cell phone to see if someone might have picked up the bag and taken it to a lost and found, but the resort wouldn't even let us do that (and we asked several times). Since our room keys were also in the bag, they made it ridiculously clear how they were making an exception for us that they were not charging us the $2.00 fee for lost keys considering the circumstances. We stayed in this resort for 3 days, and each day we went to guest services, there was a new person attending guests, and none of them would even have any knowledge of our case, also we asked to speak to the hotel manager on several occassions, and we were refused the opportunity.So Overall PCP was a beautiful resort, and I'm trying very hard not to give a biased opinion on this resort, because overall it was a great experience. The only staff that I found to be extremely unhelpfull were the guest services, but the reception, the buffet staff, the bartenders, and the housekeepers were all extremely nice and helpful. It's sad that this unfortunate event had to ruin the entire experience for us. But we learned our lesson, in the future if anyone decides to go to this resort, maintain your cash and valuables locked up in a safe so you don't have to deal with the troubles we had to endure.

<Content>Amazing holiday...proud to be canadian We stayed at the PCP from feb. 24th to march 3rd and had an amazing vacation. This was our 2nd time to Punta Cana, last year we went to the Bahia Principe. Both properties are super however, we preferred the PCP as we was much smaller and in return thought it was a better atmosphere for us. The food is about comparable at both resorts. We never went hungry, actually we ate too much. The breakfast buffet was really good and if you wanted you could always get fresh omelletts, cr锚pes ect.. made. For lunch, we always went to the beach grill. For the people who said there wasn't enough variety what else do you want for lunch??? Other than hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, pasta, salads, ice cream and deserts!!! The pizza is always fresh and very yummy. For dinner we went to the Seafood, Tex-Mex (twice), Italian, Mexican (Caribe side) and the buffet (twice). We never had any problems making our reservations and we found the food very good at all restaurants. They also have a selection of different items on all of their menus and the service was outstanding except at the Mexican on the Caribe Side. We found the service very slow and also the property to be dirty and not well kept as at the PCP. After seeing the Caribe side we were really happy to be at the PCP. The Caribe seemed much busier and we found the layout of the property to be very space out.The rooms were great, spacious, impecably cleaned. We were in the 4000 building on the 3rd floor which gave us a spectacular view of the ocean and the pool without the VIP packages.The pool and the ocean were both spectacular.The service all around at this resort was extremely good. We never had to wait for anything wether it was drinks, food or at Guest Services. The Dominican people are very friendly and just paid so much special attention to our child. There were a lot of Canadians, a few Americans and quite a few Europeans. In general, the people were very friendly and nice however we did encounter some unpleasant situations with others (non canadians). I am pround to say that I am Canadian and I have much more respect for the Dominican people and vacationers.Advice regarding taxi cabs: One day we took a cab to go shopping at the Bavaro Plaza. Guest services organizes the cab and they told us that it 12$ US return and that we pay the cab upon return. We went and had no problems. At the end of the week, my husband returned by himself to go to the jewellers to pick up a necklace I had seen. Same procedure, same price told by Guest services, however when he got back the cab driver wanted 40$US!!! My husband refused to pay it so the driver locked the doors and would not let him out. The security guard heard the commotion and approached the car. After a bit of arguing in between the driver and the security guard, he let my husband out.We had a super holiday, lots or rest and relaxationa and fun in the sun....We would definetely go back.

<Content>Fantastic Holiday Stayed at the Princess Punta Cana for one week in January 2006. My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay there. The resort is small and quiet, which is exatcly what we where looking for. The staff exceeded our expectations, they were friendly and always willing to help. At the buffett you can always find something you like to eat, and the al la carte restaraunts where fantastic. I would highly reccomend taking in all the al la carte restaraunts, none of them are bad. Our first few days, there was quite a bite of wind, but that died down after a while. The beaches are some of the best in the world, and the pool and deck are excellant. Lots of sun and lots of booze. This is an excellant resort with all the amenities, I would go back again and would reccomend this to anyone looking for a nice relaxing vacation.

<Content>Had an awesome time at Punta Cana Princess ! Just got back and had to share the great times we had at the Punta Cana Princess. There were 4 of us staying at PCP from Feb. 24 - March 3. We all agree that this was a perfect vacation place. The service we received was excellent from all employees from the friendly reception and waiters and bar tenders..all great and ready to please. The beautiful clean  spacious rooms were always touched up with fresh flowers, always a nice daily presentation to come back to after a long fun day in the sun. The food was great, no complaints there. Definately something for everyone, not to mention the great variety of fresh tropical fruits daily. The breakfast especially was nice with fresh croissants, crepes, pancakes  great ommlettes you could order to be made to your liking with fresh juices of all kinds made there fresh while you wait. Although yes this is the smaller resort of the other 3 princess resorts, it is still large enough to have a variety of ala cart rest. and of course you could still enjoy the other sister resorts next door as well if you wanted. The Animation Staff at PCP were Fantastic. They would have some activities going on all the time mainly at the beach,  at times at the pool. There would be nightly entertainment at the lobby bar usually at 9:45pm. Dance Contests, Karioke...all great fun!The beach of course ....Paridise! Always sunny  hot, the water warm and enviting.All  all. a great vacation for anyone..Would go back for sure...

<Content>beautiful beach, friendly and helpful staff I found the staff to be friendly and helpful and always ready to please. Only one unfortunate incident happened. I think this is because I was travelling alone. But resort security was quick to help and try to make me feel at ease. But I still felt I had to look over my shoulder for the rest of my holiday. The food was ok. Lots of variety at the buffet but not too exciting taste wise. No way would a person ever go hungry there. Most of all I enjoyed the beautiful beach and people watching. The beach bar was the most pleasant place to sit and visit and have a bite to eat and a drink. I hope that they put some kind of a finish on the tiles in the buildings as they are very slippery when your feet are wet. My friend slipped on the stairs and hurt her leg quite badly. However, the housekeeping staff were quick to her aid.

<Content>Amazing...Amazing The Punta Cana Princess was an amazing experience!!!! We stayed( my best friend and I) from Feb 7th -Feb 14th. The moment we arrived at the resort, the exceptional service and WOW factor became overwhelming, our room was immaculately clean, with a great view, the ocean  the pool. The food was awesome. Especially the TexMex restaurant( fillet mignon was out of this world) The buffet during dinner was awesome every night, somthing for everyone. They did a Mexican themed buffet one night, and as we enetered we were handed a margaita, and the buffet was incredible, we both highly recommed you go! We actually were reading some of the other review sbefore we left, and people were saying that the food was terrible and there was nothing to do, well I think those people must have had unrealistic expectations, and hid in their rooms. Everyday, all day the Animation staff got all tourists young and old involved in beach aerobics, spanish lessons on the beach, dancing lessons, and every night there was something going on in the lobby for the kids, then for the adults till 11:30pm. It was awesome... we had a blast!!!! The staff and Animation crew really made our vacation amazing, so friendly and eager to please! We both also took the VIP package, and the Spa was incredible too, the massage made us both melt like butter, the rum and cigars were great, and everynight when we returned to our room, we had fresh beach towels on our beds with cute flowers all over the place.Nice touch!!We did 2 day trips, the glass bottom boat with snorkling- was amazing.. you pay cash 38$us, for 4 hours, and you travel down the coast line and snorkel in 2 different spots, it was awesome. Great value for your buck! Also we did the Bavaro Runners $80usa it is the entire day 8-5pm, and if I could recommend any one thing to do while visiting, it would be to take this trip, you start out at a sugar cane field, and they offer samples of the sugar cane and sugar cane RUM!!! Then you go to a cigar making factory, then to the Maria house, and get to sample the freshest fruits I have ever had, and Mamawana, also pure coffee and cocoa right from the bean...beats starbucks any day!! Then they take you all throughout the country side, in the mountains and then to the edge of the island to go hourseback riding, swimming, boogie boarding and to taste a true Dominican lunch, and by the way the FOOD WAS AWESOME!!!Honestly this trip was amazing, as we were leaving we both reflected back and we could not find one thing that we would change- other than our reservation, cause we should have booked for 2 weeks- not one!!!Please note that when we were there we did notice that all the Canadiana  Europians were having a blast, no complaints at all, it was and it is sad to say, but it was only the American tourists that had issue, and they treated the staff very poorly.

<Content>Great location and outstanding staff We just returned from a family vacation, our two sons, their wives and 4 year old granddaughter. The one week stay was wonderful. Over the past couple of months we have been reading the various reviews posted by other travelers and have nothing but positive things to say about the resort.We didn't meet a single member of the staff that wasn't genuinely friendly. The entire staff from the front desk, the room cleaners, the restaurant help, the bar tenders to the ground personnel couldn't do enough for you. A couple of the previous reviews talked about having to tip the help for service - not true. Of course we tipped them at various times but they were friendly and helpful even when no tip was offered. An example, two men were trimming the coconut trees one morning and one of the workers stopped my granddaughter and me and in Spanish and sign language asked if we would like to try a fresh coconut. He yelled up to his friend and told him to drop a coconut. He then used his machette to open up the fruit for us to drink from - he enjoyed watching our 4 year old as much as I did. Everyday the workers made this kind of nice gesture.Another review talked about not being able to get served at the bar unless you spoke Spanish. I don't know what their problem was but we never had to wait and I unfortunately don't speak Spanish. The workers all knew more English than I knew Spanish and we both had no trouble communicating. We actually had fun combining English and Spanish and ending up with everything we asked for and needed.The food - well if you want true 4 or 5 star dining go on a different type of vacation. The food at the all inclusive was fine. Each morning I ordered a freshly prepared omelet, also available were a variety of fresh juices, bacon and sausage, pancakes, french toast, cheeses, etc. We ate dinner at the buffet plus all three restaurants. The dinners were fine - had lobster twice [no additional charge], plenty of shrimp, fish, steaks and they always had fresh pasta with a variety of sauces for those not wanting to try to clams, mussels or other local foods. Gourmet food - no; however, the quality was fine.Other reviews said to ask for rooms in buildings 4000 or 5000. We were in building 2000 and our room was very nice. The distance to the pool and beach from buildings 4000 or 5000 is 2 minutes, the distance from building 2000 is 4 minutes. No big deal and that's with a 4 year old walking. We had a ground level suite and used the room safe for passports  valuables; otherwise, we left our room's sliding glass door open the entire time and never had a problem. I didn't hear of anyone having a problem with thieves during our stay.The pool and beach area are beautiful. Miles and miles of white sand and crystal clear water. No problem getting a palapa or chairs if you arrive by 10 a.m. After that hour chairs were always available but you had to look. Also, no problem getting to use the sailboats or other water craft. We have stayed at other resorts in several Mexican locations but this was our first visit to the Dominican Republic. We will definitely go back in the future.The Punta Cana Princess is a wonderful place for families. Plenty of activities for kids and a very restful place for adults. I just realized it but all last week with all the young kids at the resort I never heard any adult raising their voice or any child crying - that's pretty remarkable.The only downside to the trip was the air transportation on Sunquest/Skyservice. We were supposed to leave at 6:00 a.m. and arrive in Punta Cana by 11:30 a.m. Due to a number of bureacratic foul-ups, not weather related, we didn't arrive at our hotel until 11:00 p.m. and our luggage on a direct flight got lost and didn't arrive until the next day. Not the fault of the Punta Cana Princess. The response from Sunquest/Skyservice was a $70 voucher after losing an entire day of vacation - not very good public relations. On the return flight they damaged my luggage and their response was that I should contact their Customer Relations Office. Customer Relations Office - quite the oxymorom.Other than the transportation with Sunquest/Skyservice I would highly recommend the Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>Beware of credit card fraud My In-laws and I stayed at PCP from Feb 11-18, 2006. We have been to Cuba 3 times, and DR once before. Shopping:Both the PCP and the sister resort Caribe Club/Tropical Princess have on site shops. My mother-in-law and sister-in-law both used their credit cards at the shops (only once and only at the on resort shops) and had their cards copied. We are quite sure we didn't spend $1000 each in Santo Domingo on Feb 20th. So BEWARE, there are lots of crooks, even on the resorts.Flight:As usual Skyservice left much to be desired, we had the most uncomfortable seats imaginable. We got to Punta Cana and had to wait 1/2 hour extra for a bus since the one that was going to take us broke down. The flight back was delayed 12 hours, suprise. Regardless, thats par for the course with the charter airlines. We will not be flying charter again, the extra few hundred is worth it for my back.Hotel:The PCP is a beautiful hotel with immaculate rooms (only 2 years old). Check in was simple, we were on the 3rd floor in the 4000 block, an amazing room and view of the beach. I would recommend the 4000 or 5000 block like previous reviews have mentioned, be sure you get 2nd or 3rd floor. Each room has a bar fridge that gets restocked with coke, sprite, water and beer daily. Watch the water bottles, some of ours were refilled. The water at the bars is bottled and not refilled so we got all ours there. The grounds are also amazing and are constantly being upkept by very entertaining grounds staff.Restaurants:We went to the Rio Grande (Tex-Mex steakhouse) and the Italian restaurant on the PCP grounds and had great meals. We were very disappointed with all of the meals at the Caribe Club/Tropical Princess restaurants (Chinese, Italian and Brazilian), the service was exceptionally slow (even by Dominican standards)and the food was not very good, with a few cases of GI upset afterwards. The buffet at Caribe Club/Tropical has more variety than the PCP and we usually ate lunch there. The lunchtime beachside buffet at PCP was good, Santa the waitress was very attentive and entertaining.Bars:No wait service to the beach chairs as advertised, instead they have a small tent bar set up amongst the beach umbrellas. Drinks were fine, I didn't see any that I couldn't get without the VIP upgrade at PCP. Rum and Beer taste the same after the first 2 anyway.Beach:Probably the nicest beach I've been on. Take insulated mugs as the sand gets hot and so do your drinks. Chairs are easy to come by but if you want an umbrella on the edge of the beach you have to get down before 0800. There is absolutely no snorkelling to be had for free at this beach, $20 will get you a boat ride to a reef but there is none off the beach.Entertainment:The usual caribbean shows, tennis was only available from 9-5, archery only at 1130 for some reason. Not really much to do besides lay on the beach or by the pool.Excursions:We went on a bunch of excursions in Puerto Plata so we didn't bother here, we heard the Bavaro Runners was fun, but for $80 it would have to be quite the trip. The Tour reps really push the excursions so be prepared.Overall:A great resort for relaxing, food was fine on PCP, avoid the other resort's restaurants. Echoing the other reviews, not a very fast paced resort, but seemed great for families.

<Content>Beautiful, Smaller resort, Excellent Vacation We stayed at the PCP from Jan 28- Feb 3 2006. There were 10 of us with different opinions and different views on what a holdiay should be and I think that the PCP suited every just about perfectly.I have travelled throughout the caribbean extensively and stayed at many different resorts from 2-5+ stars. I have paid top price and have did the sell off thing as well. I think no matter what you paid for the Princess you will be satified. We are not fussy people and as long as there is good food to eat - not necessarly gourmet and as long as the rooms are clean, drinks are cold, sun is hot and the company we are with is good why wouldnt you have a great time.We flew Skyservice from Toronto and of coarse the seating is very cosy how ever the flight was direct and quick. Check in took a few minutes but someone was there to give us a drink and music was playing in the lobby to get us in the DR spirit.Our rooms we beautiful spacious suites, new- clean- large bathrooms with double sinks. We left the maid 2.00us and a gift from the dollar store and a note if we wanted our fridge stocked full of beer and this was alway done with no problem. We were on the top floor and had really nice high vaulted ceilings. The food was good, I never went hungry and there was lots of variety for everybody. You also had full exchange privileges at the Caribe and Tropical so there was plenty of selections. We ate the Tex Mex restaurant 2x which was excellent, the Italian- very good, the Seafood restaurant at the beach- very good and the La Cava( which is part of the VIP) which was my least favorite but still good. The food presentation there is top notch but very rich in flavour. I order lobster and they presented me with 2 huge lobster tails. My tummy was a bit off after but I sure it was because the sauces were so rich.You have to remember you are not in North America so be adventurous and try new things and new culture- If I wanted french fries everyday I would stay home and go to Mcdonalds.The hotel is small enough that you are in the lobby, to the restaurants, to your room or at the beach all in about 5 minutes. You can take a shuttle to the other two resorts but the walk does you good and its only about 10 mins max. The disco and the theatre are at the other resorts but the way the resorts are intertwined its no big deal. The disco allows locals in and it can be a bit intimidating. We walked the beach to the other reosrts alot too. There was a bit more activity by the pool and the resorts looked busy if thats what you are into. At the PCP we never had a problem getting a chair or shelter by the pool or beach at anytime. It was quieter but they still did do activities by the beach. We also purchased the VIP package once we were there- it was good for some of us, other it really made no big differece- keep in mind the premium alcohols are served only at certain bars. The massages were good and the only motorized watersports are the banana boats.I will return the PCP as it was relaxing, comfortable and quaint. This time we will be taking our daughter back with us. The pool gradually waded in which is good for children as well as their own little play area.Keep in mind when going to another country (in this case a 3rd world country) things are different and they try to make things as close to what we expect here in North America. Dont go to the DR with high expectation and you holdiay will be better that you expected. If your expectations are high go the the BVI ( british virgin islands) Rememer having too much sun, too many drinks and different foods in the oils they cook in you system can make you sick faster than anything- you need to ease your way into your holiday and take your pepto bismal everyday as a precaution. Those who have written a negative review on this resort are uneducated about their all inclusive holiday. You have champagne tastes on a beer budget and will never be satisfied.The PCP is a perfect smaller resort for those looking to relax, kick back and watch to world go by. It doesnt hurt that the beaches are beautiful here too!!!(watch out for the topless women- they are everywhere!!! )

<Content>great relaxing holiday My husband and i just got back from pcp and had a wonderful time. I did a lot of research before we left and there were mixed reviews aboout this hotel, but we had a blast. It is the smaller of the 3 but if you want a relaxing and fun holiday without the lineups and chaos..this is the one for you.The beach and water were wonderful and never a problem finding space or chair on the beach. The food was ok..but there was something for everyone. The staff were very friendly and most did speak english. The animation staff made sure everyone had fun on the beach and pool, but this resort has no night life. You must go tot he Caribe for the disco, but we liked not having a loud resort. I would definetly reccomend this resort and we are planning on going back. Oh ya, the rooms are great..all are suites and the 4000 and 5000 blocks are the best and either view of ocean or pool. If you like 5 star all the way, gourmet food and fast service..this is not the resort for you...if you are looking for fun, relaxation and friendly staff working on dominican time with fantastic water/beach..there try this resort..we were NOT disappointed

<Content>Great Triop The Punta Cana Princess is a wonderfull place to stay. We did our research on the price we were able to pay and the princess seemed liked the best deal. I find it very interesting reading peoples reports especially when you are there at the same time and experience a totally different vacation. My husband and I were at the pcp for 2 weeks and were taken care of like I have never experienced. The service from your room, bars, buffet, restaurants, guest services and the front desk was amazing. I think people with negative reviews have unreasonable expectations and would have problems anywhere they went. The food; you can always find something to eat, yes the temperature is luke warm but the breeze is always blowing. We would have eggs and toast and they were hot cause they are made for you, to your liking if you like them cooked more just let the chef know. The restaurants are great we tried almost everyone except the brazillian. Your lucky to be able to have the luxury of eating at all the princess resorts on the property the other resorts are a 5 min walk max. There is a golf cart to take you if you don't feel like walking. We did not want for anything on this holiday. We were always full and Nelson took care of us everyday. Tipping, the average wage down in the DR is horrible so why not tip, these people are cleaning your room and doing your dishes and serving your food, its the least you could do. I thank all the staff at this resort for a wonderful vacation.

<Content>Big group - loads of fun! Just returned from a week long (too short) vacation at the Punta Cana Princess. I had a marvelous time. I travelled with a group to attend a wedding and found absolutely nothing to complain about. (The wedding was a magical, fairy tale event and the resort staff were attentive and accommodating. Their attention to detail made the whole ceremony and reception beautiful.) There was enough variety of food and restaurants that we never went hungry or had to endure something we didn't like. The suites were clean and bright. The resort was relatively quiet, but if you wanted the night life, the sister resort next door provided discos, theatre, shows, casino, etc. Be prepared to haggle with the vendors at the straw market. Don't be afraid to walk away if you don't get the price you want. Ask lots of questions, about the spa, about the water sports and other activities, and about the restaurants at the Punta Cana Princess and the neighbouring resorts. If you are fully informed, you'll be able to pick what you want to do and you won't miss out on the fun. When we chatted on the plane home, everyone from our group of 30+ said they had a blast and a lot of us want to go back again!

<Content>Overall would not recommend this hotel if you are young or American My boyfriend and I stayed at the PCP from 1/26-1/30. When we got to the hotel, we asked to upgrade to VIP. The person at the front dest hardly spoke English. We had to beg for our VIP items (cigars, rum, robes, free massage, dinner, internet, and motorized watersports) and did not recieve the vouchers until the 3rd day we were there (with attitude may I add). Also when we got to our room, it was a regular 2- double bed room (not VIP) we ased to be changed and they told us they were overbooked but will change it the next day. We were changed around 1pm the next day to a VIP room, however, it was more unkept and appeared dirtier than the other. Also, we were staying on the ground floor and the sliding door was broken. I immediately checked these doors because I read a review where 14 people were robbed because their sliding door was broken. When I called to get our room changed again, they said they would send someone to fix the door. Nevertheless, we went back to our original room because it was 3pm by this time and we wasted a day just to get situated. The waiters/ waitressess/ bartenders/ maids were very nice but the front desk was very unhelpful, especially if you had a problem. The food was terrible and i was sick the first 3 days we were there. Also, they charge $15 dollars for immodium, so I suggest bringing your own. If you need to take out money and want to change it to american dollars (because the mac machines give you peso's) the fron desk wont do it for you and will tell you you have to either go into town or the airport to change it... NOT TRUE! Go to the casino... they will change it for you. Also, they jipped us on the motorized water sports and said that it was too windy to do anything. If you are going away to just relax, this place is nice for that. I do have to say that it had beautiful beaches and the pool was very clean. However, don't bother upgrading to VIP because we didnt even get to use all of our vouchers. And be prepared to pay for EVERYTHING. Also, the people expect to get tipped for everything so bring plenty of one's. Overall, this place is good for families. The resort turns into a total ghosttown at night. There is NOTHING to do. I was very open to alot because I read the reviews and didn't want it to spoil our vacation, but everyone was right... there is no entertainment, the food is TERRIBLE, the front desk does not help with any problems, and if you complain, they ignore you even more and get an attitude. Everything is spread out so bring walking shoes... And I have to let you know our fiasco about the VIP... like I said before about the front desk - When my b/f lost his VIP bracelet and went to get a new one, the woman at the counter told him that it would cost him to replace the new bracelet, plus he had to pay for the VIP. Now, when we did not get the room, the man at the front dest told us that the VIP was free of charge because of out problems with the rooms and not receiving the vouchers. She argued with us for 20 minutes, saying that No one gets anything free here When we asked to downgrade, she said that we could, but she will charge us $60 for the resturaunt that we ate at, and will find out every bar we went to and what we had to drink and will charge us for that too. After she threatened us, I was appauled. I was never threatened before at any resort, no matter what problem I had. This is completely unnacceptable behavior, and I want to let you all know what type of service to expect. Any more questions/ comments, you are more than welcome to e-mail me. I would never go back to this resort, and I suggest to you to not even bother wasting your time here. If you already booked your trip, just try and make the most of it. Hopefully you wont have the same experience we had.

<Content>Great Vacation At The Punta Cana Princess Be prepared this is a long review. We just returned yesterday, Jan. 30th, from our vacation at the Punta Cana Princess. There were six family members, all adults over 50, and we all enjoyed it very much. We tried to get rooms together but no luck. If you're going there try to get in Building 5. My husband and I stayed there and it was amazing. The view of the ocean and pool were spectacular. My sister and husband stayed in Building 1 and it had a nice view but nothing like ours. My brother and wife stayed in Building 2 and they had no view to speak of. Building 3 is the worst. You'll have a view of the buffet unless you're on the 3rd floor. Our room was 5211 and if you could get in 5213 that was an even better choice. The rooms were spacious and clean. Be sure and bring face cloths because there were none to be seen. I had already read about this problem and just picked up some cheap one and left them there. A few other great items I brought were from the dollar store, plastic clothes pegs that wrap around the shower rod or patio chairs. Things don't dry very well but if you hang them up it's a little better. Dryer sheets to put in the drawers and closet to keep your clothes smelling fresh. Of course zip lock bags for everything. Lots of gifts for the staff. We made friends with the two beach bartenders, Arturo and Martines and found out they had a son and daughter and I gave them appropriate gifts for their kids. They were extremely grateful and asked me to write my room number and name on a napkin so they could take them home. They thanked us every day for the gifts and they were both going home when we were there and loved taking their presents with them. Of course we tipped with U.S. dollars too but sometimes it's nice for them to be able to bring gifts home to their kids.FOOD - I had read a lot about cold food at the buffet and sometimes this was true but we always had lots to eat. There is a great grilling station and pasta station where the food is make hot and fresh. We ate at the Tex Mex - very good, the Italian - also good but we got too much food, Chinese - very good and Seafood beach restaurant - our least favourite although I ordered the crab stuffed beef and loved it. You'll always find something you like in the buffets. The absolute worst food was in the 24 hour beach bar restaurant. If you happened to catch it when it first came out of the kitchen it was okay but most of the time it was cold and tasteless. We tried a few times but never hit it at the right time.BARS - Lobby bar, pool bar, 24 hour beach bar on a deck, and second daytime beach bar right on the sand. Lots of choice of drinks and they were more than willing to make up any kind of mixture you wanted. I experimented every day to try something new. Definitely bring a insulated mug. I found a nice one that held about 2 regular drinks and they didn't mind rinsing it out for me each time.POOL - The water was definitely cold. On a very hot day it was okay but if it was overcast the pool was pretty empty. If you want a pool palapya or ocean palapya you have to put your book or towel or something on them by 8:30 or 9:00. The ones in the best locations fill up fast although we could always find something.OCEAN - Beautiful with nice waves. The ocean seemed warmer than the pool and although there is a strong current it's roped off where it's safe to swim and we enjoyed it every day.WEATHER - The weather could change in a minute. It's sunny and hot and then it clouds over and a short shower or strong winds and then minutes later sunny and hot again. It cooled down quite a bit at night, more from the wind than anything else. A light sweater was welcomed for a couple of the nights.TROPICAL  CARIBE - We played mini golf and had a couple of drinks there. Nice resorts but more crowded then ours. Went over a couple of times for the nightly shows but they weren't that great. I think we've seen them other times on vacation and it was just the same old thing.Finally to sum up it was a great place to stay. Small enough to get from room to lobby or ocean or pool in minutes. You'll enjoy the friendliness of the staff and a little Spanish goes a long way. They also have Spanish lessons and it's a good thing to take advange of. Keep an open mind and you'll enjoy every minute of your holiday

<Content>After two other hotels We found the princess Screw up at two other hotels by the tour company we ended up at the Punta Cana Princess. Thank goodness for the screw up to come upon such a gem. Clean, quite and access to the other princess restaurants.They understood our problems of hotels and put us up in the honeymoon suites.They could not have been more hospitable. Staff were friendly, never looking for tips. Security on the beach from sale hawkers. Hotel was always cleaning and pruning. Even a little rain didn't dicourage us( umbrellas in all rooms). Between the buffet, restaurants choices, quite surrounding, it could not have been better! Long Island, NY

<Content>A great time had by all 12 of us have just returned from a wonderful week at the Punta Cana Princess All Suites. If you want a relaxing holiday in a clean and friendly hotel this is it. Yes it is quiet, however you can have all the entertainment you want by strolling or taking a trolly next door to the Punta Cana Princess Tropical/Caribe of an evening, there is entertainment a disco and transportation to the the casino if you want. We were there to celebrate a 50th birthday. Let me tell you these people went out of there way to make it a special day for our friend, more flowers in her room with a happy birthday greeting in spanish, champagne in her room, happy birthday sung not once but at all three resturants and bars we went to that day complete with a champagne toast made by a staff member. The food was fine, not gourment but fine. None of us starved or got ill. The beach was fantastic, the rooms were spotless and spacious the pool was wonderful and the staff tried their best. For the most part they speak 3 to 4 languages spanish, english, french and german in some cases. The animation staff were a hoot and kept things hopping. Drink service was slow, however you are on vacation and food and drink is available 24 hours a day......what is your hurry!

<Content>It was good! Hey there fellow travellers! I was pretty skeptical about traveling to the DR because of all the negative reports of the staff. We've been spoiled in the Mayan Riveriea at the Barcelo Maya, but I have to say that at the Punta Cana Princess, service was great! People dont' expect to get tips and greatful when they do. But I do agree, the food at the Buffets were not that great. I'm not particularily picky. I just want a great beach and a clean room. The PCP met those requirements, but the buffets were just OK. The omlette and pasta stands were fine. We are one of those couples who try a variety of foods, so there was no shortage of items. We tried all the traditional Dominican food, so therefore, there was a variety of things to try. I can see if you are a picky eater that food would be an issue. (if you only like meat and potatoes, why would you try okra?) If so, reserve a spot at every a la carte restaurant, every night. (we went to the steak tex mex restaurant twice!)I do have to agree with most, that the beach restaurant Casa something was pretty bad. Everything was cold and old. (Of course, at 2am and drunk, you dont' really care too much)It is a relatively quiet resort. We met a few young Canadians (in there twenties) and they were bored to tears. However, we are in our thirties, we love to party at the bars, but felt like slowing down this holiday. We had the option of going to the other resorts but just chilled at the PCP. (Of the 10 minutes we witnessed of the show at the other resort, we concluded that it was pretty lame. Needless to say we drowned our sorrows in booze.)I love that you don't have to reserve lounge chairs, beg for service, nor bribe for dinner reservations. All in all, a good stress free vacation! And the staff are pretty awesome, considering we were one of those couples that didn't particpate in ANY of the activities. JUST CHILLED!Hope this Helped,ZOE

<Content>Our holiday was amazing, we just got back on the 20th I had to write in and compliment the staff at the Punta Cana Princess. They were all very friendly, helpful and always smiling. The buffet's weren't spectacular, but breakfast has the option of omlettes made to order and there is also chef's making Crepes which were extremely good. The grounds, rooms, restaurants  bathrooms were extremely clean. As for the beach grill in the restaurant down near the ocean, all of the meats displayed were kept in stainless steel bins in a bin of ice. Not only were they chilled, but they had an executives/management group come in on a few occasions with thermometers taking the temperature of the buffet items. If fruits or veggies eneded ice added under the dishes, it was done immediately. The Restaurants were excellent - hot food and good service. The Tex-mex was our least favourite (we traveled with a group of 6), the Italian was excellent and we ate there twice (Chicken  Pork entrees were great)and the Chinese restaurant at the bavaro was definately our favourite. The walk (even though there is a shuttle every 20minutes) takes approximately 5-6 minutes if your taking your time and the scenery between the resorts is rather impressive (we preferred to walk).Not only would we recommend the resorts to friends, but we look forward to visiting it again.I think if you are a person that is expecting to eat lobster, lamb and be served crab cakes on silver platters, than yes, you may be disappointed with the selection. We made it through the week just fine, enjoying the buffet for breakfast, the beach bar snacks (chicken fingers, mini pasteries, fruit, cookies, etc.) for lunch and the restaruants for dinner. Don't put too much thought into the negative reviews, if you and your family are planning a holiday here - I'm sure you'll have a great time. All of the guests that we met on our vacation were just as pleased as we were!

<Content>Good time at Punta Cana Princess After writing a rather scathing report 2 years ago about a Puerto Plata 3 1/2 star hotel I am pleased to be able to say positives about my Punta Cana Princess experience.My wife, two kids (boy of 8 and girl of 4) and I spent 2 wonderful weeks at the Punta Cana Princess from Dec 24/2005 until Jan 7/2006. Highlights? The beach was very clean with nice white sand. Rooms - we moved once to get closer to the beach and swimming pool - very clean and well kept. Housekeeping staff was first rate, albeit a little slow responding to out of ordinary requests.By far the best group of folks were the animation staff. They work well as a group. Night and day they tirelessly prodded and cajoled us to participate in tons of activities including beach volleyball, waterpolo, darts, archery, dance lessons and aerobics by the pool. Not to be overlooked were the 2 fabulous mini-club directors who took exemplary care of our 4 year old daughter introducing her to new dances and encouraging her to improve her Spanish. They were gentle and co-operative and deserve accolades.Improvements should be made to the water system. It broke down two or three times during the 2 weeks, but was promptly returned to service so the inconvenience was minor to us. More night life on the property might make the 20-somethings happy, but us parents were pleased to be able to fall asleep at night without the thumping bass we experience at other resorts.Finally, the food at the speciality restaurants were almost laughable. Our preference was for the main restaurant since the pretention was ratchetted down and the meal selection was far greater, especially on New Year's eve. We got most of what we came for from the Princess and wholeheartedly recommend others taking a path to their doors. We wish them every success in the future.

<Content>Punta Cana Princess = Punta Cana Garbage Just returned from this resort...if you are thinking about traveling there, think again, DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS RESORT...I will admitt that the beaches in Punta Cana are beautiful, and the rooms in this resort are quite spacious and nice. In addition, the resort does seem to be fairly clean, and maintained...now on to the negatives..1) Food = ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING...now i know for a fact that this is not only my opinion, but also the opinion of just about everyone else that we talked to. These people screw up the easiest of items, rice is undercooked and crunchy at times, french fries and pizza is often cold, alot of the meat has some greasy mysterious sauce that looks awful. In the morning the eggs taste horrible, and depending on the day they are barely cooked. If you want to get a decent meal you must walk 10 minutes to the other princess resort next door to get anything half decent. In addition, I was scared to eat many of the meats because of the poor food handling at this resort. The guys by the grill have huge tubs filled with chicken and meat, yet they don't keep it cold with ice or cooler packs. Who knows how long that food has been left out, and exposed to the warm humid air.I will say that the El Rancho steak house is decent on the resort, don't waist your time at the italian ala carte it is complete garbage. Again, if you want decent meals for dinner you must walk to the other resorts...pay the 30 bucks and get the lobster dinner at La Pasquedor Restaurant (sp), and try the Mamma Mia restaurant it is good too.2) Nightlife...this resort turns into a virtual ghost town after 11 pm. I don't know how anyone could find these clowns in the lobby entertaining. If you want nightlife, again you must walk to the other resorts or go into town to a nightclub.3) Drinks...if you are a serious drinker, and will be boozing heavily than pay the money for the vip deal and get the international liquor. I was very disappointed with the dominican rum, and the El Presidente well get very old very fast.Finally, I cannot express in words how bad the food is in this place...if you are prepared to eat 1 or 2 meals a day, and go on a heavy bread and butter diet, than good luck, have fun! This resort caters to older couples, if you are young and looking for an exciting upbeat resort than THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU!!!! I paid over 1200 for this resort and that is too much. I wouldn't even classify it as a 4.5* that is an absolute joke, this place is more like a 3.5*...if people have never been to a real 5* all inclusive they may actually think this place is great, but those who have really seen a resort know that the Punta Cana Princess is pitiful.spend your money elsewhere this resort is garbage-bob

<Content>Good Holiday, but ............. After spending Christmas and Newyear (2 weeks) at the PCP I have to say that we had a great time, the staff were friendly the weather wonderful and great company (traveled from Canada with my Husband and two teenage kids, to meet my sister and her family from the UK) The kids had the best holiday ever and met with lots of other kids and played volleyball all day everyday! So we were really happy. I have travelled a lot and didnt really have high expectations since I realise that I could spend at least another $6,000 for true 4 or 5 star hotel/resort, especially at this time of year. So we were prepared that not all will be upto a standard that we are used to and that was fine, we were prepared mentally. All we really wanted was to get away at that time of year and to relax in the sun and meet with our family. After visiting DR before (stayed at the Flamingo) also Mexico and Cuba Tunisia, and Turkey (all places are similar in the standards of hotel ) I think I have a lot of experience in knowing how to stay well with regard to the water and what NOT to eat. My family of four were all well and I think it may have something to do with my rules..... NO fruit or salad (usually it gets washed in the tap water) Never eat anything that has been left out at the Buffet, we always eat FRESHLY cooked food and if non available I would grab the chef and insist on it in a friendly way that is. The reason I'm telling you this is that my brother -in- law didnt stick to these rules and was very very ill just two days before the end of his holiday. He got home and he was rushed to hospital and it was realised that he had contracted the dreaded Salmonella poisoning, he was in hospital for 8 days and now is recovering at home. Since he is the chef at his own Bed and Breakfast this has serious implications for his business and life. His son was very sick for 6 days of his holiday, sick, runs and fever. I have never writen a review in my entire life since I really think that you will always find something you dont like, and it's only your OPINION anyways so why bother.I think if I'd paid top dollar then I would expect top everthing ! On the food..... Christmas and Newyears was really good, Lobster, dressed crab etc etc...fresh and good! I found because of my rules on eating I pretty much had a crappy diet for 2 weeks but it only took me a week to shed it when I got home. I ate french fries (insisted that I got fresh ones) for lunch at the beach and always found something at night, something fresh off the grill is the best way to go! Fresh eggs cooked by the chef and toast for breakfast. The Ice is fine as they use bottled water. Keep away from milky desserts too. My normal diet is salads and veggies so this is hard for me! The main reason for this review is to just warn people of this serious danger and if your going be careful.... If anyone wants to ask anything you can email me. The same rules would apply for me at any resort and I have found that I'm never sick when a high percentage of people are. At the flamingo two years ago people were being sick too.

<Content>Nice quiet resort Just returned from a week at the Punta Cana Princess. This was a clean, quiet resort with a beautiful beach. As other travellers have remarked on before the food was not all that great. We could usually find something to eat for breakfast and lunch at the buffets. At least the soup was hot! The Italian restaurant was the best. Everything was very hot. Even with a scalding hot plate the Tex Mex could not deliver hot food. Amazing!Beach was wonderful you could walk for hours. The service was hit and miss and it didn't matter if you tipped them so we stopped after 3 days. We had to chase the maid for clean towels every day that we were there. We paid about 1/2 price for this vacation so won't complain too much. Went for some RR and that's what we got. If you go don't set your standards too high and you will be fine. Unfortunately if you din't get the VIP package the drinks were local brands and not very good. The solution is to buy a bottle of good booze duty free. There is Coke and Sprite in the room and ask the bartender for ice.

<Content>But The Food, Above Average My wife and I were there from Nov 24 to Dec 8.Beautiful siteRoom was very clean, even inside desk's drawers.Always had enough towels and bath stuff, bottled purified water, soft drinks鈥?br/>Air conditioning works perfectlyTV鈥?only if you like CNNPresence of local security people makes you feel safe anywhere on the site.Pools were nice and clean. There were always free chairs at the pools and at the beach.At the buffet and at the various restaurants, Food was very lousy, very ordinary, nothing to talk about. I have to say I got sick after 11 days and could not try the Mama Mia nor La Cava restaurants. I needed antibiotics as I could not get rid of my diarrhea after 7 days. Service was excellent! Speaking some Spanish does help a lot!

<Content>Tropical Princess (Caribe Side) Dec8-Dec16 Just returned from PuntaCana had a great holiday, yes beaches beautiful and food was very good, especially at the Cava Restaurant (French cook) for the extra $50 well worth it. You can book the different restaurants every day and have service at no extra cost. We never got sick and fresh bottled water every where.The Bavaro Runners was a great experience to see the culture and mountain side, wow, rough ride and crazy driver's, saw sugar cane field, small villages and kids chase the bus for candy, so if you bring some it makes it fun watching them run to get some!!!!Just a reminder on the beach, barter low, half the price they ask is what its worth, they know the new people coming in because they are not tanned!! Ha, smart ah!Enjoy we did.

<Content>Another great Dominican holiday Stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from Dec. 4 to 11, 2005. This was our 3rd vacation in the Dominican Republic, specifically to Punta Cana in the last 4 years. As it turns out it appears we return here approximately every other vacation south.Previously we have stayed at Occidental Grand and the Fiesta Resort just a little south of the Punta Cana Princess. We would return to any one of these resorts but it is not likely as we try to go to different places.Punta Cana Princess is smaller than other resorts but that makes it quiet which appeals to us. We had no complaint with the selection or taste of the food and ate most of our meals in the main buffet restaurant. Unfortunately sometime on Thursday we ate something that disagreed with us and threw our stomachs off for about a day and a half. We think we narrowed it down to a hotdog at the beach restaurant. Staff was friendly and helpful. One exception was one day at lunch when we arrived near the end of the lunch period and most of the staff was involved with cleaning up the tables. No one noticed that we needed drink service. After waiting over 10 minutes we approached the bar and mentioned this and within a couple of seconds a waiter was at the table. This was the only glitch in service all week and it certainly was not a big deal and was dealt with as soon as they knew about it.The beach is superb and great for walking. Never appears to be any stones or coral to worry about when swimming. Because there is constant wind and surf at Bavaro beach it stirs up the sand and snorkeling right off the beach is a useless exercise. There are snorkelling excursions you can take to some great coral reefs but we didn't bother this time.Lots of para-sailing takes place right off the beach and every time I visit I'm tempted to try but haven't quite worked up the nerve yet. I am sure there will be another time.We took the shuttle to the sister resort and walked into town from there one day. Found many of the merchants quite aggressive and for me it took much of the pleasure out of what was meant to be a relaxing stroll. We had better luck avoiding the merchants on the beach who have shops set up a little ways north and south of the hotel. All you have to do there is walk down by the water and look the other way. You have to do the same thing with the time share salespeople. One time share scout approached me when I was walking by and asked the usual questions; Do you speak English? My answer: No German? A. No.French/ A. No. Chinese? This time I answered Yes and the salesman broke into a big smile and did his best imitation of someone chattering away in Chinese. We both walked away laughing.We found the service did not change whether you tipped or not but we have got into the habit of tipping, mainly with U.S. $1.00 bills. From what we hear the people there do not make much money and a few tips can make a big difference to them. After 3 trips to the Dominican and being pleased with the service every time I really have to wonder what kind of an attitude the people who write some of the blistering negative reports take with them when they travel.If you want wild partying and lots of action this is not the hotel for you. If you want peace and quiet and relaxation you will find it.

<Content>Good Trip But...... I've been to several all inclusive resorts. They are all variations on the same theme and the Punta Cana Princess is no exception. The pool is nice and clean. The beach is beautiful. The rooms are just fine. The shower has plenty of hot water and the A/C is cold. I booked the VIP package and it was well worth the extra $100 per person. We enjoyed having bathrobes (not a big deal but nice), a massage, better alcohol and a very good dinner at La Cava restaurant. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. We had a few glitches with our room reservation and all was taken care of in a timely and friendly manner. The resort is smaller than others we've been to and I liked that. The staff at the water sports area was great. The food is mediocre at best. Anyone who says that the food was delicious has never had a good meal. There are some items here and there that are fine. One day at lunch there was a perfectly roasted chicken. Rice and beans were good. Some fish was OK and some smelled off. Some desserts were tasty and some were odd like a prune mousse tart. Maccaroons were very good. Fried chicken at the beach buffet, at the afternoon tea, was quite tasty. I ate a mushy shrimp and was very sick for days. My sister-in-law is a vegetarian and she went home with a sick stomach too! One can get food poisoning anywhere, but since two of us got sick eating different things I have to believe there's a problem. The hot food is not hot enough and the cold foods not cold enough. Cheeses and cold cuts sat out for hours. I had no tasty fruit except for a banana and grapes. Omelettes at breakfast were cooked to order and were fine. The breakfast meats looked awful. If you pick and choose your foods you certainly won't starve. Dinner at the gourmet restaurant La Cava was a glowing exception to the otherwise poor food. It costs $25 per person, but it is included with the VIP package. Everything we ate was really good and the wine was better too.Martin the bartender in the lobby bar was my husband's favorite, but everyone there was great. There is no theater at this hotel ,though you can go next door ( walk or ride on a small tram or golf cart) to the sister hotels theater. Since the shows at these places are usually poor we stayed in the lobby most nights and enjoyed the festivites ( karaoke, dancing). We had a really good time here with the exception of the food poisoning!! I won't go back however because of the food. You can e-mail me mamie56@optonline.net

<Content>Great week in the sun We just returned on Sunday Dec 11. After having been in Punta Cana this past January for my son's wedding, I was doing quite alot of comparing. The Punta Cana Princess is a wonderful resort for those who want to relax, enjoy the sun, experience the layed back people in the Carribean.A few words of advise..Avoid the Casino!!! take plenty of sun lotions.. very expensive there, and also they don't have wash cloths, other than that, and that isn't a big deal, everything was wonderful. Rooms, very spacious and clean, food was great!!! there was three buffets and 7 al a carte restaurants to chose from. The variety is there, don't expect the food to be what you get in the large cities here.. ITS THE CARRIBEAN!! The people are so wonderful, tip them.. they deserve it, and the smiles you get is worth every penny.We also took alot of coloring books, crayons, pencils for the small children and toiletries for the women, once ago...worth the effort.Remember where you are.. respect the people and their culture, and you will have a great time!!!

<Content>Great little resort Just came back from a week's vacation at the Punta Cana Princess. Must admit that I was somewhat disappointed at first, given that I thought I had booked us in to the Bavaro Princess, which I had been to before. I found out at our arrival at the airport that in fact our hotel was the Punta Cana and not the Bavaro. When we first arrived at the hotel, our first reaction was so,so... The Punta Cana is much, much smaller than most of the resorts I have been to in Punta Cana (other resorts I visited are: Bavaro Princess, Flamingo, Barcelo Beach and Bahia Principe). But I must say that we really enjoyed this hotel. It is small and cosy, so one does not have to walk on and on to get from the beach to the reception. The fact that you also get access to the two Princess sister hotels (Caribe Club and Tropical) provides the same opportunity as the larger resorts.Rooms are very spacious with lots of storage space (I never travel light)with all the necessary amenities such as: fridge, coffee maker, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, etc. The only negative about the room was that it was a little smelly. Our room was in block 5000 on the second floor. It offered a great view of the pool and ocean. I would recommend asking for a room in block 4000 or 5000 on the second or third floor - third flood would provide best view of the ocean.Food is fine. The buffet is ok for breakfast and lunch but must admit that the best food is that which they cook on site such as omelettes and pasta. Other food tends to be on the cold or warm side. The resort offers access to 8 restaurants which are easy to reserve and you can go as often as you want. The one we preferred is Mama Mia which is located on the Caribe Club complex.Service is exceptionnal. Quick service and always with smiles. You even get bar service brought to you directly on the beach. No need to even get up from your lounge chair!!!The resort also as Spa which is the most beautiful one I have visited in the Dominican Republic. It is even better than the one at the Bahia Principe... Great massages at a reasonable price ($60 US).So all in all, we had a great time at the Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>Fabulous!! We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from Nov 26-Dec 3, 2005. Three girls, all 25. It was amazing. Like most other reviews said, the beaches were beautiful. There are bars everywhere, so you are never left without a drink. Lots of bottled water is always available too. Our room was in the 4000's on the 2nd floor. We had no problems at all. We usually had the buffet for breakfast and lunch. I enjoyed the buffet. There was a great variety and the food was really good. We had the dinner buffet one night, and it was actually pretty good too. I seen other reviews that said the buffets were horrible, but I didn't find that. If you have a chance, check out the lunch buffet at the Caribe (next door) its a little bigger and its really good! We ate at the a la cartes every night except for the first night. Just make your reservations each morning between 8-12 and you can get into most of the restaurants. The a la carte food was fabulous. All of the staff and the animation crew were amazing. Expecially the animation guys. They were so much fun. :o) The disco was great too. The only thing was that you had to pay for your drinks after midnight. So, word of advice, just drink lots before midnight. If you still want to party after the disco, you can always hang out with the staff. And, there is a 24 hour bar right on the beach and you can get food and drinks there. The staff at the 24 hour bar are always happy to see people and they will probably ask you to dance. Go for it, make their night go by faster. :o) Well, that's all I have to say for now. Punta Cana Princess was great and I would go back there.

<Content>Had a good time but ... My husband, two young daughters (6 and 3) and I just returned from a week at the PCP. We spent most of the time at the beach and the pool and our daughters loved it. The beach was beautiful, the pool was clean, and the staff were great.Now for the not so great:- When we arrived at our room (3004), it smelled really bad, a combination of mold, mildew and bleach. I am assuming it is because the rooms had been closed up for the renovations and had not been aired out. I went back to the front desk and we were given a new room in the 2000 block that did not smell as much - still a musty smell.- The safe in our new room required reseting so that we could reprogram the access code. After telling 4 or five different staff members (including the front desk) about our problem and spending the first day carrying our valuables around with us, it was fixed.- The food in the main buffet was edible but was only luke-warm at best. The pasta bar was good in that the food was heated up when you ordered your personalised pasta (our girls loved it). The a la carte restaurants were good and the food was hot.- There was always a nice breeze in the buffet eating area and we did not have a problem with the heat. The non-smoking area was not well defined and it seemed to change every day. There would be a few non-smoking signs on some tables that seemed to be surrounded by the smoking section.- We tried the buffet by the beach for lunch a couple of times but the food was very limited.- The rooms were cleaned daily but one day when we returned to our room to shower before dinner, we had only one clean towel for the four of us. I found the maid but she had no clean towels left. It took about 30 minutes before we had 4 clean towels. We also had to wait for clean beach towels one day.- On one of our 7 days there we had no hot water in the shower. All other days were fine.- The drinks at the bars varied by bartender and service at the pool bar was sporadic. Each time I ordered one of their advertised drinks (Coco Loco), the contents were different, varying from great to horrible.My girls were in and out of the kids club in the afternoons, but I did not leave them there unattended for any length of time. There is a small play structure outside that they could use, and some games, a play kitchen, a tv with VCR, some colouring papers with crayons and tables and chairs inside. My girls favourite activity was filling balloons with water in the kids club and carrying them around for the rest of the day.All in all we had a good trip as we were there for the beach, the ocean and the pool which were great. The staff were always friendly and helpful. It had the advantage of being small and on the quiet side, with the accompanying resorts (Caribe and the Tropicale) accessible for the nightly entertainment and some more a la carte restaurants.

<Content>Good resort, great people, great beach My husband and I just returned from the Punta Cana Princess (we travelled from Nov 15-22, 2005) where we were on our honeymoon. We booked 2 weeks prior to our departure and needed to pick up our tickets at the Sunquest counter at the airport. The ticket printer was broken, so anyone who had booked the night before had to have their tickets hand written. This was not the case for us, but we ended up waiting in line for 20 minutes waiting for those in front of us. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but there was another person behind the counter who wasn't doing anything, but wouldn't look at any of us in the line. Perhaps he didn't have the authority to hand out tickets?? I had read reviews for this resort prior to leaving and was a bit nervous, however I was pleasantly surprised. Sunquest has rated this as a 5 star, which I don't agree with (more like a 4) compared to other resorts I have been to. I read reviews of other resorts in this area and it seems that they all have similar issues. The two areas I was disappointed in were the buffets and the room cleanliness, but even these were not absolutely terrible. We did have some run-ins with cockroaches in our room...but it is a tropical island, so I guess this can be expected. This resort had been closed for a while so they could upgrade things - I know that the mattresses were new, and they were very comfortable. We were there while they were still filling up the resort, so it was pretty empty at the start of the week. I think they were still working out some kinks as a result of the closure. On to the good...the airport is beautiful and it took very little time to get through customs, pick up our luggage, and onto the bus. We were on our honeymoon, so we presented a photocopy of our marriage certificate to get the honeymoon package (rum in your room, bathrobes, extra beach towels, fruit, turn down service, romantic dinner in the seafood restaurant). The concierge was very helpful as we originally got a room with two double beds (even though our travel agent had specified king bed when we booked). Anyway, we ended up with a king bed that faced the lobby and gardens - a nice view, especially compared to our first room which kind of looked into the back of a building. Ask the maid or front desk for facecloths; they don't seem to put them in the rooms otherwise.The people (both staff and guests) at this resort were all wonderful, very friendly and helpful. The entertainment staff and bar staff were great and funny. I have read reviews that people don't like when staff doesn't speak English very well...remember you are going to a country where the language is Spanish! Take the opportunity to learn some - the staff seem to enjoy teaching Spanish and learning some English in the process.The a la carte restaurants were very good, our favorite was the Tex-Mex steakhouse, the Rio Grande. The filet mignon was fantastic. We found that we liked the restaurants at our resort better than the ones at the Club Caribe, but we were not able to get into the Brazilian restaurant, which we heard was good. The beach was gorgeous, beautiful soft white sand. There were always plenty of chairs, even towards the end of the week when the resort appeared to be fuller. It was very nice that we could visit the Club Caribe, but those guests could not visit our resort. As a result, our resort was never crowded.You might want to take a taxi back to the airport - $28 US for 5 people - well worth the money - the bus ride back to the airport was extremely bumpy and rough - not good for anyone with motion sickness of any kind! I wish that we had taken the taxi instead of suffering at the back of the bus. At airport check-in - Each of your bags cannot weigh more than 20 kg, or you have to pay (around $5US/kg) - this was not a problem for us, but there were many frantic people who only had the $20 US/pp they needed to leave the country, and not enough to pay for the overweight baggage. Your carry-on can weigh as much as you want, but the size does matter!So, good resort, great people, great beach!Feel free to email if you have any questions.

<Content>awesome hotel I went to this resort back in April and didnt bother to write a review at the time but having just got back on November 12 2005 from Breezes in puerto plata I just have to say there is no comparison, the PCP is an absolute palace compared to the other from the beach to the food to the rooms, especially the rooms!!!! so to whoever is heading to the DR trust me Punta cana is a better bet, now I had a great vacation at Breezes cause I drank enough rum to not bother about anything else and there was some delightful staff members as always but I will stick to Punta cana and Bavaro beach next time for sure. Feel free to e-mail me any questions about the place.

<Content>I personally thought it was amazing  I went to Punta cana Aug 2004 i also went down with 12 people and we all had a blast. We hung around the pool all day long and Nelson our Bartender treated us like kings and Queens.We gave him a Canadian hat and also at the 24 hr bar we met the bartender Fransico and waiter Antonio i tell you their English was great and were there to meet any and all of our requests!We took one Excursion the Horse back ride not all that fun and we really stayed on the resort the whole week.We did not like the Disco but liked the Casino and went to the 24 hr bar every night to play boci ball on the beach and have some drinks like the Blue Devil and Strawberry DaquerisI reccomend this resort if you want to enjoy exceptional service courteous employees and not a care in the world!

<Content>Paradise Spent 10 days with 5 members family, three teenagers, lodged in two bungalows in first range front to the sea, privacy guaranteed, in the middle of a garden with palms, luxury flowers alleys, rose flamngoss...The beach was very large not as some neighbour Hotels having very narrow beaches.Free sailing Hobbie Cats, snorkeling to Coral reefs at very cheap prices, excursions to protected islands were you are the sole person in miles, hot water, pelicans fishing just aside you, hundreds of incredible different fishes in colors eating bread form your hand...Many restauants or a buffet, too much to eat, specially very fresh mangos, pineapple, chinola (Maracuya),aguacates, and all tropical fruits.Obsesive rythms of bachata or merengue, caipirinhas, drinks, and long soft nights.The best of all is that we didn't need the assistance of employees, and even we didn't realize they were close to us taking care of everything and guranteing our security without our notice.The Dominicans are gentle with a permanent hapiness, an incredible sense of humour, enjoying life day by day.And finally here I am, in Barcelona, dreaming of this paradise and planning when to return to this wonderful Hotel.If you speak spanish, talk, meet and joke with Dominicans, they will return you twice more, and you will have a lot of fun...

<Author>Cancelled
<Content>So Upset I got a call yesterday from our travel agent telling us that the PUNTA CANA PRINCESS is under renovations and we will be moving to a different hotel. We were leaving in less than 20 days and they call to tell us this. This issue here is that it is for a wedding and there is more than 50 people going and now all the wedding plans have to be changed 20 days before the wedding day.Some of our friends had to book at the 'sister' hotel - The Caribe Princess and they aren't being moved because they didn't boook at the PUNTA CANA PRINCESSS because it was all booked (the travel agents were booking the hotel even though they new it wouldn't be ready yet)The issue here is that now we are over 5 minutes away from some of our friends and we can't go to their hotel and they can't come to ours.I can't believe that they didn't inform us of this prior to 20 days before the wedding. If they had told us that the PUNTA CANA PRINCESS was under renovations then our friends would of never booked at the neighbouring 'sister' hotel but instead the hotel they were going to move us to.Very unhappy.

<Content>Closed for Renovation My husband and I celebrated our 5 year anniversary at the Princess, Sept 2 to Sept 9. On our last day, guests were being moved to the Bavario since the Princess was closing for renovation on Sunday the 11th. The Princess was also very empty. We are from Orlando, Florida and are big beach people. We thought we could deal with heat. It was unbelievably hot the week we stayed. The night of our arrival we had to eat at the buffet restaurant since we had not made reservations. There are no paddle fans in the buffet restaurant or the lobby and we had to use our napkins to keep the sweat out of our eyes while we ate. My husband also had to wear long pants to dinner once we had made our reservations. It was terrible to see him sweating all the way to dinner at 8:00 at night.Ahhh...the buffet! This is the only bad thing I have to say about the resort. The breakfast buffet was the same just about every day. They have a made to order omlette bar, waffels, etc. But after 2 days the rest of our breakfast was toast and fruit. Lunch was not much better and room service (ham  cheese sandwich) was even worse. The evening restaurants were good. The two (tex mex and Italian) located at the Princess were very good. We also ate at 3 restaurants at the sister resort that were also good (La Cava, Sombrero and Chinese). Our appetites were not up to par since the heat was so bad. Toward the end, we booked any restaurant we could get as long as it was air conditioned.The people...could not have been more fantastic. The majority of the guests were from Spain. We speak very little spanish, communicating with them, although sometimes difficult, was a pleasure. They were so friendly and we made some very good friends. For the staff, 4 became very dear to our hearts. They went out of their way to make us happy, be friendly, and to help me work on my Spanish. The ladies of the lobby bar could not have been more wonderful. The best part of our entire trip was getting to know them. Please remember that a tip goes a long way. Change in US dollars is very difficult to get so we took $100 in ones and $100 in $5 and $10. Just their sharing of their culture was well worth a tip.The beach was beautiful. The sand is very soft and light which adds to the turquoise color of the water. There was never a problem with chairs at the beach or the pool. Excursions - we did the Lobster Tour and the Snorkel with Dolphins tour. As I stated earlier, most of the guests were from Spain. We were the only people that spoke english on the Lobster Tour and I thought the bus ride was going to be difficult. By the time we got off the bus later that day, everyone kissed and hugged us goodbye. Our television showed video of the Snorkel with Dolphins tour. The tour was so Not what the TV showed. Once on site, they suggest you don't even wear a mask and snorkel. The only thing different between your general swim with dolphins and the snorkel activity is that they let you float free in the center of the dolphin pool and you can pet them when they swim by.The room was great. Never a problem with water or power. We were in the 5000 series which is the building closest to the beach. I will say that out of all the people that we met, either one or both of them got sick during their stay, as did we. I tried to blame it on the Rum, but it seemed to happen to many people. Please remember to pack any medication you may need. I would not return to this resort since there are many other places that I haven't visited. They would also have to do something about the buffet food. On our last day, we actually celebrated that we didn't have to look at it any more!They estimate that the resort will open again for the Holidays. If you have any questions, you are welcome to contact me. I'd be happy to help.

<Content>Great place, except for the food We were at the Punta Cana Princess for a week during the winter of 2004-2005 for the wedding of a couple of friends. Being a while back, consider this a time-mellowed review that covers what we remember nearly a year later.Arrival - Getting off the plane, passing through customs, finding the bus, and handling our baggage went quite smoothly. Customs consisted of handing-over your money for the tourist card. Being a small airport, finding the bus to the resort was a no-brainer. Check-in - Check-in was also very smooth. The staff were ready for our arrival, and processed the group quickly. The baggage was sent to our room, and a drink was in our hands before we'd taken-in the setting. It was obvious that they were aware of the importance of first impressions. The room - By the time we booked, the better rooms weren't available. We had a ground-floor room looking toward the pool. Despite being on the lower end of the room scale, the room was large and comfortable. The pool and pathways on the grounds outside were set far enough away that we weren't bothered by noise, or folks strolling by. The A/C worked well, and the fans provided good air movement. The climate control shuts-down without a keycard in the activater-thingy, so expect a ten-minute delay before it's comfortable. Our only complaint about our room was that the patio and entry door weren't sealed all that well. A half-inch gap under the front door provided a freeway into the room for the endless parade of caterpillers. We found ourselves on tiptoes each time we were back in our room until we had time to de-bug (sorry PETA-folks, catch-and-release was not maintained... crunch-and-wipe was the order of the day).The grounds - This resort is not a large one. It's very well maintained, and the effects of the nasty hurricane season were only visible if you strolled down the beach and looked at some of the neighbooring resorts. The beach was fantastic. This resort has one of the best spots in the area, which we found-out while strolling a few klicks in each direction. The dive master related to us that the weather had been unusual since the hurricane seasion, kicking-up a lot of sand in the water. The waves were a good size, but never so large as to make swimming unpleasurable. However, if you're looking for crystal-clear water and picture-perfect snorkelling, you will be disappointed. The pool, swim-up bar, grounds, and beach were all excellent. I can't be certain of the capacity that they were running at during the week, but being late December, it must have been nearly full. Despite that, we never felt crowded. There was always ample room on the beach and by the pool. There were never line-ups for food or drink. This gave the resort a relaxed, comfortable feeling. The lobby provided an excellent evening spot for relaxing and chatting with friends. The open-air buildings were always cool, and the mosquitoes seemed to have taken the week off elsewhere. I've read other reviews complaining about the lack of A/C in the dining area and lobby. We didn't find that to be a problem at all, and likely would have preferred open-air to A/C if given the choice. Then again, if you're planning on going in June, you may want to pull-out an atlas and make note of the tropical location. I hear that Alaskan cruises are great...Activities - Being a smaller resort, there wasn't much in the way of activities. We enjoy relaxing (rhymes with 'lazy'), and so this didn't bother us at all. With a limited population at the resort, the staff, despite their best efforts, were hard-pressed to drum-up the usual fun games on the beach. Every day they would try to coax us into it, but were never pushy. If you're looking for an amusement park of a resort, this isn't the one for you. If you're adept at the max-relax, you'll love this place. Activity-junkies can always take advantage of the sister resorts, which are larger, and more crowded. Better yet, book a room at a resort that advertises the activities as a feature, and leave the snoozing on the beach to me, rotating every 15 minutes... ahhh, the bliss!The food - Alas, even nine months later, the food is still... memorable. Sunquest gave the resort a '5-star' rating. Either that rating was out of 6, or their reviewers survived on rum alone. The food was sub-par, at best. The buffet was best avoided, save for the made-to-order pasta. Of the resaurants, the Tex-Mex was the best. If gaining weight on a trip seems inevitable to you, this resort will break the pattern.A basic problem appeared to be that the food was designed to be bland, and North American. I would put dollars to doughnuts that the staff could have made excellent local food. As it was, cannaloni made with fish, and a dirth of flavour, shouldn't be tried at home, let alone in the DR. I understand why resorts try to cater to our tastes, but this resort was a good example of why that's a policy that should be followed with great care. The staff - Excellent. I can't say enough positive things about the staff. From the dinning staff, bar staff, diving team, lobby staff, and cleaning staff, excellent. The guest to staff ratio was solid; not once were we searching for a friendly staffer. Now, keep in mind that this isn't a thousand-dollar a night place. You aren't going to get wine recommendations with your dinner. If you need a somelier, you've spent about a third of the required money. Heck, if you want a choice beyond 'red or white', you're still only halfway there with your vacation spending. If you order the same drink every day, expect a wild variation in what actually makes it into your glass, if you venture beyond rum and coke or beer. The lobby bartender at night knew his stuff, and was obviously the senior bartender at the resort. The beach and pool bartenders were... creative. If you appreciate a decent scotch, then book ahead and get the upgraded bevie package. Then again, if you fall into that category, read about the food before you book.In any case, the entire staff was extremely friendly, helpful, tolerant, and attentive. No reasonable request was turned-down. If you want your mini-fridge in your room stocked with something, leave five dollars and a note for the cleaning staff (we did that once, and for the rest of the week the fridge was stocked with cold water and beer, even though we expected that to be a one-time thing). The policy seems to be all smiles, all the time, and they execute on that policy. Overhearing one decidedly ignorant guest get a dinning staff member's attention by yelling, Hey, amigo!, I was surprised to see him smile and do his best to make the guest happy. As with all resorts, a well-placed fiver, a modicum of spanish, a little patience for 'island-time', and a smile will get you just about anything you need to make your trip a good one. Even without the tip, spanish, and smile, I'm sure that the service would be great.Overall - We're not planning on returning to this resort. That's not to say that it was terrible, overall it was a very good trip. It's a solid 4-star resort. To gain a half-notch, or even a full notch, the quality of the food needs to make a stellar leap. A little weather stripping on the doors of the ground-floor rooms wouldn't hurt either. I was torn between a 3 and a 4 rating only because of the food. I've decided on a 4 because our positive memories of the resort outweigh the negative. Basically, the staff and the beach tipped the balance toward a 4, despite the cringe that the phrase 'seafood canalloni' still produces.If you're a couple looking for a medium-small resort with an excellent beach, great pool, and winning service, without spending a fortune, then go for it. If food is a major part of your typical vacation experience, give this resort a year or two to adjust (which I hope they will).This year we're looking at trying Secrets in Punta Cana. The food reviews look promising... maybe this time I'll get home a pound or two heavier, not including my liver.

<Content>Would go back again and again Went to the bavaro princess resort from August 19th to the 26th. There was a group of 15 of us and 4 of the 15 were children from ages 5 to 12.We all had a wonderful time. The food was great, the beach is fantastic and the people were very nice. If you are vip and want to make reservations for the restaurants you must do this at the vip conceirge stand. NOT AT THE FRONT LOBBY. We ate at a different restaurant every night and never had a problem with our entire group eating together. The kids even liked the food. It is a very big resort. It took us a day to find out where everything was but we had alot of fun doing it. We had no problems checking into our room or with any of the service. Our shower was broken and when we called it was fixed within 15 minutes. VIP has some benefits. My husband had all the Heinken and Miller beer that he wanted. If you order room service you can get an entire bottle of unopened wine or champagne. Their white wine is great.As far as a hut on the beach we got up early to get one, but if you go out to the beach around 2 there are many huts available. At night it is nice to sit under one of the bar huts. Very nice breeze. Better than sitting at the lobby watching the shows where it is too hot. If you tip the bartenders at the beach restaurant they will come out to the beach hut and wait on you. If you are good to them they are good to you. Bring a radio if you have one since there is no night life on the beach. All of us loved the resort and the food. Try the Chopin buffet. It was excellent. The El Gaucho restaurant had a very good filet mignon. We would all go back again.

<Content>Great resort and location My wife and i just returned from the Bavaro Princess and I have to say we loved it. I am extremely particular and have been to the Dominican Republic several times. The beach, service, food, room and landscape was excellent. The nly complain I have might be that some people were a little noisy on the beach and there were many people from Spain partying in the pool that were very loud. Otherwise it was great. Here are my reviews by category:Beach: Excellent sand, beautiful water for swimming and scenery.Rooms: Large suites. AC was excellent. The bed was firm and very comfortable. Cable TV and mini fridge was stocked and included. Room was very clean. Food: Buffet is available for every meal and the selection and freshness was great. Allways a Pasta station and grill where you can have pasta, steak, fish or chicken made to order. In the AM, there is a juice bar where fresh juice is made to order and an omelette bar. There are several ala carte restaurants that are all good that require reservations, however i preferred the selection of the buffet. The buffet dining room was very nice.Service: Outstading and allways with a smile. Really nice people. Give them a dollar a day since the average wage in the DR is $200 per month. They were allways filling glasses, taking dirty plates away, etc. Landscape: Immaculately maintained. The gardens were spectacular. There are also exotic birds roaming around like Peacocks and Pink Flamingo's and odd varieties of ducks. Great for kids and even adults like me!Entertainment: A bit better than expected. They were amateurish, but fun and funny. Better than other resort entertainment offered by staff. Every evening there's a band that played for around 20 minutes including merengue, followed by a show.Activities: Sailing, wind sailing. activities all day by the pool including water aerobics, dance lessons (very entertaining), volleyball, shuffleboard, soccer on the beach, etc.I highly recommend this place. I was considering the Secrets Excellence resort that cost almost 50% more. No need to go there. This is a great place. Not sure what people with the bad reviews expected.

<Content>stay away this is not the place for you if your looking too have fun.there is nothing to do for excitiment beside go to the pool which is full of bugs and feels more like a jacuzzi than a refreshing experience.the food and drinks is horrible. you feel like ur in a lunchroom where they cater to the masses with cheap food and drink rather than with quality and flavor. the shows at night are boring might as well stay in the room and the animation during the day is non exsistant. forget about getting anywhere fast the place is far too big and not enough trolly cars. get ready to walk and walk or wait nearly half an hour for a trolly. it's ridiculous. you would have a better time at barcelo bavaro beach resort. p.s. stay clear of the gift shop if you don't want to be robbed with the prices.

<Content>Traveller's Disease waiting to happen! The following is my review of the Punta Cana Princess All-Suites Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (I visited this property 8/15-8/22/05): After a great deal of shopping around, my girlfriend Heather (24) and I (23) chose Punta Cana Princess (PCP) All-Suites resort for our vacation. We used the reviews on Debbie's (and another site) and prices provded by our travel agent to shop around for the best value. We specifically wanted a 5-star property. This review is going to be long and detailed, as I just returned two days ago and have quite a lot to say. We were originally interested in Jamaica or Mexico. However, Dominican Republic seemed to offer far better value. Since our prime interest was relaxation, Dominican Republic seemed to be the best choice for us. We arrived on a Monday at about noon. As we had been told ahead of time, check-in time was 3pm. Onto the review! Check-in:Check-in was rather smooth for us. Based on my previous experiences, we sat near the front of the bus and were the second in line for check-in. There were only 2 desks open for two busloads, and it seemed to be taking 5 mins per check-in! I doubt the people at the back of the line felt as good about their check-in. We were supplied with our room keys (cards), towel cards, bracelets, and a sticker to put on our luggage so it could be delivered to our room. We were not supplied a map of the resort. If you want a map of the resort, go to the Guest services desk to the left of the check-in counter and ask for one. This is NOT a 5-star Right away I noticed it. Right on the bracelet was marked * * * * sup. Sunquest lists this resort in their catalog as 5-star. This was clearly false information.By 2PM, we were hot and tired. We decided to try our room. Alas! It was ready early!The BuffetRight after check-in, we made our way to the buffet. The very first thing that caught my eye - The buffet is NOT AIR CONDITIONED. There is a nice breeze going through, but it is hot and humid nevertheless. The food was TERRIBLE at the buffet. I'm not a snob. I don't eat at expensive resteraunts at home, and my standards are not very high on vacation. However, it was nearly impossible to eat at this buffet. Breakfast is a hard meal to mess up. Made-to-order omellets are generally good anywhere you go. However, when the chef douses the cooking surface with what must have been 3-4 tbsps of oil for each omelet, what results is a fresh omelet that tastes as much like oil as it does like egg. On the buffet itself was bacon, which was poorly cooked and almost pure fat. The eggs on the buffet were terrible. All of the pastries were mediocre. The fruit was not fresh, nor was it any good. After trying everything to find something good to eat for the first few days, I ended up settling for toast with margarine and jam. Very dissappointing. Lunch and Dinner were equally awful. My girlfriend is a big vegetable lover. She was terribly dissapointed by the poor quality of the vegetables, and the very limited choices. All of the prepared salads had HAM in them. The lettuce was not dried - it was literally SWIMMING in water at the bottom. The creamy dressings that were available were cloppy messes. There were various oils and vinegars, which were okay. ALL of the cooked vegetables were the same. They were all made in some sort of butter sauce (and thus tasted like nothing but butter). Don't expect any good healthy choices, not even fresh/grilled/steamed vegetables.There was a pasta-to-order chef cooking custom pasta at lunch and dinner. The pasta was okay, probably the most edible thing available on the buffet. I personally enjoy beef. I was terribly dissapointed in this respect. A few times, there was no beef dish at all. A few other times the beef dish was empty and was not refilled in the entire time I was at the buffet. When I did get beef, it was fatty, chewy - basically your standard poor quality meat. The chicken at the buffet was perpetually over-cooked, though it was probably the best prepared of any of the meats. The fish was mediocre, and (pardon my pun) had a fishy taste to it. There was often a chef grilling fish fresh-to-order, but, similiarly to the omelets, it tasted like oil more than fish.I should also mention that despite heat lamps, most of the food was only luke-warm, and was often old, having sat out for way too long. The french fries (a no brainer, right?) were always cold and mushy, as if they had been cooked hours ago. Deserts were mediocre. The ice cream was good, although there is only one scoop, so it can often be an exercise in patience while you watch seven little Spanish-speaking children with no manners cut in front of you. The cakes were generally bad - it seems hard to mess up a chocolate cake, but alas it was awful. The cheesecake was good - but they only had it on the buffet 2 days out of 7 that we were there. Most of the pastries, including the cookies, were mediocre. How do you mess up cookies? I have no idea... but they did.I should say that other less discriminating folks seemed to be piling food onto their plates and enjoying it. I don't consider myself picky, but I guess to some people A LOT of food equals GOOD. However, if you value food quality, or you have any desire to eat even somewhat healthy, I don't think you will like the food on this buffet. Notably, if the buffet area was air-conditioned, food would probably be better as humidity has a way of degrading food quality. On a positive note, the waiters at the buffet were good-to-excellent. Most of the time, they were quick to server water (or coffee) at breakfast. They would also get you any drink you wanted on request. They would even take bar drink orders for you. If you like coffee, I suggest asking for a cappucino. The regular coffee leaves a lot to be desired, and the espresso-based beverages are much better.To briefly describe the smaller buffet near the beach - it was disgusting. The hotdogs were TERRIBLE. There were hamburger buns, but they never had any hamburgers. Overall, a terrible disappointment. This smaller resteraunt is also the only 24hr food source - in short, unless you're desperate, wait until breakfast... A La CarteOn the first night, due to arriving after noon, we were not able to make a reservation at an A La Carte resteraunt. The second day, I woke up in the morning and made a reservation for the that night at the Rio Grande (Tex-Mex) and for the next night at the Mexican Restaurant (which is at the next resort over). Rio Grande offers the best food anywhere on the resort. When you arrive, you are served hot corn chips along with salsa, green salsa, guacamole and cheese sauce to dip in. Excellent start. The appetizers were decent. I had the taco, which despite it's description is just some paste of a sauce wrapped in a soft taco shell. It was okay, so I don't care that they described ingredients and just used a paste. The main courses were excellent. I recommend the Beef Filet. It was the best piece of meat available at the resort, in my opinion. Heather had the Filet Mignon, which was decent, although she ordered it medium and they cooked it well-done. On our second visit, Heather had the Cheeseburger - and they forgot the cheese! Nevertheless, it was very decent meat. Also, notable is that the A La Carte restaurants are air conditioned, which is a pleasure when you're used to eating outside in the humidity.The Mexican resteraunt (located on the neighboring property, 5-10 mins walk away) was a disappointment after our first night's experience at Rio Grande. The Appetizer menu seems nice, until you realize that all it is is a desription of the dips that are served with your corn chips (the same as the Rio Grande serves). There are no actual appetizers to be ordered. The food here was okay, nothing special, and the Rio Grande was better. On our third night, we tried the Italian restaurant. The Calzones were okay, if you like meat. The only vegetables that they had were brocoli, cauliflower and carrots - strange choices for calzone fillings, in my opinion. The pasta dishes and pizzas/calzones are full size, so don't expect to be able to have one as an appetizer. We tried, and they told us that it was a main course and we couldn't have both. Overall, the Italian was decent, but the Rio Grande remained our favorite. One thing - whatever you do, DO NOT order the carpaccio. I know ... what was I thinking? I'm not sure if it was a coincidence, but it was the night after I ate the carpaccio that I got sick. Then again, Heather did not eat the Carpaccio, and she got sick one day after me ...The RoomOur room was excellent. The first thing I noticed - within seconds of putting my card in the slot (that activates the power and AC in the room), there was a very nice stream of cold air coming out of the Air Conditioner! The room was very spacious. We got the King-size bed that we requested. There was also a pull out bed in the living room area. We had a balcony that faced the pool with a little bit of ocean in the distance. The decor in the room was simple yet very nice. The mini-fridge was stocked with beer and soda, but strangely no water. No problem - we just got bottles of water from the bar, two at a time, and stocked it ourselves. The bathroom had two sinks, which was nice. The bath/shower was spacious. The water temperature left a lot to be desired. It took a good two minutes for anything other than cold water to come out. Even with the water set to the very hottest setting, the water was just-warm at best and barely luke warm at peak times. At one point, the water was dead for about an hour. I called guest services, and they apologized and said there was a maintenance issue and the water would be back shortly. It was back within an hour.Closet and drawer space was plentiful. You won't have trouble finding drawers for all of your stuff, no matter how much you bring. We were on the second floor. Sound proofing of the rooms was decent, as long as people kept their doors closed. Unfortunately, some very rude Spanish folks across the hall from us like to make noise at 7:30 every morning. Their favorite thing to do was to knock and then yell through the door. A dirty look from me and they stopped. There is no soundproofing to speak of between the floors/ceilings. If you're not on the top floor, expect to hear every step, every dropped item and every loving-bed-thump from the people above you. Lucky for us, the people above us were creatures of habit and always stopped making noise about half an hour before we liked to go to sleep, so it was no problem for us. Maid service was slow. We were never out of our room early enough for the early run (usually we took of the DND sign at about 10:30am) and so we had to wait until around 2-4pm to have the room cleaned. One day, it wasn't cleaned until 5:30pm! We tipped every day, and were treated to towel-animals, decorated with flower petals. On a side note - the maid never once refilled our toilet paper, even when it was COMPLETELY EMPTY - we constantly had to go ask for it as we ran out.The PoolThe pool was beautiful and well kept. There were always plenty of empty chairs, and plenty of sombreras to offer shade if you choose. The pool bar is nice, however at most times there was only one bar tender to handle both the in-pool side of the bar and the adjoining bar for those not in the water. Towel service is NOT at the pool, it is on the beach. This is annoying, because you are forced to get your feet sandy to get towels. It didn't make much sense, but the towel service was decent nevertheless. The pool bar attracted all of the loud day-time drunks. Situate yourself far from the pool bar if you want peace and quiet.The BeachOne word - beautiful. The white sand and crystal blue water left little to be desired. There were plenty of chairs. I never tried to get drink service on the beach, so I can't comment on that. The ToursI did not take any tours, so I can not comment on these. The excursions are rather pricey, and to be honest I personally went to the Carribean to relax and so tours just aren't my thing. We did, however, go parasailing. We paid our $80 (for 2 people) and showed up at the designated time. Five minutes later, we were picked up by a boat and taxied up and down the coast while we picked up a few other passengers. We then met up with the parasailing boat, and were asked to change boat mid water. This was fine for me, but it might be dangerous for older folk and young children. Parasailing was fun - a nice relaxing 10 min float. However, as they were lowering us back into the boat, they slowed to much, and we were pulled under water for about 1 second. I thought it was a bit strange, and after I got back I looked into it - it turns out that dunking is extremely unprofessional and dangerous. I thought so. Getting pulled under water while harnessed is very bad. As such, I would not recommend the parasailing in Punta Cana. The GymHeather is an avid gym-goer. On the first afternoon, we made our way to the gym. It was very small - one treadmill, one eliptical machine (that was broken for our entire stay), dumbells, a couple of barbells and two weight machines. We figured that this was the gym for PCP, and so we asked where the gym was for the other two larger resorts. There was none! This was it! The amazing thing is that the gym was ALWAYS empty. There was never more than a single other guest working out when we were there. I guess most people just don't go to the gym on vacation ... All in all it was adequate, but only because we had the place to ourselves. If there had been 3-4 guests there, it would have been very crowded. The InternetI paid $7 for 30 mins of Internet access half way through the trip just to check my e-mail, etc. I was amazed - in a world where a decent, basic Logitech keyboard costs $10, this $12/hr internet cafe had a keyboard that could not have cost more than $2. It was honestly terrible. I'm a 65 WPM typist and I could barely type. Aside from that, the internet worked fine, connection speed was fine ... no complaints. The Service in GeneralA friendly hola is required by all staff as they walk by you. It's a nice touch. The staff did not speak English. Some couldn't speak a single word. Generally, I don't care - I don't need to converse with them, and the staff with specific jobs that required speaking (such as the waiters) spoke just enough to do their jobs. The problem was the you could not special order your food (easy on the grease, for example) nor could you enquire about it (What's the best crepe on the menu? for example). The staff was friendly, which matters more than anything. Do expect a thick language barrier, though. One interesting thing that we noticed is that roles are divided by genders. All of the waiters were males. Women were only allowed to serve drinks. I just thought it was a bit odd, but I guess it's cultural.ConclusionTo begin, despite the shortcomings, Heather and I sucked it up and made the most out of our vacation. However, I would never return to this resort. I was tricked by Sunquest into going to a 4+ when it was a 5* I was seeking. In fact, I could have gone to another resort owned by the same company in the same part of the same town, the Bavaro Princess for EXACTLY the same price, and that resort is actually a 5*. The food was awful. It only took 4 days for me to get traveller's disease (known more commonly as awful, endless diarhea), and I did not even drink the tap water! I like boast that I have an iron stomach, because I can eat just about anything in abundance and I NEVER get sick to my stomach - yet I found myself visiting the toilet for 20 mins every 2 hours for 18 hours one day during my trip. Not pleasant. The buffet was not air conditioned, and the buffet food was terrible. It's hard to mess up on pastries, for example, but the Princess Pastry department has no trouble mucking them up every day. If you like food just because it's food, or if you have a disorder and don't eat, this would be the resort for you. Everything aside from the food was just fine. However, the food was SO bad that I really couldn't recommend this resort to anyone with ANY TASTE AT ALL. Sorry for the harshness.In closing, I'd like to answer to the reviewer who wrote if you can't find something to eat here, you're just too picky. You are correct. The bread and butter were just wonderful! Please feel free to contact me at jordancohen@sympatico.ca if you have any questions.

<Content>Great Vacation!! My husband and I just got back from the Punta Cana Princess and we cannot wait to go back again. We went from Aug. 8 - Aug. 15 and the weather was perfect!! Everything about the vacation was amazing!! The Hotel Size and our room- Perfect!! There are around 215 rooms and every room had a beautiful view. We had a 30 second walk to the pool and a 2 minute walk to the beach. (We visited another resort that was huge. People had to take a shuttle to the beach from their room.) We had a really comfortable king-size bed and also a huge couch that was in front of the tv. We were both shocked because there were great channels such as ESPN, Cinemax, HBO, Showtime, news, etc. The rooms were also cleaned to perfection everyday. We had great air conditioning. We were extremely pleased with our room and everything about it. The Pool and Swim-up Bar - The pool was a nice size and there were activities going on all day long such as water volleyball, water polo, and water aerobics. The swim-up bar was never too crowded and you always could get a good cold drink. We were disappointed that the pool closed at 7pm. My husband and I really wanted to take a swim most nights after dinner, but couldn't because it was closed. Hotel Grounds - Breath-taking!! They worked very hard everyday to keep the grounds manicured to perfection all over. The palm trees are larger than any other place we have ever been to and plus there are a ton of them!! There are some really cool statues all over the resort too. The Beach - My favorate part. The beach is such a beautiful blue. There is a small amount of seaweed, but what beach doesn't have that? There are small waves that make the water a fun place to play. This resort has kayaks, boggie boards, snokeling gear, hobie cats, and more that is included for the guests. Take advantage of all of these activities because they are really fun. There is also a dive shop on the resort on the beach. We actually went diving to a ship wreck and that was really cool. The dive master was really good and able to take us through the interior of this huge ship. I recommend diving in Punta Cana especially with this place. The sand is white and very fine. It is almost like a powder. Also very important, no matter what time of day you go to the beach, you will always find plenty of chairs to relax in and plenty of shade. The sun is intense so I recommend bringing lots of sun block. The Food - Not the greatest, but we always found something to eat. We really liked their pizza for lunch and the tex-mex restaraunt for dinner. They had great filet mignon cooked to perfection!! We did not get sick at all from the food which was a concern of ours from previous reviews. Tipping - Not required, but we tipped all the time. Before the vacation, we went to the bank and got $100 in ones. Everyday, we gave the maids candy and some money. At the nice restaraunts we would give a couple dollars. We gave the bartenders some money here and there. We ended up tipping around $75 the entire vacation and it was worth it. The employees work very hard to make sure our vacation is enjoyable. The workers have lots of enthusiasm and are a real pleasure to be around. They have great personalities and really enjoy their job!! Tips - Avoid the gift shops. Try to take everything you think you would ever need. The prices in the gift shop were insane. Our friends bought a disposable camera for $20 there and sun tan lotion for $25. The worker would not come down on the price at all. I tried to buy a tiny bottle of solarcane and they wanted $18 for it. I was shocked at the outragous prices in there. Bring all types of medicine and sun block just in case to prevent from having to pay those rediculous prices. Also bring some snacks from home. We really wanted some potato chips or just a taste of something from home. I hope this helps and you will not go wrong from picking the Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>I want to go back! My husband and I went to the Punta Cana Princess from July 30 - August 6 and we we loved it.Arrival: The flight was very long as well as the bus ride so by the time we got to our resort we were hungry and tired! We were greeted with Pina coladas and friendly staff. Check in was quick and simple. Rooms: We had our room in the 5000 builing on the second floor. It was very nice, exactly as it is pictured on the website. Kind size bed, sunken living room, balcony with oceanview. AC worked perfectly and the maid refilled our room with drinks and new towels everyday. She also make a cute design with my night gown and my hubby's PJ's.Pool: Didn't go into the pool the first few days as we swam in the pool but the last few days that we did go in it was clean. Our room overlooked the pool and every morning I saw staff cleaning the pool and the surrounding area. Never had to save chairs even the ones under a palapa.Hotel: This is a quiet hotel which I didn't mind at all. The grounds of the hotel were very nice and clean. The gardeners worked very hard in the hot weather, trimming and cutting and landscaping daily.Food: We never went hungry staying here! The 24 hr all-inclusive is a real plus as well as being able to eat at the sister resorts. Food at the main buffet was good, the made to order eggs and pasta were great. They had a theme almost everynight with different selection of foods. we didn't eat at the main buffet much though because we preferred the larger selection at the sister buffet. We also booked a la cartes for every night. We wanted to try all the a la cartes but couldn't make it on 2 nights. We did try the Tex Mex, the Italian, The Mexican (CCP), The Dominican (TP), The Chinese (CCP). Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant. The Dominican restaurant wasn't so good. Had the filet mignon at the Tex Mes which was recommended by many and it was perfect, my hubby had the ribs and he said they were delicious. Lamb at the Italian were also very good as well as the Salmon filet. We also tried the beach restaurant at the PCP for breakfast and snack and they had very good pizza and fried chicken! Tried the beach restaurant at the TP as well, not a very large selection but good as well. The Buffet at the PCP/TP was where we ate our lunches and breakfast mainly. Very good selection, wasn't very busy but compared to the PCP I guess it would be. They has a pasta station and 2 grill stations making fresh meat all the time. Drinks were always refilled, never had my glass empty for longer than 2 minutes before someone came and brought me a new drink or asked me if I wanted another. Same as plates, they were cleared seconds after finishing it. Food was always hot and fresh when we went. Bars: Always got a drink in under 1 minute. Never watered down, once they gave me 1/3 rum in my pina colada! Too strong for me. Service was fast and friendly.Beach: Picture perfect! I did see them clean the beach very often, raking seaweed and combing the sand. Also there were staff cleaning the beaches of litter everyday round the clock. Once again, never had to save a chair. PCP/TP: The sister resorts were nice as well, they had 3 pool altogether but we didn't go in any of them as our pool was big enough. The tram that goes aroundt he resorts came probably every 10 minutes, sometimes we had to wait but other times we like to walk along the beach or across the paths to the other resorts. The grounds were very nice to walk through.Overall: Very nice and clean hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful, always got a friendly Hola from any staff that walked by. The shared ammenties is a real plus. There was plenty of variety of good food, especially with the 8 a la cartes, 3 buffet restaurants and food 24/7! It's hard not to be able to find anything that you liked! We loved the PCP and would go back any day!

<Content>Not the best, but not the worst We visited the Punta Cana Princess the first week of August. Overall, the resort was good value for the reasonable price we paid. I would rate it a solid four...it is definitely not a five as some sites may rate it.Here is the break down:Resort - the resort itself was very clean and well maintained. However, if you are looking for fun and excitement, this is not the place. It was very quiet and activities were minimal.Food - the buffet was average, but please be careful what you eat. Many people, including us, all got sick at one point or another. I would recommend eating a la carte every night for dinner. Lots of options because you can visit the restaurants at the sister hotel Caribe next door. TexMex Restaurant - the filet mignon was greatIl Baccio (Italian)- calzones were amazingShangay (Chinese) - deliciousMexican Restaurant - good, but they don't have soft tortilla shellsBrazilian - great and unique dining experienceMare Nostrum (Seafood) - different, but goodLa Creperie - awesome! Bars - keep this in mind...no one at the resort speaks English so knowing basic Spanish will go a long way. There is no drink menu so when you see someone with a drink that you like, ask them what it is so you can order it too. Be cautious of the mashed banana drinks that may upset your stomach.Beach - absolutely perfect. Gorgeous white sand beach and chairs are always available.Pool - pools were good, but definitely more going on at the Caribe. If you like peace and quiet, stay at Punta Cana Princess. If you like activity, go the Caribe pools. The pool at Punta Cana Princess was much cleaner. The pools at the Caribe had too many bugs.Weather - the weather was great the week we were there, but can be unpredictable. A lot of humidity, so ladies don't even think about trying to straighten your hair. I went curly all week with lots of de-frizz.Other tips to rememeber:- Building 4 or 5 are great; closest to the pool and the beach- Use bug spray in the evening to avoid bug bites- Book your restaurant reservations at least one night in advance to avoid disappointment- Visit the Bavaro Princess at night - this is definitely a 5 star and the shows are so much better here than at the Caribe- Visit the Casino if you like gambling - pretty impressive and there are coupons for $5 matching your playOverall, our visit was good and it served its purpose of some rest  relaxation in a nice environment.

<Content>PCP Paradise Vacation Just returned back from our first vacation in DR on Monday. My daughter (18 yrs. old) and I had a great time. We were a bit concerned with weather, sickness and hurracaine issues but turned out had absolutely nothing to worry about.Flight by Skyservice went very smooth. Only complaint was how cold the plane was and lack of blankets. Arrived at PC Airport and was quickly transported by Sunquest bus to resort.Check in at resort went quickly. Offered us cold drinks while we waited in line. Front desk greeter was very friendly and met us with a big smile and a bit of personal chit chat. Room was not ready but only a 45 minute wait. Gave us a chance to grab a cold drink at the lobby bar and walk around for our first look at the resort. Bags were brought right to room by Bellboy when ready. Room was exceptionally clean and cool as AC was already running. Room had two double beds, ceiling fan, sunken living room with sofa bed, television, bar fridge that was stocked daily by maid with beer, coke,sprite and bottled water. Had our swimsuits on and were in the pool within minutes of getting our luggage.The PCP is so quiet and private. Never a problem to get a lounge chair at the pool or beach. No lineups at the bar. A la carte could be booked every night if you wanted. Food at a la carte restaurants was great. Especially enjoyed the fillet mignon at the Steakhouse and the Calzone at the Italian. Booked four nights of restaurants, ate buffet 1 night and enjoyed dinner on the beach at the Saturday night Beach Party. Always lots to eat and plenty of selection. Neither my daughter or I suffered any sickness. We did make sure our tetnus shots were up-to-date and got a hep A shot on the advice of our doctor.My daughter and I both did well purchasing souvenirs at the local beach vendors booths. They love to barter. Word of warning...their prices start very high, however, they are happy to negotiate. PCP guests have the opportunity to share all of the facilities of both the Carible and Tropical and yet they could not use ours. That meant great restaurants, bars and entertainment to use there with quiet and private facilities at our resort. The best of both worlds. The shuttle to Caribe was convenient and kind of nice on a hot, summer evening. Walk was very short if you didn't want to wait for shuttle. We went to see the entertainment every night. The DR people really put on some great shows. Nothing more relaxing than sitting under the stars with a cold drink and watching a show.Beach was beaaaautiffffulll! Blue water and soft sand. We enjoyed a few long walks along the beach shore as well as swimming in the crystal clear water. Weather made it all the better. Sunshine ever day of our vacation. Very warm but who can complain when you have a cold drink in your hand and the cool water a step away. Staff at resort were very friendly. Never had to wait to be served for food or drinks. First night there, realized sliding door lock was broken. Probably nothing to be concerned about but being two females travelling alone thought it best to get fixed. Went to lobby at 10:00 pm and told them problem. They had a repair man in our room within 5 minutes. He replaced both sides of the door lock and had it locking properly within 15 minutes. Maid left lots of clean towels with pretty fresh flowers laying on them each day. Fridge was stocked and room was clean including sparkling clean sliding door windows. We made sure to bring a lot of goodies so that we could leave her gifts every day. It was very much appreciated. Flight home was smooth. Biggest complaint about whole trip was Skyservice handling our luggage. We waited at the carousel for over an hour. When approached by us as a large group of concerned travellers, the reps had no answers and actually left their booth to avoid us. Skyservice will undoubtedly receive lots of complains about this and lose some business. It was a fantastic holiday! We will definitely return to the DR again some day and this resort would be at the top of our list of choices to stay!

<Content>Will Not Return to the Punta Cana Princess Just returned from Punta Cana Princess and it was the first vacation in a long time that we were more than ready to leave. First let me say that this was our second trip to Punta Cana this year. We stayed at the Ocean Blue in March for one week and loved it, including the food. The OB main food buffet was always very FRESH and the alacartes were very good. Not so at the Punta Cana Princess. First of all the GOOD:The weather was perfect, not a drop of rain all week.Checkin and checkout were no problem.The resort is layed out nicely (very much like Ocean Blue) and the staff for the most part were helpful and friendly.The room was spacious with plenty of closet and drawer space, double sinks and nice balconies. The air conditioning worked well. We stayed in building 4000 on the second floor.The beach, as we already knew, was great and the ocean was the perfect temperature.Dinner reservations for the alacartes were easy to make - we made them all in one day. Guest Service desk was good.Now for the BAD:The food at the main buffet was terrible. Perhaps the lack of air conditioning was the reason. Some of it (especially the cheese and fruits) looked like it was recycled from the last meal. The breakfast buffet was probably the worst. The OJ was from a can and not cold. The pancakes and waffles were never made fresh, always laying in a cold tray and tasted like rags. When I asked one of the cooks to make me a fresh waffle, he said, No. The bacon was all stuck together and tasted terrible. The breads weren't great either -- not much taste and sometimes they were stale. The sweet buns were Yuk! The only thing that was OK were the eggs, that were cooked to order. Although, they were fried in a lot of oil. The lunch buffet wasn't much better. Hope they repaired the pizza warmer by now. You couldn't get a hot slice of pizza. The Caribe buffet was a ZOO! We didn't eat at the buffets at night, we ate at the alacartes. They were hit and miss -- mostly miss. One night we were at the Tex Mex and ordered filet mignon. They served it ROAR! And the waiter said that's what we ordered! We said, Medium Rare, not Roar. As far as the drinks, we only drank wine which was OK. The bar drinks were awful. We did have more than a touch of illness (both of us) as did MANY of the other guests we talked with. Most did complain about the FOOD! This did not happen at Ocean Blue. Luckily we had an antibacterial prescription with us that we both took for 3 days.Don't count on the shuttle to the Caribe - it's quicker to walk.The Pool: The first day we arrived the pool was a little murky and was green. People complained and by the third day it was better. The pool was not as clean as Ocean Blue. Before we went to the Punta Cana Princess, we read all the reviews on Trip Advisor and it's hard to believe that in most cases, the reviews were so Positive! We have traveled to many countries in the Caribbean and in Cancun, Mexico and have never gotten ill from the food. Will we return to Punta Cana -- not sure. Will we return to the Punta Cana Princess - absolutely NOT.On a high note -- we met some very nice people from Indiana: Todd and family and from Toronto: Anne and Richard. Also from Canada: Keisha, Steve, Andrew and his lovely girlfriend.MANATEEBOY (Pete and Lynne)

<Content>R  I travelled to the Punta Cana Princess July 4 to 11, 2005. I traveled in a group of 9 people. This is a spectacular resort, in a spectacular destination. We booked our group through Sunquest Vacations, and flew with Skyservice. Flight  Transfers: Smooth, a lot of leg room, and quick baggage pickup. Very impressed with Skyservice. Our transfer to the hotel was pretty rocky, and a little nauseating. However, we made it to the hotel safley and with all of our luggage, thats the most important thing.Check-in: We were greeted at the hotel with cold drinks, which was great, because it was 38 degrees. We did have to wait about 40 min. to check in, but we did sit on the back of a full bus on the transfer. So, thats our fault. Resort: Perfect spot for rest and relaxation. The lobby was beautiful, big and had the open concept idea. The grounds were kept immaculate. The resort itself was smaller compared to the neighbouring resorts, but still pretty big! Rooms were all suites. Which had 2 queen size beds, a big bathroom with double sinks, a living room, mini-fridge, and balcony. Rooms were very clean and spacious. The pool, was very nice, it did get a bit dirty after a storm went through. You get exchange privlages at the Tropical Princess and the Caribe Club Princess. Nighlty enteFood  Drinks: The food was amazing!! Between the buffets and the A La Cartes, if you cannot find something that you enjoyed, then you know that you are too much of a picky eater. The food was fresh and plentiful, different themes at the buffets everyday! Plus you get to use the restaurants at the Caribe Club Princess, and the Tropical Princess, so LOTS OF SELECTION. Drinks were also very good. Huge selection, from espresso to a huge variety of alcohol. Try the Punta Cana Princess and the Wazzzzup.Entertainment: Hotel was very quiet, with an option of entertainment. This is what we wanted! The animation team was there, and they had a daily outline of activities for everyone in the family. They were not pushy if you did not want to participate. The hotel is very quiet at night, you can go to the Caribe Club Princess (by complimentary shuttle, or 10 min. walk on path) to see their shows, which were excellent!! Very talented for a resort venue.Staff: Most staff were extremeley friendly, with the occassional odd-ball. It is a huge plus if you know basic spanish as only about 50% of the staff could speak fluent english. But very kind for the most part.Tipping: It is not required, but it is accepted. I only tipped our maid, only because she was very nice, friendly, and courteous. They only make an average of $50US per week, so take that into consideration, when you consider tipping. Beach: Big and beautiful!!!!! Clear blue waters, crystal white sand!! Just perfect. Bonus: No need to reserve lawn chairs or palapas, there was always a bunch free! TOPLESS BATHING ALERT!! There was not too many topless from our hotel, it was mainly those staying at other hotels walking along the beach.Day Tours: We did the half-day shopping tour, and the Bavaro Runners. IF you enjoy shopping, definetly go on the the shopping tour. Souvenirs at the resort are very over priced. The Bavaro Runners, was phenomenal!! Experience culture, day to day life, food, beach, agriculture, horse back riding, and much more, all in one day. I highly recommend it!! PS - don't forget to heckle with the store clerks, they try to scam tourists. When they quote you a price, cut it by 60% and work your way up from there.Overall, I highly recommend the Punta Cana Princess, if I had to stay here again, I would not be disappointed.

<Content>It was great, but.... Punta Cana Princess resort.We went there in July 4-11,2005. Basically, we liked that resort, espessialy our room and room service. No complains at all. Food was not so bad. We were not hungry. But I had some problem with my stomack, after visiting restourant, but not so serious.Beach-is amasing! The best impressions! Not forgetable.Before going to this resort I read some peoples review and opinion about everything. It was very usefull, especially about stolen stuff on the beach. We tried to be carefull, but anyhow someone stole my hasband's googles at the first day on the beach, while we went for swimming. One more thing about watersport. You should be ready to pay for everything there. We thought that the only scuba is not included, like in most of resorts and didn't expect that we should pay even for catamaran. And one more thing. Resort is not big. There is no theatre, disco, dance there. You should go to next resort. Of course, It is not a big deal, but....We liked being there, but we don't go there again. This is not 5 star resort, like our travel agent told us, that's for sure.

<Content>Excellent and Beautiful Resort!!!! We just got back from a 4 night 5 day vacation at the Punta Cana Princess and loved it!!!!!!! Can't wait to get back. When you first get there you are greeted with a cold pina coloda and the resort is beautiful. You must make reservations at the Ala Carte restaurants, the Tex Mex restaurant was delicious , get either the chicken or the steak or both!!!! The buffet food was alright but you will find something you can eat. The weather was nice!!!!!!89 degrees everyday. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Make sure you do the Jurastic Sufari tour and if you buy anything always negotiate the price, I got a large canvas painting and mask for $100 and he originally told me it would cost $175. Anyway you will have a blast, you can go to the casino by hotel shuttle and you also have access to 2 of their sister properties, the one you want to spend a lot of your time for entertainment is the Caribe princess. The Punta Cana princess is very kid friendly, we don't have any kids, but it was a very quiet resort which we liked. You won't be sorry, our stay was excellent!!!!!!!!!

<Content>not terrible, but not great I just got back from the Punta Cana Princess just a couple of hours ago. I must admit that it was not my favorite vacation although many of the less than satisfactory conerns were not the fault of the hotel. We were scheduled to arrive in the mid afternoon of July 1, but due to problems with the charter airline, we had an 11 hour delay, and we did not get to the resort until about 2:AM. Once we did arrive check in was pleasant. The gentleman at the front desk was very polite, helpful, and efficient. Staff members promptly delivered our luggage to our room. However, the A/C had been turned off in our room, and it was hotter than blue blazes. In fact, even with running the A/C full throttle for the entire week, the room never did get cool. Literally, it was hotter in the room than outside. On a more positive note, after we unpacked, we were delighted to find out that there was an open snack bar. The gentleman working the grill made us a pizza, and it was pretty good, and since we hadn't eaten in many hours, it actually tasted wonderful.We got off to a late start on Saturday, sleeping in a bit to catch up from the late night. As soon as we could, we went to the beach. The beach at the Punta Cana Princess is very nice. The water has a pretty color, and there are plenty of beach chairs. In fact, of all of the all inclusive Carribean trips I have taken, the Punta Cana Princess is the best in terms of easily accessing a shaded beach chair. No matter what time of day I went, I could always find one. Although, the water does have a pretty color, it is not as clear as I had hoped on the beach. If you are standing in knee deep water, you can not see your feet in the water. This is mainly due to the waves, which are not big, but just big enough to stir up sand in the water to limit visibility.The drinks are not very good. We purchased the super VIP package which claims to give you top shelf liquors, but those are only served in the lobby bar, and even there, they don't have Bacardi or Captain Morgan Rum. For the most part, the bartenders were very freindly and so you didn't want to complain. The exception to that was a female bartenders serving female guest. For some reason, she did not want to serve other women. My wife told me that she couldn't get served at the lobby bar, and I found it hard to believe, but I went back up there with her and saw it for myself. A couple of other ladies I spoke with told me that they had similar problems. Also, if you go expecting a good tequila drink, don't.Food: Our first dinner was at the Italian restaurant. I ordered the steak, and my wife had the chicken. My steak wasn't terrible, but it was tough and over cooked. The chicken was terrible. I did speak to some other guest who ordered the shrimp, and they said it was excellent. So, if you go to the Italian place, avoid the chicken and get the shrimp.Our second dinner was at La Cava located at a sister property. I'm not going to say it was outstanding, but it was pretty good.Probably our favorite restaurant was the Rio Grande. We ended up eating there twice. I highly recommend the mixed meat platter.I also enjoyed the Brazillian restaurant located at a sister property. While it is a far cry from some Brazillian restaurants, it was very good.The Mama Mia Restuarant, also located at a sister propery, was very good also.Of course, there were other restuarants that we didn't get the chance to try, but to be honest, I had heard negative things about the Mexican place, the oriental place, and the domincan restuarant as well. The breakfast buffets are good, and the lunch buffets are OK.Service: Freindly, but not overly efficient. During meals, glasses stay empty too long, and in general, once the food is brought out to you, you might not see a waiter/waitress again. When you do see them, they are very amiable though. Same thing for drink service on the beach. Your best bet is just to walk to the bar. If the rare occurence happens that someone does take your drink order on the beach, you might see that drink in a half hour, or you might not see it at all.Weather: Bad, but that's hardly the hotel's fault. If anything, it's my fault for planning a Carribean beach vacation during hurricane season. Lesson learned. Out of the 6 full days we stayed there, it rained 4 of them. I will say that the resort is laid out very nicely. While avoiding the feel of just a hotel, everything is very convenient and easily accessible. It's also a fairly pretty property.Overall, compared to other resorts I've stayed at (and maybe that just says more about the other places), I didn't like it. In all fairness, though, had we have had better weather and had we not have lost nearly a full day of our trip due to an airplane malfunction (neither were the fault of the hotel of course), I might would have been able to overlook some of the hotel's negatives and have a more favorable impression of the Punta Cana Princess. However, I won't be going back.

<Content>Absolute Perfection I stayed at Punta Cana Princess from the 12th June up to the 25th June and I only have one word for it - perfection! We went on our honeymoon, and when we arrived in our suite there was a bowl of fruit and a lovely welcome letter, together with a fantastic bottle of rum. The hotel is the smaller one of the three Princess hotels, so I would recommend that for night life you jump on the buggy car and hop over to the other hotels. The suites at this hotel are large, you have the main bedroom with a queen sized bed and on another level you can find the living area, a very comfortable sofa with a nice sized TV, coffee machine and this leads onto the verandah. The food in Punta Cana Princess is wonderful, it affords a buffet restaurant (Buffet Casabe) which have themed nights, i.e italian night, french, dominican, mexican, but apart from the huge selection of international food they offer, they also have two chefs (one normally carves meat i.e lamb pork or beef in large quantities) and the other one makes freshly cooked pasta with the sauce and filling of your choice! I think this was my favourite. They also have the sea food restaurant at the beach called the Mare Nostrum which is fantastic, we always used to go for lunch there as it is open 24 hours. They have an italian restaurant and a mexican, both very very nice. Every single person working there is so so nice, please say Hi from me to Yanira, Delia and Rosary, amongst many others of course. Julio Cesar from the Mare Nostrum is fantastic, as is Santa, she makes the meanest cocktails! Always ask for a frozen cappucino and a Bahama Mama, they are lovely. The grounds of the hotel are fantastic, and the pool is to die for. Ruben is in charge of cleaning the pool, he is really friendly. Tipping is always recommended, $1 perhaps, if you are happy with that employee's service to you they really appreciate it. Remember, tipping does go a long way. You also have a swim up bar in the pool serving the most lovely cocktails. I also recommend the spa, they have loads of beauty treatments on offer, they have competent beauty therapists which make you really relaxed about everything. The decor of the place is absolutely breath taking as is the beach on the grounds of the hotel. Beautiful white sands, crystal blue water....... If you walk towards the left for about 10 minutes, there is a beach market selling everything you might want to buy regarding souvenirs, but beware, on the dominican republic, never pay more than 50% less of what they are asking for. Always haggle, they will rob you blind. I recommend buying the Larimar which is the official semi precious stone of the island and only located there. Its similar to turquoise but lighter, worth taking a few items back home with you. Regarding the restaurants, you can book the restaurants in the other hotels as well, there is a chinese restaurant (do not order the Locomoco rice, you will have a nasty surprise), dominican, mexican and the best one of all the fish restaurant called the Pescador. For the Pescador you have to pay a small fee of 25$ per person, very worthwhile, as you can choose the freshest lobster, and they serve it with a wonderful sauce. I really cannot recommend it enough, so go ahead and book this hotel, its fantastic!

<Content>Loved it! Great for Honeymooners! We went for 2 weeks July 2004!!!We absolutly LOVED IT!The rooms were exactly as pictured in the brochure! We received rum  a fruit basket in our room upon arrival(honeymooners).The food was average for an all inclusive resort! The pool  beach were phenomenal!The hotel is quite but it was fine because you can go next store for some action  more restaurants. The nightly entertainment was ok... not really professional.All in all I loved it  would go back!I recommend the excursion were you drive mini speed boat to go snorkling. I think it's called Bavaro splash I don't recommend the one where you check out the countryside, see how the make cigars check out sugar cane fields. I thought it was kind of boring.

<Content>Great but not Perfect My husband and I (both 27) stayed at the Punta Cana Princess June 11-18. We were looking for a small, quiet resort - without the adults-only prices. We have only been to the RIU Tequilla in the past, so we are not well-travelled by any means. After talking to many Europeans, Americans and Canadians, we have realized that some people are too picky and should just stay home. And it was usually the people who paid $500 for the week who complained the most. Yes, the service was a little slow at the bars some of the time, but we were on vacation and not in any hurry.Here were our observations:BEACH - The beach was beautiful. You can't go wrong with the entire Bavaro Beach. However, the PCP seemed a lot less busy than the other resorts. And we had the biggest swimming area in front of our resort. ATTENTION all romantic couples - the beach at night is amazing. We felt completely safe to walk up and down it at night. And we often saw people taking a late night swim.BUTLER SERVICE - This is where we were disappointed. Sunquest advertises the resort as having butler service for drinks on the beach. There was not a server to be found. We complained to our tour rep, and he said that they could not guarentee it because we were there in the off-season. However, a bunch of other nice Canadians made a bigger fuss, and the problem was solved by the end of the week.POOL - Clean and warm with a wonderful swim-up bar. There were lots of chairs and shady spots surrounding the entire pool.BARS - Find the menu at the loby bar and remember the names of drinks you would like to try - if you don't know any Spanish this will make your vacation a lot easier. The service at the loby bar was probably the slowest, but this is where you will find the premium brand drinks (VIP only). But, if they didn't have it at the beach bar or swim-up bar, they would just send someone to deliver it - it just took about 10 minutes to get a drink. We made friends with Nelson at the swim-up bar and he took care of us for the entire week. You didn't even have to ask, he would just fill up your drink.RESTAURANTS - The Buffet Restaurants for breakfast and lunch were okay. We always found something we liked. The omlets at breakfast were awesome - as was the pasta bar at lunch. We went over to the Caribe for lunch a few times because the selection is bigger. However, the service wasn't as good (maybe because it is A LOT busier). Our biggest complaint was that there are NO fans to be founds - very hot in June. We often ordered room service just to escape the heat.The A La Carte Restaurants for dinner were AMAZING. If you are soo picky that can't find something to eat here than you should stay home. The food was great, and the service was fantastic. We ate everything from lobster to tacos to sushi. If we didn't like it, we didn't eat it. All the restaurants (except the one on the beach) are air-conditioned.They served food all night at the beach restaurant - a very small selection, but we always found something to eat after coming back from the Disco.ROOM SERVICE - We had it included in our VIP package. We ordered it about 6 times, and they messed it up 3 times - basically because the guy at the other end couldn't speak english. We ordered it to escape the heat, but we saw people taking food from the buffet to their rooms, so it wasn't necessary.SERVICE - The service at all the restaurants is amazing. We never had an empty glass of water or wine. And they will bring you whatever you want from the bar. The service at the front desk is hit and miss - it all depends who is working. We had the VIP package and didn't receive any special check-in, but that was fine with us. Service at the bars was either really slow or really fast - it all depended on who was working.ENTERTAINMENT - It was pretty quiet at the PCP. The animation staff would try and get people to particiate in morning stretching, volleyball, dance lessons, spanish lessons ..... but they weren't overly annoying if you didn't want to particiate. We didn't see any of the evening entertainment at the PCP, apparently there was something in the loby every night. We went to the show at the Caribe every night. Some nights were really good, and some were just good for a laugh. They would always start their show with the Ice Breaker where they would get audience members to participate. We often avoided this because there were a few annoying employees trying to get you on stage. The Disco was fun. They played merengue music, hip hop and techno. Locals go to the same disco, so be prepared for lots of touching on the dance floor.Overall, we had a very relaxing vacation with lots of good food to eat. We will be returning with our kids next year.Enjoy.

<Content>Very Good My husband and I visited the PCP from May 22-29. After surviving our hard landing courtesy of Skyservice, we were pleasantly surprised with the PCP. The resort was beautiful and clean. We had a suite on the first floor and were worried about bugs coming into our room but surprisingly there were none. The only time we were bothered by mosquitoes was on one night after it had rained. It only rained one afternoon when we were there and other than that it was extremely hot and sunny. We spent most of our trip sitting on the beach and swimming in the ocean because it was too hot to do anything else. We did squeeze in 3 games of mini-golf at the Caribe Club Princess. We tried to use the facilities at the Bavaro Princess as was specified in the advertising by Sunquest but were not welcome to use any of their facilities other than their Casino. We were disappointed by this so beware it's really STAY AT ONE, PLAY AT TWO. I complained about this and since returning I've noticed that the advertising now specifies that the facilities at both the Caribe Club Princess and Tropical Princess can be used. Good luck getting to the Tropical Princess because it's definitely not a walking distance away. Other than that, the food at the a la cartes were fantastic especially the seafood restaurant where they served lobster without any surcharges. There was no limit on the number of a la carte dinners you could have for the week. The buffet was ok but basically we were a little scared to try most of the food so we stuck to omeletes for breakfast and pasta for lunch. On Saturday night there was a beach party which consisted of a Dominican Buffet on the beach, a Dominican marketplace also on the beach, and dancing and games on the beach as well. It was wonderful! A tip really does go a long way there and all the staff were very friendly and mostly all spoke English. The waiters especially loved saying Very Good and by the end of our trip all the resort guests were saying VeryGood in their best Dominican accents. Our suite had fresh hibiscus flowers in it everyday and also cute towel animals. Overall, we had a great time but probably would not return to the PCP as there are so many other resorts and countries to explore.

<Content>Honest Review Well, we arrived at the hotel at midnight, and we were welcomed by cocktails and very quick service. The room we had was the best room ever, stayed on the top floor overlooking pool room # 5203. Bar replenished everyday, linen on bed changed each day and always fresh towels left, very happy with room and room service. Pool clean and well designed, with a nice swim-up bar. The pool area was quiet with soft spanish music playing in background. The louder music was down at the beach area near bar. Grounds to the resort very well maintained, lush and clean. The sauna room was fantastic, hottest one I have ever been in and it had a great jacuzzi just outside the building. Beach beautiful and we walked the beach day which is unusual for us, miles of white sand and close to the markets that is set-up on the beach. You can buy anything you need from the stalls, cigars, booze, t-shirts, gifts etc., be careful the locals always ask way too much for their stuff but you can barter big time. My brother traded his old t-shirts and ball caps in for cigars and rum. Night life is basically in the other resorts which a shuttle runs every 15 minutes to which resort you want. We kept in the Princess and did not go to the other resorts but my brother and his friends did, they loved it especially the disco's. The only disappointment we had although we did not expect to get the same quality and selection was the food. The soups and deserts were very good, and the breads were freshed baked. For a small resort and the price we would recommend this resort to our friends etc. Where can you go for $1000, we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>We'll be back!! My husband and I and 2 other couples stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from April 14-28. We had an awesome vacation. Our maid was Digna and she was wonderful. We left a tip and a little gift everyday. I can tell you a tip goes a long way. We tip at home for good service so we should do the same elsewhere. We had excellent service everywhere in the hotel. If you can't find anything to eat I can tell you, you don't eat much. There was every kind of food you can think of. Say hello to Isabel and Martin at the Mare Nostrum bar and the Pool bar. And Hello to Adonis in the buffet. FROM CANADA!! These people made our stay at this hotel a wonderful experience. We did just about every excursion they had Bavaro Runners, Bavaro Splash(ask for Indiana Jones), Caribbean Festival, Maniti Park, The Underwater Sea Aquarium(unbelievable), Deep Sea Fishing, and Parasailing. I would reccomend them all. Our Sunquest rep was Luco and he was great. anything we needed he was there for us. (Great Guy). If you plan on taking travellers cheques be aware that you can only get Pesos for them even at the bank there. I would suggest american cash. We had a safe in our room and your money is safe there. No worry's. I would reccomend this hotel for everyone. Feel free to contact me for more info.

<Content>Paradise in Punta Cana My family and I spent two weeks at the Punta Cana Princess from April 14 to April 28th. Our Room was located in the 5000 building on the second floor which overlooked the pool and had a partial ocean view. When booking this hotel I would request a balcony room as other guests who had ground floor rooms complained of mosquitos in their room at night. Once the staff was informed they sprayed the area affected and everything was fine for them after that. Our maid (Digna) went above and beyond to take care of us. We left her a tip every morning and when my boys (8) found out that she also had a son left her some toys they brought to give away. On the day we left I also gave her all of our uneeded medication we had brought with us. We booked the VIP package and personally feel it was well worth the extra cost. It allowed us priority booking for the al-a-cartes and the massage was awesome. The buffet always had something you could eat. My son and myself are picky eaters and I can tell you we never went hungry. My only complaint regarding the buffet is that the food in the main section could have been a little hotter. We became friends with a server named Adonis and once again he went above and beyond to make our vacation the best, he even met us in the lobby on the afternoon of our departure to say good-bye. We really liked the Tex-Mex and Mexican al-a-cartes. Having two boys aged 8, I was a little disappointed with the kids club as it was more geared for kids under 5, but can one really complain when they have a beautifull pool and awesome beach to boogie board at!! We went on two excursions, the Manati Park and Bavaro Runners and would recommend both. On the Manati Park we paid the extra money to swim with the dolphins which I must say was one of the highlights of our vacation. In closing, we would return to the Punta Cana Princess in a heartbeat.

After researching many vacation spots, I ended up choosing one that I knew nothing about (mainly because it was a Deal of the Day and got an excellent price).... lucky for us we were very happy. The resort is small (compared to the Caribe), but we liked it because it wasn't as crowded. The rooms were very spacious, with a sunken living room and pull-out bed. We found the whole resort very clean and the staff was very accomodating. Having a 9 and 11 year old, the smaller resort allowed us to feel comfortable letting the kids go on their own around the resort (security was good). Kids Club was definitely not good for their age..... mainly for toddlers, but there was enough for them to do otherwise. We made use of many of the daily activities which were available...beach and pool aerobics, dance lessons, spanish lessons, kayak races and much more. The activities instructors were fun and sociable...and got people involved (but not pushy). We liked being able to visit the Caribe for the shows and restaurants, however it was impossible for us to reserve a restaurant...they were always full (a little disappointing), but we did try the crepe restaurant...excellent. We didn't mind the buffet for breakfast and lunch, but only went once for dinner.... we're not buffet people. We REALLY enjoyed the Tex Mex restaurant... ate fillet mignon twice! The Italian was good too. The beach was amazing... very clean and BLUE!!! This was our first vacation with our kids and now they're hooked!!! I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing family vacation!!

<Content>loved it! Four of us spent April 15-18th at the PCP and we all had a wonderful time. It was a near perfect vacation! We all loved the rooms, the pools and the beach. The food and drinks were delicious. We had the VIP package and we all felt we got our moneys worth. The massages were great. It was my 9th visit to the DR and I would rate the PCP as one of my very favorites. I loved the size of the resort and the bonus of having the use of the 2 resorts next door- they really did a great job with the layout. The employees were very friendly as usual and the service we received was top notch. I honestly can't find anything to complain about. The PCP is a great value for your vacation dollar and I wouldn't hesitate to return.

<Content>Great place to stay First off, let me tell you that last year my husband and I stayed at the the Caribe Club Princess which we really liked. We decided we would try the Punta Cana Princess (PCP) this time since it is a much newer property (just over a year old) and you still have full access to the Caribe. We loved the PCP because it was much smaller so you could get to everything you wanted quickly. The food options at the Caribe are better but again, you still have full access to them at PCP. Check-in was quick and our room was great. Very big, clean and a great view. The buffets had a huge selection. The omelettes made to your order were delicious. We loved the smoothie bar at breakfast (banana, watermelon, pineapple, etc.) We also loved the grilled items at lunch and the pasta bar. For dinner we have eaten at almost all of the a la carte restaurants between the two properties and here is our review of them.PCPThe Italian restaurant is very good.The Tex-mex restaurant is okay. I didn't enjoy the beef but that is just because the beef there is different than US beef. If I had ordered something else I might have liked it.The Mediterrean restaurant was also okay. My meal was much better than my husbands. He felt like the seafood on his plate had been frozen and wasn't fresh like you would hope.CCPThe seafood restaurant was our favorite. The lobster is excellent.The Italian restaurant is great. Probably better than the one at PCP.The Brazilian restaurant is also very good. You get to try many different meats so it was pretty neat. I was very stuffed by the time dinner was over.The mexican restaurant was okay. We ate there last year and can't remember much other than we decided to leave it off the list this year.LaCava - steak restaurant is very good. I got lobster there and it was excellent.The crepe place is also very good. The Domincan restaurant was okay. My husband ate goat for some crazy reason and it messed with his stomach.The Chinese restaurant is probably the only one we never tried.The buffets at both places are very good. We would eat late and usually stop by the buffet before dinner to see if there were any items we wanted to try as an appetizer. There usually were. I'm sure some people won't be happy with the food but we enjoyed it. There was such a huge selection that it would be hard not to find something you liked,The property at the PCP is so clean. They are constantly cleaning things. The grounds are pretty but the Caribe's grounds are spectacular. Since the PCP is so new, the trees and landscaping aren't as mature as the Caribes. The entertainment is pretty good and the animation team does a good job at trying to get people involved and have fun.The staff was so friendly. We enjoyed getting to know several staff members and would look for them throughout the day to cut up with. The PCP did have beach service for drinks. They didn't have that at the Caribe last year so that was pretty good to have. We also tipped throughout the week. If we had good service or really liked a worker, we would give them a tip. The beach in Punta Cana is probably the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. Definitely wear lots of sunscreen because the sun is strong.When we go back we may stay at the PCP again or may venture off and try someone else but I would definitely recommend the Princess hotels in Punta Cana to everyone.

<Content>Disappointed Room was good. we did run out of hot water one night. Plenty of food but not very good. Our friends were given a room in building one and it was NOT acceptable,unclean and damp. They were given another room after putting up a fight.The staff serving food are very good. The beach is great. If you go to the shops outside of the resort property be prepared to be mobed by merchants wanting to sell there goods. We did buy some things but you must bargin.DONT pay what they ask,give them 65-75 percent less and if they say no walk away. Be very careful about what you eat and drink. Bring something to clean your hands with. Two in our party of seven got sick. DONT DRINK THE WATER,NOT EVEN TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH. We will be back to the Dominican Republic ,but not to any princess or 4 star resort. 5-6 star only. We were told by other tourst we met that the 5-6 star resorts are MUCH BETTER.

<Content>Well worth it Just came back on March 8th from a 2 week stay at the Punta Cana Princess. We loved the resort. The resort is fairly new, so nothing was old which is nice. You have full access to 2 sister properties next door (Caribe Club Princess and Tropical Princess) but they could not come to ours. We went there for the evening entertainment and tried a few restaurants but we preferred the 3 ala carte restaurants at our resort. There is the Italian, Tex Mex Steakhouse and the Mare Nostrum (fish restaurant). The filet mignon was excellent. We enjoyed the food at all 3 and the service also. Alot of attention was paid to you on being served and our wine glass never went empty. The food at the buffet was okay, but we definetly preferred being served on at the ala carte restaurants. We met people from all across Canada and Europe and everyone we talked to really liked the resort. It is a quieter resort but its nice because people are not ontop of you at the beach or around the pool area. Lawn chairs were always available at the beach and pool side no matter what time of day it was. We noticed walking along the beach, how at many of the resorts people were sunbathing and everyone seemed so cramped together.The beach is beautiful and such soft golden sand. I have never seen a beach that nice and there always was a breeze so you were never sweating while sunbathing.If you are looking for a quieter resort this one is for you.On the way back on the plane we overheard many people complaining about various things at their resorts. I was sure glad that we had no complaints.I would definetly go back there for the food, the cleanliness and the beach. The staff were also very nice and hardworking.P.S. A tip goes a long way there, so don't forget at the restaurants or at the bars. They really appreciate it.

<Content>Great time at the Princess Had a great time at the Punta Cana Princess. The food was good and the service was very good! We found that if the people were given a small tip they would do anything to provide great service. The pool area was great, very clean. The beach was very clean and there were always chairs available. Our room was very nice, the maid restocked our fridge everyday.We enjoyed the size of the resort as well, it is smaller with very few line ups anywhere. Had a great holiday!!!! We will return again next year.

<Content>If you like food- go somewhere else We stayed at the property in Feb 2005. The hotel itself was fine, the rooms very nice, clean , the common areas always clean also. However, the food was another story. It ranged from revolting to not bad. The buffets that we tried were absolutely awful. One Chinese buffet (the first night) was so awful we couldn't eat much. The next morning at buffet breakfast it was equally as bad--cut up hotdogs with ketchup was not too exciting. The fruit was not the greatest and the coffee was Nescafe. We had stayed at the Riu up the beach last time and the food was exceptional and the coffee was fabulous. You might ask why we stayed here this time, a neighbour who is a foodie stayed here when it opened and stated the food was fantastic, it was worth a try , we thought. We approached each meal with wonder- wonder what this will be like. Their Tex-Mex restaurant was fairly good. Their Mare Nostrum (seafood) was acceptable, so we stuck to these. We had heard from others that their Domincan buffet was dreadful as was a couple of the other places at the Tropical next door.The bartenders tended to ignore you quite regularly in favour of those who were Spanish speaking or those, as we discovered, who had tipped them regularly. One bartender tried to sell me marijuana, maybe this is not a bad thing if you want this but being a total non smoker and adverse to drugs on the whole, I was not impressed.The wait staff in the restaurants we attended were extremely nice I must say.The beach and weather , of course, were wonderful. In spite of our misgivings about the food we had a pleasant enough stay. I would, however, never recommend anyone to stay there.They claimed this was a 5 star, I don't think so.Next time, back to a Riu.

<Content>Amazing My name is David, I麓m from Spain and I Just returned from a week long stay at the Punta Cana Princesa with my 8 companions of university (7 girls and 1 guy); We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess February 22 to March 2, 2005. The resort is wonderfoul, it麓s a small resort, there is always a chair at the pool or beach, the buffet is never too crowded and not much of a wait at the bar! But if nightlife is important the Areito Disco it麓s in the next door Princess Resort with free transport or only 10 minutes walking over a beautiful manglar, the disco it麓s open to the first hours of the morning and in it there are a good dominican people. The service in the Hotel are the best, smiling all the time, I speak Spanish and it is an advantage but if you don麓t speak Spanish don麓t worry they speak English too (like me hahaha..) The rooms are plenty of space and they were so clean all the time, the king size beds are so commodes鈥?the Beach (Playa Bavaro) are so clean, deep and light blue all the day with her white sand鈥?the animation staff it麓s the very best with her aqua-aerobic in the beach or pool, bachata-merengue-salsa dance lessons, stretching and more. The food buffets were great, they had different themes, with a lot of cakes, ice creams, fruis, natural juices鈥? We were to the restaurants (3 in our resort 9 in the next door) two times in our resort: Italian, Tex mex and Mare Nostrum鈥?the food and the service excellent.P.D.: My e-mail it麓s speedy.one50@gmail.com and ------- if you were during February 22 to March 2, 2005 please write me, we have too many photos and videos and things that to say, and I need to practise me English, specially I remember I girl (she speaks in French and I don鈥檛 know his name鈥aybe 鈥淪TEFFANI鈥?鈥aybe from Canada?鈥?please write me!) Thanks and enjoy your travel to Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>Run don't walk to book the Princess My husband and I were at the Punta Cana Princess from Feb 12 to 19. Really just got back. It was fantastic! The front desk staff Diana, Karen and the rest were helpful, pleasant and fully bilingual (Spanish/English). Any problems with your room go see them. Our shower was blocked and not running properly, it was fixed within the hour of our telling them about it.The food, oh my! My mouth still waters when I think about it. The buffet was nice, lots of choices. The a la carte restaurants, of which you have 6 to choose from, at least the ones we ate at, were great. The Rio Grande is the tex/mex, the filet mignon was done to perfection each time we ate it. The Brazilian restaurant, over at the Caribe Princess, was very nice. The salads were a buffet and then the meat and fish (six different kinds) are served right off the skewers. Very nice flavours. La Cava (extra$$, 25 per person) was worth it. The carpaccio melted on my tongue. My husband's t-bone took up the whole plate. It is a meal that in Montreal would have set us back $150 or more. The house wine is a Spanish wine, very palatable. The bar staff were all wonderful, especially Julio, the head bartender. Remember to ask for the Pina Colada's con Rhum otherwise......no rhum.As to the language issue, try, learn a few phrases before you leave. As long as you try they will try. Smiling and being polite goes a long way.The only difficulty we had was with the tour operator, Sunquest Vacations. Their representative at the hotel was more concerned with selling excursions than helping us solve our VIP booking problem (not the hotel's fault). We will have to think twice about using them again.I would go back in an instant. Next year's vacation will be two weeks, hopefully at the Punta Cana Princess.Enjoy!

<Content>Wonderful time I can not believe some of these reviews I have read. My husband and I got married at the Punta Cana Princess on August 17, 2004. We stayed there from August 14-21 with 12 of our members of our family and friends. It was absolutely wonderful! The best vacation I have ever had! The wedding coordinator Gabriel was very helpful. He took care of everything for our wedding...it was so beautiful and completely stress free. Our wedding was right on the beach. We could not have had a better location!  We had a few small problems with the service but there is a slight language barrier. It's a foreign country with their own language....be patient with them. We found that if you are friendly and try to speak a little of their language they are very helpful. A few of our people got sick. Once again, you are in another country. Be careful what you eat and drink lots of water. Take some ammodium just in case.  The resort itself is absolutely beautiful. Nice, spacious rooms with frequent maid service. The landscaping is gorgeous. You have to give these people credit. It is very hot under that sun and they work VERY hard to make it beautiful inside and out for their guests. Showing genuine appreciation goes a long way with them. The animation crew and bartenders were great! Nelson, Ariel, and Mercedes were a lot of fun and tried their best to make sure we had fun. Some of the food wasn't what we were used to but once again, it is a foreign country! Be careful and you should be ok! The a la carte restaraunts were very good...with excellent service.  Overall, we had a great time. We will definately return, hopefully for our one year anniversary! Aside from a few small problems, that occur during most vacations, our trip was wonderful and memorable. It was adventurous at times, yet while on the white sands of their beach it was also so relaxing. It is worth the trip!

<Content>A great dissapointment!!!! My family(husband and two kids aged 13 and 11) went to the PCP from Dec 24 to Jan 8.We are very easy going people and do not get upset about alot but in one word this resort was HORRIBLE!!!We travel each year at the same time so the fact that it was Christmas and busier did not influence our opinion.The food was really bad. The first 3 days we had to fight flies and eat food that the flies were crawling in. After a few days the wind picked up and it settled down. The quality of the food was really poor but we found the a la carte restraunts a bit better.Both my husband and younger daughter were quite sick for a few days.As a previous post mentioned we did not get all of the services we were supposed to be offered and it seemed that you had to work to get anything. Our rooms were a very nice size and were clean on our arrival but the maid service in our room was really bad but we didn't worry too much about that.We called the front desk one evening after one of the pop bottles in our room fell out of the fridge as we opened the door. It hit the tile and glass flew everywhere. My daughter and I were both cut in several spots and there was glass everywhere. We needed someone to bring cleaning tools up to clean up the glass. After the 4th time of being hung up on by front desk my hubby went on a hunt for mops and brooms himself.My daughter left her shoes and shirt by the pool one afternoon(totally our fault) and it took 4 days and about 8 trips to the front desk before they would take me to the lost and found. They kept just saying we'll call your room if anything shows up but I was a bit skeptical because they did not even ask me what they looked like. On the last request I was a little firm and asked to be taken to the lost and found. After waiting at the front desk for almost one hour someone showed up and we walked about 200 feet to the lost and found room!!!! Well, my daughters stuff was right on the table. If it had dissapeared I would have totally understood since it was my daughter's fault for leaving it there but why did we have to try so hard just to see the lost and found. On our second week it took three days of asking to get our VIP massage tickets- they just kept saying that they would bring them up to our room but never did.The service at this resort was very poor overall.We have been to the Mayan Riviera and Hawaii and absolutley had wonderful trips!!! This time around at the PCP we were soooo glad to go home. We spoke to many, many families who shared our view. I am not sure why the big difference in the reviews posted but I would definitley not go to this resort.I will say that the Bavaro Runners tour was an absolute blast and well worth the money.We also parasialed at the resort and it was a great experience. Our friends stayed at the Iberostar Punta Cana in November and they said it was quite good.

<Content>Is this the same Punta Cana Princess? Just returned from PCP on Jan 30.We also had the VIP Package.I'm not sure what happened to the previous reviewer but we found the resort to be excellent.(except the weather, but we can't blame anyone for that.Can we?) We had premium liquor(try asking),beach service was fantastic and available every day, turn down every night,massages,beach towels ON ARRIVAL as the brochure states,(not every day),excellent rooms stocked daily..........The resort is very quiet. A short ride over to Caribe,which we had full access to, brings with it the theater, disco and of course more people. If you like a bit of action it's available but nice to stick around and enjoy the relaxation. The food was excellent and included the usual all inclusive assortment. And if you looked at the fresh fruit juice bar you'll find at least 6 different fresh juice jugs made every morning,including orange at least 3 days. The Tex-Mex was an excellent meal and for VIP a gourmet meal was included.We chose La Cava at Caribe and went away stunned by the great service and meal. The presentation rivaled any 5 star in North America.(A member of our party is a chef!)The staff were fantastic. Try a little Spanish (although English is common with staff)and treat them with a bit of respect and they are truly wonderful people. A couple bucks here and there also goes a long way. We heard of no-one being ill but it can happen anywhere. We have been to theDR 5 times to different reorts and the Punta Cana Princess is up with the best. If you prefer small, quiet and friendly resorts, go for it.

<Content>Not a 5 star rating! I was at the resort January 1st to 8th. The food was always cold or salty. When you expect fresh orange juice and instead you get TANG...you know something is not right with the place.There was no entertainment for adults...you had to go to the next resort for that. The only entertainment for kids was 'mini disco' at 8:30 pm every night...for 15 minutes....thats it folks!!The resort itself is nice, the rooms are clean, and the staff are helpful, if sometimes they don't understand you.but all in all....I will not go here if I were you.

<Content>Not a Five Star 11 of us travelled to the Punta Cana Princess for 14 days over the Christmas and New Years holidays. Not only were 4 of our travellers extremely ill with vomitting @ diaherria, we had to have the doctor visit with needles and pills. They were all extremely ill for 3 days, at first we thought that they had contracted food posioning but later found out that it was a virus that was travelling the island similar to Norwalk. My son is still not feeling well after being home for almost 10 days and will see our family physician again this week, he is still suffering from bad stomach cramps and diaherria. We also had one of our travellers get a serious cut to his leg and he needed stitches, we called the front desk of the resort 4 times and yet could not get any help. We carried him to the doctor's office ourselves where he had his leg stitched, somehow I thought that this would have been an important issue and perhaps help would have been available. If you were travelling on your own this could have been a potentially dangerous situation. Aside from all of this we all had VIP packages, it was impossible to get Premium Brand Liquor, no nightly turn down service, all motorized sports were unavailable to us as the boats were out of service. We did not have daily beach towels in our rooms, there was no disco on the resort for the young adults and there was no nightly entertainment. The food was definetley not that of 5 star quality although the buffet was clean, the selection was very limited. There is no butler service to the beach for drinks and I beleive that the VIP package was just a joke. When booking my sons massages I was told that he had already used them! What a surprize that was, to refrain from arguing I just gave him mine. Aside from this the resort was quiet and the sun was great. We have travelled to other resorts in the Dominican previously and would tell others to shop around!

<Content>Great little private resort Just got back from the Punta Cana Princess on January 15. All in all this was a great resort. It is small, you never wait in any line ups, there were tons of beach chairs. The resort is very clean as are your rooms. One word of advise, if you don't like bugs and crawlers ask for the 2nd or 3rd floor. We were on the ground floor and a lot of bugs climbed in, not a big deal.The Beach is beautiful, the water is warm. We were there December 31 to January 14 and there was a lot of seaweed in the water, but we did not care. The pool is great. The animation team was fabulous as was the kids club.We did venture to the Caribe for mini golf. Tried the mexican restaurant at the Caribe, I got food poisoning, never puked so much in my life!! We gave the Caribe one more chance and tried the buffet, the resort is so huge you had to stand in line for food for 20 - 30 minutes (pasta). After that we stuck with the Punta Cana Princess, the buffet was always great and the specialty restaurants were wonderful as well.The only negatives were the first day our room was cleaned and we came back my brand new bottle of beautiful perfume was gone. I reported it but nothing was ever done. Lesson learned lock whatever you can in the safe! Also the wind was bad, I knew it would be windy but not like that, we could not lay on the beach as the sand just blew in your eyes and everywhere. Other than that great trip, I recommend the Punta Cana Princess if you want, little action, quiet, and no line ups.

<Content>small, compact, with all the features It鈥檚 been a year since we have been to the PC Princess, Jan 2004. At that time we looked for reviews to help with our choice. It was a 50/50 split between good and bad. Most of the bad reviews were results of bad weather, language ect. The staff did their best to communicate, and we enjoyed learning from each other. Many of them know a few languages; maybe we should do the same?The bus trip was short (20min), nothing worse then spending the early morning in the airport, the rest of the morning in the air, picking up your luggage, walking into the sunshine and warm weather, then jumping on a bus for another 2 hours, only to get to your resort in the late afternoon. You can buy a nice cold beer at the airport and bring it on the bus, and sometime there may be someone selling by the buses. You can bring them on the bus and start your vacation relaxed.Upon arrival, check in was quick and easy. We were given our keys and off we went. The room was exquisite, king size bed, sunk in living room, balcony and nice size bathroom. We had noticed water on the floor of the bathroom and living room, we called and a short time later all was clean up. The room came with a coffee maker and mini fridge, great for coming off the beach for a late afternoon/before dinner cocktails or special coffee. We were on the beach by 1:30pm!The resort itself is not large, however that a plus for 2 reasons, 1 - quick dependable service everywhere, 2 - no crowds. The resort has 2 or 3 sister resorts, all within a short walk or golf cart bus ride. Eating, drinking and entertainment is included and at that time, we at the princess could go there but there patrons could not come to our resort.The food, not 5* and not a great selection, however what was there was tasty and in abundance. The buffet was clean and the staff was always pleasant and eager to please. They even came to know us by name, where we like to sit and in the morning, coffee the way we liked it.For quality, we rank this up with our visit to sandals in Jamaica. The beach and the sun are 5*+++ and thats what we went for.Like any trip, have an open mind, enjoy the different culture and smile, its catchy.

<Content>Very nice place My husband and I (in our 40s) and our 12 year old just got back from a week at the Punta Cana Princess Hotel. They rate themselves a 4 + and I would agree with the 4 but maybe not the + part. We had a wonderful time and would return, if there weren't so many other places we would like to try.The hotel is relatively new and so the folliage will need to grow in somewhat, but that isn't a criticism, just a fact. The rooms are great, with a sunken living room area with a huge day bed and a trundle bed under it. Lots of hot water, double sink in the bathroom, lots of towels, hair blower and shampoo etc. The mini bar has Pepsi, 7Up and beer and was restocked daily. I did have a problem getting some Diet stuff in the room, but not at any of the bars - by the way, it's called Pepsi Light, but given the accent, it sounds more like Pesi Lie! Facilities are very very clean and everyone is very friendly. Front desk staff and Guest Services staff speak very good English and although some had less English than others, between my Spanish and their English, communication was never ever an issue.This is not the place if you are looking for much night life or swinging singles but the Caribe is next door. However, it's perfect if you want some serious R and R. There is only one pool, although it's very big, with swim up bar, volleyball net etc. There are two or three areas there you can just walk in, or the kids can sit and play. The mini club seemed good but we didn't have any need for it, so I can only tell you what I thought. The animation staff is very nice, but they are lacking some experience. I also found that if you weren't on the beach (where the animation staff is), you could easily miss out on activities as they didn't always come through the pool area and if they did, it was rather subdued. There was the usual dance classes, Spanish lessons, volleyball etc.There are two good a la cartes restaurants one TexMex, one Italian. We tried both and liked both. The buffet restaurant is a nice open airy place with lots of room and a nice variety of food - although a word of advice - don't try and sample everything cuz by the end of the week you will be bored. Be selective. If you feel like fish, have fish, but not the fish, and the beef, and some chicken with a side of pasta - Breakfasts: they have the usual hot dishes, but they also have a smoothy bar, chose your mix of fruits and they will make it for you. They also have an omelette station.Lunch/Diners: they have themed nights like Dominican, Chinese etc. They also have a carvery for the carnivores (my husband became very good friend with the staff at that station!). They also have a pasta bar with 4 different types of pasta, 3 types of sauces and a whole bunch of stuff to chose from, anything from smoked salmon (not always) to capers and onions and peppers and ham etc.By the beach they have a smaller place with pretty well runs 24 hours a day. You can almost always get pizza, fries etc, and it has bar as well.Bars: in the lobby (nice place to sit around talking or playing cards), in the restaurants of course, at the place near the beach and one ON the beach as well. We were there over the New Year and on the morning of January 1st, they had drapped the beach bar as a first aid station - it was very funny.our 12 year old was usually the first in the pool around 9am and you never had problems finding beach chairs, either by the pool or on the beach.The staff is extremely friendly, the place is very very clean, the beach is great, the drinks were cold, what else could you ask for.

<Content>Loved the place...Can't wait to go back We are a family of five ( 3 teenagers) and just returned from a week in paradise. The kids had a great time meeting other kids from all over, as well as bonding with the friendly staff. We were there from December 17 to 24th. It was definately a hard place to leave.On our arrival we were greated by the reservation staff and had an quick check in. Our luggage was immediately taken to our room. We arrived late Friday night so we took sometime to wander down to the beach and have a swim.Our rooms were adjoining and were very clean and bright. In this resort the nice thing is that it is quite small so from anywhere you had a short distance to walk to eat, go to the pool, or to the beach. My husband's brother stayed at a much larger resort down the beach and had at least a 20 minute walk to the beach from their room. The maid kept the rooms very clean and she appreciated the gifts and money we left for her. The mini bar was always stocked and fresh towels daily. The staff was phenomenal everywhere we went. From the lobby staff, to the restaurants, pool bar and animation. We got to know the staff very well and formed great friendships. The kids enjoyed the animation staff and the daily activities offered. There was always something to do. Even though there is the language barrier it helps to practice your spanish and try to use the common phrases and their staff also tries very hard to speak english. The beach a grounds were kept impreccable. Every morning the place looked like it had never been touched the day before. The beach was beautiful. There was never a problem getting a lounge chair either on the beach or by the pool. It didn't seem to matter what time you went. The pool bar was very entertaining and always had people visiting from all around the world. The restaurants: We ate at them all. We enjoyed the Tex Mex and the Italian. The meals were very good. We also ate at each of the buffets and there was always lots to choose from. I must admit that after awhile the food tended to taste the same. Unfortunately each of us got sick at one time or another. I happened to get sick after I ate at the buffet at the sister resort (Caribe). My three kids and I got sick for about a day, however my husband was sick for about three days. We are usure of from what, but he sure didn't feel well and had a terrible flight home. It has left a sour taste in his mouth even though he loved the place. The staff at all the eating establishments were fantastic at the PCP. The Caribe Princess next door is much larger and we didn't experience the same friendliness from that staff, although it too is a beautiful resort.The Bavaro Runner: we chose to go on only one excursion and we were very happy in this selection. We had a blast and ended up with a great group of people. I would highly recommend this excursion.The market: make sure you barter with the people. They will lower their prices. My kids were able to get some great souvenirs. My kids can't wait to go back....We loved it. If you need anymore information please do not hesitate to contact me. scotdeni@yt.sympatico.caPS Make sure to take a lot of american $1.00 bills for tipping. A dollar goes along way for these very hard working people.

<Content>Everything was perfect at the punta cana princess My girlfriend and myself went to the PC princess Dec 19-23 and had a wonderful vacation. Check in was a breeze, we got there around 5pm and went straight to our room. They transported us by golf cart. The VIP package is worth the extra money. We got a great room on the third floor by the pool. Room was clean and the maids did a great job of cleaning. We always had clean towels. The food was much better than the Catalonia Bavaro Resort that I stayed at last year. The TexMex restaurant was great get the filet. With the VIP package we decided to dine at the seafood restaurant and it was also excellent. I had the lobster and it was really good. The pool and the ocean are amazing. We had a great time lounging by both. The PC princess was really laid back and definitely for couples. the other princess resorts were where a lot of the night life and activities were held which was within walking distance. The staff was great, we don't speak spanish except for the basics and they went out of their way to try to speak to us in english and make small talk. Hector at the beach buffet was really professional and kind. Last year I was ate alive by mosquitoes at the Catalonia, this year I had bugspray with me and I never had to use it. Don't spend too much time worrying about the malaria. Sometimes things just get blown way out of proportion. Not worth going to a doctor and spending hundreds of dollars for medication. Be more frightened of the airplane ride there if you go through US Airways. The massage package is really great. We upgraded to the 55 minute massage and it was well worth it. There is no longer horseback riding. The half day trip called the Marinarium is well worth the $72/person. We swam in the shark/ray enclosure and should have some really great pictures. The staff there is also great and we always had drinks. Capt Cooks is the best place ever to get seafood. Go during lunch and eat outside on the picnic tables. In closing, Punta Cana is a wonderful place. The Punta Cana Princess was VIP all the way and well worth it. Don't drink too much, don't eat too many strange things you're not use to. Brings some $1 bills for tips and bartering. My girlfriend and I agree, we will be back for a honeymoon hopefully sometime soon in the future.

<Content>Good Value, Good Vacation Stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from Dec 5 to Dec 12, 2004. Great weather, great beach. This is certainly a four star resort, given that it is a smaller resort than the Tropical Princess and the Caribe Princess which are both next door. You can eat or participate at all three resorts if you want to.The food was excellent for a Carribean resort, and this is our seventh trip to the Carribean. The Tex-Mex steak house did a fine job on beef or chicken, and the Italian restaurant at the Punta Cana Princess was excellent, far better than the Italian restaurant at the Caribe Princess. The buffet had a different theme every night, and if you didn't like the night's theme then you could take a five minute walk next door to the Caribe Princess and sample their buffet, which was larger because the resort is larger. No premium booze unless you paid extra, but the Spanish wine was better than passable, and who needs a lot of premium brands when you can sample the local rums and liquers for comparison. Nice rooms, average maid service, the front desk could not change a US20 into smaller bills to use for tips, so I didn't tip for the first few days. Finally got them to change US$ into Dominican pesos, and spread a few of them around, but it didn't seem to make much difference, the service was average if you tipped or not.We read about the malaria scare before we left, and found out it was not people at the Princess resorts who had contracted it, so we went with some heavy-duty deet stuff just in case. Never saw a mosquito all the time we were there. We will be going back for sure.

<Content>misconceived notions We were given definate misconceptions. When we booked our package we were offered horse back riding. when we arrived horse back riding was no longer an option. as compensation for no horse back riding we were offered 24 hour room service and 2 hour internet service. our stay was only four days and the room service was of no use and I for 5 minutes of internet time that i used i was charged 1hour. i think the compensation should have been something a little more useful. some of the restaurants menu choices did not equal the offered choices when we were served.I think that the personel was wonderful but the hotel should be moe accomodating for people with a shorter stay and update their promotions on a regular basis.

<Content>Awesome!!!!!! Loved every minute, wanted to stay Everything was wonderful, from the minute we got there until the day we left. I don't know what some of you people think when you are writing the reviews. Especially the one about hamburgers and hot dogs in a 5 star resort, they must be picky eaters because there was alot more than that to choose from. We are talking about a third world country after all, you are not going to get the five star rating you would expect where you live. Get it together people, maybe you should stay home and not give other people a bad impression. Anyways, please go, the people and the hotel were just excellent. I will definitely go back...........

<Content>A little piece of Heaven Hola! I just returned from a wonderful week at the Punta Cana Princess (Oct 29- Nov 4). I honestly was concerned about being moved from the Tropical Princess to its sister, the PCP, but once there, all concerns flew right out the window. The Resort: Magnificant! The staff work very hard to keep the resort clean and the grounds are very well kept. The overall landscaping is very nice- you really feel like you are in paradise! Although the resort is fairly large, everything is within walking distance- no need to take trams anywhere other than to the sister resorts (Tropical and Caribe). The rooms: We thought the room was very clean and updated (new resort after all). The maids did a great job of tiding up and making sure the fridge was fully stocked with bottled water, beer and pop, as well as giving us fresh towels everyday. There is air conditioning, so you can always have a good sleep. There were fresh flowers daily, which really added to the decor.The food: There were 2 breakfast and lunch buffets, and both served good food, and offered many different options. They tried very hard to be as western as possible, but of course it still has a taste of its own. There are 3 different a la cartes at the PCP and 3 at the Tropical Princess. We never went to any at the Caribe. Of all the a la cartes, we tried the Italian, the Tex mex and the Mexican (at the Tropical). My favorite was the Italian restaurant. I had a shrimp dish that was by far the best thing I ate all week! And comparable to some of the best meals I have ever eaten! Over all, the food is deffinetly edible and you have alot of selection, so Im sure everyone can find somthing they like.The pool and beach: Both outstanding. When you think of a tropical paradise- the crystal blue/green waters and the white sand beaches, this is exactly what you get here! The beach was very clean and had hundreds of louge chairs and grass hut coverings, and it was never a struggle to find the perfect lounging spot. No need to wake up at the crack of dawn to get one! The ocean was very warm and the little waves made swimming in it alot of fun. Too bad the waves were not larger for boogie boarding! The Pool was huge! They have just one pool but the size makes up for it. The pool also hosts a swim up bar with the funniest staff (Nelson Gasoline!). It also has pool volleyball, basketball and water polo nets. Again, many lounge chairs and not once a struggle to find a seat.I would highly recomend this resort as it truly is a piece of heaven on earth. You cant ask for a more picturesque tropical paradise. The staff are very friendly and work very hard to ensure you are well taken care of. Lastly, some words of advice. It is much appreciated by the staff if you make an effort to speak a little spanish. Just the basics is enough, and overall it is very helpful. Be prepared in terms of stomach medications- pepto, immodium, etc. If you plan to do some shopping, american currency is best. You seem to get better deals and it is much easier to barder when you dont have to be doing the coversion. I found that doing the shopping on the beach was far better than at the plaza because it was kinda scary with the pressure of the store owners at the plaza than at the beach. In fact, when my friend was about to pay for an item , the store owner tried to get his fingers (literally) on some more money right out of her wallet. Not the best experience with the dominicans at the plaza! Be very careful when it comes to cigar purchases. I recommend buying them from the resort directly. I dont smoke myself, but wanted to bring some home for friends and family that do, so I bought some Cubans from a beach vendor, but later found out the cigars I bought were rolled up banana leaves. I noticed after that, that 99% of the vendors, both at the plaza and the beach sold fakes- so BEWARE! Also, when it comes to shopping, dont be afraid to haggle. I was suprised that thing were much more expensive than I anticipated, so its best to shop around and get a good idea of what you can get items for. Try some of the excursions if you can- they are well worth it. We did Bavaro Runners and Trackers as well as Marinarium. All were great in there own way. Best piece of advice: Go with an open mind and remember its your vacation, so dont let the little things ruin your few days in paradise.

<Content>Great Time!!!!!!!! Got back yesterday Oct 30.Well, I read all the reviews, and was quite worried about our trip. My advice to you is to read the reviews for amusement purposes only. Judge the resort for yourself, once you get there!It is beautiful!! The beach is great, the sand is soft, the drinks are plentiful, and the staff are great! There are a few who speak ok english, and some who don't speak english at all, but I don't speak any spanish, so who am I to complain. Oh ya the pool is also fantastic, Nelson and Martin are a lot of fun at the pool bar, You will laugh all day long with them. Try and get them to have a few drinks with you, but make sure your discrete about it, so as not get them in trouble. The food was edible, It's not Canadian though. The a la cartes were great. I don't know how people can complain about the service, These people get 3 days off a month, so sure they might have a bad day every once in a while, and if your rude to them on their bad day, then they'll remember you and you won't get great service, and I would be the same if I were them. A 1 dollar tip every few drinks will go a long way. People complain about flies, while eating, lol!!! The buffets are outdoors, what do you expect. Have these complainers never had a barbecue in their back yard? or never gone camping? Give me a break! Bugs in the rooms, again lol! Have you ever had flies, ants, spiders, mosquitoes in your house? some people just live to complain. And all the people who say they got sick, we never got sick, but did have an upset stomach a couple of times. The people who got sick, did they drink tap water? were they in the sun too long, and got sunstroke, but blamed it on the food?, did they drink too much? did they drink to many sweet drinks (bahama mama, pina colada) which are laxitives, because of the coconut? Did they eat too much greasy food? you get the point, people can be sick for various reasons, but they all choose to blame the food.My advice to you, bring lots of sunscreen, drink plenty of bottled water, don't read the reviews and believe them, judge it for yourself, and have fun.contact me if you like.

<Content>Relaxing honeymoon with pros and cons We just returned from our two week honeymoon at the Punta Cana Princess. I was disappointed as we were supposed to stay at the Bavaro Princess but were moved over due to hurricane damage. The Bavaro looks much bigger with a nicer beach and higher rating but the Punta Cana Princess was still very nice. We were VIPs, which is worth it I must add, so we had our own desks and staff who would help us book dinners etc... The massages that we received were excellent and the spa itself was beautiful and calming, with the best English spoken out of the whole resort. We were in the 5000 building, which is closest to the ocean and had a great view of everything from the top floor (3rd). Maid service was consistent and they have no problems adding 7-up or whatever you want more of. Do tip them though as they don't make much and they are thorough (we were in the room a few times when they cleaned). Lots of closet space and drawers in the room and the air conditioning worked very well. I saw some tiny tiny ants on the bathroom floor once but that was it plus what do you expect? Once you see outside the resort and what they live in, you will be happy with the great accomodations we get! To see the countryside we recommend the Bavaro Runners excursion. It's $75 US and worth it. You get a real taste of the Dominican life and it really humbles you a bit, yet isn't totally depressing. The only other excursion we went on was Manati Park where we swam with the dolphins, which we enjoyed.Beautiful beach and clear warm water was the highlight. Some other resorts had more seaweed but the sand is soft and white-you can't beat it! Take a walk both ways as it's neat to see the other resorts and there is some shopping on the left side of the beach from the resort. We found that the best deals are on excursions and Bavaro Plaza (short taxi ride from resort). The Plaza had lots of stores and a bank which we recommend getting your pesos from instead as the rate was way better than the resort, which was strange. Note: there is also an actual bank, not just a machine (which was not working by the way at our resort) right next door to the left at the LTI resort with, again, better rates.Unfortunately I have to be honest about the biggest disappointment, the food. We were OK for the first 4 or 5 days but heard that lots of people did get sick quite bad. The food didn't taste too bad and they did have lots of selection, even having a theme in the buffets some days but we figure because the resort was full and they weren't totally prepared from the hurricane, this is why the food became a problem. We had to stick to buns and pasta for the last week as we decided to stay away from the meat, which seemed to help. We didn't get cramps, only your typical stomach-ache and diarrhea. It's hard to pin-point but I really don't think this is typical of the resort and wouldn't suggest basing your decision on this info. It's a lot for our bodies to adjust too with the heat, humidity, different food etc... so keep an open mind and don't expect the worse! The a la cartes are great, the service can be good and bad (just like home though) but there's a few different choices:Italian, steakhouse, Chinese, gourmet, Mexican. Try as many as you can (some are in the next resorts over).All-in-all we did have a great time and it really does depend on your attitude. We saw some people who just seemed determined to be unhappy and complainers and it looks bad and doesn't make the workers there feel very good. They do everything they can to help and don't deserve some crabby tourist yelling in their face, especially after they just went through one of the scariest natural disasters!Have fun, enjoy and relax-that's what it is all about. If you want more entertainment I would suggest another resort as this one is meant to be quieter and relaxing.

<Content>Mixed feelings... NOT like last year Hi there...This is my second posting, my previous one was for the Princess resort, which is next door.Now bear in mind that my review will be as objective as possible considering we've experienced a great week last year and a not-so-great one this year. My review is objective in the sense that i will compare last year's experience with this present year but with the special circumstances that affected this year's trip, they are:Hurricane Jeanne:Jeanne threw a fit around Punta Cana, by talking with the local people outside of the resort and keeping in mind the exchange rate and the prices of various essential commodities; Jeanne did a lot of damage to the infrastructures (roofs and some buildings) since they are not adapted to the hurricane-force winds. Some resorts were closed and their booked clients were relocated to open resorts, causing congestion of the equipment, workforce and hotel infrastructures. Bottom-line: The hurricane did a lot of damage; hotels, resorts and tour operators underestimated the damage; sent their clinets to open resorts as to minimize financial loses but these resorts had staff only for their low-season period. Some staff membres were just transplanted from other (closed) resorts and had no idea of the policies and procedures of their employers resulting in a lot of eroneous information to customers.Sickness:Upon departure for the resort, out tour operator representative informed us that more than half of the clients staying at our resort have been sick during the saty and that this did not occur in any other resort in Punta Cana during that same period.I myslef was sick for 4 days and took my prescription of Cipro on the 3rd day of sickness because of the gut-wrnching cramps. (note ot all the people who say that bringing Antibiotics is superfluous: I'm NEVER sick during travel and I've experienced pain to incredible levels in my life so i'm not one that complains about belly-aches. I would like to see how you endure these cramps during your holidays).On the first day i got sick i noticed (talking with other guests) that a lot of people were sick too and upon further investigation, the sickness was not related to a specific food or drink. The patern of distribution of the symptoms hinted for a larger, common source. I beleive that the hurricane dammaged the water-treatement plant or infrastructure rendering it less than optimal. It is the only way i can explain wide-ranging contamination.Besides, at 160US$ per patient, the doctor and the hotel made a nice sum treating patients...Okay, these were the subjective aspects of my trip.Service:Service was generally great, people were friendly and always in good spirits and sported the world-famous dominican smirk. Always pleasant!Food:Food was NOT as good as last year, when we were staying at the Princess (next door, same resort). Food was often bland and uninspiring.A La Carte Restaurants:That's where we are not really happy with the resort. Last year we ate at the Mexican and Dominican restaurants at the Caribe Club - Princess resort; these two restaurants were simply GREAT! Now we were supposed to Stay at one, play at three meaning we had access to all the infrastructures at the Caribe Club - Princess resort, (including the restaurants) but since Hurricane Jeanne damaged the resort, we were told:a) the restaurants were not open tonight, but will be opned tomorow, cause it's their day off;b) The restaurants were damaged and were undergonig repair work;c) The restaurants were not open for us, staying at the Punta Cana Princess.On the second-to-last day, we tried to book at the Dominican and were told that we could not for reason (b), but my wife and I took a walk after supper and found not only the restaurant to be opened, but people were eating there... We were NOT amused.For the A La Carte Restaurants that WERE open;The Tex-Mex:Very good steakhouse. Excelent presentation, excelent guy working the grill who knows how to cook a steak on a hot plate (not a BBQ...). Service was prompt and very efficient. Staff friendly and funny. The Local Mariachis were there one night and were EXCELENT, they offer to sing Happy or Love song and have a great repertoire including international spanish classics and the three of them have GREAT voices... very soothing...IL Baccio:Okay, i'm a Italian food connaisseur... Short of being Italian in body, I left my heart and soul in Italy during a short, one-week trip there in 1992... Forza Italia!!!The food was suprisingly excelent, i've had a Carpaccio which was, in all honesty, one of the best ones i've had in my life (And I never miss a chance of having it!!!! - By the way, the best one in Montreal is at La Spagettata on Laurier Street). Pizza (second course) was excellent. Procsiutto was exactly like the one we eat in the old country and NOT like the one we have in North America!I was very impresssed, ate untill i couldnt swallow another piece of food...Bravissimo!Beach:As alway, gorgeous, beautifull and fun. Only problem are the other guests who thrwo their garbage on the beach; some people just dont give a crap about others and think they own the world. And more often than not, they spoke german... funny coincidence? I also did a little investigation: after talking to maintenance, security and service staff, they all told me the same thing about the German lack of respect. Of course the staff cannot comment openly about that because they do not want to loose their job which is to my observation, to pick up after them. But if just for the sake of other customers, they could make an effort to pick up after themselves. I regularly picke up junk burried in the sand (Cigarette botches, empty plastic glasses, cigarette packs, lighters, empty sunscreen bottles.... ugh...Rooms:Equal as last year, always very clean and neat. The maid service was better than last year. We were very pleased.Guest service:They were clearly overworked; these poor guys and girls were just flooded with guest complains concerning some underqualified staff or sickness-related complains. They were nonetheless very pleasant and more often than not, helpfull.Language:I've noticed that this year, most of the staff either spoke French or English; which was helpfull because our spanish is very limited but we nonetheless always made the effort of speaking the whole conversation in Spanish. A lot of the Haitian staffers were of great help since they learn French and English in school...Shopping:ALWAYS NEGOCIATE; as a rule of thumb go for a quarter of what they ask for. if they are difficult, tell them that you are not interested and you'll get your price at the next store anyways. They will telll you that the next guy does not have the same things... (ha ha). So dont be shy to say no, to bargain. (we bought 3 bottles of rum, a nice necklace for 20 US$; they asked for 95 US$ for the 3 bottles at the beginning...)Taxi:Get the hotel to call for a taxi; when the guy arrives, negociate the price BEFORE entering the taxi. To get to the shopping mall DO NOT pay more thank 8$ regardless if it'a a car or van. If the guy does not want to lower the price to a reasonable 6 to 8$ tell him to go back; he'll change idea pretty quick.Again ALWAYS NEGOCIATE before entering the taxi.Tourist Police:DO NOT RELY on these people; one guy begged us for money to pay himself a drink while on the job. The guy was sporking a nice .38 handgun that was unloaded and did not seem to have any ammo on him... As precaution, i would leave my wife and daughter get into the shops and I would wait outside and scan around for some trouble (which NEVER occurs, but i'm the prudent-type). I would also check the vendors to see if they'd try to slip something into my wife's or duaghter's pockets in order to cause a situation that could be solved by blackmail. I kept the girl's backpacks on me and restricted the shopping to the street-side stores, I NEVER GO in the Alleys... I might be paranoid but i'm in another country, i'm a gringo, I have money; you do the math...Last words:In all fairness; eventhough we were sick and a bit dissapointed in comparisson to the previous year's experience, we still had a great time! We enjoyed ourselves. ASK QUESTIONS BEFORE: to your tour operator, if they dont give you answers, turn them down. Be specific (Ex: Is the Kid's club open during our stay, if the answer is positive, ask them if they spoke to a hotle staff.) ALWAYS NOTE the time, date and name of person you're talking to and make a short note on the content of the conversation and validation of the information. Intel gathering depends on clear information. If you are not satisfied or misled, you can fire back with muscle.You can write me if you have other questions...

<Content>Not a 5 star Beautiful resort. We stayed in the 5000 building which was at an excellent location....close to the pool and beach; the rooms are clean and spacious. Our favourite restaurant was the seafood restaurant at the PCP......seafood was very fresh. However, we receive indifferent services from their staff. The service from the a la carte restaurant was excellent. Same cannot be said for the bar in the pool. We went to get drinks and we were told they were closed (before 6pm) and therefore would not serve us. However, when we turned around, the bartender continued serving his other guest who were mainly spanish speaking. Also, one of our excursions got cancelled and we were never notified of it. We waited in the lobby before 7am the day of the excursion for nothing. The concierge said that they try calling our room the day before but no one was there. They left us no message or note.... nothing to notify us. Very disappointing. Not what you would expect from a 5 star resort!

<Content>Holiday from Hell The proverbial holiday from hell.What a disaster,problems are too many to go into,however when you see hot dogs,and hamburgers on the buffet at a 5 star hotel,then you know you have a problem. My wife and I are not picky eaters,and have spent 10 years vacationing in Cuba,so we are able to compare the Islands. and their local standards etc. You could not even get fresh orange juice,just coolaid!!No entertainment in the evening,indifferent attitude of many of the staff,even when tipped (there was the odd exception).This resort has a long way to go to live up to its 5 star rating given by Sunquest. My advice would be..really check this over before you commit; we will never go back.My advice in two words.. Don't Go.

<Content>Lovely!!!! My boyfriend and I just came back from a week stay at punta cana princess. We were there from Sept 6th to 13th. If you are looking for a lively loud, crowded resort then this is not the place for you. Stay at the Caribe Club next door. Punta cana Princess was just what I was looking for! a beautiful quiet resort, I went to relax not to party. The service was phenomenal, the beach was gorgeous, rooms were clean and spacious, no bugs! Food was great at Tex Mex and the seafood restaurant, buffet was okay, but we preferred the a la carte restaurants. No evening entertainment at the resort you just to go next door to Caribe club, we saw Lion King at the theatre there and it was great!!As for the excursions we went on Marinarium,(70US pp) where you swim with nurse sharks and sting rays that was alot of fun! and we went on Bavaro Trackers(55USpp) you ride on a dirt bike along the coast and you get to do some horseback riding very adventurous if you like that but remember to bring sunglasses cause the dust gets in your eyes, be prepared to get very dirty.We stayed away from tap water, but we had drinks with ice cubes, which is what got us in the end. All in all Punta Cana is beautiful and we would go back in a heartbeat!!!

<Content>Relaxing and Beautiful My husband, myself, and a couple of our friends returned from a 7 night stay at the PCP on Spetember 6th. The Resort is Beautiful, we liked that it was smaller then some but still large enough. We had requested a specific room on the 3rd floor in building 4 and it was perfect. The view of the ocean and the pool was great from our room. The specialty restraunts were better than the buffet, we tried all of them. We liked the steak at the Tex Mex and the seafood at the Mediterranean the best. We also ate at the Chinese and the Mexican at the Carib, they were okay but nothing to write home about. Who would expect to go to the Dominican Rep. and eat authentic Chinese and Mexican anyway?The bars were great and we did not receive any watered down drinks. Try the Banana Mama it is great! We spent most of our days around the pool which is lovely. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay a very pleasant one.We went to get some well needed RR and it is the perfect place to get it.Punta Cana is very simular to Playa Del Carmen, the resort layouts are designed alike. The beach at Punta Cana is the best.We would go back!

<Content>The Truth About the Punta Cana Princess My husband and I spent a week at the Punta Cana Princess (September 4-11, 2004) for our honeymoon. We were a bit apprehensive at first, after hearing many negative reviews about the place. I travel at least once a month with my job, so I have seen the best of the best when it comes to hotels, resorts  customer service. I have also previously worked in an upper scale restaurant for 8 years as a server, and know what good customer service entails.CHECK INWe arrived at the hotel at 12:00 noon and were standing in the check in line for less than a minute, when we were brought over two tropical slushy drinks during check in. I dont' know how they knew that we were new people to the hotel, as the bellman had previously taken our luggage from us. We were very pleased that they were so prompt. We opted for the VIP package, so we were then immediately taken to a seperate table where we could sit down and check in without having to wait in the line (which was only 2 or three people anyways)Our room was not going to be ready until 3:00, so my husband and I went and ate lunch, walked around a bit, returned only to find our room was ready at 1:45! (Over an hour earlier than anticipated). It may be a good idea to carry some beachwear in a seperate carry on so you can change in the bathroom and go to the beach right away, if you like!ROOMSWe got to our room to find that the bellman had brought our luggage up for us (we didn't have to lug it around), which was very convenient. Our room was on the top floor, so the ceilings were about 22 ft high (making the room seem HUGE!!!), ask for the top floor if you don't mind hearing the rain fall at night, but want a bigger seeming room, and it was very big already. Sunken living room with the TV and mini bar and a day bed (which folds out from underneath to become an extra bed).Very clean, no ants, flys anything like that.FOODWe ate mostly at the buffet restaurant which had PLENTY to choose from. You picky people I can't believe you can't find anything to eat here. They have made to order pasta  omelettes, plenty of chicken, fish, beef, cereals, breads, potatotes, nachos, rice, desserts, soups etc, no what is there not to like?We also ate as part of our VIP package at Le Cava restaurant and had the grilled lobster which was FABULOUS!!!! I don't know why you people say it doesn't taste like the lobster at home, of course it doesn't, it tastes way better! Fresh from the Carribbean Sea.The servers are PHENOMENAL. Never have an empty glass, or lack anything. They gio ABOVE AND BEYOND for you and love what they do, even though they only make about $50 US per week. We enjoyed tipping the waiters $1-$3 US dollars at a time. One night we even gave one of the waiters $20 bill because we enjoy giving to others.ENTERTAINMENTThis would be my only complaint. If you are looking to party, you will be disppointed, because the night life here is next to none. There was some bingo, other crowd games in the lobby one night, but thats it. The next door resort, Caribe Club Princess had the entertaininment which varied every night. They have a huge outdoor theatre, ranging from low scale crowd icebreakers to a really phenomenal production of the Lion King.There is a disco at the Caribe too - lots of locals and plenty of Spanish  North American music, where your drinks are free until 2:30 am and you pay no cover, although the locals pay to come in and also to get their drinks.THE BEACHSoft white sand and clear blue waters, plenty of beach chairs and huts, never have to race down in the morning to reserve one.Because they are trying to keep the Punta Cana princess the quiter resort, people from the Caribe Club Princess  Tropical Princess can't come over to use the beach, but we could go over to use theirs.THE PEOPLEAmazingly friendly. Do whatever they can to please you. Language was sometimes a barrier as some people spoke very little English, but they will try and teach you some of their language and are not uncomfortable trying to communicate with you, so have the decency to try and talk back to them, even if just in small phrases.It saddened me to see how little the people had. we tipped a salesguy on the beach $3 after he sold us two beaded necklaces for $13 US and he had tears in his eyes. They have so little, so $3 to them is like a days work.Thats it. We had an enjoyable time. I highly recommend this resort to someone who is looking for a quiet place to relax.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation My wife and I spent a week at the Punta Cana Princess, and we couldn't have enjoyed it more. We had asked for a room with a king size bed, but none were available on the day we arrived. Jose Maria was an excellent help to us at the front desk and gave us a great room overlooking the ocean with a king bed on day 2. The food was excellent, always something different to choose from. We tried the Tex Mex Steakhouse, the Mare Nostrum, and the Mexican Restaurant (at the Caribe Club) and all were very good, especially the mixed grill at the Mare Nostrum. The Beach was beautiful and the Market on the beach was excellent for getting souvenirs. My wife and I bought several paintings, and jewlery for a very good price. When bartering, go down at least 75% of what they first offer. You will usually meet at about 60% less. For an excursion we took the speedboat/snorkel cruise and it was excellent. We were the only english speaking couple on the trip, and thus had our own tour guide for the duration of the snorkelling session. We would certainly not hesitate to go back to the PCP. It truly was an excellent vacation.

<Content>An excellent Vacation but .... My family and I just returned from vacation Aug. 9 - Aug. 13 and we all had a fun time. The staff was extremely friendly and had many activities for all the guest to participate in. The beach was beautiful with white sand. We did pairsailing, snorkling, and the banana boat ride. The rooms were very spacious and the mini-fridge was always stocked. We tried two of the specialty restaurants in addition to the buffet and also went next door to the Caribe Club Princess for breakfast. Now, the only bad thing I can say about the whole experience is that we all got sick on the last day of vacation. As much as we prepared for this with all the different medicines we took down there, I believe we ate something at the Tex - Mex Steakhouse that didn't agree with us. Overall, for the price you will be satisfied with the resort. Let me know if you want to see pictures.

<Content>Didn't want to leave I can't stop talking about the great time I had. The sand is undescribably soft, the resort is so clean, the staff were extremely helpful and the food was a great experience. There is so much to do that my friend and I couldn't fit all the activities in (Marisol was a hugh help!). We had none of the problems listed in some of the other reviews. We did bring our own washclothes after reading previous reviews, but were brought washclothes almost everyday. I would recommend bringing a few snacks, the restaurants were sometimes closed between lunch and dinner and our reservations weren't until 9:00 pm. We had no problem making reservations for restaurants up to two days in advance. I also recommend the extra money for the VIP package. The 20 min massage at the spa was wonderful. I wanted to go back for some of the other services but couldn't fit the time in.I went down with one of my girlfriends, but I'll definately be going back with my husband.

<Content>food lovers beware Just returned from 1 week at the puntacana princess resort,The resort itself was nice,It was smaller then most resorts, the pool was very large with a swim up bar, the room we had was excellent, the beachfront was very nice other then next door their is a piece of private beach which was a little dirty,(I suggest the caribe princess and punta cana princess put their hired hand to keep it clean).The buffet is very mediocore for a 4 plus to 5 star resort(sunquest rating)The salad selection consists of iceberg lettuce, that tells you the story.The food at the allacarte restaurants wasn't bad,It would be overcooked or under cooked, the waiters do not speak english and do not want to learn, I am italian and they also do not speak italian.La cava and il pescator reataurants were very good but you have to pay extra.Would I recommend the place NO.There are so many nice places in punta cana why chance it.I would recommend, the melia tropical/caribe, the riu resorts especially riu palace or riu bambu, the iberostar bavaro, melia paradisus,I have been to all three of these chains and I have been satisfied with them.Choose wisely, spend the extra money and you won't be disappointed.Punta cana princess you are lucky punta cana is such a popular destination and eventually everything good sells out and then people have no choice but to choose you.

<Content>Highly recommended hotel and facilities My friend and I stayed at the Princess for 6 nights, we found the hotel to be excellant. We are Carribean travelers and stay at only 4 star or better facilities. We found the service to be excellant, the facilities to be excellant and very clean. The beach was immaculate, the seaweed was swept off the beach daily. The staff worked incredibly hard to ensure all your needs were met. All rooms were at least two room suites with a living and bedroom. The frig in your room was stocked daily. You had the run of three hotel facilities which gave you lots of food choices. The Princess Caribe had the seafood restaurants, the Princess Punta Cana had the steak houses. Don't be shy visit the other hotels buffets and restaurants. The Caribe hotel had a MUCH bigger buffet for breakfast and lunch. We ate there several times for a larger selection. The Caribe hotel also had more children activities and facilities, where the Punta Cana was more adult in environment. Punta Cana Princess was perfect for rest and relaxation. The Caribe had entertainment at night as well. Keep in mind, you walk out the front door of Punta Cana hotel, walk 5 minutes to your left and your at the Caribe hotel (right next door). There is also a shuttle that runs door to door. So don't be afraid to stay at the Princess and shuttle over. The Caribe had LOTS of people, LOTS of noise and more competition for food, bars, and service. So think about what your needs are. Personally, I liked the Princess Punta Cana because is was less noisey and less people, better service and more facilities available (the service people to vistor ratio was better at the Punta Cana Princess). It was also the newer facility.Alcohol was plenty. You could have just about everything you wanted, when you wanted it. Every drink was very strong, at times you had to ask them to make them weaker. Drinks were everywhere. Pina Colata's and Margaritas were premade and ready for pouring on request. The presidente beer was the favorite on the island. The only thing I feel that could have been improved was the selection of wine. They offered a red and white table wine, both were a little bland, selections for wine to purchase was limited. If you have a favorite you might want to bring it with you.I enjoyed the trip, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.This one is worth the trip.

<Content>Excellent Excellent Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't believe all the bad reviews about the PCP. My family and I went for a 4-night, 5-day vacation last week and all we can say is EXCELLENT! The staff was extremely friendly and did everything they could to make sure we were having an excellent vacation. The hotel was gorgeous! The rooms were very spacious and all had fantastic views. The food was not bad either. We tried out 2 of the specialty restaurants in addition to the buffet. We especially liked the breakfast buffet and the Tex-Mex Steakhouse. We stuck to the bottled water (even for brushing teeth) and avoided chicken and fish (just to be safe. At night, if you want a romantic scene- sit out by the bar next to the beach. We will 100% return again! Great job

<Content>Don't believe the bad reviews I just got back from my honeymoon at the PCP. I must say that we both had an amazing time there.The beach is absolutely stunning and very clean. The resort grounds and rooms are immaculate and well presented. The service is great if you go there with a positive attitude and treat the workers with respect. The food at the a'la carte restaurants is better than average, and resembles the level of service and quality of a fine establishment. The buffet is ok, nothing to brag about, but this is expected of all inclusive resorts. There are several tours that can be taken through the hotel. We did Aqua Safari and Bavaro runners -both were awesome and totally worth the money!!If you are going here on your honeymoon, don't forget to bring your marriage certificate for a free upgrade and some special bonuses!Thanks to Ahmed, Frandy, Mariesol, Ramon, Franklin, Felipe, etc.. for making this a memorable and special time for us!

<Content>Overall, a good value We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess for seven nights in the middle of July, and were happy overall. CHECK IN/ ROOMS-- Somewhat slow, but this was not a huge problem. We had requested a room with two double beds, but were given a room with a king. When we entered the room, it was dirty with cigarette butts in the ashtrays and empty beer and soda bottles on the dresser. We returned to the front desk where they found a new room for us within 15 minutes. The room was big and clean and we were very happy with it. The beds are really hard, but we got used to it. We got plenty of U.S. television stations (Showtime, HBO, MTV, TBS, Lifetime, etc.) and felt right at home in our room for the week.STAFF-- We found the staff to be extremely friendly and courteous. Small tips to the bartenders, servers, and maids go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable. These employees work hard and deserve it, and you will get even better service. Most employees at this resort speak enough English to at least understand the needs and requests of their guests. Overall, the level of service at this resort was outstanding. The only times we had any issues with service is when we went to the Caribe Club/ Tropical Princess. The staff there made us very glad that we were staying at the PCP.FOOD/ DRINKS-- The food was decent. The buffet is large enough where you can always find something you are willing to eat, even if it is the same thing you have eaten for the past four days. As far as the a la cartes, Tex- Mex was by far the best. The seafood was decent and the Italian was terrible. The late-night snacks were never seen, although we looked for them twice. We ate at the Domincan restaurant at the Caribe Club one night and had such an awful experience that we chose to stick to the PCP for the rest of the week.  As far as the drinks go, they tend to be tasty but very, very weak. All of the alcohol (with the exception of champagne) is watered down. This includes the wine. If you are a big wine drinker, definately consider bringing your own. As far as insulated mugs go, we found that we didn't really need them but enjoyed having them. Also, we found that when we shopped at the vendors on the beach, they really wanted them and were willing to trade things for them. Keep that in mind if you are looking for good deals. BEACH/POOL- The beach is GORGEOUS and there is always enough wind to keep you cool. The pool is also nice and kept very clean. We never got up to reserve a spot and never had a problem finding one. Yes, there are topless women, so if that bothers you, don't go to Punta Cana. One negative note-- the pool closes for the night at 7 p.m.Overall, our experience at the PCP was a good one. The only major drawback I have was the sickness. I got SO sick the second night, but felt OK again in a couple of days. However, my friend and I continued to have stomach problems for over a week after we got home. Bring Immodium, brush your teeth with bottled water, and hope for the best.  Punta Cana is beautiful and the most relaxing place I have ever been to, and we would definately return. PUnta Cana Princess was comfortable and worth the money we spent. However, next time I think I will spend the extra money and go to a 5 or 6 star resort.

<Content>GREAT Hotel..... The Punta Cana Princess is a beautiful hotel. The grounds look great, considering how new this resort is. The staff was wonderful, always smiling and making sure everything was okay. As for getting sick..I went with a group of 6 people...1 of us felt a little under the weather the last few days..but it is understandable, you are in a different country...where their standards are not the same as North America... As for the water, any experienced travellers should know not to use it and only use bottled water. Which is given out everywhere at this resort. The buffet was good, a little repetitive at times..but still you could always find something to eat. The Tex-Mex/Grill restaurant was great and also the Italian was great also. The rooms were a great size and very clean. Our mini-fridge was stocked everyday and well-stocked at that..just be courteous to the maids and they will be courteous back. As for nightlife..this resort has none...the disco is at the Caribe Club next door and so are all the nightly shows...far walk..but there is a shuttle bus that takes you. The beach is great..a little seaweed. The jetboat/snorkelling excursion is well worth a try...only a half day tour. This was a great resort and I would go back, don't listen to all the negative reviews written by others. PCP is a great hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Experience My 24-year old daughter and I just returned from a 4-day trip to the Punta Cana Princess and I will share our experiences for those who are contemplating a visit to this resort. FOOD: We thought the food was fabulous. We had the buffet the first night, which was very good, fresh, and hot with a good variety of choices. We got drinks quickly and with no problem. The desserts were particularly good. We made reservations our first day for the Italian restaurant and the seafood restaurant. Reservations were no problem at all; the staff at the Guest Services table was knowledgable, helpful and friendly. The Italian restaurant had the best salmon I have ever eaten. Ever. It was buttery and melted in your mouth. I was served chicken first which was dry and tasteless. When informed, the waiter immediately replaced it with salmon and was apologetic about the problem. The service was comparable to an excellent restaurant. We left a nice tip, although we noticed others left not tip at all. Seems very rude, even though the meals are paid for, the staff did a very good job. The third night we ate at the seafood restaurant, which is just the poolside grill that they convert in the evening. The food was wonderful again, but we almost died of the heat. For some reason, they had closed some screens and blocked all the ocean breeze. With ice cold drinks, we finally adjusted to the temperature. We had a seafood platter (from which they cheerfully removed the calamari for me) and, again, the desserts were wonderful. At both the restaurants, they brought a dessert cart and you could choose your dessert.HORSEBACK RIDING: This was part of our VIP package - and, incidentally, I do not recommend the $100 VIP Package. It is simply not worth the money. You can get the same options much cheaper. We enjoyed the horseback riding on the beach, but some advice: 1. Have them adjust your stirrups before you leave. They did not do this and we both had sore legs and ankles. 2. Extend the 30 minutes to an hour. It takes 10 minutes to get to the beach and 10 back, so you don't have much time at the beach, which is beautiful. They take pictures before you leave, then offer you a CD with the picture or a bottle of rum with the picture on it. Kinda cheesy but fun for a souvenir. We bought the $15 CD.SPA: OK, if you don't do anything else while you are there, GO TO THE SPA!!! My daughter and I just loved it. I have been to several spas and this was the best experience for the best price I have ever had. For $125, we have a massage, facial, exfoliation of the whole body, mud wrap, hydrotherapy tub - it was fabulous. You arrive at the spa, which is just 2-3 minutes from the front door of the resort through a beautiful garden, with fountains and waterfalls. Your attendant, very professionally dressed in a uniform, takes you down another path through a beautifully landscaped area with waterfalls, etc. to your own little hut which has a tub, shower, massage table, etc. You should be aware that these are very European experiences - in other words, they are very casual about your nudity and massage your upper body with no qualms - not sexual in any way, it's just part of the experience - just go with it! We tipped them $5 and they seemed grateful.THE ROOM: Our room was perfect, always cool (remember to ask for an extra card so you can leave it in the air conditioner) and cleaned often with fresh flowers arranged with towels to create animals, etc. Our fridge was stocked whenever we drank something and when I asked for Diet Pepsi, it was delivered immediately. We had no problems getting towels, etc. We did leave some small gifts for our maid but that wasn't until the second day and we had great service before that. We were in building 5 on the 3rd floor and had a wonderful ocean view - thanks to whoever had a review that recommended that. Tell your travel agent because people tried to get ocean view after they arrived and weren't succesful.SICKNESS: I did get terribly sick; luckily it was after I got home. The only thing I can pinpoint is that I was casual about brushing my teeth with tap water and my daughter used bottled water. I was the only one sick. It was definitely a bacteria and not something in the food because it lasted for five days and I finally had to get an antibiotic. Try just using the bottled water!!SHOPPING: The first night, they had a big barbecue/party on the beach and had vendors set up tables to sell things. We did most of our shopping here. I was amazed at the number of people who thought the beautiful local stone, Larimar, was turquoise. Do your research about a country before you visit!! We bought beautiful necklaces, bracelets and earrings of Larimar as well as amber, which is also from the area. Do not pay more than 1/2 of what they ask. Do not be embarrassed - they expect you to haggle. GENERAL: The beach is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen with sugar white sand and lovely palm trees. We went topless and felt extremely daring, but there were also other women topless. In conclusion, we had a great experience and I would recommend this resort for everyone.

<Content>Please Let Me Go Back A True Paradise. We absolutely loved the Punta Cana Princess. The staff was magnificient, the scenery was breathtaking and all in all, we couldn't have asked for a better trip. The food was a little different than us North Carolinean's are used too, but that didn't stop us from having the trip of a lifetime. We had plenty of fun activities to take part in, including a fabulous snorkeling trip and plenty of beach volleyball. The swim up pool bar kept us occupied as well! You can't go wrong with the Punta Cana Princess.

<Content>Bad food, inconsistent service, sickness My husband  I stayed at the Punta Cana Princess from July 12 - 16. This was our first time in the Dominican Republic, but we have been to other all-inclusives in Jamaica and the Bahamas. Those places seemed like paradaise compared to the PCP.Food: Food was marginal at best. The buffet for breakfast was okay for a day or 2 but then we got very tired of omelettes. The lunch buffet wasn't very good either. There was a lot of unrecognizable food. The hamburgers were almost raw. The pizza was ok.Dinner at the buffet was ok and it was hit or miss at the ala carte restaurants.Service: Luckily, no one was rude as some of the other reviews mentioned; however, we were disgusted to find out that the maid used my husband's hairbrush! I've never heard of anything so gross. We returned from the beach on our second day and there was long black hair in the brush. My husband has light brown hair and I have red hair, so the only possibility was the maid. From that point on, we locked up absoltely everything when we left the room.Sickness: My husband got sick the 2nd night we were at the PCP. He is still sick, and had to go to the doctor yesterday (over 1 week from time getting sick) to get some tests run to see what in the world he has. Luckily, I only go a mild case of sickness, but I still got sick. That is after not using the water for anything. We stuck to bottled water to drink and to brush our teeth.I heard many people leaving Punta Cana, and regardless of which resort they stayed at, many had very similar stories.Make sure you do your research before going there.

<Content>Beautiful And No Need For A Laxitive! The resort was absolutely beautiful and spotless. The rooms were large and tastefully decorated. Service was excellent and we had no problem with anything other than two out of the four of us got very ill with intestinal problems. Don't drink the water! Everyone says it is the food and to a degree I agree. They have different bacteria there than what we are used to (most of us don't have the antibodies) so be careful in the foods you select to eat. Keep in mind that they do not have any type of rulings as to the temperature control/cleanliness of their foods. On the other hand, we went to have a good time and not for the food in the first place. Choose wisely. Stick with fresh fruits, stay away from the seafood (the seafood restaurant SUCKED) as it is not what we are used to. We met alot of awesome people, had a terrific time on the beach and would recommend this resort to anyone....just read the reviews and take into consideration that it is all in your ATTITUDE so go with a good one.This was our 2nd trip there in the past year and wound up buying a condo under construction. We love it!

<Content>Do your due diligence! We are a family of 4 with a 2 year old and wanted to stay at this resort . I tried to phone them to get some info and no one spoke English. Then I decided to go to the web page since a large portion of thier patrons are English speaking and guess what? No English here either. I finally got wise and decided that the error in judgement was mine and I was being an ugly American so I emailed them on a Sunday. It took them until Friday to respond. I called the sister hotel the Carib Princess and they spoke and communicated well and the only thing I wanted to know was what kind of programs or child care was offered for the 2 year old. It seems that the older reviews were raving and the recent reviews are confirming my opinion. It is 2004 and really cheap to call these places to investigate yourself. We opted to stay at the Sunscape Grand and booked our vacation through Ella at cruiseandtravel.com and really got a great deal and an additional rebate. Email me with any questions.

<Content>glad to be home The beaches in the D.R. are beautiful. It is truly paradise. The hotel was nice on the surface. The main floor hallway to our room smelled of sewage as well as the bed linens. Ice is at a premium at the bars and the restaurants. And forget it in your room. There are no ice machines.The breakfast buffet is OK if you stuck to the breads, bacon and freshly made omelets and fruits.The juices were freshly made- delicious but warm. We just aren't used to the D.R. foods( for example-mashed kidney beans and gray colored sliced meat). We never ate at the lunch buffet. just had hamburgs and hotdogs at the beach. The pizza was passable. We ran into the same problem for dinner- the selections and quality just wasn't available.However, if you can get a reservation The steak house was excellant -the italian was terrible. Make sure you make your reservation from 8am to noon the day of and the day before at the other princess restaurants. The drinks were watered down but my husband said the beer was good. Take lots of dollar bills because they won't give you less than a five dollar bill in change. Tipping helps with the service. One day we didn't get washcloths but I had taken some along.Six out of seven in our party got sick and the seventh was sick the day after we arrived home. Take lots of medicine with you Again the beaches were fabulous but all in all I would not recommend this resort.

<Content>Skip this place if you want service.. Huge Disapointment!! We just returned from a 7 night stay at this resort and it was without question the worst all inclusive resort I have ever stayed at. I traveled with my husband, two 14 yr old daughters, and 11 yr old son. We were there on the 4th of July and wore our USA t-shirts - BIG mistake as these people must hate Americans. They loved our money but did not want us there. We paid full adult price for the 14 yr olds but they were not allowed to order anything for themselves. The help would just ignore them as if they were not there at all and it wasn't much better for my husband and myself. We ate many meals without anything to drink - we ordered drinks from 3 to 7 different people at some meals but no one ever brought anything. We, as well as most of the other guest we spoke to, were sick most of the trip and well into the first week home. We paid for VIP serivce and this was nothing more than a scam for more money. We were suppose to have express check in and had to wait along with everyone else to get checked in. We had requested ajoining rooms for us and the children and they gave us rooms that were in seperate parts of the building and backed up to a garbage dump for the LTI resort. We were told that VIP guest could order premimum liquor and beer and only found one bar server that would serve us these. He would give us Budwiser beer or make a margarita with Jose Cuervo tequila but all the other servers would tell us they didn't have anything else without ever looking. Almost all the employees in guest services acted like they hated working and it was a strain to wait on anyone. The guest services clerk that makes your dinner reservations told us to make them with her for all week and we did only to find out she didn't know what she was talking about and we actually had no reservations because you can only make them one day at a time. It seemed as if no one there knew what was going on. You could not schedule a time for the free VIP 20 min massage either. The women that worked there told my husband to come back in 2 days no matter when we tried to make a reservation. The 24 hr. grill is non-existing also. Our mini-bar fridge didn't work so it didn't matter what they stocked it with. The maids were seen drinking the beer from the mini-bars anyway. As you can tell I was not at all pleased with the service at this resort and would not recommend it to anyone. Yes, the beach was clean and the room was large, but look elsewhere if you are expecting to eat or drink on your vacation.

<Content>Great place but be careful! The resort is nice. It's a good size, not too small or too big. The rooms are larger than average and have a drop down sitting area with a daybed and trundle underneath. There are a lot of USA stations on the TV. There are no washcloths for some reason. They give you one towel and one hand towel per person. The water temperature and pressure was normal. Our room was always cleaned. Like most people said, the food was OK. There wasn't a large variety...probably because the resort isn't that big. We always found things to eat. If you are expecting American food, you will be very disappointed! By the end of the week, we were tired of the food and ready for a USA meal. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants because you have to make reservations, and we didn't want to be on a time schedule. Plus, we have heard many bad things about the restaurants. The long wait, poor food, etc. The service at the buffet was not consistent. Some days/nights we had great service. Other nights our drinks never arrived or our drink order was never even taken. A few times we went behind the service area and got our own water. But most of the staff is very nice.The beach is absolutely beautiful. There is a lot of seaweed, but they rake it up every morning. There are nice waves and the water is warm. We went on the Sanoa Island excursions. I do not recommend it. They make it sound as though you get to spend the whole day at the island and the natural swimming pool. This is not true. The vast majority of your day is spent driving and boating. The Catamaran was very small, uncomfortable, and very boring. Once you get to the island, you eat lunch and only have about 1.5 hours before you have to leave. Then, they take you to the natural swimming pool and you have 20 minutes. It was not worth the time or $ at all! We would of had a much better time spending the day at the resort. Save your money!!Be very careful about the food! We got very very sick and so did everyone else we met. It was not a good situation. They must have some bacteria problems or something with the food. I know it was not just one night or one certain food, because everyone was sick at different times. I have traveled quite a bit and this is the first time I have had a problem and seen so many others sick also. Be very careful and brings lots and lots of medicine.

<Content>Sick, dreadful but a beautiful island My family (6 yr. and 4yr. old) just came back July 7. I also read in detail about this resort before booking and traveling and read raving reviews. I am shocked. There were some good but the bad outweighed the good. The eager to please is just not the case.The first point I would like to make is dont go anytime soon. My family all got sick the 2nd night we were there and stayed sick the whole trip. We met so many people there who experienced the same thing. I am waiting on some test from the doctor because we are still sick. I am scared it is ecoli or a parasite. It ruined our trip. The medical service was not good. The doctor on the property was not very educated and in my opinion was trying to cover up something. I have done quite a bit of traveling and I have never experienced this. Iam still sick. It was a very scarey experience. Some other complaints was the food was awful. Child friendly food? Whatever. The buffet was the same and smelt the same every day. It got very old and lots of flies on the food.Bath towels were extremely hard to get and the cleaning was not very sanitary.The guest service and front desk is not in any way eager to please. They should not even claim they have entertainment. I was so disappointed I will stick to Iberostar Hotels.Sherri

<Content>very disappointed in punta cana princess all suites and spa resort Okay where do I start. My boyfriend and I went on a 5 day trip to DR and we stayed at the all inclusive Punta Cana Princess in the honeymoon suite. We had ants everywhere in our room when we arrived. We told them and they would not move us, they would only spray or fumigate the room. Which they would do while we stayed in the room. We arrived about 4:00 pm and we were very hungry. So our guide told us we had to make reservations for dinner; you cannot just go to where you want to on the resort. Reservations were VERY hard to get. Almost everything was booked up, so we had to take whatever we could get. That night we could not get reservations because they had to be made 2 days in advance!! We had to go to the buffet and it was horrible - ants  flies everywhere!!! Housekeeping was non-existant. We had to call everyday to get towels. The one day that they did come - we did not get towels. We were on our vacation and had to call and wait about a hour each time just for towels to take a shower. The 24 hour buffet??? THERE IS NOT ONE!!!!!!!! The only thing you can get after 11:00 pm is pizza. It is not a buffet - you have to go order and sit and wait on it . No 24 hr Buffet........We were told that roomservice was free and available 24 hours a day. IT WAS NOT FREE!!! - it is $20.00 US each time. The best time we had was at the casino. The only food we ate and really enjoyed was the steakhouse. The filet was great!!! The beach was beautiful and we did enjoy that. Butwe will NEVER go there again. It was an absolute waste of money.

<Content>The good, The Bad and The Ugly The good, the Bad, and THE UGLY!May 17th 鈥?May 24th4* Superior All-Inclusive, Sunquest Vacation from TorontoPunta Cana Princess All Suites Resort and SpaPRINCESS HOTELSCanadian (English Speaking) couple. Early 30鈥檚 with some sun travel experience.(St. Lucia, Veradero, Jamaica x2, Cayo Coco x4. All, all-inclusive, 4 or 4+ Stars) V.I.P. Package with flight, transfers and insurance.Superior Room, Ocean view. $1300 Canadian x2We delayed with this posting to make sure that our credit charges were accurate. (They were.) Hotel was about 1/5th occupied and was very quite except for spa construction that started at 10 a.m. outside our room (We didn鈥檛 mind. Should be finished by now.) Winds off the ocean were constant all week and seemed to be that way all the time by the look of the 55-degree angled palm trees (growing that way) Rain every day at some point. Overcast, 4 of 7 days. Sunny, or party cloudy, 3 of 7 days. 30+ degree C. Daily. Little humidity (due to the wind.)The good:路 Beautiful new hotel. Huge marble lobby floor with reception/bar/ special services/internet/tour rep./area. Nice finishes throughout.The hotel is shaped like a oversize horseshoe, where the bend in the horseshoe is the reception area, buffet, restaurants (x2), tourist shops, and doctors (secondary) office. The 鈥渁rms鈥?of the horseshoe are the rooms. Sets of 3 story, 鈥淪panish鈥?style, motel like buildings running down each side of a beautiful garden area, (with concrete sculptures making for some interesting for photo opportunities), large pool with swim up bar and kiddie pool as well as a spa area (under construction). The end of the horseshoe on the left side is the 鈥渟uperior鈥?honeymoon rooms with direct ocean views. The right side of the horseshoe ends with the Kiddie Play area and the 24 hour beach bar and restaurant. 路 Beautiful beaches. Pure white, cleaned (seaweed) daily, little waves, warm winds. A beach activity centre is located on the beach. Abundant shade huts and reclining beach chairs for amount of guests.路 Strong Sun. Tanned pretty well despite whether.路 We had a 3rd floor room, 1 down from the honeymoon end rooms with a pool view, looking down the beach with a partial ocean view. Our superior room was fantastic. Checkered tiles, very large comfy King Size bed (bedside lights and phone), sunken living room with view, 鈥?satellite鈥?TV. (27 U.S. channels?). Day bed and stocked mini-bar (4 water, 2 beer, 2 Pepsi, 2 Sprite). Beach Towels, easy to use safe, iron  board supplied. Huge bathroom with 2 sinks, amenities(Towels etc.) stocked daily, shower tub and 2nd phone by the toilet?! A/C and room fan. 2 locks on room door. 路 Large private balcony provided good views down the beach and of the pool. Partial ocean view.路 Maid was friendly and was good at stocking towels and general cleaning of room. (Being generous with small gifts daily may have helped.) 路 Use of the neighbouring resorts, (Tropical Princess and Caribe Club Princess.) both to the right of the hotel. More restaurants, sports, bars, and entertainment. Mini train (golf cart) transportation offered to the other resorts. About 2-3 mins. (+ the wait)路 Guest services spoke English and was very nice and informative.路 Coco Tours (to book tours, golf etc.) rep. also spoke English and very nice. 路 Food was abundant at the buffet and there was a big selection路 Good selection of beer and spirits.路 Tex-Mex and Italian restaurant on site.路 Nice lunch buffet at the pool bar for salads, pizza, chicken and burgers.路 Immediate reception and Bell Hop service (baggage delivery and pick-up.)路 24-hour security guard at all entry鈥檚 to resort. 路 No harassment by staff or locals to buy goods on resort.路 Spa is located just outside the lobby. 陆 hour massage included with V.I.P.路 V.I.P. Package Included Complimentary Rum, Cigars, use of robes and in room beach towels. 2 a-la Carte Dinners plus massage at spa. 路 Generally, a very nice hotel by first impressions. The Bad: 路 Structured, un-personal service by all service staff.路 The walk from the lobby, restaurants, buffet, is quite long to any of the superior rooms, pool, and beach.路 Entertainment/ sports board is the same every day. 路 No entertainment at this resort except a D.J. or small 2 or 3 piece band playing at the lobby as well as the exercise classes on the beach and pool.路 Service staff spoke very little or no English and had little customer service skills other than to serve any remove food and drink. Although we didn鈥檛 ask for much it seemed like a lot of work to get it, especially at the 24 hour beach restaurant when the buffet was not available. (Tipping doesn鈥檛 help.)路 Can only drink and brush teeth with bottled water.路 Oversized, (too thick) uncomfortable bed pillows, we couldn鈥檛 use. 路 Stocked fridge varied from day to day. (2 water, 2 coke, no sprite, 2 beer. OR 4 water, no beer, 4 cokes. ??)路 The resort 鈥渢rain鈥?to other hotels arrived inconsistently or not at all. In fact, we watched a number of times as the train circled outside our hotel and turn back into the two neighbouring hotels.( 陆 hour wait on two occasions.) Many times we just ended up walking (5 mins. within resort complex along an uninteresting resort entry road with some speeding traffic from the joining hotel supply road)路 Entertainment at the other hotels was not that entertaining and very amateurish.路 The Disco is just off the resort and is open to the public. The day we went to the Disco was a cover charge of $5 (with our hotel 鈥渁ll-inclusive鈥?wrist bands) although we we鈥檙e told it was included as guests of the resort. 鈥淟ive D.J.鈥?we we鈥檙e told, but never entered and never visited again. Drinks included?路 The food seemed to be cooked in the same grease and tasted much alike.路 All a-la Carte restaurants are not open daily therefore, require a trip to the other hotels if you want to try something different. Book the day before and leave early! No train arrived for us and other guests. We ended up walking in the rain to or reserved (the day before only) dinner. Food tasted much the same as the buffet, which was open 鈥榯il 10 p.m.. Our choice, after our a-la Carte experiences but still very structured, un-personal service.路 Train route (when it does come) to the other resorts is through a 鈥渞ain forest鈥?which is a nice cover for the 鈥渟ewage treatment鈥?location.路 Spa is located at the entrance to the resort and the hotel supply road. Massage was interrupted several times by arriving bus and supply/construction truck noise.路 Mini-putt in neighbour resort is un-kept. Branches, leaves and grip-less putters.路 Golf Tour is offered at $195.00 U.S for 3 rounds with a cart. When arrived I asked for that offer and was told that I had to call from my room to book and arrange my own transportation at a cost of at least $25 U.S. / return by taxi. Therefore, a total cost of 280.00 with telephone calls. Unsure of the quality of the course I opted for I round at $110U.S., toured, to the Punta Cana Golf Club. The day of my trip, my ride didn鈥檛 arrive and a taxi was sent for me 45 mins. later. The course was nice and the course representative felt bad enough and gave me a ride back to the hotel telling me of the recent political and financial turmoil within the Dominican. 50 Dominican $鈥檚 to 1 U.S.$ from 17$鈥檚 to 1. in two years. 路 Went back to Punta Cana golf ( asked but, no discount )and was charged additional $25U.S. after 鈥渉aggling鈥?from an asking price of 40$ for my partner to join me as a guest. $25U.S. for her to ride in the cart!路 Other neighbouring (Caribe and Tropical Princess) resorts offered more but seemed like more work than any of it was worth.THE UGLY:路 Shower pressure and hot water was non-existent both in the morning and early evening.路 Our phone bill was charged an additional $1.25U.S for a local call that was not made by either of us. We suspect it was the maid service. An insufficient amount to raise a 鈥渟ewage treatment stink鈥? we paid our bill without a reasonable explanation from reception. 路 In order to take advantage of your final day, there鈥檚 a courtesy room located just beside the reception area. (A nice feature, we thought.)鈥淭he only one鈥檚 with a key are the Bell Hop and the Security at the front鈥?we we鈥檙e told. Check-out was a noon and our bus left at 5:00 p.m. so we had our bags 鈥渟ecurely鈥?stored within the courtesy room and went a enjoyed our last day at the beach. Returning at 4:00 p.m. we had 1 set of our bags removed by the security guard so that we could wash up and change for our trip home. After returning to the lobby from the washroom we lounged within the lobby before our departure. Seeing the security guard enter the courtesy room and not wanting to ask for him to open the door again for the remainder of our bags, I went to retrieve them. Arriving at the entrance to the courtesy room I found, his back to me, the guard putting papers into his back, right-hand pocket. During this motion he saw me standing, watching him. Upon relizing, my witness to this, he quickly removed the documents from his pocket and put them into an open pocket of one of the other guests bags. He was searching through the guest(s) bags!!!! This from their head of 鈥渟ecurity鈥? We can only imagine. What did I do? I quietly asked for my bags (locked compartments) and asked others to check theirs. (No others on our bus reported anything missing although several reported opened compartments) I also notified the Coco Tours rep. on our bus that said, she 鈥渨ould report him鈥?We don鈥檛 blame the security guard for such an action with the financial state of the country. However, I due blame Princess Hotels for underpaying their security, driving them to such actions, or for not hiring outside help willing to act in the best interests of their guests.NOTE: This was the first time, at any resort we have ever visited, that each and every departing guest was waiting in the lobby, 1 hour prior to the bus leaving to the airport.Side Note: We are collectors of novelty spoons. Awaiting our departure at the Punta Cana Airport we found 1 last spoon at the 鈥淒uty Free鈥? clearly priced at $10U.S. This for a $2 spoon. Undeterred, I tried to purchase the spoon for the $10 marked. The cashier, not finding the right 鈥渃ode鈥?in her computer, asked management, who then told me it was incorrectly marked and should be priced at $12. Deterred, we came home without the spoon.Overall, The Punta Cana All-Suites Resort 4*Superior: 3+ StarsPunta Cana All-Suites Hotel service: 2+ Stars.The Superior room: 3+ Star (4+ with hot water and pressure) The Resort(s): 4 StarGood First Impressions, POOR LASTING IMPRESSIONS!NOT RECOMMENDED!(From our experience, we don鈥檛 know how so many good reviews about this hotel are posted on this site.)

<Content>definitely not 5-star food! If this is a 5-star, then Macdonalds is a 6 or 7-star. My wife and I both got very sick and were sick for 2 days after we got back. We ate mostly at the buffet. One morning, I put some milk in my coffee and it looked like cottage cheese floating on top. The milk was soured. We ate one night at the DR restaurant at the Caribe. The waiter served me the wrong entree and never brought my drink at all. The grounds and beach are beautiful but the food is terrible. All the buffets are open-air and no air-conditioning. The wine was really like wine flavored kool aid. I left the maid a tip every day but one, since I had to call the desk to get towels. No washcloths! I would not go back and could not honestly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>What a vacation We just got back from 6 days in Punta Cana. Our best part of the trip-first class upgrade from US Air! There are no washclothes, bring your own. There are not too many people who speak English. They do not tell you anything about the hotel, they give you a Passport. This has wrong times printed in it. Bugs everwhere!! Flies in the buffet, they need to cover their food. The alchol was very watered down. You have to be VIP or you do not get good drinks. The pool closes at 7. No party life at all in Punta Cana. You have to make reservations a night before you eat. Dominican Republic is a beautiful country, but we would not go back. Good luck!!

<Content>Beautiful resort I had never been to Punta Cana nor to an all inclusive, so I was unsure what to expect. But like everyone else I would say that the resort is beautiful and well taken care of. It is a little smaller than most of the others and I liked that. It was quiet, restful and plenty of food choices. I could always find something I liked. Quality vs quantity would be the advice I would give to the Punta Cana Princess. For the most part the people are kind and helpful who work there. We had dinner at LaCava and it was awesome. The buffet was fair to good... very good a couple of times. We left and went to the Caribe for more options, if it did not appeal. We also enjoyed Ma Ma Mios. I personally don't know that I would return to an all inclusive...I understand the attraction. Maybe it's just not for me. The people who work there are eager to please. We always left a tip each morning and some small gifts. They were truely grateful and it was wonderful to bring joy to their day too. It's a beautiful place and I am grateful to have experienced it's beaches and wonderful sunrise walks. Have a great trip!

<Content>This place is fantastic! My boyfriend and I just returned from a stay at this resort (June 4-7) and it was a great, relaxing getaway. I would highly recommend the Punta Cana Princess to anyone looking for the same!The hotel itself is pretty new, and it shows. Our room was spacious and clean. The maid stocked our minibar and left us fresh flowers every day. We had a balcony overlooking the pool area, but it was surprisingly quiet 鈥?with the sliding door shut, you would never know there were people out there!The food was as we expected, but neither of us are picky eaters. We ate at the buffet for breakfast and lunch, the seafood restaurant by the beach (Mere Nostrum) and La Cava for dinner. The service at both was excellent. If you鈥檙e looking for a little more variety, I would try the buffet at the Caribe. We never ate there, but it looked like there were a lot more options.Mostly, we just sat on the beach or by the pool. No matter where you are at this resort, however, it is impeccably clean and well cared for. We did take the snorkeling trip offered by the hotel. It was definitely fun, but unspectacular. We saw lots of little fish, but that鈥檚 about it. Then again, it was only $20 US. I would recommend it if you鈥檙e looking for something cheap and fun to do, but don鈥檛 expect to see anything particularly exotic.Overall, I thought this was a fantastic vacation, especially considering how inexpensive it was. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the location was absolutely beautiful.
