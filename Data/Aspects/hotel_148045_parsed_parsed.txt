<Content>Needs leadership overhaul Overall, this is a nice property with a large number of amenities, though you do have to pay a steep tariff for most. The major issues as we see it relate to management issues. The staff was knowledgable and quite pleasant and responsive. The problem is that this resort sells itself as a step above and luxurious. We found many of the common areas to be somewhat shabby and in need of remodeling. The linens were pilled and the pillows atrocious. The casino is in desperate need of remodeling. Here is a nitpicking point, but emblematic of the issues. Cheap plastic cups for 9 dollar cocktails. C'mon, for that price a little better grade plastic at least. We felt as if the owners were squeezing every last dollar out for profit and not reinvesting in the little, but important details that make a resort a luxury resort.

<Content>Sweet Staff, Lots of Little Kids The Lowdown: This place is huge. It's a little overwhelming, actually. There are a two or three shallow swimming pools (no deep ends) and then a water park consisting of three slides and a lazy river for an additional fee. To get to the beach, you need to wait for the ferry that will take you on a 10 minute ride to a private island that is owned by the hotel. It is open from 9 to 5 and has one restaurant that serves bar food for lunch. To get to the ferry, you need to take an elevator down to a funicular ride, and hope you've timed it so that the ferry isn't JUST pulling away as you get there. All of this means that from slapping on your bikini to flopping on your towel COULD take you an hour.The good: The staff was fantastically friendly. The food was pretty good. Try the key lime pie, it's to die for, in fact, I ordered it via room service at midnight, and it arrived SO promptly. The views are AMAZING! The water park is fun, and a neat addition. There are TONS of activities to do on the premises (kayaking, snorkeling, SCUBA diving, ocean swimming, pool swimming, nightly movies, jet skis, banana boats, golf, tennis, etc.) and the front desk can hook you up with other tours nearby. The beach island has iguanas, rabbits, tiny lizards and roosters. There is also a horse tour that looked fun, although I didn't go. The hiking is great, too, so if you're with people who lay around on the beach but you really want to get up and go, you can do both without having to separate all day long. That's pretty nice. The water is clean and clear, but there is sharp coral that bruised my feet. It's fun to collect though. I also found a conch in it's shell, and that was cool (be careful; one of the locals wandered over as I was showing a group of kids how cool our new friend was and talked about how she was going to use it when I was finished for soup. I set him free when she wasn't looking, to the delight of the little kids who were sad when she talked about cooking him and when her boyfriend talked about eating him raw.) My niece saw a manatee (we are all still jealous we missed it), and our whole family was greeted by a humming bird flitting around the bush we were sitting by. The bad: Even thought the hotel wasn't crowded, service in the restaurants and on the hotel's beach island was beyond slow. In the Italian restaurant we waited over an hour before our appetizers arrived, and I watched other people leave in disgust after waiting so long. We had a bad experience with our biolumninescent tour; it was nearly a mile of kayacking and was nearly impossible for my 60 something mother in law and 9 year old nephew to keep up with, even though we were told it was appropriate for all ages. Everyone in between (my husband and I, 26, and 27 and his siblings and older nieces and nephews) were just fine, as were all the other people in our group who were in the 16-50 range. This tour was booked through the hotel for $90 per person, but if you just go to the docks where they leave from, you can book on the spot for around $45. There are several companies that offer tours of this really cool glow-in-the-dark bay, so if you are a small group, this is probably a good option. (Go out the small white gate by where you catch the ferry, past the apartments, through a kind of sketchy area that just looks abandoned but is totally fine; there are parked cars, and just walk a bit. You'll stumble across several tourists snapping into life vests getting ready to go around 6, 6:30 and later. Def. check out those bioluminescent waters. It's pretty awesome.)The worst for me was the hottubs, which we nicknamed bubble tubs because they were not hot at all. It was pretty disappointing. The water park is an extra charge, which is ridiculous considering what it is and what you're paying for everything else. It would be nice if it was free. There's plenty of room for adults to lounge pool side at the water park and there is a large shallow pool for the tiny kiddos, with a tiny kiddo waterslide, too. It would be great to get the families there and have the pools and hot tubs consisting of mostly adults. (We have a theory they kept the hot tubs so cool to be kid-friendly).The place is large which is cool, but I found this to be overwhelming and annoying, too. It was also overrun with little kids (the week between Christmas and New Years, though, means little kids everywhere.) We were a group aged 9 - 65 (ten of us), but I think we still would have preferred an older crowd.

<Content>Still a terrific resort- but affected by the economy This is my 3rd visit (over the last 12 years) to El Conquistador and while the resort is in need of a face lift, it is a great family getaway. If you are looking for a one stop destination- where you do not need to leave the resort to do anything- you鈥檒l love it. I will start with the pluses- the staff. They are sweet, attentive and seem to want to please. The golf is phenomenal- and this might be one of a few resorts in PR where there is golf onsite. The spa is good- but expensive ($147 for a 50 minute massage with mandatory added gratuity). While I always tip the therapist- it is usually commensurate with the quality of the service. I happened to have had a great massage but did not run back at the cost for a second service. To me the most fun activity is Palomino Island. They tender you over to their private island- where they have beautiful chairs with some umbrellas. Same drill as most resorts- early bird gets the worm with seating under shade. There are jet skis, banana boats, snorkeling, and kayaks. Beware- the restaurant had problems keeping up with our busy day and food was so-so. Maybe bring a sandwich from Starbucks (see below). Bring a small cooler for this that fits in a bag- they have ice machines near all rooms. Renting a little noodle was $6 and a raft $11 - bring a few blow up rings or floats for your little guys to save a few bucks there. A few cons. First the state of the maintenance of the resort is fair. Examples include facades in need of painting, the hot tub sans bubbles (no plan to fix I guess), floors needing cleaning, pools which could also be cleaner鈥?I truly think this is an economic related numbers issue- as occupancy is surely down. We laughed as the walk to the lower pool had dirt/hair balls the whole 6 days that just blew around and were never swept- well it is a big resort and must be a nightmare to maintain. If you have a teenager as I do- BEWARE as the drinking age is 18 (not 21). That blew me away and my son and my friends kids bellied up to the bar and drank. He鈥檚 19- but I wish I had foreseen this and snuffed it out before we got there. Plus they had no problems freely serving my 17 year old either. Scary stuff as a parent. Every guest gets these charge cards- I wonder if they have a way to restrict them? Worth asking- after all, kids will be kids. Food is very expensive (what else is new at a resort). Lots of walking there too - I guess an issue if infirmed or elderly. Rooms could be just a tad cleaner- but the sweet staff taking care of the rooms made up for it. Also be aware the drive from the airport is long- with traffic could be an hour or more. One other con- my husband and son are certified in scuba diving- but my 17 year old is not. My 2 sons did get a refresher in the pool- but on their dive the staff was inattentive at best. They haphazardly checked their gear- and you better bring your own buddy to dive with as you are on your own. That is a little scary. Tips- bring a bottle of rum/some beer for your room if you like a drink before dinner. They have a refrigerator that鈥檚 empty. Bring snacks for the kids- the food is quite expensive and is nice to at least defray some of that. We bought rum, wine (bring a corkscrew), beer, cokes- and had a happy hour on our beautiful balconies that saved money. I spoke to a guy who rented a car and this gave him eating/drinking/snack flexibility we did not have. We booked the garden view- and they kindly gave us a partial and full ocean view- wow. We had originally booked partial- changed to garden- that saved us  $1000 each room. I recommend the marina location - unless you are a casino person. I liked being on the bottom of the funicular. After getting off the boat- I saw some people who had to wait in line to go up the mountain. You have snorkel gear? Bring it and snorkel to the small island next to Palomino- my husband and sons did this and said was terrific. I kayaked to there too- and it was awesome. Want to know the deal on the resort? Starbucks- yes that鈥檚 right. The cheapest sandwich seems to be $10-$14 elsewhere. The worker said they are the most expensive Starbucks on the island- but the hidden secret of the resort. The breakfast parfait is maybe $3- the breakfast buffet is (ready for this) $25 plus tax and tip. Yipes. Let鈥檚 face it the food is always outrageous at nice resorts- but beware the dinners are a fortune too ($45 steak and $11 Caesar salad). What else? Well we ended up not doing the luminescence tour in the kayaks- but figured out if you walk around the corner (to the left of where you get on the boat)- is 陆 the cost as opposed to booking through the resort ($44 versus $88 or something like that). My other tip is the lower pool- kind of hidden but very relaxing versus the noisy upper pool. You know they have this water park- but our kids were maybe a little too old for it and I guess the $20 cost put them off (versus them sneaking daiquiris- go figure). I hope this information helps- I am always so indebted to tips I get from other reviews- so thanks to all of you.

<Content>beautiful resort This is the most beautiful resort we've seen. Mountain top looking over the ocean. Many pools and hot tubs over looking the ocean, boat to carry you to their own private island, water park for children and adults, golf course on grounds, and lots of choices in accomodations. It is expensive but with the economy effecting tourism expect some reduced rates. Prepare yourself for eating at other places as the food here is too high. peanut butter sandwiches $9 .

<Content>Memorable I stayed here about 6 years ago as a kid with my parent's. My dad had a conference here. I remember it being a truely wonderful place, and the private island they have was to die for. The tram ride is also a pretty unique thing. All in all, you could stay here your entire time in Puerto Rico and never leave the resort. However, I would recommend a trip into San Juan (on a tour) at least once, and the jungle tour as well.

<Content>Great Service - Would Stay Again We visited for a girl鈥檚 long weekend. Although it was a good little ride from the airport, the service we received was great. The front desk staff is awesome! They went above and beyond to help us and always did it with a smile. We asked to upgrade to a better view and they moved us with no issue. Although the staff was nice at the Red Door Spa my massage was just ok but the felicity was relaxing. Beautiful views, nice rooms and had fun at in the casino. I will stay again.

<Content>We dont' get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed at the El Conquistador for 4 nights from Nov 12 th to the 16th. The place was absolutely immaculate!!! We read all of the reviews on Trip Advisor that were negative an we were really worried about coming here.We saw no deferred maintenance, no grouchy staff, no problems with mold and wet carpet.Keeping this short, the place is fabulous. The landscaping was perfect. The food was awesome. And the room was great.We stayed at the Marina. (less kids-we were alone)The prices were a little high, but we new that coming in and who really goes to a place like this to save money?We highly recommend this place to anyone!!!

<Content>A great family vacation I have never written a review before, but I felt compelled to write one after reading what others had written about this hotel. Before our trip, I saw many negative reviews, and we did not have a negative experience at all. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were beautiful. We stayed in the marina, and had a gorgeous view of the ocean, with the Coqui water park right next door. We were there during a time when there were no conventions, and the place was not busy at all. We were often times the only people in the pool. The only negative was the food prices. We rented a car and went to a local grocery store and got bread to make sandwiches for lunch. It would have cost us a fortune if we would have had to pay to eat 3 meals a day there. The Coqui Water Park is the perfect size for little kids. My son is 7 and my daughter is 2 1/2 and they both totally loved it. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Much Improved My husband and I recently returned from a trip to Puerto Rico and the El Conquistador Resort. To preface our stay and expectations: we have previously stayed at this resort and Las Casitias both when it was a Wyndham and after it was sold. We travel often and always stay at 4-5 stars hotels. With that said our last stay previous to this one was in 2006. At that time the resort was under major construction and the rooms still needed re-modeling. During this trip we were pleasantly surprised to see that most of the construction is done and the rooms were re-modeled. To our pleasant surprise upon check in we were greeted by VIP services and upgraded to an ocean view suite in La Marina. The room was huge with its own hot tub on the patio. The beach and experience on the island was good. The new boats are faster and more comfortable then the last boats and the island seemed to be in better repair with a new dock. My only complaint about the island was that some days they did not seem to strictly enforce that guests of the hotel were the only ones able to access the island. On the weekend there appeared to be more local people and some were not friendly or mindful of their children. Some of the pools are refurbished and overall no complaints here. The restaurants were good, and as expected pricey, but its vacation and no more then NY prices so we were not upset. One restaurant and one bar are still closed for re-model and due to open in a few weeks. Overall, we felt that the service was improved in all areas since our last stay. Service in the restaurants was excellent (with the exception of the Japanese which was good but seemed rushed). Housekeeping was adequate and done daily. The funiculars were always working and bell service was very good. We had the breakfast buffet included which I would recommend. Overall, I am impressed with the improved service and upgrading that is going on. I think it is a much improved resort, with some areas still being worked on. If it continues on this path I would return.

<Content>Fun in the sun Enjoyed our stay at the El Conquestador! The hotel is secluded on the other side of the island, so expect an hour drive! It is set on top of a cliff, so the beaches are a boat ride away! The beach ride was actually a new experience for us and we did enjoy the beach one and they do have a bar! :) Our stay was during the most recent hurricane, which actually missed the island, so it was not crowded due to cancellations from the storm! The pools were warm and the weather was absolutely beautiful! Lots of hot tubs as well! The service was good, not great, but I'd hate to see it if the hotel was filled to capacity! Also, this is not an all-inclusive hotel, so remember to bring your wallet! The restaurant overlooking the pool was great for lunch and a quick dinner and the steak restaurant was fantastic, but pricey! They have two workout facilities, one in the spa and one on the cliff. Pay the $25.00 and use the spa workout facility as the one on the cliff is horrible! The golf course was beautiful and required some skill! My husband and I have stayed at a dozen resorts over the last 15 years and we would not go back to this particular resort. We truly enjoy the hospitality of Mexico or Jamaica over Puerto Rico.

<Content>Great resort!!! Average room. We were attending a business meeting Oct. 26-30. We checked in on the 26th and out on Nov. 1., 2008. I brought the entire family - wife and 3 kids; 16, 13,  8. First the great: The staff were wonderful. They are friendly, helpful, and patient. Service was not dependent on tips (though they were appreciated). The restaurants are world-class. We ate at Blossoms, the Strip House, Stingray Cafe, and other pool area cafes (warning: you will pay dearly for this quality!). The amenities are more than expected: a shuttle boat to the private island leaves every hour, the pools are varied and well-maintained, the shops are all-encompassing.Now the good: the housekeeping is good. We had a clean room every day, plenty of towels (family of 5 remember), and refills on soap,shampoo, etc. There are a number of hotel partnered activities: we went on the rainforest tour, the catarmaran snorkel trip, and the luminescent bay kayak trip. Thought the catarmaran tip was the most expensive ($100 per person) it was the most enjoyable. I recommend it to snorkelers. We also snorkeled at Palomino island but be prepared for a 100 yard trek over rocks and sea grass before you reach the reef. The cat drops you on top of a reef near Icacos Island (highlight of th trip for us). Next time I would travel to the rainforest on my own and hike, rather than with a guide (though our guide was very helpful, friendly, and educated). The trip is aimed at older folks who are not very fit or find exercise a problem. The kayak trip was nice but more of a workout than many in our group realized. The poor guide had to tow 3 boats after a short period of rowing.OK, now the bad: the room quality just doesn't fit the rest of the hotel. We stayed in 3503. The wall plaster was chipped. The room smelled strongly of mold. The decor was dated and just generally worn. The tub handle was broken. People run up and down the hall at night knocking on doors. Good views from the balcony but beware if you have small children. The railing is a little loose and also aged.My summary: I would return but would try to rent one of the newer condos at the south end of the resort rather than a hotel room. Our timing was great. We felt like we had the resort to ourselves at times this last week of October. Not crowded at all early in the week. It did get more crowded on the weekend. There were days when we had Palomino island to ourselves in the late afternoon (except for the staff). Next time I would rent a car and see more of the island but this was a great first time for Puerto Rico and introduction to this wonderful island and its people.

<Content>Indifferent staff My friend and I didn't stay at the hotel but scheduled a massage at the Golden Door Spa. We visited the property and spa prior to scheduling. When we asked the receptionist for information about their services, she complied but certainly didn't exude a warm personality. We scheduled our massage over the phone, knowing exactly what we wanted. When we arrived the day of our appointment, the same receptionist was there. She handed us our credit card slips to sign. We each noticed that the charge was for 80 minutes, not the 50 minutes we requested. The receptionist was visibly irritated and said that it's what we ordered. We were adamant that NO, we ordered 50 minutes. She said, I wrote it down, then picked up the phone and spoke to the massage therapists to say, they changed their minds. I was getting angry at this point and said, rather loudly, we did not change our minds, you must have written it down incorrectly. She never backed down. I apologized to our therapists for any inconvenience. Our massage was average at best. We later visited the Gran Melia in Rio Grande. A much better feel to the hotel and staff...everyone was VERY nice and accomodating. We visited their spa and though it's a bit pricier, well worth it. I suggest you stay clear of the El Conquistador and head over to the Gran Melia. We also felt it was a much prettier resort.

<Content>Definitely Not 5 Star We also stayed at the El Conquistador for a conference. Several people told us how nice the resort was. However upon arrival and check in we were given a room that was not up to standards. The room was very musty and dirty. The bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned well. The floors and shower were dirty. We didn't even have an on/off knob for the shower. The front desk was unable to move us until the next day. Our second room was better. However, our first night in the new room the carpet near the sliding glass doors was soaked with water a good foot and a half to 2 feet in to our room due to the rains. This made our room smell for the rest of our trip. There was no need to ask to go to a different room because most rooms experienced the same problem as ours. The exterior of the hotel is in just as rough shape. There are cracks in the exterior all around the pool, lobby, convention center, etc. The resort also has a severe mold problem. My husband and I tried to get in one of the hot tubs and noticed a significant amount of mold all around the steps. Another person we were on the trip with said she moved her pillows and found mold on the bottom of her headboard. We didn't personally experience this, however we did have a good amount of water in our room and it was obvious that this wasn't the first time it had happened.The Golden Door Spa is very nice. We had great treatments and our therapists were fantastic. However, I would warn against using the Jacuzzi. The Jacuzzis in both the men and women's areas were not cleaned regularly and had mold. The ceiling in the women's was falling in. All in all, the place just isn't being taken care of. The absolute best part of the resort is Palomino Island. The folks that work on the island are fantastic. We had the best service here, more than anywhere else on the island. Luckily, we were able to go to the island a couple of times during our stay.Needless to say, we will not be returning to the El Conquistador. This resort is in need of MAJOR renovation.

<Content>Save your money.... I read the reviews on Tripadvisor prior to coming on our trip. The reviews are really all over the board and I truly think it depends on your expectation level of a 5 star resort/vacation. We were part of a large group of realtors and spouses on a business retreat. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate as there was rain almost the entire week, with a threat of Hurricane Omar (that luckily missed the island). When you have the extra time on your hand, you tend to notice some of the imperfections (and there are many).The hotel overall is in serious need of maintenance. How they can maintain their 5 star rating is curious and almost laughable. With the current condition of the resort, this should receive 3 stars. The windows leaked throughout the resort and in the rooms. The staff had yellow pool towels rolled up at the base of every window, everywhere. Rugs were soggy... The pools are in need of refurbishing. It looks like my child did the grout work around the pool. The grounds are nice, but lacked maintenance. There is chipped paint, marks of the walls throughout the hallways, and generally feels like half of the staff did not show up to complete the level of work needed to maintain this caliber of hotel. With the anticipated storm, all but 2 of the restaurants closed (they have 21 I think) for two days. The food is expensive, so bring your wallet. Drinks too, and not just alcoholic. An Arizona Ice Tea ($1.00 a can in the States) is $5.75, a coke is $3.75 and the Fuji bottled water in the room is $7.00. We enjoyed a fabulous dinner one night at Stingrays, but it set us back $144.The rooms are a nice size with an incredible view of the ocean and pools. Our room looked like it had been recently renovated (very modern, sleek), however, the bathroom looked original (to what year, I'm not sure!). The grout was dirty and stained, and again was sloppy. There was peeling paint on the celing of our bathroom. The water was luke warm at best on some days. We were lucky enough to finally receive a wash cloth on the last 2 days of our 6 day stay. I'm not sure housekeeping spent more than a minute or so in our room cleaning it.The entrance as you come into the resort has large tiles. Obviously, the constant rain made it difficult to keep this area dry. But the tiles are dangerously slick. Someone in our group fell and injured her finger. Why anyone would think it is a good idea to put slick tile in a main entry way that is susceptible to rain, I don't know. We did not play the slot machines or even enter the casino. They did close the casinos down in anticipation of the storm. The area looked nice.The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. I did not see any presence of management throughout our stay. Overall, it seemed like the hotel was generally understaffed.I am hopeful that by sharing our experience will help you make a decision about this resort. Again, I will say, had the weather been beautiful the whole week, our group would not have noticed all of the little details, I'm sure. But this resort has been seriously neglected and hopefully the next group managing it (we learned it is in the process of being sold) will but some serious money and efforts into refurbishing the resort. The potential is certainly there, but given the prices they are currently charging, you expect 5 star quality (in the resort itself, rooms, service). Save your money and pick another resort......or come back when it's been renovated.

<Content>Great Views but Rundown My wife and I went there for a convention and were told wonderful things about this hotel by those who stayed there a few years ago. What a difference a few years make. First we were picked up by the hotel bus and he told us that we usually would have dinks on the bus (for the 1 to 1.5 hours drive from the airport) but he didn't have time to fill the cooler. We get to the hotel and our room is in the main building and has a great view until it rained that night. We woke up to a carpet that was drenched from the sliding doors almost to the bed. When we asked to switch rooms, we were told nothing was available until the next day with the view and king bed we paid for. The new room wasn't ready until the next night and it was a garden view with two doubles. We went to call the front desk and that room's phone wasn't working. The bellman called the front desk from his cell phone and they hung up on him twice before sending us to another room with and ocean view, but still two double beds. We were too tired of packing and moving rooms that night, so we accepted this room. We went to the casino and the female dealers were friendly, the male dealers were not. It was also took a long time to get a drink when playing the tables. We got back to our room to find water leaking from the ceiling into the bathroom. This was 2am so we waited unitl the next day and moved again. Four rooms in five days. In general the staff was nice but the hotel was in serious need of a cleaning. The pools were dirty and being a pool owner, I looked in the skimmers and found them clogged with debris. They did not clean the skimmers for the next two days. The maid service was horrible. They never vacuumed, we had to take wash clothes from the fitness room because they never left us any, even after asking and they were very frugal with large bath towels. There are several more things...lots of cracked plaster, missing tiles, broken elevators and tram, missing door knobs, etc...etc... but it is suffice to say we will never go there again. One of the staff told us they were purchased a couple of months ago by an investment bankers group. I don't know if the new owners are the cause or not, but this hotel needs better management and some money put into the upkeep.

<Content>It was okay.... My boyfriend and i came here for a romantic getaway for valentines day. Big Mistake. This resort is huge and you can easily get lost. The room we had was very pretty but it was so far from everything. If you wanted to hang out by the beach you would have to treck a long way to get there. In fact estimate at least 1/2hr to 45min to go to the private island. because once you get to the end of the property you take a elevator to the bottom and then you wait for a boat to take you to it. The private island is nice but deserted there were no seating options or anything and if you got hungry you had to leave the island. We tried the mexican restaurant at the hotel and it was horrible. Thank god we rented a car because we spent most of the time touring the island. Oh and there were tons of families with kids so it's not the ideal place for a romantic getaway. We did a day trip to Calebra island. The boat ride is like 4 hours long and painful. Once on the island you are on your own and it was nice but not worth the effort. We took a small plane back to the hotel because we could not bare the thought of sitting on the boat again.

<Content>Very Disappointed My husband and I were looking for a relaxing vacation for our first wedding anniversary. It was a very relaxing trip but we were very disappointed with the hotel. We did enjoy the private island but it was somewhat of a pain to travel up and down the funicular to get to the ferry since only one of the funiculars was in service. The main pool was being repaired and couldn't be used. The general maintenance of the hotel was poor. I was disappointed in our room. Again, general maintenance was poor. We also had gnats in our room that bit me all over. I wasn't that impressed with the staff either. We called down to a manger because we felt like our room was not up to par and we got no where. Mind you the hotel was pretty much empty and I sure that was due to the fact that it is off season for them but we knew there were other rooms available. Frankly, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Lovely views, but there is ends. We have traveled a bit around the world but never went to PR before. We are a family of three, two adults and one 13 year old boy. The property is lovely but very loud, there is music EVERYWHERE. It is difficult to get away from it. The casino is located in the center of the lobby and impossible to escape. The rooms had small gnats that bit us throughout the night. Additionally the hotel booked two conventions for some of the days we wwere there which stressed the seriveces beyond what they capable of. There is a funicular to the private ferry and island that was often out of service. We have stayed at several comparable properties throughout the world and were not impressed with this one. Again, the view of the water is lovely but beyond that the hotel is a lacking.

<Content>Loving and Returing to the El Conquistador in Puerto Rico My trip came to an end on August 31, 2008. I must say my daughter, sister and I were sorry to leave the El Conquistador Spa and Resort in Farjado Puerto Rico. Before I left for my trip, I read several reviews on this website and after reading them, I was rethinking if I had made the right decision for our vacation spot, but that thought was quickly put to rest.We arrived on Tuesday August 26, 2008. We took the shuttle provided by the hotel and arrived quickly at our destination. Upon arriving we were greeted by friendly and informative staff, but there was one person in particular who was extremely nice and it was truly a pleasure doing business with him, Mr. Rogelio Santos is truly a professional. We were checked in, with no problems and shown to our room, given a small tour and left to enjoy paradise. My room was an ocean view located near the marina, its also very close to the water park, if you have kids that's where you want to be.  Our first dining experience at the hotel was at Cafe Bell Vista. Once again I had read the reviews of how expensive food was and was a little apprehensive, but was I pleasantly surprised at our meal and the price and wonderful service. Everything was freshly prepared and served by our wonderful server Sally. Of course you are going to pay a little more, but that is to be expected but it wasn't outrageous and for the quality and quantity it was well worth it. We also ate at Cafe Caribe. Once again the food was delicious and freshly prepared. I thoroughly enjoyed the arroz con pollo. I also suggest the Ballyhoo, my sister had the steak with rice and beans, she couldn't stop talking about it. Drinks at the hotel are good and roughly the same price as I pay in any restaurant in New York. I chose to avoid the more expensive restaurants upstairs because their prices seemed over the top for what they were offering.We enjoyed several days at the beach and didn't venture out of the hotel because everything was there. The food at the beach was very good. I suggest the grilled chicken sandwich. ( Don't drop any food because the roosters will be right there to eat it. LOL.) The beach also offers horse back riding, which is cheaper than what the hotel offers. If you want to go on tours, they can be a little pricey. Private tours are available outside the hotel. Information for that was given by other guests who were staying there. ( I still have the number if anyone is interested.) If you have a little time on your hands don't hesitate to visit the casino. I would suggest a little more entertainment in the night club downstairs, or maybe even a beach party for the guests that would be nice. I think guests would enjoy a little diversion. LOL.My only complaints are as follows: My daughter has a sensitive stomach, so I had to keep ginger ale on stock. I paid $1.79 for a 10 oz botte. They don't provide anything larger. I spent roughly $20 on soda. I would suggest having larger sizes. The bugs will eat you alive, bring bug spray and anti-itch cream. Dining is outside in some restaurants, the bugs will get you. Since we were there around Labor Day weekend and there was a conference, I noticed that elevators and the funicular were broken during the weekend. It was quickly prepared, but I can only attribute this towards the large groups that began to arrive. It was an inconvenience, but the staff did everything to make sure the inconvenience was minimum.I went there for rest and relaxation and that is what I received. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are very modern and a pleasure to be sleep in. The cleaning staff was always there to provide whatever I needed as well as all the staff. I can't wait to go back.

<Content>Cheesy and a disappointment, not for honeymooners. My husband and I married in Puerto Rico because he is from there and so we elected to honeymoon on the island as well. The first three nights we stayed at a sister hotel to the El Con called the El San Juan Hotel in Isla Verde for the touristy, busy part of our honeymoon...loved it, and will go back. Then we spent 4 nights at the El Conquistador with the Romance Package including airport shuttle, daily breakfast for two, two 50 minute massages, and tax and tariff. good price offered for what we thought would be the luxurious and romantic part of our honeymoon...hated it, will NOT go back.First of all, everyone hit the nail on the head with expensive food costs. The cheapest meal was $45, for a cesear wrap and tuna pita, and water to drink. I agree the food was not anything to remember, not fantastic, nor worth the price. Half the restuarants were closed majority of the time, only one tram worked to get you up and down the resort which made us miss the catamaran multiple times to the beach (supposed to run every half hour but ran every hour). Biggest problem, screaming kids everywhere. The 7 luxurious pools were full of them. This hotel did not bend backwards, forwards or even shuffle a step for guests. It felt like a rip off. Large Dasani bottles of water-$10. No microwave in your room, so if you did have leftovers from your $100 dinner, you couldn't even eat it. The Dance club is only open 3 days of the week, for a place that traps you there, they sure limit your amenity options. The power kepts tripping off for seconds at a time multiple nights the week we were there. The Spa wasn't as clean as it should've been and the massage was not relaxing, very rigid and tacky. Luckily the view from our room was amazing, go for the Ocean View rooms, its breathtaking. Loved the walk in closet, to actually unpack was nice. The safe didn't work and staff never came to assist. Palomino Island, the private beach, was overcrowded with chairs everywhere, the beach and water was SO rocky and filled with coral, so painful on your feet. Plus tons of jellyfish in the water, be careful. If you are hungry, the hamburger was good, but $15. We had a 5 pack of cerveza for $30 and to rent a floatie for the water was $22 a day, and they kick you off the island at 5:30pm. But there were awesome Iquanas wandering around everywhere there.If you wanted to escape with a tour, the kayaking was $88 per person, which was by far the best activity we have ever done in Puerto Rico all the years we have visited, but the dock was a 3 minute bus ride from the hotel. Our friends stayed in San Juan and paid $60 per person for the same tour that drove them the hour drive to the same dock we were already at AND fed them. The El Yunque Rainforest tour for $55 per person was nice, very informative and worth the price. If you want to experience Puerto Rico, don't stay here, go to Isla Verde or San Juan. You will never taste Puerto Rican food at this hotel, nor experience the friendly, vibrant, artistic culture of Puerto Rico. If you are rich, have loud children and want to take them somewhere to dump them at the pool and pay $12 for macaroni and cheese they won't eat, then this is the place for you! Enjoy!

<Content>I wish I was at El Conquistador right now... We visit El Conquistador from August 18 thru 25...and we had a wonderful time. The hotel is located on a mountain overseeing the ocean. Beautiful views, well kept grounds. We were upgrated to a full ocean view at the Marina and what a view!! The room was clean, modern and with cathedral cealings. (our room was on the 4th floor ). The hotel is HUGE...so there is a lot of walking if you are not in the main building, but for us it worked out fine because we were close to the boat to the island and to the Water Park...which we visit almost every day with the kids and it was a lot of fun.A lot of people complain about the food prices. Yes the food is expensive. But if this is your concern, rent a car and visit the local restaurants. There is a very casual restaurant called La Estacion with great BBQ steak and chicken (from the main gate - make a right - about 1/4 mile). There is a more formal restaurant called Pasion por el Fogon...the best puertorican food you will ever taste (from the main gate, make a left - about 1 mile away). Also, on route 3( main road about 10 min from hotel)there are a lot of fast food restaurants, and there is a place called El Meson for a quick puertorican style sandwish. You can go to the supermarket and buy snacks and drinks. the room has a small fridge. We bought a foam cooler (for about 3 bucks) and put ice everyday for beers and water.My only complain was the selfparking. It will cost you 16.05 daily. You can come and go as you please, but you need to validate your ticket everytime you go out. There was a Pharmacist convention from Thursday to Sunday and the parking was always packed. Very hard to find a parking space at night. I have to say, I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad we stayed at El Conquistador and will go again anytime!!!

<Content>Do Not Honor Phone Reservations Prices I was already on my vacation and called to book my reservation. I talked to a very nice man that helped me out. He told me I was to get a $50.00 resort credit due to us staying for at least 3 nights, it was a summer escape offer. I did not know about this offer before calling he told me about it .  We had a great stay at the hotel!!! Upon returning home and carefully reviewing by bill I noticed I never got the $50.00 resort credit so I called today August 21 to complain. Their answer to me was the room was at best available rate...... They have no record of this offer. I gave them the name of the man I talked to. Its not the $50.00 ( I spent a fortune at the hotel), its the fact that I was told a price and the hotel is not honoring it.

<Content>Can't Imagine a Better Place! I just returned tonight from staying at the El Conquistador with my husband and my two daughters for four nights and five days. I must say that I was very apprehensive to even keep the reservations after reading many negative reviews about this hotel...but I am so glad we went! Every inch of our vacation there went smoothly! I booked the Coqui Water Park Package that included transfers back and forth to the hotel, breakfast each morning and the water park. It was truly the best thing I could have ever done. Once we arrived off the air plane, there was a person there waiting from the hotel and directed us where to go for the shuttle. The shuttle offered cold drinks, air conditioning and was very comfortable. We waited just 20 minutes and then we were on our way. It was an hour drive from the airport, but we liked that we were further away from the very tourist areas. Once we arrived, someone was there to greet us and explained where to go with check and in how our baggage would be handled. Check in was a breeze and the representative at the desk was more than friendly. We were then explained briefly what section our room was and what the best ways were to get there from certain areas. We stayed in the Las Brisas section and found it to be right in the middle of everything. It was just a short walk to the funicular and it was just a short walk to the main building. In other reviews I had read about nightmare stories of the funicular taking so long. Each time we took the funicular it was no longer than a two minute wait. Once down in the marina you could take the ferry to Palamino Island which is just a wonderful way to spend the day. The Coqui Water park is just so much fun for all ages. We were there during the week so we almost felt like we had the park to ourselves (the weekends seemed much more crowded). Back at the main building the pools were all just so nice and are open 24 hours.. The property is beautifully maintained and again, all the staff was more than accomodating.We did rent a car from Enterprise which is on site at the hotel. Because our package included the shuttle back and forth from the airport we only needed to rent for the days in between. This was also good because Enterprise allows you to park in their lot, therefore, saving you the parking cost of the hotel. Renting a car allowed us to save money on guided tours such as Old San Juan and The Rainforest. The hotel gives very good directions to both places and it is very easy to drive. Both are must sees in Puerto Rico!Going in August, we knew it would be hot, but honestly, there seems always to be a bit of a breeze going. We thought the weather was just perfect. The rooms at the hotel were very clean and modern with more than enough space. Needless to say, this hotel must have the best views in all of Puerto Rico.Now for the restaurants. Yes, they are outrageously priced. But one of our dinners was in Old San Juan and the price was just as comparable as eating at the hotel. I think the hotel has many choices. For a lighter fare and a lighter budget...try Ballyhoo's at the Marina or Cafe Bella Vista.In short...this is a resort not to be missed!

<Content>Come on EL Con you can do better We have just returned from a week at the El Conquistador. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such an incredible location before. Plenty of things to keep the whole family busy, from the beach on a private island, kayaking to a smaller pristine island, the water park and the great hotel pools. I disagree with those that felt the hotel is in disrepair. It's a family resort, the rooms were clean confortable and nicely air conditioned considering the August heat. The public areas were nicely kept and service was very kind considering there was a mix up with our rooms and agreed to accomodate in any way possible. We booked the water package plan which allowed us access to the water park all day, buffet breakfast and airport shuttle. In relation to the cost of the room per night the packages was a good deal. Sounds good right! Wrong. I will have a hard time recommending this place without emphasizing the biggest fault. There is something wrong with a place where Starbucks is a bargain. What are they thinking? Fifteen bucks for a cold hamburger? Eighteen dollars for frozen pizza? Thirty dollars for a half filled pasta dish that would have serious competition from a chain restaurant. Come on El Con it is apparent that you guys don't work on repeat business. Get them while they are here. The cost of the food is excessive but the shame of it if they want to be a first class operation, do something about the quality of the food. Gourmet prices at run of the house quality. Blossoms was only passable. Othello was a disgrace to be called Italian. The outdoor cafe and the the Bally Hoo at the marina should consider only selling drinks. Breakfast at Las Brisas was a pleasant surprise and although at $25.00 per person if not included in a package, well worth the cost considering the quality and quantity of the food. Therefore pick your poison. A really great place with poor food.

<Content>DO RISK IT WITH THIS PLACE !!! I don't even know where to begin. Let's start by telling you that this hotel freezes 150$ per night stay on your credit card at check in EVEN if you have already paid, they say it's for incedintals.Lucky for me I called ahead of time and was told by a supervisor we could do $200 for incidentals.At check in we thought everything went smoothly only to find out they froze 600$. After getting this fixed we then had another issue at checkout with money, they charged the 200$ even though we paid the $71 we owed with a different card. Now onto the the other issues. The staff at this hotel are very rude and not helpful at all. The waitress at the poolside restaurant was by far the worst waitress I have ever had and I only tipped her $1 on a $70 lunch for 4. Also they will not allow you to bring a cooler to the private island so we were forced to pay $16 for soda for 4 people and the cups were only about 5oz. We then had the breakfast buffet at the Las Brisas Cafe which for 2 adults and 2 kids was $80.Also everything in this hotel was breaking down constantly. The elevators,the Funicular ( rail car that takes you up and down the cliff side from the rooms to the main lobby area), the ticket machine for self parking area,the ferry that takes you to their private island, and 2 of the mornings we were there the emergency alarms went off at 7am (they were false alarms). The hotel has 2 catamarans that are supposed to take guests to the island but only one was up and running and one of the days we stood in line for 2 hours while they did repairs. There are also 2 funiculars and only one was working so there were EXTREMELY long lines waiting out in the heat to get down to the rooms. They were making no attempts to fix either the broken catamaran or funicular. This hotel is nice to look at and the rooms are nice and clean but all the other problems do not make it worth your time or money.

<Content>Bring Your Own Food! I attended a conference at this resort at the end of July. My husband and daughter came with me. The first part of the week was work for me and fun for them. We all vacationed at the end of the week.We took the hotel's airport shutter rather than renting a car as we had read horror stories about renting cars and driving in Puerto Rico. It was an hour drive to the resort, and I was glad someone else was doing it. The shuttle was expensive ($66 per person round trip), but a cab would have been more (about $120 one way).My biggest problem with this resort was the cost of food. Because the resort is far from everything, you are at the mercy of the hotel restaurants which are extremely expensive. The breakfast buffet on a weekday for three was $90 after the tip! It was good but not that good. The Italian restaurant and the Steak place had excellent food but again a very high price tag. Steaks for three were $235. We were unable to eat in the evening, even at their most reasonable restaurant, for less than $60 for the three of us. The lunch menus weren't much better, and many restaurants were not open for lunch. Almost all of the lunch restaurants were outdoors if you don't like sitting in the sun. They did have umbrellas at most of the tables. We took several tours offered by the hotel which we enjoyed very much. However, one of them, a kayak to the bioluminescent lagoon cost twice as much through the hotel (approximately $90 per person) than if you had just walked outside the hotel and purchased the tour directly ($45). It was essentially a very short $45 van ride per person for the privilege of purchasing it through the resort. We thought the rain forest and Old San Juan tours were reasonably priced for what you got. Just the transportation back to San Juan covered the tour cost on that one since cabs are outrageous and driving in Puerto Rico (e.g. rental car) is risking your life.The resort personnel were not very responsive to issues when they arose. The wireless Internet did not work properly from my room and cost $15 per day. I found out later in the week that I could just walk down to the lobby with my laptop and get faster service free. I called four times to get this fixed early in the week and never received a single call back.I use a medical machine to sleep at night so I need a power outlet near the head of the bed. There were none available so I called for a power strip several times but never received a call back. We ended up unplugging the light at the bedside each night.The security lock on our door was broken, and calls regarding this were never returned. The room was nice, and the bathroom very spacious. However, it had an odd design with the closet in the bathroom so getting three people showered and dressed in the morning was interesting to say the least.Our room had a nice balcony overlooking the bay. We spent a fair amount of time reading there as it rained the last three days of our visit. The last day it rained so hard that they cancelled the boat to the private island so I never got there. My husband and daughter went there a couple of times and liked it. They did say that you must wear shoes to walk into the water though due to the sharp coral. They don't crunch the shells every day so my daughter was able to bring some back which she liked. It does make the beach difficult to walk on with barefeet though if that is your thing.My husband and daughter enjoyed horseback riding on the island. We didn't find any bicycle rentals though which was suprising. We tried walking to the a nearby business area one day; but, it was a lot farther than we expected with little to offer anyway. There are a couple of restaurants a few blocks outside the gate bayside; but, they both looked pretty run down. We didn't try them. There is supposed to be an excellent restaurant about a half mile from the hotel gate which is almost as far from the actual hotel. it is HOT in Puerto Rico so we didn't want to walk all that way. We were told the cab fare would be $25 each way so we elected not to go. There were several nice pools, but they were often very busy. This is a hotel that really caters to families with young children so the pools tend to be noisy. There were multiple hot whirlpools, and they were HOT. Again, very often, they were filled with children. The regular pools were warm and clean and had poolside bars for drinks and food. I travel a great deal, and I felt the hotel looked rundown overall. I would not return or recommend it, based on my experience. it was not a terrible place, but I think It's too expensive for what it offers.

<Content>Cant wait to go back I celebrated my 40th bday with my family at El Conquistador and loved it. The resort is absolutely beautiful and the rooms are updated and well maintained. We enjoyed the private island and water park soooo much.would like to thank Semi Rivera for his exceptional service, He surprised me and brought a birthday cake to our room on our last night. He was always helpful and went out of his way for us. Another great employee was Edwing the tour guide for the rainforest, he was very friendly and informative. My kids loved the tour.Only negative was some of the restaurants were over priced, and the drinks too! Otherwise the resort was perfect.

<Content>Conquistador OVER Rated. I have been to this beautiful resort when it was Wyndham. Now LXR manages the places and it has gone DOWNHILL!! The place has gone through a room renovation so let me get out the good side of the review.The Rooms are clean, new, nice flat screen (NO HD), plenty of hot water, and the Ocean View is spectacular!!the beach is also very nice. Typical white sand and very nice island.The bad (REALLY BAD):The place is TIRED. Old, needs paint jobs, rennovation and frankly looks very poor. For what used to be a world class location, the place is far from this. I cant speak for Las Casitas ($500/night), but the Hotel experience was bad. Some details.- the pool was disgusting with mold, and it desperatly needs a power wash. - Breakfast. The Las Brisas buffet is not maintained if you get there by 9AM it is picked over and disgusting full of flies- Had a late dinner in the Casual restaurant across from Casino and admitely we got there late like 15 minutes before closing...we were one of two families...but the cleaning crew started mopping the floors and I had to mix my meal with the nice odor of amonia. Not pleasant. To be fair, when i told the manager, he took 20% off.- Is this Disneyworld? When checking in, valet, tram to beach, buffet, and just about anywhere else...lines, lines and more lines. For example, the check in counter had 9 stations, but only 3 people at the counter and a long line- The room was not ready at check in at 1PM. Had to wait until 5PM - The lobby of a super8 may look better than this place. Its a shame as it once was spectacular.I can go on. If i have more, I will post. Needless to say, we will stay the course for the next 3 days and go home. For $350/night, I do expect more. We are moving to Ritz-Carlton in 3 days!

<Content>Could Have Been Better My husband and two children (ages 5 10) stayed at this resort in early August. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The resort is very beautiful, but that's it. For that scale of hotel, I really was expecting a lot more. Compared to other hotels of that scale in the Caribbean (Bahamas, Virgin Islands) the resort could have been better.Positives - We loved the Coqui water park. The slides were lots of fun and the infiniti pool was gorgeous. The beach was OK (too many rocks). We were able to use the waverunners without a problem (lot of the summer traffic was gone by August). Horseback riding was available. Wanted to do the rainforest, but didn't have time. Other tourists I spoke with during the trip said they enjoyed the rainforest.Negatives - The resort is isolated. It's hard to get off the property unless you rent a car or are going on an excursion. The hotel is pricey for what you get. Food was expensive for the casual restaurants. $90 for breakfast for two kids and two adults - how much do eggs, milk, bacon and waffles really cost? Carpet was dirty in our hotel room. The housekeeping was subpar. I could tell no one was really cleaning - ring around the tub for days. The toilet area had a constant urine smell I noticed on the first day (never went away). Nightlife, activities and good music were lacking. It's not that difficult to throw a simple pool party every now and then considering the resort has nice pools. The resort should get with it. I would not come back considering I have other places in the Caribbean and Mexico to vacation.

<Content>Our Stay at The El Conq My wife and I recently returned from a five night stay at the EQ with our two children ages 6 and 8. We were a little unsure of what to expect given the varying reviews we have read. We have traveled quite a bit in the Caribbean with our kids and on a whole we were very pleased with the hotel. Here are some of our impressions, comments and tips.We purchased a 鈥淐oqui water park鈥漰ackage which included transportation on their shuttle bus to and from resort. An EQ rep was there at baggage claim and old us where their stand is. We waited for our bags and walked over (2-3 minutes) to their stand/pick up location. We waited about five minutes for shuttle (I imagine it can be longer) to arrive and then another five minutes for a few more passengers to arrive. Shuttle was nice with on-board bathroom and refridgerated complimentary drinks like soda and bottled water which was a nice touch. Drive to resort took 1:10. Entrance area was very nice, set on high cliff with views of sea. Check in went smoothly and we received our requested room down at the Marina section.As many have said this hotel is large. With almost 1000 rooms it feels more like an 鈥渁ll inclusive鈥?than a hotel. Bellman escorted us down to Marina level via long walkways, an elevator and funicular. We passed the casino, Starbucks, and a number of small convenience store selling sundries, clothes, jewelry, sandwiches, sodas and bottled water.We were very pleased with our room which we found large and well decorated (contemporary). Bathroom was large and room had good storage space. If you chose to stay in marina level then perhaps request a room on fourth floor as ceilings are vaulted and hence very high.We proceeded to waterpark which was very close by and which we found very well done. It has a regular pool, lazy river with tubes, one tube slide, one body slide and one speed slide. As late July pool temp was 86 degrees plus. There were lots of people and kids, and lines for slides were a bit long (5-15 minutes). We found it fun but a bit loud (music playing) and 鈥渮oo-ey鈥? They have many chairs but are side to side to side and often taken. We ended up going only twice out of five days. We enjoyed, but only stayed about an hour each time. If you purchase tix a la carte they are only avail for full day and cost $20 adults and $15 for kids. It seemed quieter at end of day and imagine first thing when it opens.We then headed back up to Bella Vista resto which was outdoors and casual where we all enjoyed our meals. We found prices very fair for these types of resorts and were impressed to see kids menus with most offerings at $6 per meal which included fries. Our package included buffet breakfast up at Las Brisas each day. We found the enormous variety and quality of food as well as the service and views to be outstanding. This was a great way to start each day. We noted the a la carte price for adults ($25) and kids ($12) plus tax and tip to be around $90. They also have an a la carte menu which looked reasonable.One of the important things to be sure to realize if you are considering this hotel is that there is no beach at the resort. This is a detail that was fine for us for this trip but certainly is one that may not be for everyone. Yes they have their own private island which you reach by their very nice ten minute ferry ride but you must keep in mind that it can take quite some time and walking to get down to ferry from the main level, plus you are dependent on ferry times, with last one coming back at 5 PM before sunset. In short, this is not a resort where you can simply 鈥渉ead down to the beach鈥? You must also be sure not to forget anything as returning to your hotel room will likely not be an option (although there are two stores on island that sell basic beach stuff). As I said, for us this was fine and just part of the experience staying there. Beaches themselves were very nice with palm trees and palapas for much needed shade. We had no problem finding chairs even though the resort was 100% full. Minor problem was that beach on one 鈥渟ide鈥?of island had little breezes and quite a bit of seagrass in front, while beach on the 鈥渙ther side鈥?(beaches are actually connected) had lots of broken coral in the water. Having water shoes can help with this problem. We all enjoyed being in the ocean and despite these pieces of coral everywhere in water, they don鈥檛 seem to be the kind that can cut you (just 鈥渂other鈥?you). The beach area was quite crowded though with lots of people around (and probably 500 + chairs) so don鈥檛 come here expecting a quiet, secluded beach 鈥?it鈥檚 more like a beach at an all-inclusive.There is a small deserted island not far away which I actually swam to and walked to but most people rent kayaks from resort to explore. Fun.Snorkeling off the beach was half decent. I鈥檓 spoiled and used to much better but if you swim around and find the right area you鈥檒l see some stuff.We had lunches at the island鈥檚 resto and again enjoyed. Service can be slow but no different than any other Caribbean island. They have a putting green and free putters and balls which we had fun playing.They also have full washrooms.We rented car on our second day from Enterprise which has a desk in hotel. Can take some time to actually get your car as only one computer at desk but we were glad to have one as ventured out to some great spots like El Yunque rainforest and good restuarants. Hotel is only about fifteen minutes from Walgreens, Walmart, Mcd's, Pizza Hut etc...After third day and given we were using car we found that it was becoming just too long a 鈥渟chlep鈥?to be heading up and down from Marina level to car and so we switched to room up in main section on top which we found much more convenient (The 鈥渒icker鈥?had been when I realized the night before that I was pretty sure I had left my camcorder and camera in bag in truck of car and wanted to be sure so left room and set stop watch: it took me 35 minutes to head up from marina to car park and back with quite a bit of walking!)We had lunch by the beautiful main pool up top which we enjoyed as well as another good dinner down at the Ballyou bar and grill in the marina section near the water. All these restos were outdoors and on the casual side and prices were fine for resort.Check out was fine, with no problems with our bill.Only complaint and reason we give 4 stars and not 5 was that we found the resort was a bit rough around the edges. For example, my wife and two kids got stuck in an elevator for ten minutes which was hot and scary. At one point one of the two funiculars was broken which meant for a 15 minute wait for one. Up at main level we found both key elevators not working for a few hours one morning so had to find others. I elected not to bring my laptop as I had called and was told that there was a business center I could use any time - problem was that for the entire five days we were there the three computers in the center were all 鈥渙ut of order鈥? One night we took kids to game room which requires tokens but both machines were 鈥渙ut of order鈥? One night I went to get ice and both machines on our floor had no ice. You kind of get the picture.Having said that we know that we would definitely return to this resort which we felt was of very good value given the time of year. If anyone has any more questions about the El Conq you can PM me.

<Content>"Pefection!" Our family of 5 just returned from the El Con (as they call it) and it was one of, if not the best, family vacations we've ever taken. Note, however, that some of the accomodations are better than others - many rooms and casitas (condos) have been renovated - of course, make sure you're booking one that has been. We stayed at Las Casitas - the adjacent property that is all condos and much, much nicer (and quieter) than the resort hotel (El Con)....transportation back to El Con for for dinning, more pools, etc etc. is easy - there are golf carts running all the time. Palomino Island is gorgeous - the water park is fun for an end of the day fling (the last boat from PI is at 5 - water park closes at 6)....don't miss the rainforest (rent a car - it's an easy drive and self tour) as is the bio bay (go to las corabas harbor by 6 pm and you'll find several tour operators for 1/2 price of El Con - just look for the kayaks.).

<Content>Not quite what we expected If you are used to staying at high-end 4 or 5 star resorts, this is probably not the right resort for you. Although the property is somewhat nice and the views are spectacular, this resort is absolutely not worth the money. All the reviews about broken elevators and service problems are absolutely accurate. We stayed in the marina area and to get to the room, we had to ride the funculars up and down the hillside. When they were working, it wasn't an issue. However, if one of them was broken, it took forever to get to the room or up to the resort. There is no alternative way to get down to the marina so it wasn't the best experience. Although our room was renovated and well decorated, the new decor couldn't make up for the major ant problem in the room (even though we were on the top floor and didn't leave food out) and the cleanliness of the room. Minor renovations were also needed but obviously not attended to.Although there is a resort shuttle to/from the airport, they didn't bother telling us that the ride was $140. It just showed up on our bill. The service is slow at this resort (our iron broke and it took an hour to get a new one) and the room service is outrageously slow and expensive. It took an hour each time (and they were 15 minutes later than promised) and 2 breakfast egg plates w/ coffee will run you $85.On the positive side, the food and service at the restaurants is great. Although expensive, we don't mind paying for good food and service. I highly recommend Blossom's and The Stingray Cafe for dinner. For lunch, we loved the Ballyhoo bar/grill outside in the marina. The casino doesn't comp and they only have blackjack and Caribbean Stud tables, and slots, but we enjoyed the time we spent there.The highlight of our trip was our fishing excursion with Capt. Marcos of Light Tackle Paradise. We booked through the hotel (big mistake - they pocket $250 of the fee). I definitely recommend Capt. Marcos' fishing trips, though. Call him directly at 787-FISHING. His rates are very affordable and it'll be worth it!!I should probably mention that we have stayed twice at the Atlantis and that resort really sets the bar high for other resorts in the Caribbean. In comparison, the El Conquistador isn't even close. The Atlantis is expensive too, but worth it. There is so much to see and do for free that this resort doesn't offer. If it rains at the El Con, your only alternative is the casino or stay in the room. You could entertain yourself for hours at the Atlantis rain or shine.

<Content>Overpriced, terrible service, very noisy This hotel is positioned as a high-end resort. (and priced accordingly). It is NOT a luxury hotel and is a terrible value. The prices are outrageously high, and the service is really lousy. The hallway outside my room seemed as if it was designed to echo as much noise as possible. I regularly felt like there were people right in my room with me... that's how clear and loud the conversations were. The only thing this hotel has going for it is its beautiful location. My biggest complaint was the food. As a vegetarian, I expect that my choices will be limited. But I also expect that restaurant  hotel staff will at least TRY to accommodate my needs. I'm really not that picky. I was here with a convention of 500+ people. When I asked for a vegetarian meal at lunch, I was told we don't have anything for you (and then they put a plate of meat in front of me.) That's all. So I was forced to go order lunch at the outdoor bar (for another $25 for a very simple meal). At dinner, I was told that they could make me a vegetable plate. What they brought me was an enormous pile of boiled broccoli, boiled asparagus, and boiled green beans. I went hungry that night because none of the other restaurants would serve me (because our convention had booked those restaurants).I tried room service once. I was put on hold and the operator never came back. I gave up after 5+ minutes. I ordered a salad (take-out) from one of the restaurants. It was filled with bacon, so I could not eat it.

<Content>Not For Beach Lovers We stayed at this resort for four nights in June. Myself, husband  15 year old daughter.Pros: beautiful views from most areas of the resort; lots of shopping, dining, activities. Especially liked the Godiva chocolate shop - it made for a great dessert stop in the evenings. The rooms are large, recently renovated, well-equipped. Las Brisas breakfast buffet was excellent and the view fantastic! We also ate at the Italian and Japanese tepanyaki restaurants - both were very good, although expensive. Food at Iguana's on Palomino Island was just average, but it came quickly even when they were very busy. Service in general was good - friendly, helpful employees. Lastly, we thought the Cocqui waterpark area was beautiful. There is an infinity edge pool right near the ocean that we really liked. Much nicer than the pools in the main part of the resort. Even though there were lots of kids around, it seemed more peaceful. Rides were limited, but fun. I would definitely recommend it, especially for those with younger children. Cons: Of course, very expensive, but we expected that. I don't feel we got too bad a deal because we did an American Express package that included 1 free night, breakfast for two each morning  one-day Cocqui waterpark passes for each of us. We also stopped  bought some food  beer, wine, etc, so that we wouldn't always be buying the $10 drinks. (which were very good, by the way, especially on Palomino Island.)The poor quality of the pools  beach areas were my main objection. Be aware that the main pool areas are very shallow (like 3-4 feet), so not very good for adults to swim in. The water was also very warm  a bit cloudy. Having a pool at home - I know what it means when the water gets cloudy - something's growing in there that you don't want! Also, there were areas where the columns  tile around the pool areas were crumbling. Bit surprising considering how nicely maintained the rooms were. There were two hot tubs - but one wasn't heated at all. Oh - and if you have any physical disabilities - DO NOT stay here - for some reason, they can't seem to keep the elevators in working order. Biggest negative was Palomino Island - it's fine if you just want to sit in the chair  enjoy the scenery. However, almost no swimmable areas, lots of rock  seagrass as others have said. I've been to lots of other Caribbean resorts that dredge out swimming areas - for what this resort charges - they could afford to do that. We are also into snorkeling  found that to be poor. We also wanted to rent waverunners 鈥?but the rental stand was never staffed. And you can鈥檛 walk around the island coastline very far, either. It鈥檚 mostly rocky along the shore except for the one beach area. The resort has really only developed a small area of the island, the rest is undeveloped scrub brush. Last negative - it is rather isolated - this didn't bother us for the first three days -there's enough to do for that long, but by the 4th day my daughter  I were ready to go somewhere a little more lively. The only evening entertainment is dining  the casino.To sum up 鈥?if you鈥檙e looking for an upscale Caribbean resort similar to what you would find on other islands 鈥?like Bahamas or Virgin Islands 鈥?this won鈥檛 compare. We went because we wanted to hike the rain forest  swim in the Biobay (both excellent, by the way!). But if you鈥檙e looking for a beach vacation, this isn鈥檛 it.

<Content>Nice place, OUTRAGEOUS prices. I would NOT recommend this hotel for the average middle class traveler or for the elderly. While I am not cheap by any means, this hotel went far beyond my budget. A lot of walking is required and climbing stairs to get to various places in the hotel. There is even a tram to take you to different areas.HOTEL:Upon arrival we paid for an ocean view room with 2 queen beds. (For 4 people). Theygave us a shoe box sized room with a garden view. They offered us an ocean view with one full and an air mattress. That was unacceptable! They finally upgraded us to La Casitas, off the main hotel up on a hill where we had to be driven there, in a golf cart or a mini van if we got lucky, because it is too far from the main hotel (the driver expected a tip every time). Although the room was large and the view was beautiful they only offer 2 full size beds, which was a problem for us since we were four. We were also put on the second floor with a long flight of stairs to climb. There were also multiple long flights of stairs down to the pool, which was a huge problem because I was with my parents who are in their late 60s and my mother has health issues, they were not fit enough for the climbing and long walk. To get to the main hotel we had to call the hotel transportation and wait outside to be picked up which took anywhere from 10-15 minutes, just to get to a restaurant to eat. The second day we demanded the ocean view room we originally paid for, we argued on the phone 3 times and they made us wait 2 hours while they discussed whether they would move us. We threatened to leave and they finally moved us to the ocean view room with 2 queen beds on the first floor in the main hotel. To go down to the marina in order to get to the water park, ferry to Palomino Island (the beach) or the shops and bar  grill, we had to take an elevator down, walk across the entire hotel, and then take a tram down. The tram usually had a long wait because so many people needed to get on it. PLEASE NOTE: there is NO BEACH AT THE HOTEL. You need to take the ferry to what they call their private beach, which is their ONLY beach. The caf茅 at the beach is also extremely overpriced and they give you barely enough food to hold you for an hour.FOOD:I know resorts usually have expensive food, but the prices were just not a little expensive, they were OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. There is no choice but to eat within the resort and ALL the restaurants are overpriced. There were no reasonable prices or even just a little expensive places to eat.It doesn't make sense to rent a car to try to find food cheaper off the resort because parking at the resort is $15/day. Besides the cost of renting a car, and there really are no decent places to eat outside the resort.Be prepared to spend between $15 - 22 for a hamburger and fries.Breakfast, lunch and dinner averaged over $100/meal for four people.Also be prepared to WAIT 30-40 minutes for your food everywhere. La Caribe gave me and my mother our breakfast after 30 minutes and gave my father his 20 minutes later, with no apologies.The drinks were incredibly watered down. I ordered a few alcoholic drinks that had almost no alcohol in them. The tropical drinks go from $12 - 15 a drink. And don't expect fancy tropical drinks. They are in regular plastic cups or hurricane glasses.The sandwich shop you can get a sandwich from 9pm to 1am at $10 and up. But be prepared to wait on a huge line then wait another 20 minutes for them to make the sandwich, and they expect a gratuity even though it's considered take out.SERVICE:Besides not getting the right room when we arrived, then giving us the run around the next day to get the right room and waiting hours, the first day at La Casitas I needed a hair dryer. There was none in the room. I called the front desk at 8 in the morning; I didn't receive the dryer until 9am. The hotel elevators did not work. There were two and one was broken for the entire week.The plumbing is awful! The water pressure is way too low in the showers and the water is always luke warm.The room at the main hotel had no coffee maker...forcing us to buy the overpriced coffee at Starbucks in the lobby, or go to Daniels Cookies, another coffee shop where they expect a gratuity for making your coffee.On the way home we called for a bell hop to take our luggage out front and were told there was a 30 minute wait. We could not wait because we had to get on the bus to the airport in 20 minutes.There is a small internet room with 4 computers with free internet. 3 were constantly not working and one was always being used.The staff is not very willing to help with anything and half of them were very rude!KIDS/WATER PARKIf you have kids there is a water park that is $20 /person for 3 slides. That's about all that encompasses the water park. Long lines to use the slides. We went here because I have a 15 year old son.If you don't like kids don't come here! It's crawling with small kids running around, screaming and crying constantly.. AND they are up ALL night long!!!There is NO QUIET place in the hotel!NIGHTLIFEThere pretty much is none. There is a small night club with not much going on, and usually empty at night.CASINOForget about getting any complimentary free drinks and sandwiches. There are NO waiters to be seen offering anything. But there is a bar in there to buy drinks. And the machines don't pay out at all!POOLS/ BEACHThe pools are nice but loaded with kids! Get there early! The beaches are beautiful but again, get there early to get an umbrella or you'll have to rent one for the day. Any activities at the beach again, are very expensive.SIGHTSEEINGDon't expect to do any sight seeing after exhausting all your funds for food and activities at this hotel. Just to go to Old San Juan for shopping, its $50 per person.We did no sight seeing.SHOPSI know its to be expected, but I have to mention, yes.. everything in the shops are triple the amount of what you would pay at home.IN CONCLUSIONFor such an expensive place it is NOT WORTH it. Be prepared to spend a fortune on food, wait in long lines for virtually everything, and get aggravated by the less the helpful staff! If you are elderly or handicapped, or even have health issues, don't go here. If you don't like kids, don't come here. If you don't have tons of money to waste, don't come here! You don't get any breaks here.

<Content>Loved it We had a a great stay!! After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried. We booked the Coqui water park package. It was a great deal. Sure the park is small, but wonderful for people with smaller kids (ours are 6 and 9). Both of my kids could go down the slides by themselves (at its deepest it was 3' 6). We loved the breakfast. The longest we waited for a table was about 15 minutes. The line for the omelets was long about 15 to 20 minutes. We arrived to the hotel at about 7:30 am. We were concerned that they would make us wait until 4:00 to check in. They actually checked us in when we arrived and upgraded us to the Marina (at no charge). Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. We were a little disappointed in Palomino Island (the private beach). The ferry ride out was lovely, but the water was quite rocky on the bottom or covered in sea grass. My kids did not like to be in the water. It was a lovely view. We spent our days at Seven Seas beach which was about 5 minutes from the resort. We rented a car at the hotel for 5 days at the Enterprise. We opted for the insurance and it cost us a total of $289 for the week (w/o insurance it would have been $189). Because food was so expensive, it was cheaper to rent a car and eat off of the resort. We also bought sandwich meat, bread, sodas and other things and ate in the room or set a blanket out in the grass and enjoyed the beautiful view. There is a small refrigerator in the room. The funnicular was nice in the beginning, but we got tired of waiting to get on it every day. Plan on walking a lot!!! I wore a pedometer and the walk from our hotel room to the parking lot was about 1400+ steps. The people on the island are very laid back so if you expect to get quick service you will be disappointed. Whenever we had a problem it was taken care of. We would definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>Overly priced not worth it. Horrible stay! Resort is beautiful, amazing view as well. Elevators were constantly messed up, We were upgraded to the Marina but to far from the main entrance and again you need the funicular to get up to restaurants and casino and we had a bad experience with only one working for a full day. Food, not recommended when you are traveling with children......OVERPRICED!!!, be ready to spend $15 for a burger and fries for kids only since they don't have any kids menus anywhere in the resort, a bottle of water will be $4, I suggest to bring water and juice from outside if you rent a car, you will find a walmart and other places to eat just 10 min from the resort.our first night we went to one of the cheaper spot to eat and they had us wait for 2 hours for our food! Management would not do anything about it just said sorry. 2nd night same thing and again nothing was done about it. Would not come back here and would not recommend to any friends and family to stay.

<Content>Do NOT Stay here! I just returned from my stay at this hotel in Puerto Rico. I had a terrible experience. Two elevators were being worked on during my stay which made it incredibly difficult to get around the hotel, especially with a stroller (stairs were not an option). I even had to use the service elevator at one point which was dingy. The employees at the casino were rude when changing my money so I decided not to even bother losing any money there and left. Our tub was clogged for two days (and the tub showers were sunk-in and not very big). The maid service took our wash cloths and didn't replace them. There wasn't any hot water. The best it got was lukewarm. The phone in the room didn't work. You are stuck at the hotel and the prices are outrageous. Spend your money on a nice hotel elsewhere where you at least have the option of going out for reasonably price meals. Another member of my party had a problem with her credit card (she was paying cash at checkout, which they said would be fine). Then, when she had reached her limit on her card, they proceeded to lock her out of her room and not let her charge to the room for lunch (she was at the private island and had to skip that meal). They had to get the manager to even let her in her room to get cash to pay them. They then wound up telling her that they would give her a credit, but then wound up charging her instead, which pushed her over her limit so her credit card company is now charging her extra. I would not recommend this hotel at all. The price was definitely not worth all of the headaches and the inconveniences.

<Content>Lovely, but needs to be freshened up! We stayed here 2 nights and noticed a few things. While the hotel is amazing and the property could not be nicer the hotel could use some painting, some areas are really just looking not so fresh.Our room was lovely but the floor was not clean when we checked in. We called housekeeping and they came immediately. That was great.The hotel staff was wonderful, we spoke with a lovely woman in one of the shops who gave us some great advice on the local food. Also one of the concerige, was lovely too.

<Content>"high expectations, low satisfaction" I booked amex magic nights fourth night free, 2 daily breakfast for 3 days and two one day water park passes requested two queen beds but was assigned two full size beds. It was that or a king size bed and an air bed for my teenage daughter, for the price I considered it unfair. After considering to cancel the reservation they offered a transfer to Las Casitas Villas, very nice rooms and ocean views but very uncomfortable full size beds, my back still hurts. The first morning I had to stand in line for more than 25 minutes to be seated for breakfast ,it was very disorganized. They overbooked rooms and we received a poor service. At the concierge desk, for one question I was given 3 different answers and none of them where certain. I was misinformed by phone. About the water park, it is small, stairs to get to the slides stink like urine. They gave me a bottle of wine and apologized, that did not make it better. Y do not think I would go again and I can not recommend it. I hope you have a better experience.

<Content>Liked the El Conquistador we just retured from a family vacation at the El Conquistador.in Puerto Rico. While we had some initial difficulty with the room we requested, the staff more than made up for it by immediately switching us to a more appropriate room. I have to say that the hotelseemed a little run down in places, but overall it was a beautiful setting and the staff could not have been nicer and accomodating to our every need. The one thing that was tough was evening activities, especially with kids in the 12-17 years range. Outside of dinner, there is not a lot to do for them. The water parks closed early, but it was really fun. The beach was phenomena, but again, it closed early. The restaurants were very overpriced for the quality of the food, although ballyhoo's seemed to be the best deal.. All in all, we had a great time

<Content>Great Vacations I just visited this hotel with my family. We stayed at Las Casitas Village for 7 nights. The villa鈥檚 view was spectacular and was very clean. We called guest service a couple of times and were quickly assisted. We never had any problems with towels or linen, they were very attentive with our needs. Lilliam in las Casitas Reception was always very useful, as well as all bell staff and the waiters from Infinity pool. We went to Coqui Waterpark but it was raining so much, we could enjoy it very much. Also, went to Palomino which is beautiful, yet the drinks at the beach are watery (not good at all). But overall, it was a nice vacation, I hope to come next year as well.

<Content>Great vacation We recently returned from a wonderful tip to the El Conquistador. Our room, view, private island -- all were wonderful. We had stayed here when it was a Wyndham 4 years ago and it appears that the new owners have done some renovations. The only part I didn't like was that our bathroom (which was huge) had a sliding, non-locking door which is not good if you have little kids. We opted for the Water Park package, which was a fabulous deal. My only complaint was the prices of the food. You're pretty much stuck on the resort unless you have a rental car and the owners definitely gouge the food prices. Otherwise, we had a wonderful 5 day stay and would definitely return.

<Content>The Ideal Caribbean Vacation I stayed at this hotel from June 29-July 3, 2008. I had stayed at this hotel previously, when it was a Wyndham resort, and I had liked it. I read some of the negative reviews after I had booked, and I was a little apprehensive. But it turns out that now the hotel is even better.My family and I had our room upgraded from garden view to partial ocean view, and it was lovely. The room was totally renovated, and it is big and comfortable. The bathroom was also quite big, and had a spacious closet. The room also comes equipped with a mini fridge, and a flat-screen TV. The hotel has several pools, and a water park (entrance fee is charged). The water park is small, but provides hours of fun if you have children. A ferry takes you to the hotel's private island if you want to go to the beach. The water there is crystal clear, and there are no words to properly express how beautiful it is. It's one of those things that you have to experience for yourself. But if you've watched movies and commercials of people laying back in their beach chairs and just taking a break from it all, you'll get an idea of how wonderful it is.You are able to rent equipment at the beach, if you are interested in water sports. Otherwise, just sit back and relax. There is a restaurant right there, but like the other restaurants in the actual hotel building, it is quite expensive. Actually, all the hotel restaurants are over-priced. If you're able to, rent a car and go eat outside the hotel. There are excellent restaurants nearby, with much better prices. A stop at Wal-Mart's on the way won't hurt either, and you can stock up on drinks and snacks. But bear in mind that the hotel charges $15 per day for parking (if you're a guest).On our first day, the bathroom door got locked from the inside. Turns out the lock was broken, but I called housekeeping, and it was immediately fixed. Service was wonderful, and all employees were friendly. El Conquistador is a beautiful hotel/resort, provides plenty of activities for guests of all ages, and you will experience one of the best vacations ever.

<Content>Magic in Puerto Rico We've been to this hotel at least 4 times over the past decade. The first few times, we went as a couple. I will never forget escaping a freezing cold NYC, arriving late at night and getting out of the long car ride to warm Caribbean air and the sound of a million Coquis. It was Magic.Many things have stayed the same over the years. The food is still banal and high priced. It is also distinctly not very Puerto Rican - I don't mind so much because I don't really like PR cuisine (No flaming please! I lived in Viejo San Juan for 6 months and tried hard to keep an open mind. Just don't like it!) Some things have improved: the boats to Palamino are bigger, more steady and faster; the health club is bigger and better. The biggest change for us was the addition of our son during this last trip. He was 2 1/2 at the time and the waterpark had just opened. Watching his eyes light up as we tried to track down Coquis, floating down the Lazy River, dipping our toes in the ocean, spashing around in the pools, trying his hand at mini mini golf (they have really small clubs at the towel counter on Palamino!) -- it was Magic all over again!For this trip, there was one annoying thing: we had gone out of our way to arrange through the concierge for a driver to pick us up at a residence in Condado and transport us WITH A CARSEAT to Fajardo. We spoke at least 3 times to specifically make sure that the CARSEAT would be the right size, etc. Well, at the appointed hour, the driver showed up in an enormous vehicle - the kind that shuttles you to a car rental office from the airport! - with no carseat whatsoever. In fact, not even so much as a seatbelt. All for much more than the price of El Con's normal airport shuttle.On the plus side, we stayed at the Casitas. Like it there, as it offers more space for families, plus extra access to a few small pools.

<Content>Magnificant Property. Mediocre Experience The oft discussed renovations are complete. The property is gorgeous. Genuinely breathtaking especially if you're a weary traveler and walk up to the outdoor balcony overlooking the main pool. It beckons for a swim. Rooms were good, too. Staff always enthusiastic  helpful.My dissatisfaction lies in the price gouging for below average food. Expect to pay $25/plate for the breakfast buffet and $90-$100 plus tip for lunch for four. All for lukewarm food that tasted like it was the last plate off the heat lamps down at the room service kitchen.Same economics underlie all purchases at El Con. $20 bottle of suntan lotion. $40 t-shirts.In short, if someone else is paying the tab, i.e. a company expense report, this is a fantastic facility. But if you're a private traveler, be ready for that feeling you get when you're a captive at Disney World and you have no options but to pay inflated prices for food and drinks.

<Content>Great views from every location on the property We have traveled a lot in the most recent years, and this resort ranks up there with some of our stays in Hawaii.Unlike most resorts that are 鈥榝lat鈥? this resort is built on and in a mountain. This gives you great views from all over. The pools over look the ocean, breakfast overlooks the ocean, the hot tub, etc.We took a number of pictures from above and below that look like postcards with it鈥檚 color. Blue Ocean, bright red flowers, etc, just gorgeous views.It is on the expensive side, but we selected the breakfast and water park package. It is well worth the price!!If you decide to go to the private island, be sure to wear something on your feet. It has too many rocks and it makes it nearly impossible to walk out. This was one of only a couple 鈥榙raw backs鈥?I saw.On the weekends it gets rather busy. We enjoyed the resort much more Monday-Friday. On the weekends the pools are too crowded.We will go back again!!

<Content>Wonderful experience! I recently stated at El Conquistador for 5 days 4 nights in June, 2008. The views were breath taking, the service was great and the rooms were a good size and very clean. Since my room was on the ground level we were compensated with an ocean view that included a balcony. Tthe property is very extensive and does require lots of walking, living in NYC, walking is nothing new to me but to those who drive it might take a while to adjust. To get to Palamino Island, every morning after our $50 buffet brunch for two at Las Brisas, we would trek the walk to the tram to take the ferry that would take us to the island. In hindsight this probably took about 45 min but my boyfriend and I were on vacation - what's the rush? The island has plenty of activities and seating to lay back and relax. Spending $15 on water daily became ridiculous so after a couple of days we rented a car and headed to the local supermarket about 25 minutes away to get water and snacks. Dansani water is 3 bucks a pop on the resort. If you decide to take the bioluminescent bay tour don't pay the hotel's fee of $90. Walk down to the marina around 5:30 pm, pass the parking lot into the local Park (if you can call it a park). The kayaking tour guides line up and for $40 will give you a 3 hour tour. So by walking 15 minutes I saved myself 50 bucks! I loved the hotel and the prices are comparable to NYC 鈥?my only wish to make this vacation even better is an all Inclusive option 鈥?which the hotel does not provide. Other that I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly!

<Content>Beautiful place The hotel is just beautiful, the entire complex is huge and includes a water park and a funicular to go from one part of the hotel to the other. I stayed at Las Olas Wing and La Marina Village in two different occasions, if you are looking for having some quite and romantic time I'll recommend these wings of the hotel. The pools nearby the La vista Wing and Las Brisas Wing tend to get pretty crowded. The beach at Palominos is beautiful, with crystal clear water and has a few good spots for snorkling. However, if you want to get a feeling of the island and its culture, this place is not suitable. It has all the amenities of the typical american 4-5 stars hotel and does not reflect the Puerto Rican culture. Also, be ready to spend big bucks, the prices for food, etc. are outrageous.

<Content>Great Place! Just got back from Puerto Rico and the hotel. We had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. The grounds are fabulous. The view from the top level of the hotel looking east out onto the Caribbean Sea is breath taking. On a clear day you can actually see St. Thomas along with the other Puerto Rican Virgin Islands of Viegus, Culebra, and the hotels own Palomino Island. From the western side of the resort you can enjoy the view of the beautiful golf course, and the majestic El Yunque Mountain and the other Caribbean National Rain forest mountain ranges. At first we were disappointed. We were to stay in a partial ocean view room, but we were upgraded to an ocean view room in the Marina section, because of a convention that took all of the double queen beds. The room was clean and neat. The Bellhop Juan was very pleasant and informative. We are from Orlando and have stayed at several Disney resorts. In cleanliness and upkeep of the rooms and hallways and certain minor repairs needed El Conquistador does not compete with Disney. When it comes to layout of the resort and the cliff side setting it beats Disney hands down. Please be sure that you rent a car, unless of course you are loaded. The restaurants are all expensive, but we knew that ahead of time. The four of us had breakfast in Las Brisas Restaurant one morning. Bill including tip was $90.00. We basically ate outside of the hotel. Plenty of Creole and American fast food restaurants. Palomino Island was awesome, beautiful waters and beaches. We plan to stay there again.

<Content>Best Vacation if you're willing to spend a lot! This place was a paradise! I went with 4 other friends for 5 days. The excellent things about this place is that it has its own clean, beautiful private island with snorkeling, kayaking and gorgeus jacuzzis. The views at day and nighttime were unforgettable! this resort even had its own casino! I would recommend this place for couples, families and friends. the only negative is that everything is very expensive so it would only be fun if you're ready to spend a lot of money.

<Content>Great Getaway! We loved this hotel. Really nice pools and jacuzzis. Staff were really friendly. The property is a very isolated large land and gives you a chance to get away and relax. The hotel has a water park for kids and gives the adults a chance to hang out by the pool without kids screaming and yelling. The beach accessability is not great because you have to take a fairy to get to the private island Palmolino, but once you do it is prestine. The water level is really shallow and gives you a chance to relax without worrying about the waves crashing on you. The food was extremely pricy and we didn't know if we were in Puerto Rican hills or Beverly Hills. For next time, I will definitely choose an all inclusive hotel in Dominican Republic (next door) over this.

<Content>Beautiful but overpriced My boyfriend and I stayed here for four nights in May based upon a recommendation of a friend. I read the reviews about the hotel being overpriced but since I was able to find a deal on their website through AMEX (buy 3 nights, get the fourth free) we decided to go. Overall, my impression is mixed. On the positive side, we had a BEAUTIFUL room. It was an ocean view, in the new wing in the main building. The hotel itself was beautiful, we enjoyed the pools and the food was good (even though it was ridiculously overpriced). Also, if you come here to play golf, the courses looked amazing. Additionally, I think that if we had kids with us, this would also be a nice self-contained, fun and safe place to stay for a family. The bad things are the parking ($15 day for self-park inconveniently located 10 minutes away from the hotel), the 14% resort fee to allegedly pay for the catamaran that takes you to Palomino Island. Also, the area around the resort is not great so you are pretty isolated here and should just plan to enjoy your evenings in the resort and pay high prices for dinner. I think that we enjoyed our stay because we had already stayed in San Juan and Culebra during our trip so we didn't feel like we were missing out on other areas of the island. I wouldn't be happy had we just stayed here and nowhere else in Puerto Rico because there was nothing Puerto Rican about this place. The hotel is close to the Yunque Rainforest which we visited with our rental car (we heard that the resort overcharges for their tours so if you want to do this, get your own car and drive there yourself). In fact, the hotel also overcharges for their airport shuttle so you may as well get a rental car at the airport so you have the ability to go sightseeing or buy groceries! The rental car may cost you the same as their airport shuttle! We also were able to take the bio-bay tour one night at Vieques Island with East Island Excursions and that was fantastic (book this directly with East Island and not through the hotel)!

<Content>Camera was stolen and was over charged on my check out bill!!! Me and my husband and 2 kids ages 2 and 4 actually loved the grounds of the hotel. This is the only positive thing I;m gonna say about this place.As soon as we got our rooms we went to the pool and after that returning to our room our camera was stolen from our room. The staff and security weren't the brightest people on earth and they weren't the nicest. They did get the local police to investigate. Which was a joke. Nothing was done! To top it all off when we checked out to leave they charged my credit card and extra 1300 in amenities when I paid in full upon leaving. We will never return here!!!! We will continue to go to El San Juan Hotel and Casino in Isla Verde!!!

<Content>Great time at El Con! Just returned from a long weekend at the El Con, and I cannot wait to go back. The resort is gorgeous, from the ocean views to the vast lobby to the chic, modern rooms. My family received excellent service throughout the resort, and most notably from Ariana at Bella Vista restaurant. We dined there our first night, and when we returned several days later she went out of her way to serve us, remembering our drink orders and our family name! That level of personal service is difficult to find, and it was much appreciated. Thanks, Ariana!Palomino Island was gorgeous, and not overly crowded even though it was a holiday weekend. I was pleased to find ample chairs in shady spots for those of us who can't handle a full measure of the Puerto Rican sun. All in all, it was a fantastic vacation for my whole family, and I look forward to visiting again in the future!

<Content>Pack Some Sandwhiches Just returned from a 3-night stay at the El Conquistador for a professional meeting. Heard nothing but rave reviews about this hotel from others, so I was looking forward to the trip. My wife joined me, and we were expecting a flawless and romantic weekend.Bottom line: This is like staying at Disney without seeing a mouse. A major disappointment. The rooms, although well-decorated, and apparently recently remodeled, are still dingy, poorly lit and in some disrepair. Not even close to what you would expect from a high-end resort state-side. Bathrooms are passable, but having your clothes closet in there doesn鈥檛 really make me happy.Kids are everywhere, likely due to the addition of the new water park, so do not believe this is a quiet and subdued destination. The water park, although brand new, is quite small, and for the amount you are paying for the room, you shouldn鈥檛 have to pay extra for this attraction. Like others had mentioned, forget about staying down by the Marina, unless you enjoy being at least 20 minutes from being able to purchase food you have to choke down to swallow. The restaurants are way overpriced, and good luck finding something that approaches palatable. There is a Starbucks on property, but even their coffee tasted funny to me. The resort is immaculately landscaped, and in a beautiful setting, but the hotel has been piecemealed with additions that don鈥檛 blend with the overall setting. There are ridiculously out of place components like polished silver and glass elevators, and an ugly escalator rising from the Satillo tiles.Up-charges are everywhere. The casino is mediocre. The Golden Door Spa is nice, but expensive. Generally, I found the staff very friendly and accommodating. However, I would never go back, and can check this one of my 鈥渂een there, done-that鈥?list.Bring a good book and some protein bars.

<Content>Not the best option... My fiance and I stayed 4 nights at El Con, along with two of my siblings. The decor was too cute. My room came with a balcony and a great view. The bathrooms and walk-in closets were perfect. However, my brother's room had a horrid view (what a pale concrete wall), and they would not improve the room, despite the fact that the hotel was NOT bustling at full-occupancy. This was my brother's fifth time in PR, and undoubtedly, his only stay at El Con. The pools were beautiful.Everything seemed to be an inconvenience. The resort was incredibly far from the airport and night life in San Juan or Loiza. You'll be driving/riding for at least 1 hr. The caves (which are a big tourist attraction in PR) is 1.5 - 2 hrs away. Breakfast buffet was $25 per person plus tax with NO traditional PR fare. To get to the beach, you had to take the elevator to the lower level, walk across the back of the hotel, take the tram down the mountain, show your hotel ID to get an ID bracelet in order to wait on the dock for the ferry to take you on a 15 minute ride to Palomino Island -- and the ferry only runs on the hour. The latest you can stay on the beach/Palomino Island is 5:30p. What kind of nonsense is that?! It's still nice outside at 5p. The wind is finally blowing off the water. What a waste. The alcoholic drinks on the island were nasty, expensive ($8 for a 12 oz. frozen pina colada from a machine) and WEAK (are you sure that's rum?). To add to one's inconvenience, the self-parking at $15/day was a joke, and it was a hike to get there to/from the lobby. Yes, they had a shuttle to take you to the self-parking lot, but it ran sporadically, and one of the primary drivers was rude and consistantly MIA. You could be waiting for 20 mins. Plus, you had to keep getting the cheap paper tix validated at parking services, instead of them just giving you a key card to come and go. The food at the Iguana Bar and Caribe Cafe were sub-par.Overall, after that experience, I wouldn't stay at El Con again. It was just a mediocre hotel with a hefty price tag, considering you're in PR. We passed a number of resort hotels on Route 3 to get to El Con. If I had to go back, I'm sure any of those would do.

<Content>Family Vacation We just returned from Puerto Rico on May 2,2008 after being there for 1 week with our family. We had travelled with our kids 3 and 6 years old. We had booked the reservation directly thru the hotel website and purchased the Coqui water park package including breakfast for 4 and I am glad I did. Our kids had a great time at this resort. The waterpark was perfect for them. They had a zero entry pool with a little kids slide and the pool goes as deep as 4'6 so you can actually swim a little. They had 3 larger waterslides and my 3 year old was able to go onto the slide that requires an intertube (they have tandems and singles) and my 6 year old could do one of the other slides by herself. There are additional pools up at the main hotel to use also. Everyday we went to Palomino Island to unwind a little and we all enjoyed this part of the day as well. The boat ride was something my kids thought was fun to do. The island is nice, has bathrooms, and a restaurant. I would be careful into the ocean as it is pretty rocky initially but gets better as you go further in. It remains shallow for quite a distance from shore. The Island and the Coqui waterpark only takes room charge and no cash transactions. Everywhere else they give you a choice. The rooms were nice and clean and maid service came early and did a good job. Believe the reviews about food prices. The food prices are very inflated however, if you prepare yourself then there should be no issue. The water in the room is $7 per bottle, however in the main lobby you can get a bottle for $2.25 or at Starbucks for $2.50 per bottle. Ballyhoo was the only place that we had a bad experience with dining. We ate at Stingrays and had good food and good service. There is a restaurant up by the main lobby that overlooks the pool that has the lowest priced menu that we had seen...the menu is limited but with kids a hotdog or pizza is just fine for them! As I mentioned we had purchased the package which included the daily buffet breakfast for 4, daily entry to the water park full day, and our transportation to and from the hotel. For us this worked out well. There was one small error on our hotel bill and it was easily taken care of no problems at all. There were no surprise surcharges other then the ones you had charged to your room. The package includes all the taxes and resort fees so you have a clear idea of how much your vacation will cost you. The hotel is large..but this should be no surprise to anyone if you read how big the resort is on there website. So plan on walking a little more then if you are at a smaller resort. We had an ocean view room down by the marina but closer to the water park and thought this was a great location for us. If we were to go back to Puerto Rico we would definitely stay at this resort again.

<Content>Great girls trip at Las Casitas Village at El Conquistador We had a group of 13 ladies between two casitas and we had a great experience at the resort. Everyone on staff was very helpful but there were several who stood out. Carmen, a concierge, was extremely helpful prior to our arrival and answered many questions and helped make transportation arrangements. Wilfredo, our butler, was fantastic and took care of any requests very quickly. Omar at the Ballyhoo bar was great, too. The food was really good throughout the resort. The pools were beautiful and the property was very well maintained.

<Content>It was OK, not worth the price We just returned from staying at the El Conquistador, from 4/23/08-4/28/08. There were 11 of us, celebrating my in-laws' 50th wedding anniversary. Ages ranged from 4 - 78 years old. While our stay was enjoyable, we would not stay there again. The rooms were expensive, the food prices were OUTRAGEOUS, as was the price of other items (I ran out of sunscreen, went to buy 2 small bottles, but the total was $32, so I left them there). We were prepared for the prices, but for that kind of money, the hotel and the service should be impeccable. They were not. We chose rooms in the Marina area, so we could be close to the water park and the boat to Palomino Island. The location was convenient, and the kids had a great time at the water park. However, the rooms look much more luxurious in the photographs. I was not impressed when we saw them in person. Out of our 3 rooms, 2 of the balconies were so small, that you barely had room for your feet once you sat in your chair! Travelling on the funicular to reach the main portion of the hotel did get a little old after a while, but it was made worse by the fact that one or the other cars on the funicular was not operational about 25% of the time. We also found Palomino Island to be a great disappointment. The beach area was not what we expected, and once you go in the water, the sand mostly disappears and you have very rough and sharp coral under your feet. We needed to buy water shoes, at $20 a pair. And the staff on the island mostly had the attitude that we were bothering them, from the woman selling the water shoes, to the 3 guys renting the jet skis.The restaurant staff proved to be the biggest disappointment of all. With sky-high prices, these people should be giving service to match. Not happening. From the bar  grill at the marina to Otello's Italian Restaurant, to Blossoms Teppanyaki restaurant, we had one disappointment/aggravation after another. From having to ask repeatedly for things like drinks for the kids (which sometimes never came at all) to waiting over an hour after being seated in Blossoms before the chef showed up, to the maitre d' in Otello's actualy being rude to my teenage daughter when she asked a question about a menu special he mentioned, I've had better service at McDonald's. Don't get me wrong - the trip was not all bad. The rooms were nice, the food in general was good, and we had a great time. But we have travelled all over the world, and felt that this place definitely did not meet our expectations, or its price level.

<Content>No such thing as service at this hotel... I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I have traveled to many resorts and this was by far my least favorite. We arrived to a very dirty room...something splashed all over the walls and doors in the bathroom as well as something smeared on the walls over the bed. We immediately called the front desk and to their credit, they did have it cleaned immediately. We know another couple that was here with us who switched rooms 3 times before they got one that was acceptable.The service EVERYWHERE in this hotel is SLOOOOW! Espeically the pool - we waited over an hour for pizza one day and were told not even to bother ordering a burger because it would be forever until we got it. You have to hunt down waiters to get food. There was just nothing relaxing about this. The casino bar and marina bar was slow you didn't even want to drink anymore once they got to you. The one place we received good service was at Strips a restaraunt within the hotel...there was very good food here and our waiter was excellent. I would rather not waste more time with the details, but I really would find a different hotel to stay at if you are considering. Too many people, slow service, average food and Ritz Carlton prices!!We did go over to the island to hang out and that was by far the best day - although - it takes an hour just to get over there by the time you get down the elevator, down the tram (one was broken, of course) and on the boat. Nothing seemed convenient.

<Content>This was a magnificent resort Do not listen to the bad reviews go go go Just returned from a 6 day trip to the BEAUTIFUL EL CONQUISTADOR... We traveled from April 19- 24th We stayed at the LAS OLAS SECTION OF THE RESORT in my opinion this is the best part to be in.... Centrally located to everything... need to take the funicular up to the main level but you can go down to the Marina by stairs if you choose to.. you also have a pool to your selves at the Las Olas... I feel it is more relaxing than the main level of the resort. The food is good... The better restaurants like the Strip house, Otellos and Blossoms are excellent. They are alittle pricey but I am from New York so I am used to expensive. There is alot of walking at this resort but that is okay because everywhere you go the views are absolutely breathtaking. I hope whoever wants to go to this resort does not get discouraged by the poor reviews that some people have made. We went to the waterpark 3 times while there my son Justin who is 11 loved it and SO DID I..... The beach is also something to see.. The ocean is so clean and gorgeous... I am definetly going back to the EL CONQUISTADOR IN the very near future. I Have nothing bad to say about this resort Oh I even won money at the casino... I will be posted some photos shortly..... Thank you CONQUISTADOR FOR A VACATION WE WILL REMEMBER FOR A VERY LONG TIME...DONNA FROM BROOKLYN

<Content>Good management could make this an outstanding hotel! Management needs to correct operations at this beautiful resort site. The pricing reflects an upscale luxury property, but there are annoying gratuities added to each bill.The staff seems to operate at an 80% level and is indifferent to the guests' needs. For example, we tried to have breafast each AM when they open at 7:00 AM and yet, the waiters were still setting up instead of being ready to serve immediately.Housekeeping never provided any turn down service in our room and we even had to kill our own large cockroach in the bathroom.On Sunday one of the finiculars was not working.Valet parking never cleaned our windows on the rental car.Golden Door prices were outrageous.El Conquistador has a great location, a beautiful new Water Park and many choices of dining. Management needs to train all employees how to provide service and how to deal with the guests in a friendly, yet professional way. In the end, one remembers the little things, not the huge golf course that is underutilized.

<Content>What a wonderful experience! I had a wonderful time during my stay at the El Conquistador hotel..From the moment that I walked in the door I was made to feel welcome. It was nice to be greated with a beautiful smile by the lady at the front desk. Her name is Magda Walley and she not only took care of me when I was checking in, but anything that I needed during my stay she made sure that I had it. All I would have to do was call her at the front desk, and she made sure that I was taken care of right away. This kind of service by an individual makes you want to come back every year. I also got a chance to visit the waterpark, which was very nice. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to go on vacation to Puerto Rico, and I will definitely tell them to make sure that they ask for Magda when they get there. Because I know that they will be in good hands. Look forward to coming back again real soon.Michael

<Content>Beware! I travel a lot. And I'm an easygoing person. So when I went to El Conq in Puerto Rico, I expected to have a great time. And though we found the Puerto Ricans overall to be truly lovely, genial people, we were shocked at the deceit we experienced at this resort! Definitely watch your back. Things were stolen from our room. (Use the safe!) Many things were falsely charged to our room, and the front desk did not want to hear about it. (We made good and certain that they did, and eventually got every line item removed. But it took a lot of work. Don't wait until your check out time, review your bill in advance! We did, and it still took two days to straighten out! Front-desk personnel will tell you to your face that they do not want to deal with it.) Astoundingly, every single person checking out when I was (there were three agents open) had a bill dispute! Plus, one poor man approached the check-out desk and said, and I quote, My room was broken into. Again. Expect erroneous charges, overall hostility, average rooms, very, very uninteresting location (no town anywhere near) and do not expect to see a piece of fruit during your entire stay. Greasy bland food. Expect absolute mediocrity if you choose to stay here. Or better yet, avoid this diabolical dump altogether! (P.S. - There is ZERO nightlife here! Absolutely negative nothing!!!)

<Content>Had a wonderful time We just returned from a stay at the El Conquistador Resort and Spa and I must say, what a great experience we had. The staff is prompt, courteous and always eager to help. One of our bags was held up at the airport by TSA, but when it finally arrived at the hotel the next morning, the bell hop brought it to our room within 3 minutes. We also experienced a flat tire to our rental car while driving in the city, but when we returned, the parking services staff pointed it out to us and even fixed the flat immediately. The concierge staff was always very helpful and took time to make sure our questions were answeredThe hotel itself is beautiful and very well maintained. It sits atop a craggy cliffside offering astounding views in all directions. How many other resorts can say that they take their guests to a private island? We stayed in the main building with a view that looks out over the tennis courts and the mountainside of El Yunque rain forest. Breathtaking! Outside our door each night in the garden were the sounds of the native Coqui frogs. Loved it!If you are frugal and can't enjoy the finer side of life, then this resort is probably not for you. The hotel itself and the restaurants are indeed pricey, but the food was always top-notch and delicious and the service 5-star. Couldn't ask for a better experience. I highly recommend

<Content>Not Great My wife and I spent the week before Easter at the resort. Was there on a company retreat. Weather was not great, windy, overcast and at times rainy. The resort was ok but far from great. Its actaully divided up into several different areas that are spread out across their property...really spread out. We stayed in the part of the resort down by the Marina. Rooms were fine, nothing special but clean and nicely appointed.Would suggest that you get a room on the top floor at the marina so that you get high ceilings, and one thats on the corner so that you get an extra window. Each room had a DVD player and a nice LCD tv. (Had to unplug the DVD video cable from the tv to get the tv to show channels and the remote was missing batteries when we got there.) The rooms each have a balcony which was great for sitting and having a glass of wine at the end of the day. I suggest buying a bottle/and or snacks at one of the many general stores instead of the restaraunt/bar..The rooms each have fridges that you can use to put what ever you buy.- but no snacks or drinks were in the room. (these could have been removed by my company ? )The draw back to the marina was that in order to get to the main part of the hotel you needed to take a tram up from the seaside level the top level, then walk a long hall way to an elevator to the main hotel...sound like alot ? It is. The positives are that you are down on the water and by the water park and the boat that takes you to the resort's private beach island. If you are up top, it takes a long tme to get to these attractions.In short, the resort was ok, good for a company event as it has everything a big company event needs, but its really lacking in charm, charater and the layout leaves a lot to be desired.

<Content>Great Place! To all of the people who wrote negative revies...This place is huge! If you don't like large hotels, don't stay here. People who write negative reviews on here about the size of the hotel obviously did not look at it online. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at El Con. Is it expensive? YES!!!But I don't know many hotels where the in -food dining is cheap. Word to the wise. Stop at Wal-Mart. Stock up on cereal, bottled water...and you will be fine. We stayed in La Marina. You need to take a tram there and a shuttle to the private island. If you are going to go on these things during peak times, there will be a wait. We went to the beach early. Plenty of chairs and shade. Definitely eat off site at Pasion De Fogon. This place was excellent. We would go back!!!

<Content>Beautiful Resort! There were eight of us in our party, two families of four. We travel a couple of times of year together and always go to the caribbean. This was our first trip to PR and we were a bit concerned with all the mixed reviews. We did know that it was very expensive to get to the hotel via shuttle so we decided to rent cars. It was definitely the way to go. Thrifty had the best price for a car and it was a 40 minute easy drive to the hotel. I should start by saying that I booked our trip through AMEX Platinum Business travel and were given an automatic upgrade on arrival with comp breakfast for two, normally $25 per person. The hotel grounds were very beautiful and kept very clean. We were in a recently renovated room and the view was beautiful. The bathroom was quite large with a seperate walk in closet. The room itself was beautiful, clean and well maintained. We found the staff to be very helpful and accommodating. We too were there during the Chase and Bank Of America corporate events and my husband was unable to get a tee time because of it. They certainly do cater to the needs of their corporate events over the regular guests. We were fortunate to be there the week after Easter and the resort was pretty empty or so it seemed. Our kids really loved the water park and we spent two full days there. We were able to really relax as the park was small enough that we were able to keep an eye on the kids at all times. It was safe and extremely clean. The snack bar served decent food also. The spa was beautiful and the massage was fantastic.Food Prices - I will say that there were restaurants that were slightly overpriced but we are from New Jersey/New York and we're used to paying top dollar for food anyway. You're on vacation; if you constantly worry about the price of food this resort is not the place for you. For the people whining about the prices should stay at a 2 star all inclusive resort and eat the same food everyday! There was a McD's and Church's Fried Chicken 5 minutes from the hotel for the complainers! The hibachi restaurant and Stingray restaurant were fantastic. Casino - STAY AWAY! You'll never win in this casino! Palomino Island - Very beautiful and definitely worth the trip. Short private boat ride from the resort. The sand is not powdery and soft but it was still a great time. Two decent bars/restaurants there for lunch.All in all, it was a great trip and the resort was beautiful.

<Content>el conq. worked for us. I just returned from a 4 day stay at the El Conquistador with my 14 and 11 year old kids. Overall, we had a great time and we will be back for next years spring break. The kids had a great time exploring the private island - Palomino - especially during low tide. The ferry to this private island was a short 7 minute ride and very relaxing so it was not a problem for us. Once we were there, we stayed until the last ferry returned at 5:30. I do recommend bringing you own bottled water and snacks as things are very pricey - $6.00 for a virgin Caribbean Breeze and $8 if you want it with alcohol.The only negative I will say is the food cost. This I hope will change over time as people like us write our reviews. One night we ate at Blossoms (Japanesse place) and it was $160 for 3 people and 1 glass of wine - way over board for mediocre food.When we return next year, we will plan to have dinner off property more often until the hotel gets the hint.We did have a great time and the room we had (lAs Brias wing) was clean, spacious and very comfortable.

<Content>Way overpriced, not worth it at all! The grounds and property at the El Conquistador were very impressive. I heard it was formerly some type of university. The absence of a beach concerned me, but the shuttle to the private island worked well, and we really enjoyed our time out there. In many ways I felt like the prices were a rip off. The hotel campus is quite large and remote, and so you have very limited choices when leaving the campus. Since they know you are largely a captive audience, they really stick it too you. Every meal is 5 times what it should be. I bought a hamburger and fries one day for my 4 year old and spent 32 dollars. Its price gouging at its worst. It would be one thing if the food or service was something out of the ordinary, but he food and service is actually sub par. There was a Star Bucks in the middle of the lobby, and the prices there seemed cheap! The rooms are not well insulated for sound, as it was not originally built as a hotel. We had noisy partying drinking neighbors for two nights, so we got no sleep for that time. They kept giving you the heavy sale on bottled water at 8 dollars a glass. I just felt like it was a constant attempt to extract money from us. It really ruined our vacation. The cream of the rip off was the shuttle service from the airport. Most hotels are so glad to have you , they give you free shuttle service to and from the hotel. We were charged 832 dollars for our group of 14 on the day we check out. Nice surprise. It would be one thing if they warned you or mentioned it anywhere, but no, they left he surprise for the last day. The bus that brought us there had a terrible mildew smell inside, and the video system broke down that was to give us orientation to the island, then the transmission went out, and we had to go 1 mile per hour for the last 1/4 mile. It almost did not make it up the hill to the lobby to unload us. The staff at the hotel was very mediocre. I would never come to this place again, even if it were free. It is a beautiful place with so much potential, but they are so greedy to rip you off, it just ruins the whole vacation.

<Content>Great People  The staff at the El Conquistador Resort  Golden Door Spa were extremely sincere and friendly. The trip started by getting to the hotel around 10pm so everything was winding down for the night. We hung at the bar and casino 21 on the main lobby were the staff was great. The next night we partied upstairs at Drakes were the Bar tender Hilda Concepcio made sure no patron was without a drink in hand. She did a wonderful job making sure the customers were taken care of even as busy as it was and always had a smile on her face. The following day we hung at the water park which was very relaxing and had a great family atomsphere.

<Content>You can definitely do ALOT better than the El Con! The best thing that I can say about my trip to the El Con was that I didn't have to pay for it myself.My experience with the resort started poorly and failed to improve over the 4 days that I was there. Things started with a luggage mixup in which we had inadvertently grabbed the wrong suitcase from baggage claim at the airport. We realized the problem immediately upon arrival at the hotel and contacted the Concierge desk to assist in sorting things out.They were the most hapless group of individuals I came across while at the hotel and probably at any hotel I have stayed at in the past 20 years. It took almost a day and a half to get our suitcase even though we had confirmed that the correct bag was at the airport and the hotel made countless roundtrips to and from the airport each day. After countless screw-ups, lies, and conflicting stories, we relieved the Concierge team of the task of retrieving our bag and made the trip back to the airport ourselves. We were able to get our bag within minutes.The hotel itself was clearly, at one time, an impressive resort. Now it has the feel of a place that is clearly living on past glory. The room, we were in had clearly never been renovated since it was originally built and it had a 1980's feel to it. I will say, however, that the room was large and spacious. The rest of the hotel could use a facelift too - or at least a good painting. Instead they seem to invest in attractions like a water park or new bungalows, while the main hotel continues to deteriorate. I don't get it.The food and activities were very expensive. One expects this at a resort, especially one that is as isolated as the El Con. They have a license to gouge and they use it. Expect to pay double what you would at home. If you decide to do activities, don't book through the hotel. By way of example, the hotel charged $90 for the luminescent bay kayaking trip - we took the exact same trip for $35 by walking around the corner from the hotel.Lastly, look out for after-your-stay charges to show up on your credit card. I, along with two other people in our group, had extra charges charged to our credit cards after we had checked out for fees that had been negotiated into the contract with the hotel.Long story short, for the amount the El Con charges, you can do much, much better at an alternative PR resort.

<Content>Skip this resort My husband and I are easygoing travelers and found this resort based on the recommendation of a few friends who absolutely raved about it. The resort has some good qualities, but it one of the worst value vacations we have ever experienced. It has the ambiance, food quality, and feel of a mid-range Sandals type resort, but is priced like a Ritz Carlton. We spent almost $3000 on a 4 day trip there, with a middle-road Ocean View room (actually we were given a blocked view, but that's another story). Bottom line - 4 days in Hawaii could be done for this price, or 2 weeks in a similar quality all-inclusive adult or family resort.The problems seemed to be mainly service based, rather than facility based (other than them giving us the wrong room and refusing to acknowledge it). We are very seasoned travelers and have spent time in the Carribean, Mexico, Africa, Europe, and all over small towns in the US - so we are not sheltered Yankees with bad attitudes - I promise. We maintained our patience the whole time but by the end of the trip we were ready to go home, which is not typical for a 4 day weekend in a supposed luxury resort. Waiters/waitresses were understaffed, had bad attitudes, and were not attentive. Pricing throughout the resort was ridiculous (every meal was $50 for two people, usually a salad and sandwich with soda). On top of that, there was no authentic Puerto Rican twist, not even a local type restaurant, on the resort. It could have been located anywhere. I would suggest to the resort that they space out their conventions or add a convention wing to separate convention guests from other guests. They actually closed the main pool on 2 out of the 4 days we were there for the corporate parties, which for us was pretty disheartening. There were 2 conventions while were there - Chase and B of A, back to back. This was a big spring break week, too, so it was 100% capacity. The resort should not have booked the hotel to 100% capacity, as the restaurants and staff were not able to handle it. Again, attitudes were poor, guests were grumbling, and many people's room bills had invalid charges.I would recommend spending 4 days at the Mirage or Caesar's in Las Vegas, or heading to an all inclusive mega resort in the Carribean or Mexico instead of spending your money at El Conquistador. It is a terrible value for a similar experience.

<Content>Beautiful Resort! Just back from a great stay 3/21 - 3/25 at the El Con. I used this site extensively when deciding on where to stay so I want to share my experience. I was with my husband and two boys ages 14  11. We stayed in a Las Brisas ocean view room. The room was nice, spacious, and clean. The view from the balcony was beautiful. The beach at Palomino island is very nice, and the ride over only took about 6 or 7 minutes. The pools at the main resort are nice, but cold. The new waterpark is a lot of fun, my kids really enjoyed it. The food was good. You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars at the expensive restaurants. There are other options. We ate several mornings at Cafe Caribe at 6.95 - 8.95 per person for a nice breakfast. We also ate dinner at Cafe Bella Vista by the main pool, for 4 people with drinks and desert it was about $100. There are also off site restaurants that are good. We ate at Metropol and Calizo in Fajardo and both were great. Overall this was a beautiful resort and a good place for a vacation. I would recommend having a rental car, the ride from the airport and going to some of the different sights and restaurants was less by paying for the rental and parking, than what it would have cost for other transportation.

<Content>loved stay, however, I can appreciate concerns of others I enjoyed my stay and never left the hotel even though we had a car. The good. Found my room well decorated, clean. Loved taking the ferry to the island. The place is so big, you can spend two days just walking around. Blossoms was fun with my toddler at the Tappani section (the chefs cook at your table). The afternoon guy at the concierge was informative and fun. View from my room. We ate in several establishments, the food was always fast and the staff was very good with my 2 1/2 year old son. Lots of space even though the hotel was full, it never seemed crowded. RelaxingThe bad. To get reservations on the phone was almost impossible. Later, it was almost always a problem to get the front desk on the phone. I kid you not, it took at least 15 minutes for an adult (walking quickly) to go from my room in the Los Olas section to the front desk. This was the biggest problem for me. The TV services also didn't work. Prices are in my opinion crazy. The section we stayed in which was a deluxe Ocean View needed some work. One staircase that we needed to take everytime we came and left our room, both railings were broken. Also the same area needed some cleaning and renovation.Kids On the map I had,(which they gave me at the front desk) they show a playground and someone mentioned activities for little ones. The conceirge advised me there is no longer a playground and they have no activities for kids of 2 1/2. They have a little game room. If they had activities for kids, the frontdesk never advised me of any activities.Activities No scheduled activites in the pool area or at the beach, no live music anywhere in the hotel.All this being said, I can't wait to go back. I would only go when they are doing a promotion (discount) and I would take some items to save a little money. Drinks, snacks, fruit, maybe bread and some kind of spread. $3 and up for water $6 for one serving ice tea (no free refill)

<Content>Tips for El Conquistador My family traveled to the El Conquistador during Easter week. It was our fourth visit to the resort. We have a nine year old and a seventeen year old. We booked a partial ocean view and got a great ocean view room in Las Brisas. First of all, I would recommend renting a car. Self park your car for around $10 a day. Stop at Walgreens in Fajardo and pick up breakfast items. The prices for meals are outrageous. We had breakfast in our room every morning. I would recommend lunch when you can at the little Sweet Corner Cafe near the funicular. We ate lunch there a few times for around $30 for 4 people. You will pay 60-80 at the other places. We traveled off the resort for dinner. There is a Sizzler about 10 minutes away by car in Fajardo off rt. 3. In addition, there are other fast food choices like Wendys and Mcdonalds. We ate one meal at Blossoms for $130. The food and service was average. The room itself was pretty nice. We had trouble with no hot water one morning. The pools and water park were nice. The grounds and views at the resort are outstanding. The resort was crowded since it was Easter break for families. I saw an advertisement(we stayed near the airport on the last night) for Puerto Rico residents for 129 a night. I paid 185 plus taxes. It is better to come here in the summer when it is cheaper and less crowded. I would recommend the hotel if you have never been there. However, I plan to look at another resort for my next vacation.

<Content>Overrated! We just returned from a 5-day spring break visit to the El Conquistador Hotel. After a long flight and drive to the hotel, my boyfriend, 16-year old daughter and I were looking forward to unloading our luggage and enjoying some late afternoon sun. We arrived around 1:30 PM, and we had to wait until 4:00 PM for the room to be available. In the meantime, we enjoyed a $90 lunch (sandwiches and salads) and walked the property. Our room was located on Level 2, Las Olas. The only way to reach this area is via the tram, which is very slow-moving and holds 20-30 people max. Our room was decent enough, but being stuck in the middle of the cliff was less than appealing. Getting to the marina and lower-level restaurants was easy as stairs are available. However, going up is a challenge - no stairs and only one of the two trams stops at Las Olas. Service was fairly good in the restaurants, especially the Stingray Cafe'. However, stay clear of Iguana Grill on the island - horrible, horrible service at a mere price of $105. A rental car was not in our original plan, but after reviewing the prices of trips to San Juan, the rental fee was the better option. Having a car also allowed us to eat off-site, and the restaurants in Farjardo are much better and affordably priced. Do not book excursions through the hotel - there is about a $30 markup on the Snorkel and Catamaran trip alone. We called a company in the Fajardo area and booked a trip for $60 each - 5.5 hours and it included lunch. The same trip was $98 through the hotel. By the end of the trip, we vowed never to return. The hotel is too large in size to receive personal service and the prices are not justifiable. I do not mind paying money for good food, but $18 for a tuna sandwich is a bit overboard.Tips if you stay at this hotel: (1) Get to Starbucks early or very late - the line many times went outside to the pool area; (2) a few restaurants are located near the service gate. It costs $20 each way for a cab to go about a mile (from the lobby to the entrance). Ask the bell captain to drive you there by golf cart or parking shuttle. We enjoyed La Estacion and Calizo without paying a dime in cab fare. La Estacion is very close to the service gate and Calizo is about 0.3 miles away (although no shoulder). There are also restaurants with 0.5 miles of the marina area at the bottom of the resort.; (3) rent a car - it will save you a ton of money; and (4) look off-site for excursions.

<Content>Made Great New Friends I read alot of the reviews on this site. I feel that the conventions do take away from the experience. We had the opportunity to enjoy the resort before UBS came in. After that large crowds of families came to the resort. It does take away from the resort. Be aware the ugly American has arrived. (and I'm from New Jersey, LOL.)Bottom line, we made many new friends. Jessica Colon, the concierge supervisor is the kindest, most caring person we have run across in many hotels. Well before our trip we lost two family members. Jessica, was so kind and attentive that I decided to take a private car to the resort instead of the bus provided. Just to pick up flowers for her. Jessica set us up with Millinium Limos. Pedro the owner (whom I never met) provided superior service. Nestor, our friend and driver was fantastic. I could not imagine the island without Nestor. Nestor, took us and our friends to Old San Juan. His knowledge and experience made our trip second to none.Norman, the bell captain, truly, made us feel like family. I know that Norman is now welcome in our home, as we are in his. We spent alot of time talking to him. He is a wonderful person.Selelnia, our server at the pool, was wonderful. Luis, Louis and Juan were also great.However, Selenia was the best. We adopted each other. Not knowing that adopting one was adopting all the servers. It got to the point that we were hugging so many people we thought we were family. It was nice.RestaurantsWe never had a bad meal. You do have to exercise your will at Blossom. The Japanese Hibachi side will go really fast unless you control the timing.StripHouse, Great NYC steakhouse. NYC prices. StingRay, good food, when busy they put tables on the walkway. Ask for the terrace or inside.Otellos, got to be served by Christian and his crew. Dancing, singing and phenom service. Again, I think they are coming to live at my house and they are welcome, LOL.Martini Bar, violin music while relaxing before or after dinner.Anyway, expensive. We saw many people being rude to the staff because of prices. Heard many people abusing the staff for no rational reason other than they were disgruntled over prices. Good dinning at the pool at night, I heard.Bottom line we could hardly walk through the resort with out hugging, embracing and kissing staff membersAs a matter of fact, other guests were rather rude to us because we never waited for a table, everyone knew our name and we never waited in a line. Also didn't play the towel game either.Ask if a convention is booked. Ask if the resort is full. Then meet your extended family. The El Conquistador staff will surprise you if given the chance. Book Las Casitas(we didn't cause we didn't know)Nice people, new friends, big bucks and enjoy!You get what you pay for, and you get new family if you are not jerks.

<Content>Overpriced, Over-rated Stayed at Las Casitas at El Conquistador for 7 nights with my 3 kids. We had a good week, but were very disappointed by several aspects of the hotel. First, the food was uniformly terrible, not to mention overpriced. The hotel has many restaurants; we tried 7 or 8 of them and never found one that could make a decent meal aside from breakfast (but, how hard is it to make scrambled eggs, bacon and fresh fruit?). Service was friendly, which is fortunate since many restaurants automatically included a 20% gratuity on every bill. Also, there is lots of walking/traveling involved at this hotel. The Casitas are nice, set aside from the rest of the hotel. But it is a walk to everything. The hotel makes a big deal about the personal butler service that comes with the casitas. We were told we would have a butler everyday. The first day our butler, Steve, called and stopped by. He was great. Gave us some tips, brought us a DVD player (the casita only had an old VHS machine). But after a couple of days, he had 2 days off and we couldn't find anyone who was assigned to our casita. We enjoyed the water park, although it is small. It is at the bottom of the hill, accessible only by two small funiculars that travel up and down the cliff. Fun for the kids once or twice, but a drag when lots of folks are trying to go to the same place at the same time. The waterpark itself has three slides, a lazy river and a shallow area for small children to play. If your kids have been to other water parks, be sure to set their expectations fairly low. It is certainly more fun than a traditional hotel pool, but it is not that great for a water park. And not free. The tickets are about $13 for kids and $20 for adults. The beach is on a separate island. To get there, you take a free ferry ride. You can rent rafts, inner tubes and other fun things, but everything is overpriced. A kayak is $48 for an hour, for example. A noodle, $6.We rented a car from Enterprise at the front desk to tour the rain forest -- much cheaper than the $50/person for their half-day tour. And we could set our own schedule. The rain forest was beautiful and the hiking was great for kids. I highly recommend at least a 1/2 day there.We also went on a boat tour of the bioluminescent bay. Many folks take the kayak tours, but I really recommend the boat, as we got to jump in the water once we were there. I didn't see any of the kayakers getting into the water.We arranged this trip separately from the hotel with a man named Captain Suarez. He took us in a small boat with about 12 people. We would through mangroves in the dark, with Captain Suarez shining a powerful flashlight onto the mangroves. We saw huge iguanas sleeping in the trees and he pointed out lots of ither interesting nature facts. Swimming in the water was a trip. Water lighting up all around you.While we enjoyed our time in Puerto Rico, we would have preferred to have stayed somewhere with decent food and fewer people.

<Content>wonderful trip and experience I had reservations about going back (I was there with my parents 30 years ago when I was 16) to the El Conquistador after reading so many of the reviews that were written about the Hotel. After spending 6 wonderful days there I am very happy we went. While the hotel was not inexpensive in any way we did not find that it was out of line for the class of hotel and its on site offerings. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. The hotel itself was clean, modern and very spacious. The restaurants served beautifully prepared and tasty meals. While they were not overly large and about 10 to 15 dollars more than in an off site restaurant they were not out of line with what we have seen in our travels to other resorts. There were many less expensive options available in the hotel as well as just off site.While the hotel is huge in both number of rooms and the area it takes up we did not have any trouble getting access to any of the facilities. I played golf twice and had my choice of tee times (even thought the hotel was sold out for the entire time we were there) and when we went to the beach, the pool and the water park there were plenty of chairs, towels and umbrellas to go around. The staff was happy and helpful (in the restaurants service was at times slow but it could have been percieved as not rushing us just as easily) and the staff was in no way always with their hand out. They truly seamed like they wanted to make our experience a good one.The week we spent with our 6 year old went by way to quickly and when it was over we were all sad to be going home.

<Content>Had a great time but.... well it took over an hour with traffic to get to the resort and we were a family of five and upon arrival we had to wait 40 minutes just to see someone at the desk. granted it was a holiday but we were so tired from the long trip we just wanted to get in the room. With that they tell us the only room they have is a king bed. How ridiculous is that. They gave us a double blow up mattress for the kids to sleep on. Food was great but expensive but we knew that going there. Went to palomino and water was beautiful and kids had fun. Asked for blanket for blow up bed for two days before we finally got it on the third day. Was upset about that since my daughter was cold, i actually had to call 4 times. At one point they called my room at 2 in the morning to see if i had received it and i hadnt and was upset they woke me up. Also went to palomino to go horse back riding (first come first serve) my son went up to the desk and asked for reservation for 4 at 12. guy told him only had reservation for 4 at 2pm. then a woman walks up and says she has 6 and he opens up a 1 pm riding for her. I confronted him and he tells me I cant please everyone. Are you kidding me? Took too much work to get to everything which was okay since my kids were teenagers but if you have small ones i wouldnt recommend coming here. If you ask me to go to the carribean again i wouldnt go to puerto rico i would go to the bahamas and stay at the atlantis it is much easier to get to and they dont charge you extra for the water park which is only three rides. Service was great at the restaurants but housekeeping was horrible.

<Content>Disappointed I will begin with the positve points:Service was great; view spectacular; rooms clean; waterpark fun; restaurants great!The negatives: beach infested with bees and does not look like the pictures on the website as the water is very cloudy, not good for snorkeling; no waitress service at the waterpark so if you needed an adult drink you had to walk out of the park to a bar where the wait was ridiculous; taxi service to go three minutes from the resort for a family of 4 was $50 each way; the water in the showers in the room was warm at best.I booked this through American Express but I do not know how this made their Fine Hotel Program.

<Content>Great Experience We just returned from 10 days at El Conquistador. Everything was just perfect. We stayed in Las Casitas but had been at the hotel the prior year. Both are great although we liked Las Casitas more because of the privacy, the larger accomodations and the quieter atmosphere (although still close to the hotel).Especially great are the people there. Our butlers Manny Santiago and Wilfred couldn't do enough for us - reservations, shopping, renting a car, advice re: local restaurants, visiting old San Juan, dealing with a couple of glitches in the room, room keys, etc and giving us advice on where to go, etc. They practically became part of the family. Very professional, kind and effective.Also, the Golden Door Spa/Fitness Center is like an oasis of great karma. Everyone there is gracious and first rate as are the facilities. Rita Maldanado and Juan Perez, the personal trainers are the best in every respect - they are true professionals, as well as inspiring, encouraging, etc . Juan designed a personal fitness program and then throughout the stay he and Rita helped refine it. I worked out with them several times to get the program into a fluid routine. Rita and others also led some wonderful Yoga and meditation sessions which the entire family enjoyed (2 adults, 2 teenagers). One could spend all day at the Spa/Fitness Center. Sofi Valentin, Guest Services Manager of the Spa was equally terrific.The 9 pools and numerous retaurants provide a great variety of atmosphere. Palomina Island is a good beach and fun. There is lots to do and it's just as easy to do nothing all day.The wide variety of restaurants are all great as well. We'll probably go back next year - for our 3rd annual visit.

<Content>Resort that Deserves Recgonition If you are looking for a great family get away, the El Conquistador is the perfect choice. With activites ranging from a child care center for little ones, to a teen club, to bars and a casino for us old guys this place has everything. A private beach is just a short boat ride away where one can engage in activites from snorkling to jet skiing. The service is amazing and everybody is so nice. We stated at Las Casaitas and were fortunate enough to meet Casey Jones who made our stay that much better. As a well travelled man, I highly reccomneded this resort.

<Content>Awful Service My husband, myself, and our three year old son just returned from a five day stay to the El Conquistador. Although, the resort has been recently renovated, the service is in need of a major renovation. In all of our travels we have never experienced such poor service.Upon getting to our room we found the safe to be locked. It took five hours and a couple of phone calls before security managed to come up to the room. As soon as we checked in I requested extra pillows so I could put them on my son's bed so he wouldn't fall out. Once again, it took numerous phone calls. Finally someone from housekeeping showed up approximately six hours later with one pillow. He couldn't understand why we were so upset. Upon speaking to the head of house keeping, additional pillows were finally delivered. We knew that we were going to pay resort prices for food so we were prepared. However, the service in all of the restaurants, especially Otello's was beyond awful. It took approximately 45 minutes for them to bring out a plate of chicken fingers. We always eat on the earlier side to avoid any crowds and delays when we are out with our son. This is in fairness to him and to everyone else in the restaurant. However, you can't expect a three year old to sit for forty five minutes patiently before a meal arrives.We knew the hotel was not inexpensive and we didn't have any problem with that. However, we expected to get far better service than what we received. Everyone who we spoke to said the same thing. Many of the people we met would not return because of the poor service.

<Content>El Conquistador, Puerto Rico If you go in a large group, you must ask the waiters in the restaurant to give you individual checks before you start, or when you make your reservation.The restaurants in the Hotel will charge you extra for bottled water, but the local tap water is fine. Watch out.The concierge, Semi, was incredibly helpful. We ate twice in local off campus restaurants, both of which were terrific. They were his suggestions, he set up the transportation, and made the experiences top shelf.The golf course is incredible. One of the most beautiful and chalenging we have ever played. The coupiers were all friendly and helpfull, as were the pit bosses. Again, a nice experience.Can't wait to go back.

<Content>We got a deal but still expensive! I recently stayed at El Conquistador for just one night with my family (husband and 3 teens) and actually had a nice time. My daughter and I stayed here 2 years ago for a week and enjoyed it then also. So the good stuff, we had a nice room in Las Olas (which I prefer), comfy beds, huge bathroom, nicely decorated. The water park was fun. We got a very cheap (relatively) rate. We enjoyed dinner at the Strip House. The water park manager gave us the half day rate at noon time. Not as good, very expensive food and generally not very good. Long walk to the rooms and the water park not much better than the pools at many hotels we have been at. Don't get me wrong, I will probably go back but it's not the Ritz!My best hint, many of the rooms in Las Olas are considered Garden View even though some actually have great ocean views. Also despite the distance Las Olas is like a little resort within the resort. Quiet with a nice pool for only 40 or so rooms. Definitely much less hectic than the rest of the hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Carefree Vacation I have stayed at this property annually for the past 4 years and each new stay is an even better experience. I stayed at the Casitas two separate times in February, one for work and another with family and both times were exceptional. Each stay and especially this year's stays have been facilitated by Butler Carlos Mangual and Carlos made for a wonderful and carefree vacation. He is a completely professional and highly accomodating butler. Carlos always delivers the highest level of service. The Casitas village and Carlos Mangual as a butler is one of my favorite vacation destinations.

<Content>Spend your time enjoying your Vacation This vacation was the best we've had in a long time. We can't wait to go back. The hotel has so much to offer, we didn't know what to do first. The service was fantastic. The hotel staff were very friendly and made sure we were well taken care. We wanted to make sure we gave special thanks to two of the members of the hotel staff - Jeffrey Franceschi and Pablo Frese. Both of these young men went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable. It is a tribute to the El Conquistador Resort for having employees that understand how to make the customer happy.

<Content>Underwhelmed I found the service at the Hotel to be poor at best except for the Otello Restaurant where the service was superb. The staff at Otello's is to be commended. From the front desk to the bars to the other restaurants we where very disappointed with the lack of professionalism. I would expect that from a place charging $99 per night but not for $419 per night. The drinks and food where very overpriced for the service that we received. Otello's was expensive as well but we did not mind paying it in exchange for excellent food and service.The view was excellent but the overall resort was run down and needed a face lift.Very Disappointed. Would never return.

<Content>The WORST stay EVER!!!! This was the worst stay that I ever had ever! The service was horrible. It took over an hour just to get a plate of chips at the BallyHoo Bar and Grill. All the restaurants had bad service and so-so food. Also, the prices were really high. It was $3.50 for a bottle of water. The room service took a hour and a half for a bowl of cereal and some coffee. Really, the only good thing was the comfort of the beds. The hotel workers were grumpy and unfriendly. It took a whole day to get the towels that I had ordered the day before. The hotel was one hour away from San Juan Airport and you need to take a bus to the hotel. There is no beach on the mainland so you have to go to Palomino Island, but there could be bad weather so you can't go to the beach all the time. The Las Olas pool and the water park pools are not heated. There is no jacuzzi at the water park and the shady seats are very, very limited. The normal seats are limited, too. The jacuzzi at Las Olas had BROWN water and towels are very had to come by, so if you see some, grab them. We stayed at the Marina, so we had to take trams to go up to the main hotel area. The first few times are O.K, but it gets old. The direction to hold on to the rails comes on AFTER the tram moves. All the rooms were recently renovated, but we thought that we were staying at a beachfront motel it looked so cheap. We thought the furniture was from IKEA. The service at the front desk takes minimum fifteen minutes to speak to someone, and they sound like they don't care. My daughter thought that this was horrible and wouldn't go back even if there was first class airfare all expenses paid. Our trip WAS all expenses paid and it was STILL bad. The food was good at The Strip House. They have great steak. But, that was it. A glass of wine costs at least fifteen to twenty dollars per glass. They don't leave chocolates on your pillow when they clean the room. If they say they are a four star hotel,(we couldn't believe it), they should act like it. My final words are, DON'T GO.

<Content>Great Service at El Conquistador My husband and I recently stay at El Conquistador. We had a wonderful time - the private island was excellent! The resort was well maintained. Most of all, we had great service, starting with the front desk (go Yveanette Soto!) to the all the waiters and attendants and staff. We highly recommned this place for those who are looking for a peaceful, sun filled vacation!- SMC

<Content>Butler service rocks! And great exercise classes! We had a great vacation at El Conquistador, even better than the 1st time we went. We stayed in a one bedroom villa in the Las Casitas Village section which allowed us to have a full kitchen, breakfast in the room, flexibility with meals, to save money on food, and most importantly the ability to control food for our child with food allergies. (We had our taxi stop at the supermarket on the way to the hotel and stocked up for the week.) Each villa comes with an assigned butler who can help with any arrangements or amenities desired. Our butler was Steven Ortiz and he was a huge help and now feels like an old friend (thanks Steve!). The new waterpark is small but nicely done and fun for the kids, my only complaint is that you have to pay extra and reserve tickets in advance. My favorite part of the vacation was the Golden Door Spa - truly a relaxing experience. Any spa service allows you full access to the beautiful gym facility and classes at the spa. Their approach to exercises classes is unique and creative - lots of combined modalities that are challenging and really fun, and the instructors are great. Highlights were Manuel's Toys class (Tues/Sat) and Full Moon yoga with Lawrence (once a month). Go to the spa for a schedule. The beach is a bit if a trek/adventure to get to (private island) but we preferred the pools and waterpark anyway.

<Content>Butler - Isreal Trevino My family were at the El Conquistador last month for three days. Our Butler, Isreal Trevino, was SUPERB! We have a handicap son with Autism, and Isreal was very accommodating to our every need. He went beyond the call of duty for the Nioras Family. I would like to relay to his managment team that Isreal is a true asset to El Conquistador and the Villas (Las Casitas) and will return soon and request his services personally again.The Nioras Family

<Content>El Conquistador was NOT a vacation! Very disappointed in El Conquistador, if you are planning a quiet relaxing vacation, do not go to this hotel, doors slamming and paper thin walls you can hear the person in the other room using the restroom. we stayed in the 3440 section, there were ants on the nightstand, bathroom was just remodeled but it looked like they just glued the new tile to the old, you could see the old mildew and old tub! long long walks to get to one place, NO golf cart transportation. Service by the hotel staff was poor, the only great service we received was from Fernando in Bella Vista, he did an outstanding job, the rest of the staff acted as they if we were doing them a favor. They all of sudden became alive when it was tip time. Hotel Hot tub near the Bella vista had a Kotex Max pad sitting on the side, the grounds are NOT kept there is cigarette bud, cups, napkins junk on the floor, there is NEVER anyone picking up or sweeping the property. THe lobby restrooms were flity and old. They need a serious paint job and chaulking the bathrooms! The food was very over priced, and the drinks were weak. The only place that had discent food or drinks wa the bella vista, the pizza was yummy. Forget about asking for assistance on tours or places to go, every time you called the concierge, they never knew anything or told us to call back. We did enjoy our $300 dinner at the strip house, it was delicious. I felt that I never got a good night sleep, there were doors and staff walking by talking on their radios, it was loud all night, and one night the wind was blowing so hard that we had to push the furniture up on the glass to stop the howling or the glass from vibrating! We did move rooms one from 3200 section to the 3440 but it was all the same LOUD! Bring your ear plugs, and be prepare to see trash every were you go. the beach was okay, my son enjoyed the boat ride, but there was trash all over the beach, and sea weed every where, it would be nice if they could of just invested a few hundred dollars to pay a cleaning staff to keep the properyt clean! A tip for Palamino beach, hire someone to rake the seaweed! Next time I will go back to Mexico!

<Content>Not a Beach Vacation This is not a hotel for someone who wants a beach experience. There are two problems with going to the beach here: 1) you have to walk a long way through the hotel, go down a cable car (funicular), board a boat and be taken to a separate island 2) the hotel has expanded drastically in recent years and there is not enough beach space to accommodate all the guests. We spent a week at the hotel during the recent winter break holiday. The staff was very kind and accommodating but they could not make up for a facility that was overwhelmed by the sheer number of guests. The hotel has added on hundreds of rooms in the last few years but they haven't been able to expand the swimming, boating, snorkeling or restaurant facilities to keep up with all the guests. In addition, the newer, nicer area where we stayed, (Las Casitas) is that much further from the main restaurants, beach facilities etc. One day we came back from the beach by one of the later boats, had a half hour wait for the funicular to get up to the hotel and then a 20 minute walk to our room. It took over an hour from the time I left the beach till I was sitting in my room.I also caution people against using the hotel's tour company to kayak into the bioluminescent bay. It is a wonderful sight and there were many other, better organized tour groups out at the same time as ours. The hotel's tour guides went ahead with the faster people in our group and left me with my 10 year old son to find the way to the bay by ourselves. We were alone in the water at night, couldn't see the way to go and were afraid to turn back. It was a very unpleasant experience.My husband enjoyed the golf course very much and was able to get tee times quite easily. My son had tennis lessons from a very good teaching pro. We found that the food was outrageously expensive and generally mediocre. We had rented a car and after a few days used it to go out for dinner every night. We discovered numerous restaurants right by the hotel serving terrific food. I particularly recommend Estacion, which cooks everything on an outdoor grill.

<Content>Beautiful location but beware . . . We stayed at Las Casitas during the February break this year. The location is beautiful and the unit we stayed in was very nicely appointed. Having a kitchen was a huge plus for us since we were traveling with young children. You should most definitely use the hotel service to purchase groceries upon your arrival or rent a car or taxi to go to the local supermarket (about 5 minutes from the hotel), you will save money and be better fed. There were, however, significant negatives to the hotel which would prevent us from returning:1. It took an hour to get from our room to the beach at Palomino Island. You have to take a golf cart to the main hotel, walk about 4 city blocks through parts of the hotel, take an elevator to the tram, wait on line for the tram, wait for the boat to arrive and then travel to the island. No part of the trip was unpleasant but that is a considerable amount of time (especiallyl with kids in tow) and your entire day had to be planned around trying to get to the beach.2. The hotel was extremely crowded (not suprisingly) because of the holiday and they seemed unprepared for the crowds. By the time we arrived at the beach they ran out of chairs, we had to wait 1 hour to pick up our lunch at the only restaurant on the island, the ice cream parlor in the main hotel ran out of most flavors and one of the restaurants we ate in even ran out of napkins. I think this also contributed to the fact that we received very poor customer service from the certain members of the hotel staff.3. The hotel adds additional costs at every turn. Given the cost of our room per night they should not charge an additional fee ($25 per day per guest) to use the Golden Door Spa. Similarly, the $25 per person fee they charged for cancelled dinner reservations in hotel restaurants detered us from making any reservations in advance. This proved to be a wise choice because 2 of our children became sick during our visit and we would have spent $150 not to have dinner.

<Content>Specatacular views  Just returned from 3 nights and 4 days at El Con. This place was amazing. It lived up to it's 5 star rating. The grounds were SO spreadout and I had no complaints with the walking around because the views are so specatcular everywhere you go - who can complain?! If you're looking for lavish and luxury, this is the place to go. If you're looking for the real Puerto Rico, venture towards the West side of the island and don't stay here because this is truly for relaxation and luxury.The thing I liked the most about this resort is that nothing was set in stone. If you needed something - they'd go above and beyond to accomodate you. If it was possible, they'd make it happen. We never heard the word no to anything we needed or asked for. Things we loved: *Cleanliness.*The room had great decor and very spacious. It had an i-home on one of the dressers which was great to prop up your i-pod while you're getting ready or just lounging on your balcony at sunrise or sunset.*Great service by the staff. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. We arrived at 11am and they let us check in early which was awesome. I recommend to stay in the main building because it will eliminate the longer walks and it's central to everything.*The amazing pools. Check out the Infinity pool in Las Casitas (not the small one by the waterpark). This Infinity pool has the most beautiful view I've ever seen. Although the pool is in Las Casitas, it is open to all guests.*Variety of tropical drinks. Try the El Conquistador. *Fridge in room.*Amazing views - the resort is located on a cliff. *Weather was at a steady 85 degrees every day (a few sprinkles once a day and there but nothing that lasted longer than 15 minutes).Things that could've been better:*Prices at the restaurants. However, there is a way around this!!! ***CASH SAVING TIPS***--Get a ride in to town and go to the Amigo (grocery store) and buy bottle water (Desani since that is what they use and you can get away with towing your bottled water to Palomino island). This saved us $100. --The further you away from the main building where check in was, the cheaper things were. For example, if you walked all the way down to the marina, the bottles of water were cheaper. -- We found an all you can eat breakfast down by the marina for $18. This beat the $30 breakfast everywhere else and the quality was excellent.--If you rent jet skiis at Palomino island and they are having a slow day with jet ski rental, they'll come down on the price. Just ask!!--If you're ordering drinks with rum - they tend to be weak. Just ask for more and they'll add it.

<Content>Five Star Prices for Three Star Product Idyllic setting and one of the most gorgeous properties I have visited in my extensive Caribbean travels. But the praise stops there. I was in a recently remodeled ocean view room which was decorated tastefully but not well maintained. There were scuff marks all over the walls and the furniture was stained. The bathroom/walk-in closet area was huge and functional with one huge problem -- no air conditioning vent. Ladies, you cannot style your hair in this humid climate with no air. Bring an extension cord so you can do it in the bedroom. Food was incredibly overpriced for the quality. In all my years of dining out I have never refused to pay a check until I ate at the Cafe Caribe for breakfast, waited almost an hour for an omelet that was flatter than a pancake and had a few slivers of lunch meat in it. They did not make this disaster complimentary but after much haggling discounted the bill 50%. Expect to spend over $100 pp at the steakhouse for a steak you could get at your local Sizzler. I don't mind paying those prices for great steak. Trust me, this steak was not aged prime beef. Sat at a bar for 30 minutes waiting to be served and just got up and left. Bottom line: beautifully maintained grounds and exterior, sub standard rooms, terrible service, mediocre food. Will not return.

<Content>fun, but I don't know if we'll go again We enjoyed our trip, although this place is very expensive. We knew that going in, but WOW!!!Also, we were not a part of a very large group of Chase people who pretty much took over. It would have been nice to know that going in!!!We stayed in a beautiful casita and it felt like we had our own private home on the ocean. Gorgeous view!!!!The staff goes over and above to help. We had a butler name Luiz who was wonderful, but we didn't utilize him as much as we should have.The casino is small and I didn't see anyone win ever.The only real problem I had was that our two 5 year olds weren't tall enough to go down the water slides and we spent a fortune to get in.The best food and service was at Otellos. Very good, but expensive. Overall, we had a great time, but I don't think we'll go back.

<Content>Worst catering manager and service staff Anyone planning a destination wedding or spending their vacation at the Conquistador should think twice before wasting their money and being insulted by the service staff. Our party was a group of event coordinators, restaurant owners and service industry people and we will never recommend or revisit the conquistador even if they paid us to.

<Content>Wonderful Staff, Beautiful Location! My company recently had a sales incentive trip at the El Conquistador/Las Casitas last month. I planned the trip and wanted to write a few quick words about the beautiful resort and the FABULOUS staff. This was my first trip to Puerto Rico and the staff at the hotel really made the trip seamless. 2 of the butlers in particular- Carlos Mangual and Ruben Perez- went above and beyond to ensure that our group had everything we needed. All of their time and effort were much appreciated! I would definitely recommend this resort for similar trips.

<Content>Great Service at the Pool - Great Service by Front Office From front desk to back end this was a pleasant and enjoyable experience. I might have done as another and rented a car in retrospec since leaving the resort for any distance is difficult without one. Although, there is a little village just to the north along the parking lot path to some good local establishments, like Tommy's. Back at the resort, the island was very good with great facilities for water sports, good bar and sunning. One in the party did have a day on a hobby cat where the backstay broke, the operators were out in the water to help immedeately. That they were always watching was very good. On another occasion the last shuttle back to the resort was out of fuel anf the resort had to get other boats to transport many back to the resort. The best comment about this incident was by one of the ladies  What a shame they have to give us two more hours in paridise. The resort gave a house credit to everyone and the GM was there to appologize to each guest. Very professional approach.Of special note were some of the most professional staff I have encountered at any property were here in the the front desk and in hospitallity.If there is any thing you needed to be done go straight to Ms Torres and Ms Bosque at the front desk, they must get my special mention. In hospitality Mr J Castro makes a really special Mojito at the Spalsh Bar at the pool. He has a wide range of concoctions and just remembewrs each guest. If he is not there be sure to say hello to Ms A Marquez and Mr J Lopez. These are the best hospitality staff I have meet besides those at the Moana Surfrider, my favorite hotel. Last was the casino, a very pleasant mix of locals and guests. It was just enought to keep you interested but a caution to all is that putting a $100 in the penny slot machine will mean you play forever. A couple of suggestions for the Management:The pool bar needs a couple of ceiling fans for summer circulation and one or two televisions to capture those who want the news or sports. Also light it up at night and keep it open until 9 or 10 pm. That would allow there to be anice afternoon happy hour say 3-5p that would keep people there longer. Might also put stools in the pool side. Food service to the pool should come from both locations instead of just the one bythe cabanas. We had an ocean view room with a great view of the entire resort and a direct walk to the pool and two floors down from the lobby. The steakhouse was delicious, beautifully prepared and presented. The Seafood was tremendous, especially the Sea Bass. Al in all it was great , thanks for a great get away - I will be back

<Content>Great for kids but overall overpriced Overall we had a great time at the el conquistador with virtually no problems or hiccups. I would NEVER recommend this hotel for those without kids, but if you do have kids (we have a 1 year old) you never have to worry that someone will be upset when your child melts down and has a tantrum in the middle of dinner since the table next to you is probably having the same problem. The whole place is very family friendly.Pro's were nice renovated room (las marinas level), loved palomino island - the best thing about the whole place, great service, idiot-proof pick-up at the airport and delivery to your room.Con's were mostly related to food. There were two options: (1)spend way too much for ok food (ie $70 for chicken and rice for two and a couple drinks) or (2) Spend an insane amount for pretty good food (ie $150 at one of the higher end restaurants). Even breakfast for two at the nice buffet was $60. All that money spent and we still felt like we might get scurvy if we stayed too long. Very few fresh veggies, no fresh fish (unless at the upscale restaurant), no fresh fruit cocktails that we found.So if you are coming with kids and expecting to be gouged you should do fine.

<Content>Fantastic service by La Casitas Butlers Carlos Mangual and Ruben Perez I stayed in the Casitas with my family and had phenomenal service by all of the Casitas staff. Carlos Mangual and Ruben Perez took such exceptional care of my family during the stay. Carlos and Ruben made sure everything was taken care off from dinner reservation to activities to grocerry shopping to tranportation to specific needs and requests. Carlos made sure to go the extra mile to accomidate my family with what ever we needed, as well as check in on us regularly to make sure everything was ok. I highly recomend that you ask the Casitas for Carlos and Ruben to be you personal butler during your stay, You cant get better attention or service and will be very pleased.

<Content>El Conquistador Just returned last night from a 4 night sisters long weekend. Overall we had a wonderful time but will not return. We left the husbands and kids at home so had little to complain about but by the end of our trip we were complaining. We knew fully well that the resort was expensive and that they charged for every little thing but by the last day I just felt I was getting taken advantage of. It all ended with a $65 charge for a two hour extended check-out. The food at the independent restaurants was amazing. We ate at The Stingray Cafe at the Marina and it was great. We had sushi at the bar at Blossoms one night and it was fabulous and very reasonable. The Striphouse was very dark and we almost fell asleep (maybe too much rum) but very good food. We did not eat at Otello's but it look very nice. The food at the restaurants owned by the hotel were pretty bad. Iguana's on Palamino is aweful and it's your only choice. Palamino Island is nice. Great beach but you can only walk so far and have to turn around. Snorkeling wasn't great. If you want to go to the beach it's your only option. The first day it was great and taking the high speed catamaran was awesome! By the last day it was a total pain. It would have been so nice to be able to walk to the beach, go back to your room if you wanted, or switch to the pool in a matter of minutes. The island also closes at 5:30 so you have not choice but to come back to the resort.If you are someone who loves the late afternoon sun to read and nap find another resort. The sun goes behind the mountain at 5:15pm (at least in Feb.) so it's not an option. The swim up bar is nice but would be so better if it was in the sun at cocktail hour.The resort caters to large conventions. MTV had their Sales Meeting when we were there and if they had an event the rest of the hotel guests suffered. They closed the pool bar and blocked off areas. I like to sleep with the balcony door open at night to hear the frogs and the palm trees in the breeze. All we heard was scraping tables and chairs as they were cleaning up from the functions for MTV. We also had a fire alarm at 5am one morning.OK, enough compaining. We had a wonderful time together and the resort is a great place for couples and girls weekend. I don't recommend the resort to singles or famileis with small kids. Our kids ages 3-8 would much prefer an all-inclusive. PBJ's were $9 and they would have died walking this huge resort. If you do go have a great time and bring lots of money!

<Content>Great family trip! We loved our stay at El Conquistador! There really were no (unpleasant) surprises. We knew that it was a large, sprawling resort. We knew that there was a funicular that would take you to the different levels of the resort - that was part of the fun. There is now a new music genre - funicular music - one step above elevator music! We knew there would be a lot of families - afterall there's a brand new waterpark and a great island for snorkeling and other beach activities. That's why we were there. We also knew that it was President's week and school break so we were prepared for lots of people. This did not hinder our stay in the slightest - I guess we were part of the lots of people! Though I wouldn't hesitate to plan an adults only trip here as well. With the wonderful restaurants (the strip house was phenomenal), the spa, the golf, the bars and the casino - it would make for a terrific getaway for adults, too.We will definitely return!

<Content>BIG resort We just returned from 10-days at this property. This property is HUGE. While it is a nice place for what it is, I personally did not care for it and wouldn't go back. There was just 2 of us adults looking for a quiet romantic get-away. We had no idea based on our review of their website that they catered so much to families. The good: The food is excellent, albiet expensive. My compliments to the management in that regard. I don't think we had a bad meal the entire trip. The wine list was also excellent. The bad: Don't get me wrong, I like kids...but they did not have an adults only place anywhere on the resort where you could get some quiet time...not even the martini bar (you couldn't even have a quiet conversation there!). We also saw them serving teenagers in the Ballyhoo bar in the Marina...who got pretty obnoxious after awhile. Aren't the drinking ages the same in Puerto Rico?? As a parent I'd be quite upset that they were serving my underage kids. We found we had to wait in line for just about everything, from the funnicular that takes you from the top of the hotel to the marina to the ferry that takes you to the only accessible beach on the private island off shore. In my opinion, the nicest place to swim in the water on the island appears to be reserved for private boaters coming in for the day. There are no beach chairs in that direction, so they are definately directing the masses to the shallow, windy and more rocky side of the beach. And when I say masses, I mean masses! There was one day that not one beach chair was available on the beach. One of the employees told us later they had counted 1500+ people taking the ferry to the beach that day. Expensive...I don't know how so many folks with families can afford to stay here. Bring a small ice chest. If you have a car, you can stop at one of the local grocery stores and buy snacks  things. You can walk down to the little marina town just outside of the hotel  buy beer for less than $1 per can (Beers (10 oz cans) are over $5 each at the resort). You can get ice at the machines near most rooms. There are small refridgerators in each room, so you do have somewhere to store snacks. SUGGESTIONS: Rent a car and travel around the island. We rented a car in advance from Enterprise about 4 months before our trip...we got a great rate ($150 for the week for an economy car). They were renting for $59 a day if you rented at the hotel. The hotel says there is a $15 per day parking fee. The folks at enterprise have spaces reserved for enterprise...they told us we could park there for free if there were spaces available. We were able to get a space every night, so never had to pay any fees. Bring a small ice chest. The bioluminescent bay is a must. We did the motor boat with Capt Suarez, but the kayaks looked more fun. If you don't think you can control a kayak, the motor boat would be the way to go. The rain forest was beautiful. Pack a picnic lunch (you can get stuff at any local supermarket). After we hiked to the top we had a beautiful picnic at one of the picnic areas within the park. Go to San Juan for at least one day. It is a beautiful city full of history. We had a great meal at the Parrott Club.

<Content>Camp Conquistador We have been going to the Caribbean every Presidents week for 10 years. We know it's an expensive and crowded time to travel but we have no choice. This year, we decided to try the El Conquistador.Children under 10 outnumbered adults 3-1. They were everywhere!We could not find a quiet place at any poolside or at their private beach. You would turn over in your chair to find someone's foot about 6 inches from your nose.The restaurants are supposed to be good. We never mind paying $100-150 for a good meal. This was the case at the StingRay and Strip House. the Northern Italian Otello's, however, was the biggest rip off ever! Their food was most certainly not Northern Italian by any stretch of the imagination!! It was TERRIBLE and very expensive.You need to make dinner reservations to any restaurant a week before you go or you may be out of luck.Breakfast varied from place to place. $17 for a dried up waffle was riduculous. Lunch: $15 for a tiny tasteless frozen pizza was ridiculous as well.Think twice before seeking peace and quiet here on Pres. week!!

<Content>Excellence at El Conquistador I just returned from an amazing week at El Conquistador Golf Resort and Casino in Puerto Rico. My husband and I and 3 young children went and had an excellent week of fun in the sun, great food and attentive butlers, especially Eddie Trau. Anything we needed, he had for us within an hour. He was also great with the kids and gave us information about day trips and good places to eat. We were upgraded when we got there(what a nice surprise) to Las Casitas Village. It was absolutely beautiful! We would recommend El Conquistador to anyone. There is also a new water park on the propertythat is great for any age child. My 3 year old and 8 year old loved it. When making your reservation talk to Aileen Lisch, she is so helpful and nice to deal with. Also, Carmen and Mr. Bizardi at Las Casitas Village are so helpful with all questions when checking out. Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable. We'll be back next February!! They have a grocery service at Las Casitas for a fee they will send someone to the store for you. $0-100 was $25.00 that is good to buy snacks and drinks.Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable. We'll be back next February!!

<Content>2 adults  We were only there for three nights - wish it were longer! Our kids LOVED the water park - just the right size for the four of us to stay entertained and not get lost! The pools were great, and the staff and service that we recieved was WOW! Everyone was ALWAYS happy, and VERY helpful! And when you have two little ones that is VERY important... Our partial view room was SO nice, we had the best of all worlds, able to see the rain forest, the ocean and the golf course! The kids loved the ride on the monorail and the boat ride to the beach - since our baby is only almost two - the beach is not a great place to hang out all day, so the boat ride really broke it up nicely! All of the restaurants were very accomodating and I would recommend this beautiful resort to everyone! Clean, family friendly, romantic, just perfect!

<Content>Overpriced, Underserviced. Think Twice With Young Kids Stayed at the El Conquistador over the school winter break which is, admittedly, a very busy time to travel. We booked late. First off the positive: Our room (Las Brisas) was beautiful. Recently renovated, tasteful in a boutique hotel style and was quite spacious. The bed very comfortable. Our view was magnificent. Endless vista of the Caribbean Sea. The waterpark which opened 2 weeks ago was an absolute blast for all of us and at $12 for adults, $9 for kids, the biggest bargain.Now the flip side. We didn't know much about the resort and also didn't realize how spread out and large it is. We have young children, aged 3 and 5 so convenience is a premium for us. We were near the pool area and a number of restaurants, but there is no beach at the hotel. You need to take a fanicula down a cliff, then a catamaran to the beach on Palomino Island (which is beautiful). The boat leaves every 1/2 hour, and though very punctual, if you forget something you can't just run back to your room to get it. My youngest got tired and wanted to go back to the room to rest. He had to wait a total of 45 minutes to get there. Around 4pm people start leaving the beach so the lines back can be long. Overall, expect a lot of standing in line to get places and a good bit of waiting in general. So if convenience is a premium, this is not the place for you.SERVICE: Mediocre at best. We needed a rollaway bed. After 2 days of calls we finally got one (don't even ask how long it took to get a blanket to go with it!). Most hotels, especially nice ones , provide you with moisturizer, cotton balls and Qtips. After 3 calls to housekeeping I finally gave up trying to get them. Lastly, we had to call twice to request robes (also something you expect at nice hotels). FOOD: Mediocre to awful. Completely overpriced. No matter where you go, from the burger hut at the beach to finer dining. Lunch was always $50, dinner near and over $100. And the service, terrible--the pace glacial no matter where you are which is a nightmare when you are with tired children at the end of the day. At one lunch my husband and I ordered the exact same thing and when 2 different meals showed up the waiter looked at his order form and insisted we were the ones who were wrong! Didn't even apologize or offer to fix it.The pool is also too cold.My final comment is that this is a 4 star resort with 5 star prices and 2 star service. The owners/management (I hope they're reading) could really learn a thing or two from the folks at the Ritz Carlton, where we'll be returning next vacation. (The one in Montego Bay is fantastic!) I'll plan ahead next time.

<Content>Fun vacation at the El Conquistador in Fajardo Puerto Rico My family and I stayed at the El Conquistador for a week in Feb durning school vacation. We were driven to the hotel from the airport by a private driver. We got his name from the hotel. We enjoyed having a driver since he knew the area very well and had great stories to share about the island. Once we got to the resort we were stunned with the amazing ocean view. Pictures don't do it justice you must see it with your own eyes. Check in was easy a little line since it was school break. We did request a better room but no one followed through on it. Rooms- We had 2 rooms in the main section of the hotel, the older section. My parents were on the first floor so the view from their balcony was not as nice as ours on the 4th floor. My room had no DVD player and a very small balcony basically just a huge window. We did have a beautiful view! Our hallway floor was getting repainted or some type of work done on it so the workers placed towels under our doors so water would not seep through. The room was bright, pretty big and a large bathroom. It was great to leave the windows open at night so we could hear the ocean.Resort/Pools- The lobby is huge. There are tons of little stores inside the lobby including a Starbucks which was packed every morning! There are local bands that perform great music in the lobby at around 10:30 P.M, fun to watch everyone dancing. We did not go to the Casino but it looked nice. We did wish that the hotel had more info on events that were happening durning our stay. The pool was great. We reserved 4 chairs early in the A.M under a palm tree. The cabanas at the pool costed $218 for just one day. There is a great pool bar as well. The water park we did not use because it looked like there was construction going on. All in all everything at the resort is expensive but we did know that going into it after reading other reviews. The hotel is very spread out and sometimes can be complicated but after the first day we got the hang of it.Palomino Island was great. We had so much fun on the island. The boat ride over was lots of fun and it was also a quick ride 8-10 mins. Once on the island each person gets one towel. The beach is calm and serene once you get away from the dock area. There are many cabanas and lots of chairs. There is also a place to eat and tons of water activities. The coolest part was just being on our own island and seeing the resort up in the mountains. The ferry comes every 30 mins and the crew on board is very nice. You do have to take the funicular down to the marina so give yourself plenty of travel time. The funicular is pretty fast, there sometimes can be a line which is to be expected. Tip: Try to avoid taking the funicular around 5-6 P.M if you can. We had to wait 30-40 mins in line for the funicular at that time since that is when everyone leaves Palomino Island and the water park to go back to their rooms. Food and drinks were very expensive but again we did know that. We loved Stingray and Bella Vistas. We also had a lot of fun at Ballyhoo bar and Grill which was down near the Marina. It has great views of the ocean and everyone there was very helpful and fun to talk to. The bartenders were great and told us where some of the New York Yankee players live and other famous people that they met.We also went to Pasion Fugeo for dinner outside of the hotel.....great food, lots of fun to leave the resort and see Fajardo!We had a very good time at El Conquistador but were a little disappointed with our rooms since they were in an older section. The employees were great,very helpful and always saying Hola to us!Lastly, It is always windy at the El Conquistador since it is so close to the ocean and it can be a little chilly at night.

<Content>You can find a better place Overall our stay was OK - the place is clean with beautiful ocean views, nice pools and the grounds were great. However, our room opened into a courtyard - no hallways, so you heard every sound made outside, people talking dragging their luggage, laughing, etc. The second issue was the time it took to get to the beach - by the time you left your room, took the cable car down to the marina, got on the ferry, waited for departure and got to the island, it took almost an hour. Last problem is they barely put ANY alcohol in their drinks.

<Content>el conquistador las casitas is the best! The Las Casitas Village Villas are the Best!Not only are they clean with incredible ocean views but the service the best. We had Ruben Perez as our butler along with Eggy Lopez. Five stars to each. They called each day several times a day to attend to our needs. They stocked the kitchen with supplies.

They are truely first class and when we come back will be requesting them as they made a great place an awesome experience!The restaurants are all top shelf better even than NYC!Thank you Ruben for making our visit so enjoyable!

<Content>Good for Conventions, Golf and Family Reunions Not Couples Just got back last night. We wanted a three day getaway to a beautiful beach and great pool. What we got:1.OK we knew the hotel was huge but weren't worried cause just wanted beach and pool. Alot of time traipsing around. Arrived to what looked like a convention center building. Checked in - were relieved to find our room was near the main building (no need to take a golf cart.) Went to our room - renovated to a three star level (Marriott is nicer) with a lovely balcony with beach/pool view. Decided to go to the beach - traipsed through main building near check in- walked through tables of people eating lunch on outside area - around the bend (gorgeous views)- past alot of stores to glass elevator which took us to the funicular. Funicular took us down mountain. 10 minute wait for ferry to take us to private beach (with about 500 people on it). No waves. Felt like we were commuting to the beach.2. Water Park and pools. If you are with a posse of preferably 10 year olds and younger - you are in good shape. The pools have no depth. Average depth is 3 feet - a few really deep spotsreaching 4'6. At the Water Park, there is one area in the pool which is 4'6 and looks over the ocean (up close!) which is a treat. Not sure why they charge for the Water Park - we have been to nicer more beautiful water park pools(Grand Walea for example) at other hotels that don't charge extra for it.3. Everything everyone has written about the food is true. We live in Manhattan and thought the prices were outrageous. Had lunch at the Marina and thought maybe the best way to handle the resort (if you are not a golfer - the course is beautiful) is to stay in the marina sectioin (cutting off the elevator, funicular) and being more in tune with nature and the beach island.4. I'm extremely familiar with the beauty of this portion of the island (having done biz here in the early 90's). If we had signed on for longer, would have taken the ferry to Vieques and Culebra and spent some time at Luquillo beach ------ The big question - why stay at this resort to go elsewhere.5. Loads of people - yes, it was a holiday weekend but this place was jammed. Lines, waits and traipsing through people.6. Didn't see the golfers but can imagine they were happy. Famililes with kids also looked content. Not for us. If you are a couple looking for a romantic getaway - think twice about this place!

<Content>The "Do's" and "Dont's" We just returned from a week stay at the El Conquistador with another couple. Both couples have traveled extensively and stayed in accomodations from cabins to world class. Here is the down and dirty on the El C.Getting There. The El C charges $140.00 per couple round trip from the airport to their facility. For $280 we decided instead to rent a car at Enterprise by the airport. The week rental (plus gas) was no more than the El C charge and gave us a vehicle for the week. Yes the drive on Route 3 has many stop signs so take Route 66 until you must merge with Route 3.The Hotel  Grounds. The grounds are magnificent as is the cliff side location. Clean and well maintained with many beautiful views of the ocean. The hotel is huge - like a small city. Anyone who complains about the size has no one to blame but themself for booking here. You know about the size before you come - right? Since we were not there on school vacation week we were amazed at how uncrowded everything seemed. No hassles anywhere with crowds or waiting.The Rooms. We stayed in ocean view rooms in the Las Brisas wing. They were large, well appointed and clean. The view from the balcony was fantastic. A mini frig was perfect. Not one complaint about anything. FYI...I would not want to stay in the middle complex rooms or at the base (Marina). You are then tied into using the tram all the time to gain access to the main hotel buildings.Service. Superb. Everyone was friendly, helpful and made you feel like a guest to be pampered.The Tram. We saw several complaints about the tram. Truth be told we did not have one problem. The trams (there are 2) run constantly and we found our longest wait maybe 2-3 minutes. The trip up or down takes only a couple of minutes at most. Maybe this is more of a hassle during school vacation week.The Ferry. If you want to got the resorts private beach island you must take the ferry. They run every half hour and the trip to the island takes 10-15 minutes. Again, not one hassle with this.The Island. Fabulous. Plenty of chairs - sun or shade. Great swimming etc. Perfect in all respects. Water shoes are not necessary but if you have tender feet or sit on the far side of the island (away from ferry dock) you might need because of coral. Towels are available as are rest rooms and food and drink. Really a fun way to spent a day.Casino. We are not big gamblers and found the casino perfect. Not too big, not too small. Something fro everyone.Gold Course. We did not play but it looked spectacular. We inquired and it $180 a round.Spa. We did not use..no comment.Food  Drinks. Hold onto your wallet. Everything is expensive, expensive, expensive. We ate at numerous grills and also at Stingray and Othellos. For the prices you expect world class cuisine but that was not the case. THIS IS WHERE THE CAR COMES INTO PLAY!!!!! We went to the local store in Fajardo and loaded up on waters, fruit, yougert etc. so that we could take breakfast or a light lunch on our balacony if we wanted. We also bought some booze and had cocktails on our balconies at night before dinner. This is the way to go and will save you a fortune. This also allowed us to go off site and visit local restraunts. This was a blast and we met some great local folks.Rain Forest. We went. Lots of hiking but honestly unless you have never been out in the nature and want to experience it don't lose any sleep if you miss this. The can't miss waterfall in the forest was disappointing for its lack of size.Bioluminescent Bay. DO NOT BOOK THIS THROUGH THE HOTEL AT $90 A PERSON. Ther are many local companies to book through. We went through Eco at $45 a person. This was also dissappointing. The luminescence is brightest in the summer...not much help for all of us there in the winter. It is further diminished if the moon is out. Honestly we could barely tell it existed. Also be aware that you will get wet so bring a change of clothes and it is a workout to get there. We are all in great shape but felt like we had been to the gym.Luquillo Beach. This is a great side trip if you have a car. It is a Blue Flag beach and is fantastic. You can rent lounges for $5 and an umbrealla if you want. Restrooms and snacks are available. If you go you have to head down to the kiosks for lunch. Number 2 - La Parilla was the best...so good we went back for a second time.All in all we all agreed we would return!!

<Content>Loved every minute! Marvelous!!!We just got back and I have to say it was beautiful.Our ocean view room was great and the service is to die for! Everyone went out of their way to make us as comfortable as possible. My husband got dirt on something the day before we had to leave so there was no time for the laundry at the hotel to handle it but one of the women there took it home and washed it for him. How's that for service??The food was great in all the restaurants we tried and the spa was decadent.The private island was beautiful with full drink service right to your lounge on the beach.I had a great time in the casino at night. I would highly recommend this hotel to all travelers.

<Content>Nice Resort, Good For Family Vacations We stayed at the resort on Feb 5th 2008 a couple days after the water park opened. The resort is huge with a lot to do. I definately recommend going out to the private island and spending your days there rather than at the pool. The water park is also a nice activity for a couple hours if you have kids.Our hotel room was very spacious, nice decor and a beautiful view of the ocean. We stayed in the Las Brisas rooms which is on the main hotel level. I definately recommend staying in this location.The food was ok. I recommend eating at Sting Ray and The Strip House or the Italian restaurant. I do not recommend the Blossoms.

<Content>A dissappointing vacation to say the least A very disappointing experience. The hotel is huge and filled with conventions. We were put in the Los Olas section, which is run down, concrete walls chipping, wood railings rotted, and carpeting in the lobby of Los Olas was filthy. Our room had been remodeled and was very pretty, but someone had not cleaned properly. They were very accommodating and moved us to the Marina, a new building and new rooms.....very satisified until we checked into the room (the only one available, according to them) and our premium ocean view room was right over the major construction of a water park, Coqui, which started promptly at 8AM and went until 6PM with backhoes, etc. and way too much noise to even sit on our deck overlooking the ocean! The food was outrageously priced.....such as $9.00 for a KIDS hotdog or $14 for a cheeseburger......and the list goes on. Won't go back. People were very friendly, however! Oh, the night kayaking ($89 per person) was a huge disappointment. The lumenated kayaks were nothing more than a Halloween glow stick on the front and back of the boats! Lots of rowing in the dark to see a little bit of luminance in the water......

<Content>Too Big and A Little Overpriced My husband and I usually stay at a Four Season's Resort when we go on vacation but this hotel was picked for us by family. The hotel was nice, but not up the standards that we have grown acustomed to for the price. This hotel asks the price of a Four Season's but unfortunately, not the quality. It is extremely big and can take a while to navigate. The prices for food, beverage and room are too high for the quality of the hotel.

<Content>Loved El Conquistador Resort  Puerto Rico: El Conquistador Resort Las Casitas Village Just sharing with everyone that this amazing Resort will become my personal getaway. My family and I were able to experience this beautiful Resort in two occassions and were extremely satisfied by not only the incredible views, sites and Villas, but, mostly by the special service provided by a staff/Butler of Las casitas Village, Jeffrey Franceshi. From the moment we arrived, he provided us with special attention incuding accomodations for our 9 month old baby and also provided special attenton to my parents. It was a pleasure to have him as our butler and will request him each time. He was always available for us and very diligent. I have traveled to many locations on the globe, but, this is definitely my favorite. Please remember this staff member of the El Conquistador and experience the excellent service. This resort offers wonderful grounds, pools, private islands and entertainment for the whole family. The hotel staff are very friendly and always attend you with a smile. Experience this resort and it's natural beauty.

<Content>Amazing! I had a wonderful stay at this beautiful resort. The atmosphere was relaxing, the room was luxurious and the staff was friendly. the pools are beautiful and a pleasure to lay beside. It is also the first hotel I have stayed with a private island and ferry service to and from. the food is also of excellent quality all over the resort. However, as any experienced traveler knows, it is the staff at a resort that can surely make the difference between an average experience or a wonderful one. I can specifically comment on three staff members who above and beyond the call of duty to help me, Nilmari, Alejandro and Yesenia. Any hotel or business would be privileged to have staff as personable and accommodating as they are. I hope the resort appreciates them as much as I did. Therefore, I not only recommend a stay here but insist that it is an experience that should not be missed.

<Content>Too much -- in all aspects My family (me, husband, 2 children (under age 10)) stayed at El Con from 1/26 - 2/2/08. I relied heavily upon this website before leaving for our visit and was glad it prepared me for the resort. Here is my take on it:Location:The drive from the airport to the resort was about 50 minutes...really far when travelling with children who had been up since 4 AM; and, with everyone ready to start vacation. We had the prearranged shuttle waiting for us, so, there was no time at the airport for us to eat (and the airline ran out of food before our seats were served) so needless to say, we were tired  hungry. The shuttle had a cooler with water bottles (HINT: grab a number of them and put them in your fridge once you get into your room, because the resort price for bottled water is about $3/bottle). Pulling into the resort you immediately see that it is well decorated and has beautiful grounds. However, the resort was far too big for me. I felt as though I was in a town. Nothing is really within a quick walk. Check In/Rooms:The hotel staff member we worked with was very helpful (Joanne) however, checking in was a problem for us. We had made a prior request for an ocean view room that would be near the main hotel area (versus taking the funicular to/from our room); and, we were told we had an ocean view room (2 queen beds) down the bottom of the funicular. The only ocean view room available that was not in the funicular area was a king size bed and, to accommodate the kids, we were told that they would bring in an air mattress! Now, that was not acceptable to us...our children were also on vacation and we were not paying those high rates for them to sleep on an air mattress. The only ocean view room with 2 queens in the main hotel part would be available in 3 days -- so, we took that one and stayed the first few nights in the king room and the air mattress. The first air mattress lost all of its air within 2 hours; and, the staff needed to come in the room and set up a new one (while my kids and I sat up in my bed in our PJs...an uncomfortable situation!). This ordeal took until 10:30 PM to sort out and we were very tired and hungry and not real pleased with El Con at this point! (HINT: if you are placed in this same situation, and are told you need to use an air mattress in a king bed room, make sure that you get one of the larger king bed rooms. There are 2 size rooms with king beds...the first one that they tried to use the air mattress in was so small that we literally needed to side step through the room in single file to get dressed, watch TV, get to the beds, etc. After complaining about that we were moved to a larger king size room which held the air mattress a little better and again because it was temporary (just 3 days) we suffered through). Now this next comment is going to sound odd, but, it was an issue: there are no blankets or covers. The room was always very cold and we switched back and forth between having the air set on 74 degrees or turned off and just ran the ceiling fan. We called guest services for 2 blankets, but, 4 blankets would have been better! The bathroom was very large and clean. My only complaint with the shower was in our room that had the 2 queen beds, and, that was that we never had hot water. It didn't matter if we showered first thing in the morning, afternoon or evening, our water was always tepid. And, when we moved the nozzle to hot there was a loud vibrating noise that ran the whole time we showered.Pools  Beach:The pools are kept very clean. The water temperature was fine, and, there are pool noodles, balls, towels, etc. (which did not have a service fee or charge attached to the use of these things --- that was surprising because with the exorbitant fees we paid for food/drinks/services for everything else, I would have expected a $20/person/day charge for the towels and pool usage!). Almost every day we took the boat ride to the private island to go to the beach (the resort is not directly on the beach...so if you want sand/snorkeling you need to get on the boat to get there). The food at the beach as well as the pool service (at the resort itself) is very expensive and nothing unique to Puerto Rico. It is very standard fare (burgers, chicken, salads, sandwiches). The drinks were all expensive and I am still sickened by the money we spent on food/drinks each day.Staff:The staff (at all places: pool, beach, front desk, concierge, restaurants, cafes, etc.) were always pleasant, quick, helpful, but that didn't take away the pain of the expense! Kids Activities:All I can say here is it will cost you. There was one morning that my husband was golfing, and, I had to work for 1.5 hours. So, I put my kids in the kids club. Imagine my surprise to learn that the kids club is not free -- it is $45/child for 1/2 day (9:00 - 12:00, no lunch provided) and $75/child for a full day (lunch and snack provided). Yes, it was $90 for 1.5 hours.Restaurants within the Resort:The cost of food was astronomical. I saw a lot of comments about it before we left and somehow it didn't hit home until we experienced it...it is crazy what you will pay to feed a family of 4, 3 meals a day. And, the taste of the food is not very good and actually seemed worse given the cost! There were no places within the resort that offered local food. I kept forgetting I was on vacation because the menu choices were that what you get at home (but double the price). Water Park:The water park was supposed to open in December (which was a big reason we booked in November for a late January/early February stay). Well the opening got pushed back several times and it finally opened at 11 AM on the day before we left the resort. Due to the inconvenience of the opening day/time, we were allowed in for free. That was great! (Normally the fees are $20/adult; $15/child, I think). We spent the entire day at the water park and it is a lot of fun. I am glad that it was not opened the entire time we were there because the daily ticket prices would have just added to our outrageous bill. Checking Out:Read your bill extra carefully. We had a self parking fee on our bill for each day we were there -- and we didn't even have a car! The staff was great about taking it off immediately. There were also some charges that we did not expect due to taxes being added after we signed off on our bills already (example: we ordered food while on the beach; before you place your order you need to show your resort card and give your room #, then, the order is placed on your master bill with the resort. before you leave the beach for the day, you 'check out' with the beach staff, and you sign off on your bill. we would look it over and make sure the right number of drinks/food were noted; and, then we would add a tip. the total that we would sign off for would be about $45 (example only). yet, on the last day when the charges were all printed out for us to check-out, that $45 charge would show up as a $49 charge because they would add taxes to the bill after we signed it!)Feeling trapped:Okay, my final complaint --- I felt like we were stuck on the property (we did not rent a car due to the expense of rental and parking each day at the resort ($16/day to self park) and we felt forced to pay ridiculous prices in order to survive. There are a few local restaurants within walking distance for adults, but, not for those with small children so we did not opt to walk 15-minutes to try out the food at these places. Overall, we spent an awful lot of money on the room and our meals/drinks and nothing felt luxurious or extravagant... it was all very ordinary and we were left feeling like we were ripped off.

<Content>Best Ever This is the second trip that my wife and I were making to Puerto Rico, we had planned on staying somwhere else, however they were already booked. A friend of ours, Maralyn Lopez, works at the Conquistador Resort and sugested we stay there. I am glad she did, everything was perfect, from the service, the pools, beach, food, golf, beautiful views, casino, new water park and even shopping. There really is no need to go anywhere else, they have everything right there. When the airlines we traveled on lost our luggage, they even assisted us in getting it located and brought to our rooms. Now I am spoiled and there really is no other place I would rather stay in Puerto Rico.

<Content>Pleased with the Updates Having stayed at the El Con last year for a convention I was interested in seeing how the renovations had come along when I found out the same convention would be returning this year. I was very impressed. I was in one of the renovated Las Brisas ocean view rooms. Very clean, crisp, bright and modern. The bed was very comfortable and the room as a whole was spacious. No problems at all with anything electrical or water pressure. I arrived back to my room each night to a turned down bed, chocolates on the pillow, and the radio playing. I had a perfect view of the ocean and could hear the singing tree frogs at night.  The new convention area of the hotel is beautiful and there are plenty of different sized rooms for use for whatever size group might attend. The staff was very helpful and attentive during the entire stay. Check in was smooth and quick. Eva was very pleasant and courteous. All of the staff that I encountered said hello and were willing to help. I tried Stingray Cafe this year. The sea bass was excellent and the waitress was willing to substitute items if asked. The restaurant was busy, but I did not feel rushed and the atmosphere was very nice. There are new stores in the hotel and a Starbucks. I think the hotel is definitely getting better.

<Content>Fantastic I stayed at El Conquistador early this year. First, the service was great. All of the staff members were very helpful. In particular, Marisol Bosque setup my reservation and I could not have been more pleased with her service and her ability to accommodate me in short notice. If anyone is looking to book a vacation with a group they should definitely ask for her. I will absolutely stay at this hotel every time I visit PR. The rooms were spacious and had great views. In addition to Marisol, Diana Cortes was very helpful during my checkout process. The Spa was by far the best that I have ever been to. I could not get enough of the spa treatment. Overall, I had a great time. Thanks for the experience.

<Content>How SAD If you were to be blindfolded and dropped off at this place the only thing you would know is that you were on an island somewhere. My husband and I are not golfers and the prettiest part of the hotel IS the golf course. We stayed in Las Vistas wing in which you were awakened to what seemed like a jack-hammering noise probably due to old water pipes. The elevators were broken since the day we arrived and we were on the fifth floor.There was no tropical atmosphere in your room whatsoever.The food was beyond below expectations. Again, being in Puerto Rico a person would expect to have some kind of local foods to sample. If we would have eaten at IHop the food would have been better. We attended a semi-formal event in which we were served hockey-pucks. Thankfully we were there on a business reward otherwise my review would prabably be worse. I feel bad for the fact that our company had to dish out money to this place where we could have had more fun in South Florida. The only good point is that the staff is friendly. The worst part of the whole place was the fact that if you wanted to go to San Juan or elsewhere, which YOU wanted to, it was an hour and a half out. We spent half a day on sitting on buses. There are plenty of hotels within three miles of the airport which are cheaper and better worth your time. It is truly false advertising for them to state they are a luxury hotel. Whoever owns this hotel is truly milking it for the business events. Two stars at best. This is the type of hotel which makes you not want to returnt to Puerto Rico.

<Content>WOW...Great Resort...Golf Getaway I am a (25) Year old reviewer and am very blessed/fortunate to have stayed at many caribbean resorts from punta cana and aruba to st johns/thomas, nieves, barbados, turks caicos, cancun and jamaica..I ONLY say this because i have a fairly good grasp on caribbean travelling..So anyways I stayed with my girlfriend in a las casitas guestroom and the room was great and the grounds are very lush and well maintained like a private golf course...The actual golf course was great but very hot, geez was it hot during my stay, bring sunblock. I played as a single golfer and saw monkeys and mammoth iguana on nearly every hole, very cool...So about the resort you know food expensive and service may or may not be sub par, this happens on any resort and this one is huge so get over it.....Palomino island is great for lounging and i mean special/great awesome place/ but def not snorkeling like st john/barbados..I dont snorkel so i always brought my gap wedge and chipped on their chipping/putting surface on Palomino very cool, when i wasnt swimming .Basically for new insight that other reviewers havnt touched on if you want great nightlife go to Cancun, Cabo or Aruba....If you want the best of the best ever go to Sandy Lane Barbados or 4 Seasons Nieves/St Kitts but beside these aforementioned destinations this can not be beat.....I would never stay at a San Juan resort or dominican republic after going here. The Cove at Atlantis is cool but this place is better than that in some ways...BTW Strip House is very good like NYC good and we also went off site at the marina entrance and at local food while drinking beer we bought at convenience store..you can walk wherever you please while drinking from golf to the pool to the island and restaurants...Tip: go offsite and eat where the locals are its funny...TIP: Also i bought couple hundred dollars of tequila/gin at the duty free shop in the san juan airport for dirt cheap and than had top shelf liquor on heavy ice waiting for my signif other and I whenever we wanted TIP: Also for the $65 you pay for the shuttle I filled a duffle bag with about 25 bottles of spring water and had bottles of water on heavy ice during our entire trip for free....

<Content>Beautiful location The resort location is stunning, the newly renovated rooms are trendy and comfy and the pools and private island beautiful. Great golf course. However the service and staff is not top level. We received a cold welcome/greeting at the reception, and didnt get access to our room until 5pm, even if we were promised the room at 3pm. When calling concierge, the line was often busy with no waiting system. Service in the pool bars/restaurant was below average and on out on the island we waited 20 minutes to order a drink in the bar. It was not busy at all but the bartender ingnored us and a another staffer was just hanging out and advised he only served food. By the main pool area, i specifically asked if a certain sandwich came with fries, and the waiter said yes. It then came without, and when i asked for the fries I had to wait and was then charged extra for them. Not the end of the world, but with the rates of the El Conq, you expect top notch service. I still recommed this resort though since the location is stunning and amenities are very good. We stayed 3 nights/4 days.

<Content>Decent Vacation The El Con was decent and a nice vacation but not perfect. We chose PR because we did not have our passports back from getting renewed. The El Con's reviews were all over the place but we thought it would be better than staying home. Here is what we found:September travel is dead. No one is around. I cannot imagine being at the El Con when it is high season as the service is average when we were the only ones there. The plus side was we never waited for a table and had our choice of poolside chairs etc... The downside is that we were bored.Food - yep, believe what you read. It is expensive. Plan for it. Was it outlandish? Kinda. Did it ruin our stay? Nope. The pizza by the pool was good and big enough to split. The Japanese restaurant was excellent and worth the price. We ate at the bar by the marina several times and got salads. The view and the atmosphere was great and the salads were reasonably priced. We did discover that the hotel store had lots of snacks and drinks (including beer and wine) for pretty cheap so we bought our drinks there and had heavy snacks for lunch. We even took our beers to the pool and the island. Probably not supposed to do that but they do sell it so... We spent a total of $969 for 2 people for food for 5 days. Not out of line for most resorts really. We did check the little restaurants outside of the resort (short walk from the marina entrance) and would NOT recommend them. Very dirty with stray dogs running around. Brunch at Las Brisas was fantastic and enough to tide us over through dinner so the $25 was pricey but worth it.Pools- one pool was closed for construction. The other pools all connect to each other in the same place so it really is just one big pool. There were lots of little kids at the pool and it was very loud and not relaxing. These kids were not staying at the hotel which was disappointing especially since they were disruptive. Not a great pool experience unless you are there with kids (which we were not).The room- we did book the new Las Brisas wing and are glad we did. The room was nicely redone with a large bathroom and good size closet. The older rooms were very old and musty- we peeked. The walls in the new section still had paint peeling in spots. The renovation was cosmetic and not a total rehaul. The room was clean enough and well appointed but nothing special. The halls were not vacummed daily which was unacceptable to us. When we called needing service in our room (AC not working, clock set at wrong time, DVD player not working) , it was several hours before anyone came and several reminder phonecalls. We did go over to check out Las Casitas Villas and they were very nice. They have their own pool, restaurant and pool bar. It is very private and much nicer- wish we had stayed there. It is a bit off the beaten path but golf carts take those guests to the main hotel if desired. The walk was actually nice though.The island- the best part of our stay and well worth the trip!!! Palomino Island was amazing and beautiful! The short ferry ride was relaxing and fun. The chairs are many and the huts keep you shaded if you wish. The shoreline is small for beach walking but still calm and fun- just do it a couple of times. The water was clean and warm. It was very peaceful at the beach with a great breeze. We went every day and loved it! It is truly paradise and a nice break from the world. You get lost in it! They do have a small bar and snack hut (the big restaurant was closed) so we couild get drinks and food, but of course we brought our own from the little store in the hotel. Spa- expensive, very expensive. My massage was $215 for 90 minutes- more than double what I pay in the States, However, it was definitely the best massage I have had (and I have had many) so it was well worth it. What is a vacation without a little pampering?Nightlife- there wasn't any. The casino was open and busy each night, mostly with locals, not hotel goers. We won enough money to buy ice cream but nothing spectacular. There was no live music and the disco didn't open unitl midnight- by then we were too tired to mess with it. After dinner we just putzed around and usually had a drink at the marina bar and watched a movie in our room.Bottom line: the property was beautifully built into the mountain and the views were spectacular. The staff were friendly but not overly accomodating. They weren't rude but didn't wow us with good service. We didn't play golf but those who did commented that the course was great and the views again amazing. The funicular was fun and we enjoyed the mountain view so much that we are glad we didn't stay at the marina. The property is spread out, but not so much that is was hard to navigate. There weren't any good walking trails on the property so we resorted to the workout room which was fine- basic machines but all were new and in good shape. Food pricey but yummy. Same with the spa. The overall experience was average but not disappointing. We wouldn't go back, but are not upset that we spent our vacation there this year.Note: the water park was under construction and is set to open soon. if you are travelling with kids, this may be a real attraction to you, although it will really max the space available and service level. if you are travelling without kids, stay away from El Con. It is not a great adult getaway as is and with the waterpark addition, will most likely resemble Disney, especially if it is open to the locals.

<Content>Impressive on all Fronts! My husband and I stayed in Puerto Rico for 5 nights, and we stayed at this hotel as well as the InterContinental. The El Conquistador is about an hour's drive from the airport, which makes it feel like a tranquil getaway yet doesn't take 5 hours of driving to get to. Compared to Intercontinental, which is basically in the middle of a semi-sketchy area, this place was paradise. We stayed in the new tower that had just been renovated. It was super clean, modern, and chic, and had an incredible view of the ocean. The resort is a self contained unit, ideal for families or couples who want to get to their destination and then just relax, without the trouble of renting a car, etc. There are multiple restaurants and shops. The pools are beautiful and you can't possibly walk the grounds without being in absolute awe of the views. Everywhere you turn, beauty.The hotel has exclusive access to a small island, and you basically get an i.d. bracelet each morning, which allows you to take a boat (free) from the hotel to the island. Once you arrive, you'll find lawn chairs and water sport equipment rentals available at average prices. There's a small cafe with basic burger/salad options. There's a teeny tiny island (like 20 yards across!) that you can kayak to or swim, if you're so inclined. The snorkeling in this part of Puerto Rico is disappointing, if you're used to seeing lots of sea life when snorkeling other islands. There was lots of dead (maybe bleached) coral, and it was tough to determine if it was from hurricane damage or global warming. We chartered a sailboat (I recommend Erin Go Braugh) and they took us to some great places that were accessible by boat only. Still, it's no St. John!We had no problem with service. In fact, the woman at the front desk was an absolute gem. Very helpful.If you're looking for a place where you can relax by a pool, or have an adventurous day scouting a teeny tiny postcard-esque island, this is a place for you. It's also within driving distance of a lovely rain forest trail, so you aren't limited to staying at the resort. There's so much to do at this resort - I can imagine that this place is great for families with children.If we find ourselves in Puerto Rico again, we won't hesitate to stay here.

<Content>It will be nice when it is fully renovated, BUT... We booked a 5 day, last minute getaway to El Conquistador for Christmas at a great price, or so we thought. We knew a bunch of people who had stayed there and raved about everything except its location- about an hour away from San Juan airport. So we thought it was a safe bet. I even did my homework on trip advisor, and noticed that some people mentioned some renovations being done on grounds. So I called the hotel and asked about that. Two different people told me that everything was fully opened and the only thing being worked on was the Coqui Water park (due to open Dec 2007). So off we went. First thing I hear when we check in in the lobby? Drills! First thing I smell? Paint. Lovely. But not enough to ruin the trip. Our room was renovated and big and nice and clean (part of the 50% of the hotel rooms that were available as the rest of the rooms were in fact being worked on). The pools were pretty but 2 of them were closed for 3 out of the 5 days we were there. The restuarant on the beach? Closed. Virgin Burger (poolside food service?) Closed for 2 days. The worst part was that no one at the hotel had a good handle of what was going on. The front desk continued to tell us things were open when we were standing there and they were closed. The people taking reservations (we called to test them) told us the water park was complete and open! They did let people in on strict schedules the day we left, but there were still men gluing fake grass on the ground and I would say it was still only 89% done. (it will be good entertainment for kids when it is finished). The other part that disappointed us was that there was NO ONE there! Yes I know it should be nice to have a huge resort to yourself, but there is something creepy about being the ONLY people in a restaurant at 7:30pm! The positives: Easy to get seats at the beach/pool everyday, the service at restaurants and by housekeeping was very attentive. Maria the poolside server was great she brought me waters all day long (I am pregnant!) while another male server told us he was too busy when we asked him for something! The hotel did fill up a but more closer to Christmas, which made it feel more alive. The casino was fun but it is hardly the world class gambling mecca they claim it to be. So maybe we were just there at the wrong time. The bottom line is it is a pretty place, will be even nicer when it is complete, but don't trust what they tell you over the phone! It is a quick easy flight from NY, and it's remote and there is a lot to keep you busy if you don't want to make the drive to San Juan. Give it a shot but maybe wait till next winter!

<Content>Very Luxurious, but Pricey We stayed at El Conquistador for a wedding, so our experience may not be typical. The resort was quite luxurious, quite beyond what our family is accustomed to. We had a balcony room overlooking the Caribbean. The children loved the pools and the grounds. The resort has its own island that you can go to (about a 10-min. boat ride), which really felt exotic. The worst problem at the hotel was that the food at the resort was not included, and everything was quite expensive. There was a Starbucks inside the resort which was the most reasonably priced place there. There were NO water fountains anywhere in sight, forcing us to buy water bottles at $7 each. If you are in Fajardo and want really exceptionally good Puerto Rican food, go to El Pasion del Fogon. It's down the road from the resort.

<Content>stayed in the hotel and the Villas I took my family to the El conquistador last year. We went at the end of president's week in February, when many schools are closed in the Northeast. Since my little guy is too young for school, we went Thursday to Thursday. As a result, we were unable to get into the Villas until Saturday. So I can write about the experience of being in the El Conquistador as a hotel guest, and also as a guest in the Villas, which are attached. The hotel..a new wing was under construction, and the existing one's rooms were somewhat tired. We all came down with something like the Norwalk virus, so we were grateful that the staff happily brought us towels, new sheets, etc. in the middle of the night.So we didn't explore much at first...Then we moved to the Villas, and WOW are they great! A good kitchen, a nice living room, even made us sick-folk comfortable.Once we recovered, we began to explore. The boat ride to the island for beaching is quick, and lots of fun for my little guy. The island itself has natives: iguanas and chickens, along with the snack bars and rentals. Close by is the El Yunque rainforest, good hiking, even some tame enough for 3 year olds.We loved the Villas (although they aren't a bargain) and would go again, but avoiding President's week is my preference...

<Content>Beware of Bed Bugs! We arrived late our first night and went straight to bed. The next morning while on the beach at Palamino both my husband and I noticed we had small bites on our feet and ankles. We thought it was from sand flees. The next day we had a few more and that day we hadn't gone to the beach at all. It wasn't until the fourth day when I started welting up that I thought something was wrong. When we were at the airport another couple who was on the same trip mentioned that they had bites all over their bodies and they were having to take benadryl and they were sure it was BED BUGS!. By the time our plane landed I had welts all over my legs and arms. I went to my doctor right away and he also said that it was more than likely BED BUGS and that I was having an alergic reaction to the bites. When you wake up with bumps that you didn't have when you went to bed....it can only be one thing...BED BUGS.I would never go back to that resort and now I'll have difficulty staying anywhere until the mattress, linens and headboard have all been inspected.

<Content>Best trip ever What can I say, this was the nicest resort we have ever stayed at and the people where very friendly. The resturants where 5 star all the way. Room service was great and the drinks where fantastic. I highly recomend going to the Palamino Islands also and take in the Rain Forrest. Thank you El Conquitador for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Great Service I attended a conference at this hotel and they did a great job of handling almost 700 attendees. Ivette at the Front Desk really helped me out when the hotel was booked solid. The private island is very nice, and the boat service to it is fast (10-12 minutes) and on-time. I would definitiely recommend the El Con to friends. The only small downside is that the food is a bit expensive, but it's not out of line with full-service resorts of this type. Lastly, I brought my 8-month old daughter, and the staff was very friendly and kind ot her as well.

<Content>Very Nice I really enjoyed my stay at the El Conquistador. This was a great place to get away and relax. I ate at the Italian restaurant and the stingray cafe. Both were good. However the Japanese restaurant was the best. The sushi chef working that night was great! The local food and environment around the bend was quite a good experiance also.Overall the staff was courteous. However, upon one of my visits to the front desk I happened upon a young lady named Marilyn Lopez who I believe went out of her way to help me; she is a superstar for the resort! The landscape and scenery of this resort is beautiful and like no other. Overall everything was nice. Bring money because this is a real vacation spot. I will be back to the El Conquistador!

<Content>Spectacular Resort, but be prepared to pay This resort is truly spectacular, as it sits 300 ft above the water, which provides amazing views, particularly at sunrise. The grounds are a tropical paradise. The milti-tiered pools allow you to lay out with some degree of privacy.I enjoyed travelling down the inclinator to the marina and rooms at sea level. The seafood restaurant there is very good, and the outdoor bar is a lot of fun.What makes this resort really special is the private Palamino island serviced by large ferry boats. The water, beach and amenities are outstanding. Some may feel inconvenienced by the ferry trip, but I felt it just put you in the right mental attitude to go the beach. for those who just can't be unwired I got a good cell signal from the island.I had no problems with check-in, or any of the services during the trip. All staff were very friendly. The resort is somewhat remote, so--aside from a small village just down the road (walking distance...but did not eat/drink there) you're pretty much at the resort. That brings me to my one negative...that prices are very expensive for food and beverages (e.g. $17 hamburgers). I understand this is a resort, but just be preprared for the $$ when you go. One other note...there was room construction going on while I was there, but I felt it was not an inconvenience with regard to noise, construction activity, etc.

<Content>Operating at Half-Mast It's a beautiful property, but it's mostly under construction. Only one pool was working... (out of the seven promised on the website) The restaurants are great but very pricey (over $200 for dinner for two one night)... My room reservation was screwed up upon arrival--didn't get the room I was promised, but once I was moved into a renovated room, it was very nice... The private island is also nice, but takes a while to get to via ferry... The casino was working, but the bar was being built (and no cocktail waitresses)... The nightclub never opened... I wish I'd tried the spa--a friend did and said it was above average. Might be nice once it's up and running.

<Content>Extraordinary Resort And Service El Conquistador Resort  Golden Door SpaFajardo, Puerto RicoNovember 2007Without much fanfare or signage, one passes through a collection of multi-colored small homes when they get to the front gates of an oasis perched upon a 300 foot cliff. As you proceed pass through a lush, manicured golf course laced with fountains and palm trees, you are greeted by Felix, a Brooklyn transplant who warmly welcomes you to the resort. As you walk from your vehicle through an outdoor cavernous walkway, you are awestruck but it's beautiful tropical awnings/canopys as you peer at the blue Carribean waters that appear so inviting.Once inside, if you are as lucky as me, you will be greeted by Krysis, Magda or Marilyn. Initially, I was met by Krysis and her glowing smile. I can honestly say that the service I received upon my check-in with Krysis was unparrelled. She was charming and explained each and every one of the amenities at the resort, including but not limited to their private island, the transportation there with the resorts private transportation; the golf courses; shopping and dining venues and the casino. Krysis arranged for me to stay in an ocean front room with balcony was tropically decorated and elegant yet serene as I could see the crystal blue waters and skies. As I sat in total awe on my balcony, I observed small and large watercrafts dotting the waters and berthed at the resorts marina. I could also see the resorts private island, Palomino and in the foreground, the island that is home to Flamenco Beach. Flamenco Beach is reknowned and a must see which can be reached by a small 9 seat plane or by ferry. I took the 15 minute flight and it was spectacular as we flew over the sea and look at the various islands along the way.During the remainder of the stay, I was very fortunate in that I got to meet Tomas and Edwin at the concierge desk. They were the individuals that told me to visit Flamenco Beach and made all of the arrangements. They also told me to visit the Bio-illuminescent Bay and arranged for me to meet with Captain Suartez, the 14 seat boat owner who captained our boat through the mangroves in the dark of night only to reach this incredible phoshorous water. He invited us to jump in the water and swim. As each of the participants glowed, one could only think of how lucky they were to be at that place in that point of time. It was incredible!. Tomas and Edwin, when asked about off-site restaurants, immediately stated Pasions without hesitation. Krysis confirmed that Pasions was her favorite as well. I went there with high expectations that were exceeded by incomparable atmosphere and phenomenal food.Sadly, I had to leave earlier than expected to return to San Diego for a meeting I had forgotten. However, I will not forget the El Conquistador Resort and will make it a point to return, if for no other reason than Krysis, Magda, Marily, Felix, Tomas and Edwin.

<Content>The El Conquistador Rocks! Took a friend of mine to Puerto Rico to celebrate her 40th birthday. She had been to El Conquistador, before, and loved it. Little did I know that I would fall in love with it, too!We were met by a limo, which took us to the property (about an hour east of the San Juan Airport). We were met by our concierge, Angie, who had also arranged all our special needs for our trip--two connected rooms, special birthday surprises, dining reservations, and spa appointments.From the touchdown to takeoff, we were treated with warmth and superior service. The spa staff--especially Frenchie at the front desk and Betsy, our masseuse--were extremely courteous and accommodating, especially when we had to quickly reschedule some appointments/treatments due to other activities (tennis, tanning, and sleeping in too late!).Although the resort is out of the way--something I prefer, actually--it's well worth the trip, the expense, and the wait. (At peak times, it's hard to get into this exquisite resort.)When (not if) you go, please say hello to Angie and Betsy for me!PNew York, New York

<Content>Great Vacations This is by far the best place me and my family have ever stayed before. The environment is awesome, as well as facilities, and recreational areas. The island of Palominos was a never (ever) had experience. Staff was very courdious, and they always made the environment great for every member of the family.

<Content>really good and bad... We stayed at the El Conquistador the first week in October. First what was good: It's BEAUTIFUL!!!!! Really stunning! The views are amazing, the private island was heaven, the casino was fun, and you can rent a car from the hotel, which was convenient.What's bad: one word: construction!!!! We had to change rooms, only to end up in ANOTHER room with construction right next door (which was unbearably LOUD!) The hotel was probably sick of complaints and they weren't very sympathetic about it. Also, the food was average, at best, and really, really expensive.Having said this, when the costruction ends this place will be amazing (unless your a foodie!)I would go back - the beauty of the place outweighed all else.

<Content>Beautiful views, but at a cost! Got a great deal through hotwire.com on this place - nice deluxe room, which was comfortable and impressive - equally impressive was the 2 inch roach inside the hotel guide which rather shattered the first impression of luxury. Again, beautiful views from the room but everything is very expensive - breakfast $25 per person per day, internet and parking, similar fees. The private island is a novelty, but by the time you ride the tram down to the dock and the boat to the island, the novelty wears off. Bottom line - glad we went there, glad to have seen the views, glad we had a rental car to escape to town where we could afford to eat, glad we only stayed a couple of days.

<Content>Convention Attendee First, understand that I was atttending a convention, I looked at the pools but never took a dip, rode the water taxi but never touched the sand on the private island, walked the Casino but never lost a cent and admired the golf course but never made a putt.Second the resort is now called the El Conquistador Golf Resort and Casino.The negatives. The water level got to be about a foot deep in the tub while I showered, good thing I was rooming alone because it took a couple of hours for it to drain. I checked with the guest in the room below me and he indicated that his drain worked just fine. I called engineering about 4 times for assistance, I am pretty sure that help did not arrrive for about 8 hours, and though his intensions were good the results were poor, water still pooled in the tub. Next, I requested a wake up call for 7:00 am on the day of departure that I am still waiting for. On my last day I figured I could squeeze in a fast trip to the private island for a swim. I was on the water taxi that departs at 9:00 am only to find out that the chef was running late and we departed at about 9:30, well there went my swim. The boat could have left, went to the island, dropped off the vacationers and returnded by 9:30, why we waited I will never know. The television did not have a signal at first, but that was corrected quickly and I never turned it on again. The bar at the marina was out of local beer?The positives. The front desk clerk, Nilmari, had a smile when I checked-in and a smile when I departed. She was polite, courteous and made me feel welcomed. The room located in a two story building surrounding the marina at the bottom of the funicular was clean, comfortable and airy. The bed was quite comfortable and the linens fresh. The bathroom was spotless, spacious and the vent worked. No musty smell, no mold and no insects (If only the drain worked)! There was a small deli by the funicular at the top of the hill, not many selections but lunch and snacks were fresh and the prices were reasonable. I did not have a chance to eat at any of the hotel restaurants, however there was a spot about a mile outside the main gate heading to the left, Pasion Por El Fogon that is worth going to.Would I stay here again? Yes, the overall experience was good.

<Content>No!! Stay away. Half the hotel is under renovation, the other half is totally dysfunctional. The nicer rooms are at the bottom of a very steep hill, at the marina, but to reach it you need to take a cable car up and down. Given the shoddy desk service, lack of in-room amenities, failed wireless internet access, bad food, horrible bellhop service, and other disappointments, there's no reason to think one should have confidence in the cable car (which in fact went on the blink when we were there).

<Content>Worst Vacation Resort Ever I do not recommend anyone staying there. Everything on the whole resort is extremely over priced. And at one point we came back to our room from dinner to find a Hotel Bell Hop rumaging through out suitcase. I got stuck in two of their elevators , neither of their two hot tubs were working. We had a camera stolen by housekeeping. I could go on and on. This resort ruined our vacation and I suggest if you are thinking about staying there dont find somewhere else.

<Content>We loved El Conquistador We found the hotel to be absolutely wonderful... landscaping was incredible - as was the water taxi ride to the private island. There you'll find a beautiful, secluded beach. The staff was attentive and helpful, our guestroom was wondeful, the entire experience was great.Highly recommend.

<Content>Amazing Views!!! i was afraid to stay at this hotel after reading some of the reviews, but i am so very happy to say that we has a great time, the views from the resort are just some of the best i have seen. the view from the infinity pool is just so awsome and the way the pool is built on the side of the hill ,it really looks as if you will just slide off the side. we were very lucky we got a newly renovated room and a partial ocean view, we were offered an ocean view but is is not as private and quite, because they are renovating down the hill it is not to noisy but we really wanted the most private spot that would still offer a great partial view of the ocean if you can , ask to stay at the las brisas partial ocean view in one of the renovated rooms. the new rooms have an ipod dock so it was great because both my daughters were able to charge thier ipods and listen to thier music. there is also a small fridge in the bathroom. i really liked that the new rooms have plenty of drawer space it made it very easy for us to unpack and not have to share a drawer there were four of us my husband and my two teenage daughters. we usally stay at an embassy or a condo, but i really did not want to cook and i always wanted to stay at this resort. i have been coming to puerto rico for the past 8 years and i have to say that i love this place the best!!there is renovation going on in the hotel but it did not affect us in anyway, just if you look around the property you will see people working in some of the areas away from las brisas wing, and the main pool area. i am so glad that the new owners are renovating this property it is located in such an amazing spot that it is really worth staying here. the cons about this property is that the food is expensive, but we always rent a car when we are in puerto rico, and we where able to eat at the many many places within five to ten minutes away. we even went to walmart which is five minutes away and brought snacks, yogurts, parmalat milk and were able to have food when ever we wanted. there was no coffee pot in the room , so we purchased a $8.00 4 cup coffee maker at walmart along with $2.00 bag of puerto rican cofffee and my husband and i would enjoy our coffee everymorning on the balcony. if you are going to stay here i would really suggest a rental car, because there is so much to do around this area and we drove to old san juan using the new route 66 which really does cut down on the traffic. we stayed here for 9 days and the service was great, it does get busy at the resort on friday and saturday because they hold thier local conventions thier on the weekends, but the resort is so large that you can find a great spot no matter where you are. the front desk staff was great, roberto, iyveannet, ivette, and the best waitress was minex. the boat to the private beach is new and a quick 10 minute ride to the private island.. i loved the island, we had water shoes so we where able to walk far out and enjoy. also there are two spots where they have chairs, one right at the dock and one around the bend from there. we rented the jet skis, for $70. for half an hour but since we did that on a tuesday there was no one else renting them so we where out for forty five minutes! you can pull your chair into the water and lay on you chair in the water that was so relaxing. i loved it. my favorite spot on the resort hands down was the infinity pool over by las casitas, it is a five minute walk thru the pool areas over to las casitas or you can ask for a ride from the golf cart at the bell station. the view and peace and quiet from this spot was the best i have seen by far. i have been to alot of infinity pools and the negative edge on this one was the best. when you first get in this pool you dont see the edge it is so cool. you really have to get close to finally see the edge. i cant wait to be able to go back and stay again.any questions please email me.

<Content>Experienced Traveler Review When reading the reviews for the El Con, it can be kind of scary, even taking into account the knowledge that most people writing reviews are doing it because they had a bad experience.As someone who travels quite a bit for business and pleasure, I was leary of the El Con because of some of the bad reviews, yet the dramatic 'loved it' or 'hated it' was confusing. I needed a quick trip without a passport, so I gave it a shot.The resort itself is beautiful and kept immaculate. Everything I saw there was very well maintained. It was a busy weekend and the main hotel was booked so we were moved to Las Casitas. If you have kids, stay at the main hotel, more activities for kids. If you want peace and quite and can spend a few extra bucks, I highly recommend staying at Las Casitas. It is only a minute or two walk between the main hotel and Las Casitas.The staff was exceptionally friendly and very eager to please. Palamino island is incredible. Rent some snorkelling gear and swim to the little island, quite impressive fish and sea life.The hotel casino is very small, if you are a gambler, you are a long way from Vegas. Two blackjack tables, 1 poker table, 1 roulette wheel, 1 craps table, 1 Carribean Stud table, that's it for table games. Only 4 video poker machines. Save your gambling $$ for Vegas, rent a snorkel and enjoy the beautiful fish on Palamino.The things I would agree with most reviews on is the prices on food and billing issues. The resort is in an area where you probably won't want to leave the resort, so you are left only with the resort restaraunts. I went expecting resort prices, maybe 20% over NYC or Vegas, but it was considerably higher. Dinner for 2 in the Italian restaraunt was over $100, with simply one app and 2 entrees (add the $65 bottle of wine that would go for maybe $30 in an NYC restaraunt, grand total of over $185). Breakfast at Las Casitas cafe was usually around $50. (French Toast - 17, omlette 19, plus drinks). Breakfast buffet at Las Brisas rest is good, but at $25 per person, can be pricey for just breakfast. The food and service were exceptional in every restaraunt, but if you are staying for more than a day or two it can start to get expensive.Several reviews complianed about the El Con billing. I am dealing with this right now. Be sure to check your bill carefully and make sure everything is correct and you are paying for the correct account. It wasn't the fault of the desk person, it seems they have a lousy system. Thus far they have been very helpful in resolving the issue.I would definitely stay at the El Con again and recommend it. I would suggest staying at Las Casitas, and if you can, get a casita with a kitchen and hit at one of the grocery stores close by. If you can have a couple of meals in your casita, you'll be able to make up the difference in price on the room vs eating every meal in the restaraunts. If you stay at Las Casitas, rent a car at the airport, it's cheaper than the El Con shuttle, parking at Las Casitas is free, and you can run out to the store to save a few bucks. Parking at the El Con is 15-20 a day.Go for the beautiful beach and sea life on Palamino, super friendly people, and well kept resort. Plan ahead for extra food budget and make sure you check your bill when before you pay when checking out.

<Content>paradise gone bad We have recently came back to what we hoped,a great 15 year anniversary trip. This place came highly reconmend to us by people who have traveled extensively and who I trust. The hotelis renoun for its service our so we thought. I booked through the casino at the resort because me and my wife like to gamble a little. The casnio is small but with a cosy personailty. Here is where the nightmare began on our anniversary night we had a great dinner at the strip house with is a premire steak house the food was excellent and service was above average. We decided to go to the casino around 11.30 p.m. for texas holdem limt play . My wife gracelessly asked if I would like to take the only empty seat at the one table they had. I sat down while she put her name on the waiting list for the next seat several others that came in after us also put there name on the waiting list. About 35 minutes went by, be for there was a open seat at the table, a gentleman who had just arrived at the casino took a seat my wife informed the dealer that she had been waiting for the seat for 35 minutes and her name was next on the list. The dealer continued to ignore her and continued to allow the gentleman who afford to give the seat up since there was a waiting list the dealer informed my wife that he would have the seat since he is a man and she could wait. Sexual Discrimanation at its worst she in formed the pit bose who also ignoed her and then procedded to ask for the casnio manager who also gave her lip service wanting to voice my opionin in the mattter but not wanting to trump my wife handling of this matter I continued to be a spectator, after the situation continued with not the slightest apology or resolution ,she told me she was going up stairs to pack and that we checking out after that, but for me to continue my game till then. They had numerous opportunities to apologize to her but they never did . They did offer us dinner on them witch we refused. This casnio is poorly ran with the dealers not knowning the rules and pit boses who are not capable of making sound judgements as to the gaming rules , not all the dealers and pit boses, but most are poorly trained . When my wife came down to say she was ready to check out at 3.00am, I gatherd my chips and in the hast to leave took my cards that we in play at the table with my chips. They offerd me a 3 night comp Till this day I have never recieved our room comp that they said should make up for the blatent sexual discrimination that presist in the el conquistador resorts casino . .So women beware sexual discrimination is alive and well in that resort. It truely could be one of the premire resorts in the caribbean, It is a shame the management will not step up and address this issue, as any competent resort would. They will never make that 5 star if this is not changed .

<Content>Great Resort I can tell they are making major improvements I have to say that I too was a little concerned after having read the many previous reviews.To the best of my knowledge many of the rooms have been completely renovated. A previous review had suggested the Las Brisas section of the resort. I asked for this section and in fact the room was completely renovated. The flooring, furniture and bedding were if brand new. The ocean view from this section was incredible. The room was spotlessly clean.The balcony is great for having breakfast in the AM.The bathrooms are oversized with a separate room off the bathwhich is similar to a walk in closet. I also found the hallway corridors to have fresh paint and new carpeting.Since I am not a big breakfast person, I was fine with havinga hot ham and cheese croissant ($3.75) or a large pastry for( $2)from David's Cookies. They also had cereal for ($2).I did notice at Cafe Caribe a breakfast special for ($8.95) which included coffee or pancakes for ($6.95).We ate twice at Cafe Bella Vista which is the outdoor restaurant near the pool. As mentioned in many previous blogs the pizza is more than enough for two with prices ($17 - $20) and excellant.Two people ordering a non alcholic beverage could dine if splitting a pizza for $30 including tip total for two.A burger and fries at Cafe Caribe was ($11).The portion sizes seemed quite large. With the recent improvements to this resort I would rate it as a four star. I found the service to be excellant from the front desk,housekeeping and the wait staff at the restaurants.Previous blogs had mentioned that a mandatory tip was includedwhen dining and the cash was not accepted. The five times that I dined in the resort the tip was at my discretion and cash or credit card was an option.I found the beds very comfortable and the entire resort well kept.A previous blog had mentioned a wait for the funicular down to the water. There are two and one was being repaired but I found the wait to be only a few minutes.My advise is to ask for a Las Brisas section room or at besta renovated room. When I walked into the room my response was wow ,it was just like the pic on the El Con Web site. The only room renovations that I saw still going on were near the marina. In the Caribbean prices are higher than in most of the US. There are dining options for all budgets at this resort.Food costs are lower if staying in San Juan but there are not really any walkable dining options that I found due to the size of the property and its secluded location. I have to say with the ocean view dining it was personally worth it to me to pay a couple dollars extra per person per meal. I did not dine at the fine dining options requiring other than casual attire.If you are renting a car, you will pass a Walgreens and Walmart enroute to the resort.if you wish to stock up on snacks and drinks. The refrigerator inthe room is not stocked and it actually kept the drinks cold.My experience with reviews is that half are good and half not so good. I work for American Express in the travel biz and would never want to have a resort ruin my vacation or a clients for that matter. It is great that Luxury Resorts bought this property and is putting money into it to make it a four star resort again.I would love to return to the El Con.

<Content>Awesome place We recently stayed at the Conquistador during the first week of July. My wife and 2 teenagers as well as myself were really impressed with the faciltiy and staff. The highlight of our trip was definitely Palomino Island. Great snorkeling, friendly service on the island and just a great time. As part of our trip to Puerto Rico, we wanted to travel the island, therfore we rented a car. Only one complaint I have was the hotel's parking facility. Finding a parking spot was an adventure, and when you have a problem at the parking lot, no one can help you. When we went to the hotel and spoke the parking people about our situation, they could care less., ,Later we found out that the parking is owned or operated by a third party.Despite the parking fiasco the rest of our stay was remarkable and we plan on returning. (Hopefully parking situation will be resolved by then)

<Content>Will not return If you are disabled, or have difficulty walking. DO NOT STAY HERE! Everything is incredibly far, even rooms to the elevator. The hotel is like an L shape. The elevator to the lower pool area is at the end of the L shape, if you have difficulty walking--no pool for you! There are NO Handicapped rooms with two double beds. There are no courtesy wheel chairs, they rent for $25 a day. Frankly, there was no courtesy anythig! Be prepared to pay for everything.DO NOT be fooled by the pretty recently removated rooms on the web site, these do not exist, at least at the normal people rate. One of our rooms was missing a lamp FROM THE WALL over the bed, the bathrooms were big, but kind of grimmy from aging. The mattreses were awful, you could hear the springs every time you turned.The only really nice thing was the ferry to Palominos island. The boats are new and the crew very courtious and nice. Be aware that they do not let you bring even a water bottle on board. This is because once you are captive at Palominos they nail you for everything. The water sports come at a high price also. In short, although the hotel grounds are neatly maintained and the view is spectacular, the accomodations, amenities and services are poor.Another terrible thing was the uncooperative, and unfriendliness of the folks at th front desk. They made little effort to accomodate or help resolve a situation. I stayed there this one time, but will not return. If they sell themselves as a luxury hotel, they should deliver what they sell.I also stayesd at Parador Villa Parguera and when compared, I will return to La Parguera, but not to El Conquistador.

<Content>Wow!!! Well, I was a little afraid of some of the reviews about the El Con, but the pics were so nice, I just decided to think positive and hope for the best. I was definitely pleased with the property of the hotel. The buildings and landscaping were AWESOME. The resort is extremely large, and there are different sections, so I can speak for them all. I think we were in the Las Brisas section, which had ocean views. The rooms were clean and up to date, so I'm not sure what some of the reviewers mean by outdated and dirty. The beds were a little hard, i have to admit, and my husband and I think we have been bitten by bedbugs, but it could possibly be mosquitos. Overall, the resort is beautiful. There is the private beach which is a short ferry ride away. The one complaint I have about that is the cable car that goes to the marina. There are supposed to be 2, but only one was working, so the wait was a little inconvenient. So besides the beds and the cable cars, I give the resort itself an A+On the negative side, we felt that they tried to squeeze as much money as possible out of us. It was ridiculous. Internet service was 15.00 a day! Not 15 bucks for the duration of the stay, which still would have been a lot, but each 24 hr period, was $15. Ridiculous. There was a bakery/internet cafe, that had only 2 computers, which for the size of the resort was clearly insufficient.The restaurants were ridiculously overpriced, a single scoop ice cream cone was $5. A hamburger was $13. The bottled water in our room was $7. Come on. We didnt eat a single thing at the resort. We also rented a car for our stay and the parking was $15-20 per day.The front desk was kind enough to tell us to use our cell phones because the phone usage was like 9 dollars a minute. It was a great place to stay, I would stay again, but I would remain mindful of what I was willing to spend. The grounds and private beach were superior, but I think we made out well and beat the crowd by coming days after hurricane dean.

<Content>Not the same I recently stayed at the Las Casitas in the El Conquistador during the tail end of my honeymoon. We came off a beautiful cruise to the Southern Caribbean with Royal Caribbean and thought what better time to visit the beautiful El Conquistador. I had stayed here approximately 3 years ago and loved the entire experience. This experience, however, left much to be desired.I booked a 1 bedroom villa in the Las Casitas. When we arrived, the room had not been cleaned. The refuse laid on the front landing. Additionally, we paid $500.00 for a oceanview. For one to see the ocean you must go out on the front landing and look around the palm trees. We made the best of the stay becase of our prior experience; that was until we went to dinner. Being from NY, we are accostumed to higher prices, however, this was insulting. The restaurants were mediocre at best. During our previous stay, we were entitled to a complimentary breakfast at the Las Casitas. When we awoke, we did not see the same continental breakfast. We asked the wait staff and were told: there is new management, no more breakfast. We visited the concierge and were informed that the information given by the waitstaff was correct; the new management eliminated the breakfast. Subsequently, I had the $18.00 Golden Spa egg white omelet. We complained to the concierge about the messy, outdated villa. As a result, they moved our room, but informed us that he could not assist us further. He promised to send a bellboy to assist us with our luggage. Unfortunately, he forgot. I called and voiced my frustration. A bellboy arrived and brought us to a new room. The room was better, but not worth the rate. We became so frustrated that we contacted the airline and cut our visit short. The airline informed us that it would cost an additional $200.00 per person. It was worth salvaging our wonderful honeymoon experience. When we called the concierge, they did not seem surprised.Overall, the resort has beautiful property, but the El Conquistador seemed to be open to the public as a day resort which made for crowded pools and a not so luxorious Las Casitas. It was very disappointing because we loved it so much on our previous visit. I was relieved that when we boarded the shuttle bus to the airport an older couple echoed the same sentiments about this disappointing visit. Additionally, they informed us that they paid $280.00 per night for the same room. I would not recommend this resort to anybody in the future. It is unfortunate because the property is beautiful, but definitely not worth the money for the food alone.

<Content>wouldnevergoagain I had the pleasure of experiencing Puerto Rico for the first time in my life and stayed @ the el conquistador. The first night I was sleeping and had my ceiling leaking water over the bed 3:00 am morning called the front desk they did not respond until the next day when I had to go to the concirege and complian, none of the refrigerators in my room worked, the lighting fixtures was coming apart, Take atlest 5,000 in cashif you plan on staying there the charge for a bottle of Fiji water in the room was $7.00.when I arrived home they charged my card $400.00 for security fees and told me that I would recieve the money in about 10 days. I was never told about the $400.00 security fee upon checking out of that overdressed dump. Yeah the grounds are kept nice but the rooms could use a makeover. I will go back to PR just at another resort I would not recomend this resort to know one.

<Content>Dated and Faded - NOT a 5 Star! I am sure at some point this place was a beauty, but is was very dated and tired. I came with my husband and two step-kids - 12 and 13 -so not looking for super luxury. The prices were heavily discounted for this time of year - $159/night for a garden room (we took two rooms ) - but at full price, this place would be a disappointing. Full disclosure-when I travel only with my husband in the Caribbean, we tend to stay in what I consider lovely places-Jamaica Inn and Biras Creek are two of the last places - so I wasn鈥檛 expecting their level of comfort and service. But an $18 pizza (see below)? We were in the unrenovated section and had a Garden Room with great views of the golf course and countryside from the 2nd floor. The room was very large but the bathroom, although huge, was dated as was the decor.There is a private island for sole use by the guests. The island was a cool concept with a ferry getting you there in less than ten minutes, but the place is CRAMMED with chairs, cans of drinks laying by chairs by day's end (perhaps brought in by people who were not suppose to bring their own food?!?!) and a restaurant with marginal, overpriced food. The main issues - Overall Decor-Paint peeling everywhere, chairs by the pool are old with caked on dirt and need to be replaced - the whole place looks like it is hanging on by a thread. They are doing many renovations so hopefully in a year or two, they will be back up to speed. Restaurants-OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced with very average food. The one exception was The Strip House which was expensive but very good food, presentation and service with a decent wine list.Internet Access -The internet service was down the whole time we were there (we needed to get on for work). We left our laptops at home since we were told we could access the internet for a fee. For a hotel this large not to have internet access in this day and age is nuts. They let us use the computers in their back offices but this was very inconvenient.Check In-They have a check -in time of 4pm and they were still an hour late - so 5pm check-in and the hotel was empty (according to the guy checking us in!).Kids just need a pool and a beach so they had fun but I would not recommend this place for a couple - too many kids and no intimacy.I wish I had better things to write but I wanted to give an honest opinion. The Management, who tried to help us with the internet issue, were very nice but seemed overwhelmed.

<Content>3 star hotel on a 5 star piece of real estate The El Con is a 3 star hotel located on a 5 star piece of property with 2 star guests. We stayed one week from July 31st and got a great deal on Hotwire so I cannot complain about the room rate. Then we were upgraded to a beautiful oceanfront room with a terrace or balcony that was at least 12 feet by 13 feet and had breathtaking and ever changing views. The room had not yet been updated but we found it very clean and appreciated the DVD player, coffee pot (with free coffee) and mini fridge. The safe was big enough to hold a laptop plus other items. There were no robes and no turn down service than one comes to expect in most 4 star hotels. Contrary to many of the reviews we did not find anything missing from our room, all staff were always nice, polite and friendly and the two small complaints we had were corrected by maintenance within half an hour. We found our bill to be correct but had saved all receipts as a precaution.Fortunately and based on information we had read in previous reviews we rented a car at the airport for the duration of the trip. We used the self parking which cost $15.00 plus tax per day but was well worth it as it allowed us to do all our sightseeing and exploring on our own along with many outings for meals. We bought our own breakfast supplies and ate on our terrace each morning. We even went to town to the blockbuster and rented movies.The private island is spectacular and some of the food is cheaper there than at the hotel, a fact which made no sense to us. Jet skis $110 per hour, double kayaks $38.00 per hour. Mask and fins and snorkel $15.00 just to give you a reference for rental rates. They also had sailboats, horseback riding and a sort of mini-put. The snorkelling was great about 200 ft off shore but we had to laugh as most guests stayed within 30 or 40 feet where there was absolutely nothing to see but the odd stray fish. The ferry could use a schedule and the funicular must become a huge problem when the hotel is full but was fine during our stay. We found two major problems for us at this hotel. The first, being the cost of everything. The cheapest bottle of wine on any menu is $40 but once you add tax and tip you are closer to $50. A hotdog and fries is $10 of course you still have tax and tip. Beer is $6 and drinks range from $8 to $14, again you must add tax and tip. Everybody we spoke to at the hotel felt it was pushed over the top and most were consuming all kinds food and drink in their rooms to avoid the excessive charges. We enjoyed a meal in the Chinese restaurant $60.00 for 2 with no drinks and the Italian at $75.00 for 2 with no drinks or wine. Both restaurants gave us excellent service and above average food. We also shared a pizza one night by the pool which came to $22 and was really good.The second problem was the other clients, the hotel was overrun with huge noisy families that had little or no concern in displaying the respect that a resort of this calibre should deserve. One previous reviewer referred to them as 鈥渄ay-trippers鈥?but in fact most of them are staying at the hotel using a special non-advertised Puerto Rican off season rate. We witnessed guest behaviour that you might expect at a Super 8 motel but not at an upscale resort. Guests often stayed in the pools with lots of hollering, horsing around and screaming and crying till past midnight. Because off the cheap room rate we were paying it was easy for us to overlook these issues. If I was paying top dollar I would have been really disappointed in my stay. The best tip I also found in one of these reviews was to leave the hotel on foot by walking past the gate at the marina. Within 5 minutes you will come to a small fishing village with many little bars and restaurants. The road is well lit so even if you come back late it felt reasonably safe. Local beer was $1.50 and although we didn鈥檛 eat, some of the plates we saw go by looked pretty good. This is also where the trips to the Bio bay leave from. You can book directly from one of the operators here.I would stay here again if the rate was good but only with a car. We spoke with one large family that called it Alkatraz because they felt so trapped and ripped off. Thanks to all those that posted before we had a great trip and were able to enjoy this hotel without a huge bill.Lastly, the internet cafe was broken during the entire week we were there. I got the impression it hadn't worked in a while.

<Content>Beautiful hotel This hotel was absolutely beautiful. The lobby, the rooms, and the grounds were just stunning. I can't imagine a more beautiful property. The staff was all quite pleasant and helpful. The steakhouse had one of the most tender and yummy steaks i have ever eaten - and the japanese hibachi restaurant was also amazing.The problem with this hotel is its location. About 45 minutes outside of SanJuan, and not really near anything else. The restaurants are pretty pricey, but you're not near ANYTHING else to even go to.

<Content>Wonderful views, don't forget your sunscreen! This is a really great property with nice pools and an amazing private island (really one of the prettiest places I have ever seen) but I say don't forget the sunscreen because if you do, it's gonna cost you. $20 to be exact. Yep, if you forget anything while you are staying here you better be prepared to pay dearly for it. Oh, and if you want to eat, you better be willing to pay up, big time. I am no cheapie, but $16 for a burger was a little high and almost $20 for two well drinks was a bit over the top! I loved this place, but make sure you bring LOTS of extra cash for food, drinks, parking etc. and try not to leave any essentials at home because they charge a ton for little stuff. We had a great view from our room, STAY OCEANFRONT!! It is such a great thing to wake up to! We took our two kids and they loved it, especially the awesome pools. I am glad we stayed here, but really wish there were some sort of affordable food options, there just isn't quite yet.

<Content>Be warned do not stay in this hotel My wife and I looked into this hotel for our weeding. Everything seems perfect when we spoke to the hotel people and looked at the website. We set up the weeding via email and telephone. When we arrive to the hotel it took almost 2 hours to get us checked in our room. After that delay we went to check out the hotel and it was a little dirty. We said well we are here already might as well make the best of it. Next problem arose the hotel is in a mountain and due to this they charge ridiculous prices for their food and amenities, and I mean over priced. If you want to go out of the resort to eat which you can eat great food and affordable prices you have to either walk like miles or you can get a cab which will cost you about $40 dollars just to get down the mountain. Then same amount to get back. So of course we had to stay in the complex. So I decided I wanted to rent a car so that I can go out of the complex but wait if you rent a car you have to pay about 30.00 per day unless you rent the car through the hotel. ok so finally we give the final numbers of people coming to the wedding we told them 48 people plus 2 dj and 2 photographers. The photographers and djs would eat hamburgers and a drink for about 25 each. so here is the kicker on the contract they put 52 people total which was correct as per our count. 48 people invited and 4 workers at a discount price. When the weeding was over at the end of the night when we are drinking and having a great time they gave us the contract and it said 52 total people attended. So we signed it. Cool, our cards were charged we closed out and we were gone. Until about July 07 when they charged an additional 936.00 dollars. So I called the hotel and asked why the charge well they said we signed the contract for 52 people I said correct. 48 people plus the 4 workers. They told me that the reason was that they forgot to add the 4 plates at 234.00 each. I was like what; those people are part of the job which was supposed to be charged at the quoted price of 25.00 each as per our emails. Even with our email backup they refused to give us our money back. They said that we signed the contract for 52 and that charges were correct. This was completely done on purpose as they didn鈥檛 break down the amount of people so after that fact they can come back and charge an extra 936.00. I have to say also that security was really bad there things were missing and in the own complex cars were left without tires all 4 tires. I just want to let people know to be very careful when booking with this hotel and check the taxes and all other hidden fees that they have. Outrages. Also if you have to buy souvenirs best to buy at the airport if not you will get ripped off. The food in the hotel in no way real Spanish Puerto Rican food. So if you are going to the hotel and expect real Spanish food forget it and I know I am Puerto Rican and lived most of my life there. Well good luck to all. So much more happened but not enough space I could write a book on the whole process.RgdsEric

<Content>Worldclass Hotel Nice rooms, incredible views. Absolutely stunning property with private island and all amenities to match. This place is a city onto itself. Food is somewhat lackluster.I recommend taking a trip to the biolumiscent bay and perhaps taking a drive down the easter coast of Puerto Rico to Humacao.

<Content>Lock Up Your Belongings!! The resort is beautiful, if a little pricey. They do have a HUGE security problem at the Casitas. When the casitas are being cleaned, they open several units at once and leave them unattended for long periods of time. Someone got into our room as it was left open while we were at the private island beach, went through myn luggage, and took a digital camera, its chargers and an ipod and its chargers. Lickily my wife had locked everything else valuable in the room safe. The resort management was not really responsive to my complaints, and I had to eventually go and demand to see the manager on duty and the security manager, both who basically told me that they were looking into the theft, but they never returned my calls and we left without any action or answers from the hotel. Overall the hotel was nice, service at the restaurants was good, food ranged from bad to pretty good( the stip house was the best). The private island beach is nice, and the food there was some of the better we had. I would go to Puerto Rico again.. but I would not really want to go back to this resort. I think there are better places to stay.

<Content>So, so disappointed First the positive, because there is not much of it...the setting is beautiful and the grounds are nicely laid out. The room was nice. It was clean. But beyond that....don't go here. The staff was at best apathetic and at worse downright rude and unhelpful. We were often told conflicting information. There is a dress code suggestion that is a joke as the resort is overrun with what seems to be daytrippers. Late at night entire families are hanging out in the lobby with their feet up on the tables, dressed in cuts off and scrimpy shirts. That would be fine if the hotel did not try to present itself as an exclusive type resort with standards. The food was passable, but nothing to write home about.....The spa, again surprising was filled with unhelpful staff and limited supplies in locker rooms. It was such a disappointment.

<Content>Missing $150 shoes!! reward if found My recent stay at El conquistador was pleasant... However......... Right after we left, i realized i left a pair of brand new bcbG stilletos in the room ... I called immediatly and spoke to a woman in housekeeping who promised to return my call in 20 minutes. 4 hours later i call again, speak to housekeeping, and laura promises to call me right back.. The very next day I call and guess what?? They say they will call me back. .. Needless to say I never got a call back !!!! I think it's a pretty [-] thing to do , To me that is like stealing from a guest... Isn't all the money we spent enough???

<Content>A little late posting this, but had to disagree with most.... I have traveled and stayed all over the world and this resort, by far, had the best views, staff and overall appearance of any I'd ever been in. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and were not in the least dissappointed during our four days. The resort is out of the way which was a plus, but with that you get the higher priced restaurants and shops. It costs us a pretty penny to get to Old San Juan, but it would have cost us more if Mercedes, front desk cleark, hadn't worked with us. We're looking forward to going back because four days weren't enough to enjoy the entire resort...it's huge!!! Food was outstanding, especially at the marina.Only draw back...too many cats!GWW

<Content>Sewage backed up in the shower - bad management We went down for a wedding for 3 nights.We had a dead animal smell in our first room.The shower backed up sewage (while my wife was getting ready for the wedding) in our second room.The management was reluctant to do anything to make the situation right. Puerto Rico is beautiful. El Conquistador needs new management.Stay somewhere else.

<Content>Should have stayed somewhere else! We stayed (4 people, two separate rooms) at the El Con July 8th - 11th on a business trip. We had one ocean view room and one garden view room. The garden view room was on the 6th floor and had, in my opinion, a pretty darn good view of the ocean. For the money, it may not be worth the upgrade to an ocean view room if you can manage to get a garden view room on a top floor. My girlfriend and I were in the ocean room. The first one they put us in was right next to an elevator, so we requested a change. The second room they put us in was right next to the funicular railway, which, by the way, runs all night! You'd think that if you request to be moved due to noise in the first place, that they wouldn't put you right next to something else that's equally as annoying. That room was also next to a family with who knows how many kids whose primary goal in life was to slam doors and yell loudly. We requested another move and were put on the other side of that particular wing in another ocean view room. This time, we weren't near anything noisy, and this room's view far exceeded that of the first two. Clearly, the rooms here aren't created equally. Speak up and get a nice one! The bed in the ocean view room was really comfortable, but forget about the L shaped vinyl couch. Whoever came up with that idea should be fired. Overall we found the staff very pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. We tried to sign up for a couple of the tours, but unless the hotel has enough people signed up, they won't run them, which was disappointing. Luckily, we decided to rent a car for a day and go out on our own. The rentals are cheap (there's an enterprise desk right next to the concierge), and this was the best decision we could have made. A car offers infinitely more freedom on this island (I didn't see any public trans), and since this hotel is literally on top of a huge hill and far away from San Juan, it's the only way to escape - for example - to eat somewhere local and reasonably priced (try El Pasion if you're looking for a good nearby restaurant). With four people, we spent nearly half as much on the car/gas as we would have doing the hotel's tours. We also saw double the amount of attractions. The most annoying thing about this place is that the beach is on an island and you have to take a boat out there to get to it. We didn't even bother doing this due to our schedule. The last boat out there leaves at 3 PM and the last boat back to the hotel leaves at 5 PM. At other hotels we visited during our business meeting, a beach was no more than a 2 minute walk from the hotel lobby (e.g. Rio Mar Hotel near El Yunque rainforest - as an aside, we swam at the beach here around 4 PM and it was amazing). At El Con, I guess you are just out of luck if you want to have a beer on the sand after 5 PM! The pools are open 24 hours, though, but during the day were crowded to the point where I wouldn't even really consider using them. I wondered if half the people using them were even staying at the resort.The Sting Ray Cafe offered delicious fine dining for around $50 a person not including drinks. The other restaurants were overpriced and were acceptable otherwise. I believe it's much better to go into Fajardo and find a local place instead. Overall, the place has amazing views. It's probably better for families than it is for couples. If you want beach access without a huge hassle, don't stay here. Also, this place is better for those who don't want to travel around the island - those looking for the resort experience only. The golf course looked great, too, although scorched in some parts. Also, the casino was a lot of fun, but for anyone who likes video poker, the pay table are awful (6/5 Jacks or Better).My advice would be to stay somewhere more centralized and wherever you stay, rent a car!

<Content>Should be called El We will take every last dime you have and do nothing for you From the moment you arrive at El Conquistador, the experienced traveller knows something is wrong. You are told to park several blocks away from the hotel and then you wait in the blistering sun for a van to pick you up and bring you to the main lobby, all of which you are charged $15 a day for. Neither the van driver nor the bell men at the dropoff point assist you with your baggage (even women and children) unless you pay them up front.If you stay at Las Casitas (the higher end property) nobody at the main hotel will help you find your way as they appear to not care what happens to that property's guests. A cot for an additional guest in your room will run $45 a night and bedding (comforter) is not included. Everything you order from the bars has a 20% gratuity already included although the servers do not act like it. On our first day, four drinks cost us $58. Sandwiches for 3 people was $92. Then once you check out, your bill will undoubtebly have a multitude of charges that you never approved, everything from maid services (thought that was included in the price of the room?) to shuttle transportation that was never provided to parking charges for multiple vehicles even though you only had one vehicle. And please, do yourself a favor and do not leave the bar without signing your bill, assuming the staff will close it for you. That seems to be when most of the erroneous charges occur.After returning from Puerto Rico, I realized my card had been charged $6,000.00 erroneously which was in addition to the $2,000 mischarged while I was there. When I phoned the hotel to have it fixed, they told me their systems were down and they couldn't help me. That was the same answer I received when I was checking out and disputed several of the aforementioned charges they had erroneously applied to my account. All in all, my total tab was +$16,000.00 with more than $2,000.00 in erronecous charges which again, the hotel could not refund at the time of checkout because their computers were down as was internet in the room the entire time we were there (Great for spouses who want their spouse to focus on vacation, BAD for business people who have to keep tabs on the office while they're gone!). I can only guess how I will get my money back at this point.To be fair, the views at this hotel are like no other, as is the infinty pool and the private island available for guest use. The staff are next to worthless in terms of their desire to help you but if you can find a way to not be affected by their inattentiveness, your private moments with your family and loved ones can truly be priceless. But we had already heard about the financial mysteries that occurred at El Conquistador before we went and let me tell you, they are true! Keep all of your receipts and check your final bill vs. those receipts when you check out. Or just go to a hotel that is more trustworthy and avoid the mess altogether.

<Content>"El Con" is a singularly aproppriate nickname for hotel Stayed at Casitas section of hotel, privately owned apartments run by the hotel. The cons : 1)Too much work to enjoy amenities/you have to take golf carts to main hotel, then go through complex to reach the vernacular to take you to the marina, then take a boat to the private island beach. Then add that you wait everywhere for ever.2) The restaurants are outrageously expensive.Wanted to order for a party of six three meals since not everybody wanted to eat a full course.They wanted to charge $ 20.00 per person sharing fee. I gave a buffet reception where they could only provide 4 plastic containers to have guests take leftover food back to their apartments;claimed they were all out thus I had a lot of dissapointed guests and expensive food waisted. 3) Poor service, tray set outside for three days before being picked up, extra towels took a day since they had to get it from the main building, we never got the coffee for our coffee maker the entire week, had to ask for new soap several times...etc.4)Paid $ 75.00 for shampoo at salon where service was so bad, I need pages to describe experience5)Many incorrect charges on final bill (thanks to Trip advisor input I checked bill). Overall, I felt they were nickle and diming me(with 00's)and it did not feel I was at a nice , classy , relaxing resort.

<Content>not worth the $$ Our troubles started upon check in. We were staying there for a wedding, and the price we were supposed to be paying for the wedding party was not recognized through the resort. We had to end up booking through another travel site, and paying much more. And after numerous attempts to call them to sort out the problem (long distance of course) and having no one answer the phone we had to stick with spending more money on reservations. After arriving to see if there was anything they could do to help us, they actually told us No and there was nothing they could do for us. Wow, horrible. The area around the pools are extremely slippery. The concrete they decided on was a horrible choice. And to get to the main pools, you have to walk through an outdoor restaurant. I felt rude basically interrupting people while they were enjoying lunch/dinner just trying to get to the pool. Also, there is no easy way to get to the 3 different pools in the main area. Which leads me to my next complaint. My father already had a sprained ankle that was in the process of healing, very well I might add. Well, in trying to find a better way just to get to the hot tub from the pool, he ended up slipping (again on the slippery choice of flooring) and rolling his ankle again. It was horrible. And the staff there, didn't care. They looked at us like we were stupid when I was trying to rush to get him ice (and trying not to fall myself) and told them I needed a wheelchair ASAP. When the staff member finally showed up, he had the nerve to tell me Oh, don't worry the use of the wheelchair right now is free, but if you need it any other time it will be $25 a day Are you kidding me?? First of all....over something that happened at your resort, and the complete nerve of them to take advantage of people in that since is outrageous. The food. Well, the restaurants were wonderful. Dinner at the Stingray was amazing and the service was outstanding. Also, Blossoms was wonderful as well. And truly the other dinner places were great as well. However...the prices are insane!! One morning at breakfast, my husband and I (keep in mind it was just the two of us) had a $50 bill. $18 for Belgium waffles, and $4.50 for a glass of orange juice. And trust me, the waffles were not that impressive. There were only 3, and they were small. Also be prepared for the 20% automatic gratuity they put on. One other disgusting fact is, my husband and I went to David's Cookies one night and Wilma had the most disgusting gross finger nails I have ever seen in my entire life. They were long and brown with so much dirt and grime underneath I couldn't beleive that she was allowed to be in the food service industry. And she didn't wear gloves to get our food. Needless to say I couldn't eat. I put in a complaint with the front desk staff regarding this. The staff was touchy. They didn't seem to enjoy their job at all. One lady wouldn't even give us towels until we could prove that we were guests at the resort. I can understand, however we had wristbands on from going to Palomino Island earlier that day. The only way you can get a wristband is showing proof that you are guest there. So we then had to dig through all of our belongings to find our card just because the wristbands weren't good enough for her. The spa was wonderful. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. However, I had a Rain Forest facial there and the Esthetician was extremely heavy handed. It was not relaxing at all, the lights were on the whole time and she was cleaning during the treatment. Banging around utensils and the metal bowl they use. I wish I had choose a different treatment, I did hear the massage someone else had was wonderful. The rooms were ok. Not up to standard of a 4 or 5 star resort however. And the elevator did not have AC in it, and to top it off, it was slow. And be prepared for a lot of walking. The resort is almost too large and it truly makes it hard to get from point A to B. Palomino Island was very nice, however the ordeal of having to get there almost not worth it. All I can say is Good Luck to the future guests.

<Content>Beautiful Resort I just got back from El Conquistador 2 days ago and I have to say I was quite impressed with the place. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and the service was great. Upon check in the printer wasn't working to print out my information so I waited a while to check in and the lady upgraded me from a garden view to an ocean view because of the wait. There were a few things that I didn't care for in the resort, the overpriced food and the parking. One day my boyfriend and I bought breakfast and spent 45 dollars for silver dollar pancakes and a breakfast buffet after that we headed out of the hotel to eat. We decided to self park since it was 15 a day instead of 20 for valet parking. Everyday when you self park you grab a ticket for that day and then park, the parking lot was a bit far so we had to wait for a van to pick us up which took a while some days and we had to walk maybe a 5 min walk up the hill. When you want to leave the next day you have to validate the ticket and have 20 mins to use the ticket to leave the parking lot which was a bit annoying. In the resort just about everything is charged to your room so make sure to keep your receipts because you will get a bill on your last day. I went to the bank one night and noticed a $250 charge on my credit card from a cigar bar which i never stepped foot in, apparently someone used my room number to charge my card, luckily my bank refunded me the money and i had to call the bar to tell them the situation. Places I would recommend- Palomino Island which is owned by El Conquistador. El Yunque- try La Mina Trail which is 30 min hike but the waterfall is so worth it.Snuba diving- is like scuba but without all the equipment, absolutely loved it especially if you're a first timer like I was.If you have a car go to Luquillo beach. I went to the biobay in Fajardo, didn't really care for it and it was one of the excursions i was most excited about.I took a ferry to Culebra Island which is an hour and a half ride and went to Flamenco beach, which was absolutely gorgeous. If you decide to go buy you ticket for the ferry the day before, we ended up waiting on line for over an hour or if you find out about the flight to culebra which i think is about 20 bucks try that.I would definitely go back to El Conquistador but maybe for a long weekend not for a long week because there isn't much to do out in Fajardo so you will end up driving everywhere as far as nightlife.

<Content>Beautiful resort and Island Overall, the resort was beautiful, but Palamino Island (Resort's Private Island) made the vacation. As with other reviewers, we found the prices of food and drink at each of the resort restaurants to be quite high, but we were on a much needed vacation and didn't care. For those nights where we didn't want to purchase the high-priced fare, there were several conveniently located stores and restaurants in the Fajardo area. The room was a bit dated, but not unclean and felt relatively safe. There was a problem with the in-room safe-box and security personnel took care of the problem immediately. I would recommend this resport to others with the advice to expect high prices and to request a modernized room prior to checking in.

<Content>Excellent Resort! After reading some of the comments people had posted in regards to this resort all I can say is they were not staying at the El Conquistador in Puerto Rico. This place is phenomenal! Starting with the bell hops, housekeepers, and all staff. They could not have been nicer or more accomodating. We were upgraded to a deluxe oceanview in a newly renovated room. So new that you could smell the wood of the furniture and there was not a speck of dirt anywhere. The pools were great, the funicular service was perfect, the island was beautiful and let's not forget about the wonderful, entertaining birds in the lobby (which is palatial). I really can't say enough about this resort. I know that food tends to be expensive, but no more than if you stayed in any other resort, we live in Florida so you must know what I mean. The shuttle was always waiting to take you from the parking lot to the lobby. We took the funicular one night down to the marina and walked out into the little town and had dinner - it was wonderful and inexpensive, so that is an option also. We had a car, which was great, since the only problem with the resort is that the tour desk does not book tours unless they have enough people sign up and that can be a problem if you had your heart set on doing something outside the resort. But honestly, that is the only problem we encountered. There are locals stores to buy things on the way in and you have a refrigerator in the room, for drinks, etc. The views from anywhere in the resort were breath taking. So ignore all the negative comments and give this place a chance - you will be very happy you did. Oh, and Nancy in the swimshop picked out the nicest bathing suit I ever bought! And even remembered my name the next day when I walked by. Last but not least, the day we were checking out, our flight was not til 7:30 pm, so after checking out they held our bags so we could swim, etc. and then gave us a hospitality room to shower and get ready before we left for the airport at 4. Now, that is what you call service! This is a DEFINITE 5 star resort! We had a great time and if I ever go back to Puerto Rico, the El Conquistador is where I will be staying...

<Content>Definitely not 5 star I was staying at the El Con resort for a wedding. First of all, we booked our rooms when the resort was owned by Wyndham. Our preious reservations were not accepted by the new managment, an we had to redo our reservations (at double the price of course). Upon checkin the problems started. They booked us in the wrong section of the resort, even though we called the resort directly to confirm that we would be in the newly renovated Las Briasas wing. After complaining they at least bumped us to an ocean view room. Rooms were nice upon first inspection, but as we started to use them we realized there were many problems. the toilet stoppped working ourfirst night. It may have been a hotel wide problem, because it wasn'tjust our room that experienced such problems. The sink in the bathroom did not have a plug. There were problems with the stereo anddvd player. The restuarants that we went to were not acceptible (we tried to eat off the resort whenever possible), service was incredibly slow and the food was not good and over priced (like most hotel food).Additional charges for everything were outrageous. if you had acar it was $15 to $25 a day to park (although locals using the casino could park for free), and the internet service (not even wireless) was $15 a day. The island beaches were nice, but not much to see snorkeling, and they did at least give you complementary beach towels at the pools and beach.

<Content>Nice place but keep an eye on your credit card We just came back on 05/28/2007 and when we check out they try to charge us $500.00 more. It took us almost 2 1/2 hours to clarify everything and we almost lose our fight. I check my bank account on 05/29/2007 and they over charge me $ 2,514.60 Immediatly I called them and it took them almost 3 days to get back with me. They just call me back and told me that I will have my money back in 3 to 4 business days. The place was beutiful but is not 5 starts plus the restaurants don't have the best food and is expensive. Tip: If you pay cash or credit card in the restaurants, bars or shoping store, keep your receipes or they will charge double.

<Content>Bueatiful but overpriced Rooms were old. Worn carpet, bad tiles and old furniture. The rooms were definately NOT worth the cost. No hot water in the mornings, all four days we were there. Peeling paint in the bathroom and stained floor tiles made a very bad presentation for such a pricey resort.Staff was accomadating, friendly and spoke english.Hotel lobby is in good condition but resturaunts were extremely overpriced for quality of food and service. All meals I had were poorly prepared, over cooked and most using very inexpensive ingredients. At $70.00 dollars, lunch for two, $60.00 breakfast for two and at least $100.00 dinner for two. I had the absolute worse eggs benedict I have ever eaten in my life for $60.00 service for two. If you go to this hotel, eat somewhere else.The views overall were very nice and the hotel offers tours, etc. The location of the hotel demands a car rental or you will be stuck with what they offer there. It is a long walk to anywhere once you leave the hotel lobby. Fajardo is a 4 mile walk. Although you would expect a beachfront due to the availability of full ocean view rooms , the only beach has to be accessed by ferry but in all fairness, guests COULD see the ocean. All in all, this hotel is not worth the money and you will not see the real Puerto Rico while staying here.

<Content>Very beautiful hotel with great views. It was well worth it!!!!! We just returned from a 5 day/4 night stay at the El Conquistador. We had a very good time! Before we left we made sure to read the reviews and were a little scared after seeing all the negative reviews. In fact, we almost cancelled the trip after reading that someone got bedbugs at the hotel. But in the end we decided to continue our trip because we figured that there was just no way that it could be that bad.... and after returning from the trip I鈥檓 glad we didn't listen to all those negative posting.The resort itself it beautiful. The views you will see there are unlike any others that I ve ever encountered. They are simply breathtaking. The resort is about an hour from the airport and far from the city, but to me that was one of its best features. San Juan is very congested and there are only a few beachfront hotels and none that have views like that of The El Conquistador. Also being so far out gave us a chance to see the countryside of the island, which is something that you won鈥檛 encounter if you stay in the city. The Resort is very big and although the hotel might be at capacity you do not feel crowed at all. Our check in/out was very smooth and only took minutes. We had a Garden View Room that was very spacious with an incredible view of the tennis courts and the golf course. The room itself was average at best. The room was very outdated and was screaming for an upgrade. The comforter on the bed was from the 80s maybe 70s and was very hard. The sheets on our bed were never changed the entire stay, unless all their sheets have holes in them. The room was clean and there was no mold or leaking ceilings to report like mentioned in the other reviews. Overall the room was okay, but by no stretch of the imagination could it be considered 5 star. ( Oh, and beware if you get a garden view room, the birds will chirp all night long. So if you cant sleep through that, you might want to upgrade. However it didn鈥檛 bother us, and we were actually amused by it.) Palomino Island is beautiful with white beaches and crystal clear blue water perfect for snorkeling. You had to get on the funicular and a ferry to get to the beach, but it was not at all the hassle I read about. Usually we got on the funicular without a wait, but on a few occasions we waited at the most 5-minutes. The ride on the ferry only took about 10 minutes to get to the beach. The food and the drinks on the island ( and the entire hotel ) were not that great. The drinks were watery and the food was mediocre at best. The prices for the food was high but it was to be expected at a resort. The service was slow at all the daytime restaurants and it was almost like the wait staff were on vacation too. Several people advised us that there are good local restaurants in walking distant from the hotel near the marinas. We did not get a chance to find them but I would advise people to eat off of the resort and to rent a car so you don't have to be stuck at the hotel. While there were plenty off activities to choose from during the day, the nightlife was very dull. The casino was small and not that entertaining. Casablanca, the club on the resort, was always empty. On our last night there I looked through one of the books in the hotel room and discovered that there were an array of different nighttime activities to choose from like taking a sunset cruise or private dinners at the marina. If you鈥檙e the adventurous type I would recommend the Bioluminescent Bay Kayak Adventure at night. Its very exciting and most people say that its the highlight of their trip. If you have a rental car I would recommend going to Old San Juan for a day. Its a very historic town with lots to see and do. If you don't have a car and have to go with a tour group I would recommend going with the group that doesn鈥檛 include the Rum factor. Don't get me wrong, the Rum factor is nice as well, but it doesn't compare to exploring the streets of Old San Juan. We did the combination tour and only had two hours in Old San Juan. We found ourselves racing back to the bus and there was still a ton of stuff to see and do. I felt like we missed out on a lot and really didn鈥檛 get a taste of what Old San Juan had to offer. Overall our trip to Puerto Rico was really great and I would return to the hotel when I go back. I know for next time to rent a car so I will be able to see more sites and be able to dine at local restaurants. If you鈥檙e looking for a laidback getaway without all the crowds and the tourist, this place is for you. If you鈥檙e younger and are looking for more of a party scene and a high-energy nightlife, this is not the place for you. But either way Puerto Rico is a beautiful place and you鈥檙e guaranteed to have a good time!!

<Content>Beautiful views, huge property, but not 5 star We had a great deal staying there for 3 days and 2 nights $379/person including plane ticket and car rental at the airport. This was our second time there and we were better prepared this time. Some tips:1) Reserve a car at the airport. Confirm car at the airport before getting on the shuttle to pick up the car (cause you have to deal with lines there.)2) Before getting to Conquistador there is a Walmart, Walgreens, supermarkets, etc. If you're frugal like me and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for beer, chips, soda, and water, buy all your groceries and bring them in. Make sure your room has a refrigerator as well as one for the snack bar (2 fridges) though they both weren't very cold.3) If not peak season, try to get a room closer to the funnicular (the elevator-like tram that takes you to the ferry. We had to trek for 7 minutes from one end to the other end. Ferry runs everyday beginning at 9:30am every half hour and takes only about 7 minutes.4) I snuck water and snacks over to the island cause I'm too cheap to pay their prices although my husband says they deserve the money since they spent a lot of capital on that manmade island.5) While driving on the highway, Rte 3?? I think it was, there are lots of stands along the highway. Try them. Mofongos which are crushed up plantains with seafood are not bad. There's a restaurant called La Casita Blanca that's near the airport which serves local Puerto Rican food. Google it.6) Plan the trips to Culebra and Vieques carefully. We didn't have time to do either cause we didn't look at the schedule until we got there and it was too late to go and come back. If you want to check out the bioluminescent bay in Vieques you have to stay overnight though I hear that's the prettier one than in the main island itself.As for the room and its properties, it wasn't dirty (like insects everywhere and stains all over) but it wasn't spotless either. I stepped on old cigarette butts in the balcony when I got close to the edge to take a picture of the water (which was very pretty by the way)... If you're not a picky person, the rooms won't bother you really. For the price we paid and the amount of money we didn't spend at the hotel, it was well worth it.

<Content>Great Place to relax but it is not a 5 star Went on a girls long weekend, the grounds are beautiful and I would highly recommend staying at the Casitas. While everything is connected, the El Conquistador hotel was huge and the pool area was massive - lots of chairs, lots of people, I felt like it was spring break-ish. The casitas were more secluded and the pool area (not the one by the restaurant) was spectacular- we used it everyday and didn't even venture to the island that the resort has. I have stayed in many hotels (I am a big business traveler), and if you say you are a 5 star, then I expect a certain level. While everyone was nice and accomodating, I can safely say the rooms are not 5 star qualilty (we moved because the first room we were placed in was at best, a room that you would get at a Quality Inn). The second room had a balcony and a view of nothing much but it was far superior than the first room. We were moved quickly and the butler (nice name for a bell boy) was very social. The service was not 5 star, they were nice but S-L-O-W, and considering they include a 20% tip in every transaction, why should they servers go faster? Everyday, we had to go and find a server to come to the pool area. At the pool, we would havedrinks and lunch and bill was always around $100 - we didn't drink anything fancy it is just that expensive. A diet coke can was 4.95, just for an example of the prices. We got room service and it was another $100. they charge you double the service charge to deliver to the casitas and the 20% tip. The marina area is dumpy and the Los Olos area isn't much nicer, we only went to the marina to get picked up for the bioluminecent tour. The kayaking was nice but make sure you use BUG spray, I did and still have 12 bites on one arm. Good experience to go into the lagoon and you do get wet, so bring a towel for when you are finished. Don't bring cameras, etc. they will get wet.Got pizza from one of the restaurants and it was FABULOUS. seriously, the best meal we had. Ate at Strip, and it was very good, the service was exceptional and the manager on duty was doing everything right, he came by our table and ensured everything was going well (not obtrusively..just wanted to take care of his guests). I would recommend this place for a nice dinner.Had massages at the spa, and I thought they did a nice job. Efficient, on time and most of all, I felt as thought I had gotten a massage. We rented a car at the airport and it worked out well for us. You don't have to pay for parking if you stay at the Casitas but will if you stay at the El Conquistador (like 15/day or something). Overall, i would stay at this hotel again, but would remember it is not a 5 star but a 4 star in need of some fancier rooms (lost water one morning and the faucets were poorly attached to the sink), some more training of the staff (housekeeping was hit/miss and no turn down service - the cornerstone of 5 star service) and more maintenance of the common areas (someone broke glass in front our entrance, it was cleaned up somewhat but a bunch of glass remained and probably is still there).

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, all in all good bet We just got back from a week at this hotel. The property is beautiful. You can't beat the views. We had rooms in the La Vistas wing, the ground floor so we had a nice walk out patio, I would highly recommend. The only downside of this location is that they host quite a few parties and they were all right outside of our room so we had very LOUD music and parties going until late and since we were traveling with our 4 KIDS this was not what we needed. The manager was nice he knocked off one nights room for the inconvience which was nice. DO NOT eat at Caribe cafe, the food is mediocre and the service is terrible. I don't care how much cheaper it is, it is not worth it. They tried to charge me 30 bucks for a chicken sandwhich that I never order and never ate.The pools are nice, the island is great, soft sand.BEWARE of room service. My kids ordered it 3 nights in a row and each night it too 1 1/2 hours to get the food. I am not exaggeratting. The order was also wrong two of the three nights They brought chocolate covered strawberries to say sorry, I would rather of had the meal free.

<Content>Good overall We had a pretty good time. The hotel itself I found beautiful. We stayed in the renovated wing and had an incredible view of the water. Our room was very modern. We found the staff very responsive to our requests.Our only problem was the extra costs. I do understand that food will be expensive, but the quality did not quite match the price. I also found some of the add-ons a little annoying. Our bill had a $10 fee for the bellman and $3 for housekeeping, both of whom we had already tipped. We probably would've anyway because, as I mentioned, the service was great. I did think everything was overpriced, but on par with other five star hotels. We probably will not go back.

<Content>Nowhere deserving of 5 stars; not in Four Seasons or Ritz league at all Well -when we saw the LXR marketing materials we were pumped for a high-end family vacation without needing to get the kids passports. We like nice - and have vacationed at some of the Carribean's best like Little Dix Bay, Cap Jaluca, Four Seasons and more. We expected with the LXR ownership that the bad reviews on Trip Advisor would be history.Thankfully, there was no sign of mold nor dirty rooms. Unfortunately, service was ordinary and basic- not five star quality by any means. Imagine our disappointment to learn that the updated Las Brisas rooms that we'd been begging for every two weeks since making the reservation were all taken up by a company's national sales meeting. We saw these sales people everywhere we went, taking all the pool cabanas, all the barstools. And imagine our surprise to see another major company digging up the beach for their team build meeting. If I'd known this would be such a corporate trip we'd have gone to St John and likely will next time.Don't get me started on cost of goods. It was an event worth crying over when the wind knocked over my $9 mai tai on the beach. :( The breakfast buffet was $25 a head for adults/$11 for kids- with 2 kids and tip that's more than $75/day just on breakfast! And my new sandals gave me blisters but no one at the front desk could find me a band aid.Highlights: the ferry to the island; Strip House bar service, food and drinks; the Italian restaurant, particularly the awesome service; Golden Door Spa - especially Juan who improvised a class when the regular instructor was a no show.

<Content>My experience and a few $ tips Beautiful location, amazing views, nice pools, a variety of places to eat , nice staff, small casino...well, I'm sure you have seen the hotel website!. We just came back from a 5 days stay at El Conquistador and all I can say is that we had a wonderful experience. Housekeeping of our room was always good, perhaps on the 4th day (Thursday) it was a little short as the hotel was crowded with newcomers and the checkouts of people on conferences. However, I must add that on the 4th night I called guest requests and asked them to make the sofabed of our room and I was impressed by how quickly they got to our room to get it done.I know that each guest at a hotel gets a unique experience, so, this is mine! I can't wait to go back and spend more time by the pool, or at the Palomino Island, or even just to take the water taxi to Palomino and enjoy the Ocean Breeze and the views. At night, it was fun to waste a few dollars at the casino and watch the serious players or just walk around!. You can listen to some music (live music on weekends), dance, or simply have a drink outside at Brisas Cafe (I think that's the name!) . There is a nice bar and seafood restaurant by the marina area. There are lots of nice seating areas in the hotel, so you can just sit and relax. My $ tips...One thing to keep in mind when booking a hotel like El Conquistador is that regardless of the room deal that you may find, (who doesn't like to get a designers pair of jeans at 75% cleareance!!) the reality is that the prices for food will most likely remain the same, no deal there. I say this because I am surprise by the amount of reviews pointing at the high cost of meals...I honestly think that the prices are fair, for the most part. The italian restaurant had a sunset deal from 6 to 7:30 which was ok, $40 for a 3 course meal, not bad!, I won't recommend it after 7:30 PM. The prices at the asian , steak house and seafood restaurants were, in my opinion, reasonable and competitive when compared to similar restaurants in PR or the US, main entrees range from $17 to over $40 pp, I'll say that's average. Breakfast can range from $4 to $25 per person...i.e., you can get a ham  cheese bagel and coffee for about $4 at the cookies' place, or the whole 9 yrds at the $25 buffet, where kids under 4 won't pay, or have a breakfast special at the restaurant in front of the casino for about $8-10. I tried them all. You can also stock up your room with some breakfast items that won't require refrigeration (i.e. cereals). You can buy a 1/2 gallon of milk at the cookies store (about $4) and keep it in your room small refrigerator (when traveling with kids, milk is essential...you should have their favorite snacks also). The hotel provides you with 2 top quality PRican coffee packs for your room coffee maker everyday. The bkfst buffet is really good! but once during the stay is enough, you won't need lunch after the buffet. Drinks are what they are! always costly in hotels. You can basically buy all kinds of alcoholic beverages components at any local grocery store, so, you can keep some in your room, there's plenty of ice available. Otherwise, be ready to pay from $6 to $10 for beers  cocktails. As for lunch, average cost is about $17 but I highly recommend sharing, so that makes it less than $9 per person, not bad and more than enough food. You can try local restaurants, PRican food is really good and local restaurants are usually less expensive. Definetly try the seafood stuffed arepas or coconut arepas, you can get them at Las Croabas, near the hotel, a short walk from the marina (hotel dock) where there are many places that sell them from $4 to $6, nice lunch alternative or mid-afternoon snack, so that you can have a very late dinner. Ask the employees, they'll help with directions. Last but not less important, kids portions, you can get some from $4 to $8 at the restaurants by the pool or the one by the casino, but keep in mind that the high end restaurants which open after 6PM don't have many choices for kids (the asian does). This is a great destination, do what works best for you!!

<Content>El Conquistador Is THE BEST!!! We have just returned from our amazing stay at The El Conquistador Resort and Golden Door Spa (Arrival April 27, 2007 - Departure May 5, 2007) Our two children actually cried the whole way to the airport on the day we departed. They did not want to leave and neither did we!This phenomenal property is located on a cliff with unsurpassed ocean views. Our two connecting rooms were deluxe with large bathrooms (nicely upgraded), walk-in closets, large bedrooms, nice sized balcony and flat screen TVs (full cable access). I might also mention that the beds were very comfortable! There is so much to do while on property that we never felt the need to leave. We all enjoyed the two brand new $2 million+ catamarans that sweep you from the Hotel's marina to their private island. We visited the island every day - sometimes staying 2 hours, sometimes longer. Our two children (ages 3 and 6) played endlessly in the safe clear water while we relaxed over cocktails and good reading.  There is fun for the adults, too! I had the most amazing 80 minute facial (The Rainforest Organic Facial) at the Golden Door Spa. I personally belong to a very high end spa in Colorado and the Golden Door was superior to my spa by far! I highly recommend the Rainforest Facial, all of the massages and the reflexology treatment. You will not be disappointed! The treatments along with the venue are superb. I also attended many of the fitness classes at the spa. One of the instructors taught me some great balance techniques during a group class. This particular trainer was very knowledgeable and used to train Mariah Carey! My husband skipped the spa and played two rounds on the golf course. He was pretty excited to get to play more than once! I know he had a great time. I did not play the course but drove by it a few times in the complimentary valet golf cart. The course is beautiful with breathtaking views and lovely landscaping. The hotel service is superb and the restaurants are top notch. There is plenty to choose from. However, we particularly enjoyed our gourmet meal at The Strip House (try the Lobster Bisque as an appetizer and do not miss the Cheesecake for dessert). We were overwhelmed by the amazing sushi at Blossoms Restaurant. While at Blossoms be sure to order the spicy tuna rolls - they are to die for! Drakes Martini Bar is right across the hall with great cocktails and a stylish decor. Recreation at the hotel also includes a casino, multiple shops, outdoor pools and many smaller restaurants for quick and tasty meals. The funicular entertained our children and provides lovely ocean views (it takes passengers from the hotel to the marina). It is important to mention that there is a kids camp for children ages 4 and up (must be potty trained). Our 6 year old son spent a couple of days in the program and had a blast. The counselors were terrific and my son made some new friends. Finally, both of our children were endlessly entertained by the water slide at the main pool. I believe at last count our son went down that slide 243 times during our stay. Exciting news to share is that the hotel is in the process of building a state of the art water park. More slides!! The water park will be completed in early 2008. Although we have MANY amazing memories from our stay perhaps the most poignant was watching our son swim independently for the first time. We hope to return as soon as possible and plan to make it an annual trip. We have to return to for a visit to the new water park!  Thank you to the staff of El Conquistador for a dream vacation!

<Content>save your $$$ This hotel is really not worth it. Extremely poor facilities - the funicular was working only occasionally and the room that I stayed in is in no way spectacular - most hampton inns are much nicer.Everything was overpriced for one reason - once you are on the resort you have absolutely no choice but pay their prices. If you want to buy a 2 liter of soda at the small convenience store expect to pay $4.50 with tax included. A club sandwich - $12. Cab ride to San Juan to avoid these prices - $100/ each way.And if paying these prices weren't enough, the service might have been even worse. It seemed as if the staff was put out for doing their job but they sure did expect the large tips!My recommendation, find another hotel (this one is 2 stars at best).

<Content>El Conquistador El Conquistador April 25-29, 2007We just came back from our trip to the El Conquistador resort and are pleased to say that you will enjoy your stay!!!The room renovations are just outstanding from the decor, amenities and the beds are quite appropriate for the resort.We ate at the Strip House and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, food and wait staff. They made the night seem magical.If you want to unwind, make reservations for the Golden Door Spa. The massages were totally relaxing and the various exercise classes were informative and enjoyable.The food overall at the resort was top shelf. A little pricey for a midwesterner, but not for people from a large city.If you want the local life, you can get a cab to go into Fajardo, the El Yunque Rain Forest or anything else.For a total tropical getaway, make sure you go to the private island. Once there, you will forget whatever may trouble you.We will go back to this wonderful vacation spot again!!!!!

<Content>Resort is pricey and lousy but location is simply awesome We stayed at the El Conquestador during 1st week of Feb. It was a company sponsored trip so I didn't really have to worry about the expenses but sometimes I felt that this is such a rip off.1) Resort itself is old, it is painted but the furnishing are outdated and dirty. I would never pay for such lousy rooms myself.2) Location is awesome, picturesque views of the Carribean, private Island is amazing. 3) Staff was friendly, no problems with that, they did mess up our bills but after persistent calling they fixed that.4) Food: Food in the resort is aweful and pricey, my suggetion is to get a car and eat outside, local food is really good but you won't get served that in the resort. You can't walk out of the resort to get something to eat, there is nothing there. You would need to drive, by eating outside you might be able to save the amount you pay for the car rental. 5) Transport: The transportation is very limited and pricey, plan your trip so can rent a car. It will allow you to explore better parts of the island, if you are there only for 2-3 days, you could just spend that on the resort. Or rent a car for part of your stay. Book in advance.6) Things to do- Palomino Island: Jet Ski and other water sports, the island is beautiful and you get drinks and food served to your place. One word: Paradise.- RainforestWe took the rainforest tour, it's a half day tour and you can get the shuttle from hotel, it is pretty nice, if you have time you should go there yourself and do some trekking. I would have loved to spend more time in the rainforest, the tour was short.- San JuanWe rented a car from Avis (Avis members get 20% discount) and drove to San Juan, you can get directions to the city from Conceirge. It's beautiful place,very good food, touristy, the forts are nice too. You can spend a day there, it does get a little tiring walking across the city. Take your sunscreen and water with you. You can buy your souveniours from there.- KayakingWe did the Kayaking night tour, you have to Kayak in the night for around a mile through marshes, and you can get to the bioluminiscnce bay. It's not adventurous but a fun event.-SpaMy wife just loved the spa, it's very nice, must do on your vacation.In summar spend as much of your time outside of your room as possible.

<Content>Overpriced and unbearably rude staff The grounds and amenities of this resort are absolutely stunning, but it is incredibly overpriced. My boyfriend and I went during the off-season so we got a great deal on a room with an ocean view, and there were very few guests at the hotel. But eating and drinking at the hotel was ridiculously expensive for medicore food and unbearably bad service. From the minute we checked in, every staff member at El Conquistador was impolite and rude. The the staff made us feel like they were doing us a favor by serving us overpriced drinks and food.

<Content>A Wonderful Experience!! I read the reviews on this website before I went to this hotel, and honestly I was afraid of what I would find. However I was pleasantly surprised!! From the moment we stepped out of the cab to the moment we were dropped off at the airport, the staff was extremely courteous - my family and I are not used to this kind of service. The property and views will take your breath away. We went in the first week of May from Mon-Thurs so there were fewer crowds and the staff had more time to really take care of you, so if you're planning to go for a weekend in July/Aug keep in mind they are probably booked to capacity and cut them some slack!! Also, there was construction going on in some areas but honestly it didn't bother us, the workers were friendly to you if you were nice to them. Also there were no problems with our bill. Some warnings: be prepared for the expensive restaurants; we spent the most on food while we were there. Apparently, there is a small fishing village you can walk to from the marina where you can experience real Puerto Rican cuisine for cheap prices; we didn't find out until the day we left so we missed out on that. Palomino Island (their private island) is a great place to spend a day, they have tons of water sports and horseback riding, etc. Again, keep in mind the prices. For tours and excursions, I would recommend renting a car for El Yunque Rainforest instead of paying for the tour. I would recommend bringing rain gear and wearing a swimsuit as it WILL rain when you go, and there are these falls which you can swim in. However it is a 35 minute hike from the main trail. For Old San Juan you should go with a tour; we went by ourselves and had no idea where to go. Also, for most of the tours that the hotel organizes, there is a 6-8 person minimum so we missed out on some of them cause there weren't enough people interested in going. If you're going with a group then you're fine but if you're in a smaller group (we were 3) then keep that in mind. Probably in the middle of the summer the tours will leave every day but make sure to call ahead to check. All in all - this is a great place for groups to go to, there is so much for everyone to do. They have a lot of wedding parties here as well, they have a beautiful location for a wedding although I have no idea how much that would cost. Really romantic for couples. Families would enjoy themselves as well - they have a children's club with activities. I would definitely recommend this hotel for people who enjoy watersports, otherwise you will have less to do. Basically take these reviews with a grain of salt, as each person's experience will be different. We went at an opportune time because it wasn't so crowded and we were able to enjoy ourselves. When we left on Thursday we noticed the crowds rolling in and they probably had a different experience than us, who knows. Basically you need to go for yourself to find out!

<Content>I Beg You, Please Don't Waste Your Money. This Is the Rodeway Inn Of Resorts This hotel/resort is NOT worth the money we spent to stay there. This resort is in terrible condition and the location allows them to overcharge on meals and drinks. I 've seen motel 6 rooms in better condition than this one.We went on an all girls celebratory trip and dished out over 400/night for our room, needless to say we had high expectations but much to our dismay we walked in to our room to find-Dirty carpetA dirty bathroomMildewDirty floor tilesHair and trash in the bathroom and on the floorThe first day we didn't have hot water....just to name a few.After speaking to a manager he agreed to let us move to another room. My friend and I looked at 4 other rooms and they were all in the same condition as the one we had, so we stayed put. Based on their rates and website pictures we had high expectations but we were thoroughly let down. On a lighter note the service was good in the hotel and restaurants after they charged your lights out. If you are going to Puerto Rico please don't waste your money, this is the Rodeway Inn of resorts......seriously.

<Content>Do Not Stay There! My husband  I just returned from a stay at the El Conquistador. DO NOT STAY THERE! Yes, for the most part, the negative reviews posted on Trip Advisor are true.The bellman summed it up very simply, Nothing is free at this hotel except the air. They charge you for everything, parking, tennis, the gym, etc. In addition to that, everything is expensive. Bottled water is $6.00, a simple greek salad (very small) is $19.00, and dinner for 2 at the Italian restaurant ran us $180.00. We found the food in the restaurants to be mediocre at best. After our $180 experience we started eating off the property. There are many very good restaurants in the area.Although the boat ride to the beach is fun, it only ran every half hour at best. This was not very convenient, especially if we left the property for a trip and returned in the afternoon. There wasn't enough time to park the car, walk back to the room quickly, and use the tram to get to the boat, when the last boat back was at 5:00. I didn't go all the way to Puerto Rico to sit by the pool.The room we had was very outdated and it looked like it had not been renovated since the 80's. The furniture was beat looking and also damaged. It looked like furniture you would expect if you were paying $69.00 a night, not $430.00 a night! The room didn't have a balcony, or a refrigerator. We were provided a cooler which kept water cool as long as I kept adding ice to it two times a day.I also was not pleased with their customer service. One day I was changing my clothes and a stranger walked in my room. Unfortunately a bellman let him in to the wrong room. When I went to the front desk, very upset, the clerk was helpful, and brought the manager over to me. He apologized to me, but did not offer anything from the hotel to apologize. Even after I stated, Sorry doesn't cut it for me, you can at the very least comp me a meal, the manager told me he would get back to me. Forty-five minutes later, my husband went back down to give him an earful about customer service.The El Conquistador hotel is located in a beautiful location, but they need to irenovate their outdated hotel rooms, improve the quality of their restaurants, and customer service.

<Content>Gorgeous! You will not be disappointed at this resort. They have it all! Beautiful hotel  landscaping. Pool was a little crowded, but LOVED the private beach. You take a water taxi to a private island/beach. There is a restaurant/bar, water sports, plenty of lounge chairs, horseback riding, live band......Paradise! Back at the hotel,The Strip steakhouse is to die for! The best steak we have ever eaten! The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel arranges for many off-site activities. We chose the Old San Juan sightseeing and shopping excursion. It is a must!If you are a penny-pincher, don't come here. But, if you don't mind spending a few bucks, this is a must-see!

<Content>Luck of the Draw This is an absolutely beautiful property, with stunning views and an impressive array of amenities. We had a wonderful time. I would attribute this to the fact that we weren't paying for anything (this was a corporate award trip) and that our group had an on-site meeting planner who dealt with any potential pitfalls and kept us blissfully ingnorant. While our room was not yet renovated, it did have a spectacular view of the Caribean and was comfortably close to everything we needed, including the spa. It was clean enough, though not pristine, not 5 star but perfectly acceptable. The hotel was supposed to be at 100% capacity, which concerned me upon check in - but the resort is so huge, you really don't feel like you're in a crowd at any time. The only thing we waited for was the funicular to get to the ferry. This wasn't ever any more than 5 minutes - no problem. The spa is wonderful, not the BEST, but good and clean with wonderful attendants. Food is good, again, not 5 star but resort quality with one notable exception. . . Strip House is at least as good as most fine steak houses in NY or Chicago and the prices are similar (very high) but worth a trip upstairs. The decor is stunning. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. NOW, the warnings: a couple in our group did experience bed bugs and the type of nonchalant service described by other reviewers. They were shuffled from one disgusting, dirty room to another for two days and missed a couple of night's sleep. Another member of our party had jewelery stolen from a locked in-room safe. Not cool at all. Still others confided that their rooms were dirty, buggy, moldy, had holes in the walls or ceilings or were loud at night. Personally, I really enjoyed the natural sound of the tiny frogs and exotic birds at night.Overall, I think it's really the luck of the draw at the el con. We got lucky and are very thankful. Others, had a very unfortunate experience. In addition, the prices for food and services here are positively criminal. We enjoyed a six pack of Coors Light on the beach at Palomino Island for $36 plus tip. Breakfast buffet for two with taxes and tip (no alcohol) was $63. Lunch (hot dog and quesadilla with two beers) was over $70. A private cabanna at the pool is $214 per day, 50 minute massage $150 plus taxes and tip. On my own dime, I'll choose another lovely resort in the caribbean. This place really seems to have captured the market on corporate award trips and is priced accordingly.

<Content>very nice resort After reading all the bad reviews on this site I was very worried about spending a lot of money for this hotel .I booked a garden view in october and thought many times about cancelling.I 'm glad I didn't. The resort is beautiful ,we got an upgrade because they didn't have a double bed we got a beautiful ocean view very modern room great bathroom the closet was a little room .Everything brand new and modern.Prices very high could be better especially at the island a plate of fruit 17 dollars....very good restaurant expensive but even outside the hotel we went to a seafood restaurant and the prices were the same seafood pasta 24 dollars.Very good service and very nice staff.If you can spend the money great place to go....

<Content>No place like it on the planet Stayed three nights mid April. Took our two teenage boys, and had lodging in the Las Casitas villas. We rented a car from San Juan airport, and drove to Fajardo. Not a bad trip, but beware of drivers in Puerto Rico. They make their own rules. We rented a car to have access to the rainforest on our own time so as not to have to take a tour. It was a good decision, and we'll definitely rent a car next trip.Last time we visited, we went in February. April is a much better time to go. Hotter and more buggy, but not as crowded. The El Conquistador is unbelievable. From the moment we were met by smiling staff curbside, took the last moment we sadly drove out of the gate, it was like being placed on a picture perfect postcard.Bottom line: this place is expensive. Our first night, at the Strip House, our two boys drank $28 worth of diet coke alone. But, where else can you find such a view on planet earth? If it wasn't expensive, the hotel couldn't afford the upkeep of such beautiful grounds. They were exceptional. Flowers and hedges perfectly trimmed. Pools and pool areas very clean. Ferry service to the island -- 7 minutes! How can someone complain about having not having a beach at the hotel if they can't wait 7 minutes??? Have a mai-tai at the marina and relax!One disappointment: Drakes Cigar Bar doesn't allow cigar smoking anymore due to the new smoking laws in Puerto Rico. You can't even smoke a cigar on the adjacent patio. If you want to pay fast-food prices, find a 3-star hotel. But if you want luxury, this is the place. We will definitely be back. And We Can't Wait!

<Content>This Place Is A Joke... This place is a beautiful place run by misfits. Where do I begin. While waiting approx. 45 minutes to check in - one desk person for 30 hot, sweaty people waiting to check in - guests already staying there came in to complain they had been robbed. Another couple complained that they saw one of the maids wearing a necklace that belonged to the guys wife! Shoddy construction done in their remodel - case in point where the tile meets the carpet we stepped on the tacks holding the carpet down - ouch! The room had not been cleaned. We didn't get the king size bed that we had booked more than 3 months in advance! We were paying $500.00 per night and we were told sorry you can't use the infiniti pool because you're not staying on that side fo the hotel! Are you kidding me? I asked the mgr. about this and his response was essentailly yeah - tough luck - you can't use it! I asked him why it's on their website - and a glazed look came over him as he couldn't answer it. What pathetic customer service! The mgr. should be working at Toll Booth. My apologies to the other professional tool booth collectors. in conclusion please don't stay here. save yourself some money and heartache and find another place and If you go down here sleep with one eye open and screw or nail down everything in your room if you if you leave for any period of time cause chances are it may not be back when you return...

<Content>Incredible Location!!!! The El Conquistador is awesome! I had a completely positive experience during my entire stay. The staff was so nice. Even if you don't have a view of the ocean from your room, there are amazing views all over the property. Everything was very clean. It was good for people with families, but also for couples on there honeymoon. Tons of activities. I will definitely be going back.

<Content>Outdated and in need of repair. We arrived late and waited in excess of an hour for marginal service at the desk. We were then sent, carrying our own baggage to a maze to the funicular - a slow and often broken antiquated devise that was the only way to get up and down the mountain. This became the bane of the trip. The room was musty, loud and outdated. The staff was without a care regarding following up or abilities to accomplish the simplest tasks. It took no less than 3 trips up and down the funicular to get a credit card imprint. It was not all bad, however. The Stingray Cafe was delicious and the private island/beach was wonderful. This is not a 5 star experience...closer to 3.

<Content>A paradise getaway After reading mixed reviews of the El Conquistador Hotel, I didn't know what to expect. Yes, the food and beverages were highly over priced. Do yourself a big favor and stop off at the Walgreen's (3 on the way to hotel) and stock up on water, snacks, soda, cooler and snorkel gear you will save a small fortune. Renting a car is the best way to go so you are not stuck at the resort and paying the ridiculous food prices. Do not book anything through the hotel! If you rent a car go visit El Yunque on your own and go as early as possible, opens at 7:30 to avoid the mass tourists. Rainforest is truly a wonderful experience a must to see. Be prepared for plenty of walking. There is also a fishing marina at the end of the El COnquistador Ave. where the food is outstanding and the prices more reasonable. David's cookies at the resort had pastries and bagels at an affordable price, best place at the resort for the cost. Okay everthing at the resort is over-priced, but the view and grounds are absolutely breath-taking! Pools were clean and well-maintained. Palomino Island was so much fun and absolutely gorgeous!!!!! If you have your own snorkel gear bring it. Many coral reefs and plenty of fish to find, even saw a sea turtle (water shoes a must).Overall this was my best family vacation, plenty to see or just relax, everyone on the island is extremely nice. If price is a concern there are many places to eat outside the resort if you have transportation. Enjoy this wonderful, magical place.

<Content>Save your Money - Find another resort - We just returned from 6 days on the resort. While it was nice to be on vacation, the resort was not worth the money. At $500 per night, there are many places that you can stay that are cleaner, newer and more high end.A couple of points:- We were lucky to be in the new renovated rooms. The room was clean and refreshing. The bed was great and the bathroom was very large. A cheap shower curtain and a ripped couch were the only issues with the room. It was in appropiate that they charge a 25% hotel tax for the renoviated rooms. They did not advise it at check in.- The food was terrible and overpiced. Every place you ate, the menu was the same. - Fine Dinning - The resort has 3 high end restuarants for dinner only. The food was good, but everthing was 2x what should have been charged. - Grounds - The resort is beautifully located on the cliffs, but without easy acess to a beach, made for a major disappointment. The private island is not that great. You have to wait for a ferry, which only runs on the 1/2 hour and the ride is about 15 minutes. After all the dealing, it is not worth it. Because of the inconvience, we only went to the island one time and spend all the time at the pool. The island was not that great. - The trams - you have to take a tram down to the lower part of the resort. Most of the time that we were there, one of the trams was broken. Everyday we spent about 30 minutes waiting in line for the tram.- Activities - the pricing to snorkel, fish, sail, etc. were so over inflated, that we did not spend the money.- The Golden Door Spa- We really enjoyed the treatments and the staff were fantastic. The spa seemed to not fit in with the resort since it was so much nicer than any spots on the resort. The only negative about the spa is that it was SO EXPENSIVE. But once you are at this resort, you are looknig for some relief from your overpriced reality.

<Content>absolutely great places Me and my husband book this trip to puerto rico. We both have been to San Juan so many time but we never been to Fajardo so we decided to try some place new. We both love it . I was a little scare after reading some of the comment people wrote in the tripadvisor. That I was going to cancel my trip .Im glad that we decided to go it was the best place I have ever been in puerto rico the private island is absolutely magnificent . The service was great. The food is a little expensive. but if you rent a car there are place in the area that you can eat that are not expensive. we both enjoy ourself. I highly recommed this hotel will be back next year for sure .....

<Content>Beautiful rooms Expensive Meals I read numerous reviews about this hotel over the past number of weeks in anticiapation of my visit and found myself quite anxious of what I would expect. The pictures of mouldy floors and worn carpet were a bit scary. Happily, these reviews were either old or in a part of the resort I did not see. My room was overlooking the ocean and was both comfortable and clean. The staff for the most part were friendly ( I had an argument with a bartender who would not make me a mojito!)  My only problem with this resort is that the prices charged are ridculously inflated. Be prepared for the $18 hamburger w fries (served on a plastic plate) $8 bottle of water and $6 for a small beer. All in all, this resort is a nice place to visit but I would not consider it to provide value for money spent.

<Content>Poor quality  Attended Company convention at EC 24-29 March.Firstly, there is no way this resort should be 5*, more like 3*.Surroundings pleasant  nice views. However, massively overpriced (**BEWARE - 'RESORT FEES'/TAXES WILL ADD 27% TO YOUR BILL !!**).Food hyper expensive  mediocre quality. Room not very clean  service poor. (Shower not working/no face towels available for most of our time - Hotel's laundry equipment not working).Overall, can be summed up by our initial experience after check in. Arrived to mediocre room. Called reception  enquired any chance of moving to the renovated part of the Hotel. Response.....you're in the renovated part of the Hotel ! .......................................Enough said !P.S. Never, ever make an international phone call from the Hotel Room. Did so (stupidly)  a one minute call to the UK led to a charge of $70 !! Added to the overall feeling of being ripped off. Don't mind paying top rates for a top Hotel, but this isn't one of them !Will not go back.

<Content>Will be great when renovated We stayed at the resort Feb 20th to 25th. Overall the site is beautifull. The service was quite good. The island is very nice. The golf course is very nice. It is obvious that there is a lot of money being spent on renovating and upgrading the property. They are even putting in a water park. However, the reno's are where we ran into problems. After our first night there we were greeted very early in the morning with the sound of workmen going about their business. The hotel did move us and the noise level was much more acceptable. We also found our bill to be exceptionally high for food, drinks and spa.( My wife went for a massage and facial and her bill was over $300 US plus an automatic 15% tip added. )It is a very nice spot and if you aren't on a budget it is a resort worth visiting

<Content>Not worth the money - not a 4-star hotel We stayed in the hotel for a week at the end of February. The hotel looks great on the website and promises a great deal of value but we experienced quite a few problems whiel staying there.1. Check in - it took us over 45 minuters to check in. Cannot figure out why since the hotel already had all the info from the initial reservations. People were growing very impatient while waiting. To top it off ,nobody could get room keys for the next 3-4 hours so everytiem you wanted to re-enter the room, we had to call the bell service. No apologies were offered, I guess it is a normal practice.2. The room was large, as promised but extrremalty outdayted (Garden View) with some kind of pasta sauce/ketchup/blood on the walls and the ceiling. It took me 2 days to get this issue resolved (they repainted the room). A decent 4-star hotel would give us a different room aoreven an upgrade but we could not even get an apology.3. The food is very pricey but that was expected. Plenty of cheap local food if you are willing to walk 10 minutes from the marina .4. The beach is very good, although weekends are very crowded and noisy due to the influx of locals.5. Service in some resuarants is non-existant. We waited for about 20 minutes just to get menus. But upscsale restaurants have very good service.We've been to many 4 and 5 star hotels in US, Europe and Australia. El Conquistador compares only in pricing but not in service and hospitality. We wlll defitnely go back to PR but next time we will avoid this hotel.BTW, the dive shop on the property is not proffesional either. Making a reservation does not mean anything to them but they would gladly put in danger non-certified divers when they see the money....

<Content>Beauiful Location but... Extremely Expensive, Billing Problems etc.!!! Okay so....the resort is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. My now husband and I went to get married along with our closest family and friends. We were promised amenities that to this day we still have not received. Everything was expensive! We were charged double by the front desk for the transportation and still have not been reimbursed even after we have given proof that we were charged twice and they tell you that the transportation from the airport to the resort is 30, that is a lie. It took over an hour for us to get there one way. At least three of our friends were wrongly charged on their bills, some of which are still not resolved and somehow they mixed up our bill with my parents'. Then, over a month after the wedding and our return here, my mother and I both noticed charges on our credit cards from El Conquistador, they said they were charges for things that had not posted yet, they said they were incidentals but did not say what they were and did not reimburse the money in its entirety. This was a horrible experience and I would not recommend it!

<Content>Brought home bedbugs Beautiful setting, but vast hotel and a little impersonal. Okay beach on a separate island that you have to take a boat to (free, every half hour). The rooms are a little worn. The worst part was that when I returned home (after having stayed only at the ElCon) I brought home bedbugs. And that's not a joke.

<Content>A decent stay Just came back from one week at the hotel and in summary, it was OK. We paid $200 (a special return rate) a night for a tennis court view room which I think was over priced for the stay. This is definitely like staying at a lower end Hyatt or Hilton. And unfortunately, there are more cons that pros. PROS: shuttle bus to hotel is convinenient and easy to find at the airport (although this was $60 pp RT); staff is very nice; pool is great especially for small kids; views from pool over the caribbean are spectacularCONS: Food is over priced and quite average. Tthe other family we were travelling with ordered room servce for breakfast for 3 people (1 child) and it was $100!!! During one lunch, I ordered the 3 mini burgers and essentially got White Castles. And they charged $12! And the resort is in the middle of no where so we were not about to take cabs with 2 children all over Fajardo in the search of food. The hotel is outdated and needs some spiffing up. Floors and bannisters are worn. Room furnishings OK but outdated. COMMENT ABOUT THE PALOMINO ISLAND: It's OK. The kids had a fun time on the ferry boat, but the island is nothing special. It's a standard beach with a restaurant and bar. And if you think about it, it's a pain to take a ferry to the beach so we only did this once. This was a family vacation that was planned last minute and I had read the reviews before going so I my expectations were not high. Our goal was to spend some quality family time relaxing which is what we did. If you are looking for high end, go some place else. It looked like they were renovating and supposedly, LXR has taken over, so maybe in a year or two, El Con will be restored to the reputation it once had.

<Content>"THE" absolute jewel of Puerto Rico... El Conquistador I am a world-class / first-class traveler. I travel consistently for both business and pleasure. With almost 200k miles in 2006, I have some qualifications to share my experiences. I have stayed in many resorts in PR and the Caribbean abroad and the El Conquistador is bar far among the best. I was fortunate enough to stay in one of the newly renovated rooms. The clean and crisp feel of the new interior design and color schemes overwhelmed me. The big flat screen TV was great, but that view will make sure you don't turn it on. The bedding was very comfortable and sleeping in was always a pleasure.I am a stickler for service. If I am going to pay a premium, then I want to have uncompromised service. This is exactly what I got from the valet and check-in service; to the poolside wait staff and the pampering we got at Palomino Island (El Conquistador's private island just 15 minutes from the shore.) it was clear that our 鈥渆xperience鈥?was the top priority of every staff member. All in all, you must experience Puerto Rico and the best way to do it is to allow the El Conquistador to provide the get-a-way experience you have been dreaming of from your downtown office cubical in Anywhere, USA.L.

<Content>Amazing Room and View, But Isolated First the good things: I booked this hotel for $150 plus tax at priceline.com for March 3-7, 2006. It was accepted on the first bid so I might have been able to go a bit lower. This is the peak season so everything in San Juan was either booked or very expensive. The staff was very friendly and accomodating (don't really understand what happened to the other reviewers) and instead of giving us a garden view room we received a deluxe ocean view room at no additional charge! I think this is because I requested a room as far away from the new addition construction as possible and the hotel was slightly empty. Anyway, guest services responds to every request prompty (bath robes, extra sugar, washclothes, etc) and follows up with a call. The view from the room is spectacular and if you stay up all night, the sun rises directly across from the hotel over the small private island and the caribbean sea. The island had beautiful sand and water. The hotel grounds are very nice and it is pleasant to walk around or hit the slot machines for fun. Next, the not-bad-but-just-want-to-mention things: Everything at the hotel is ridiculously expensive. Apparently, everything having to do with tourists on the island is ridiculously expensive (unless you hit the local BBQ stand). I mean, more expensive that Maui or Germany or Greece or Singapore! We're talking Tokyo prices ($17 for a turkey and ham club sandwich + 20% tax + $4 room delivery). HOWEVER, there is one spot tucked away at the hotel where things are reasonably priced (only if you live in California or NYC) at the base of the hotel right before you get on the funicular called David's Cookies - sandwiches are good, lattes good, good selection of pastries. Next, I personally, like to have a beach at my doorstep. I get pretty lazy while on vacation and getting out of the hotel room in the morning takes a while - tack on the extra 20 minutes to get to and wait for the ferry and the 10 minutes on the ferry and the fact that the last boat leaves the island at 530p, then there are only a few hours left to spend at the beach. For serious beach dwellers, I would suggest staying in Isla Verde where you can literally be at the beach all day taking only a few minor excursions to grab some food/coffee. Next, the hotel is very very very isolated from anything remotely cool or fun. Luckily, we had a convertible and drove around after the private island shut down and pretty much headed to San Juan every night (stuff doesn't stay open very late there, either). I guess I'm used to late nights with food and music, but these activities don't exist in Puerto Rico on weekdays. The rainforest is nice but the road only goes in for about 30 minutes. BE WARNED that while driving into El Yunque there is a Portal to the rainforest where the forest service charges $3/per person in the car but this is NOT TO GET INTO THE RAINFOREST. It's simply three bucks each to go to the gift shop and to get a map. The guy who sold us the tickets put is this way: Welcome to El Yunque, enter here to receieve a map from the tourist center. It's three dollars each for the gift shop. That's six dollars, you pay now. Of course, I fell into the trap (as did the three cars before us) thinking that this was due to poor english (ha ha! my boyfriend and I were giving them props for being so convincing) paid the $6 and drove into a dead end parking lot. I got my money back but everyone else I saw just picked up a map and drove off, even waving at the attendant and thanking him. THE DRIVE THROUGH THE RAIN FOREST IS FREE - DON'T BE FOOLED. So, overall I'd have to say that the hotel is really really nice and comfortable. But taking in the bigger pictures of the hotel's location and the fact that Puerto Rico is really not that lively and the food selection isn't that good, I would suggest either staying in San Juan or realizing that you want a very sedate vacation at a nice resort and that you can rent a car and take some trips outside the hotel. Seriously, don't even think about not renting a car unless you don't mind being held hostage to the hotel. Final unsolicited impression on Puerto Rico - Hawaii is WAY better when it comes to food and driving excursions and you'll probably save some money too (shocking).

<Content>Old, Tired and Lacking Stayed over a 4-day business meeting in February. Warning 1 - stay in the Casitas and make certain that you get the ocean front room - don't stay in the main hotel or in any non-ocean facing direct view room in the Casitas. To start, you arrive at the airport and the staff are clueless to get you to the long, no-shocks bumpy, CO2 odor, ride 1 hour + after a 1 hour wait at the airport to get there. They have a bar cart on the bus, give you bacardi, then after 4-5 drinks, our riders spilled all over themselves - quite funny. Warning two - once there, you are a captive; if this is what you want fine. Get off the resort by going down to the marina and left and walk into the little town. The private island is fine and the transport to and from is fine. As you expect, drink/food prices are astronomic. The little shops are ok. The penny slots and gaming tables are full of people. Lots of business meetings there. Warning three - I said get the ocean front room - our first ocen front - was a dank, back-view of the pool, stained desk and moldy bathroom. We requested to be moved - they moved us. The ocean view was great, but then again, the room showed serious sign of age. The internet access in the room did not work, and neither did the room safe. Staff - there are are lots of them - but they buzz past you on golf carts and when they stop, expect you to tip them. Food was bland over bland - expect 30$ for a breakfast for 2. Warning four - if you are looking for a beach front resort, the only sand is the private island - a boat ride away and 6 spaced apart of well oiled chasies. Heard the golf and spa were fine. The ride up and down to the marina was fun in the little cable car. Lots of tree frogs and little lizards running about.

<Content>Fantastic grounds and staff, outdated rooms After reading the many mixed reviews on this stie, I was terrified of what we had in store at this hotel. We won this on priceline from the mid 250s which is not cheap but quite low compared to the 375 and up rates for the President's Day weekend we were there. Was it worth that price? Probably not. But had I paid what some people on this site list as prices they paid, I'd have definitely been happier with the deal. I think this place has many pluses and negatives, and they kind of balance out. For me, the two big negatives were the state of the rooms (mentioned repeatedly in other reviews posted here) and the total lack of security - not necessarily in thefts (we had nothing stolen) but in who roams the grounds freely at what hours, access to swimming pools and various parts of the resorts (see below).The first thing to note about this hotel is that the grounds and location on the cliff are heavenly. Gorgeous views from every part of the grounds - and a beautiful golf course. If you just spend most of your time walking around the different parts of the hotel, you can't deny how lovely the location is. The pools are also quite nice, especially very late at night when there are not too many people around and the locals populating them have left... and there are many pools to choose from. However, it is not really practical to attempt to get anywhere with the Funicular (including lower level rooms, or pools, so avoid those). I highly recommend avoiding the rooms at Marino or the mid-level Las Olas village if you plan on going to the Casino, restaurants, or if you have a car you have to retreive at any point of time (by the way, use the valet service for car, its the best extra $5 you will ever spend). The Las Brisas wing is redone and the photos I was shown looked spectacular but it is quite pricey- about 125-165 more than an ocean view room in the La Vista section. We had one Ocean View room (via upgrade) n La Vista, and one Garden View. The surprise is the Garden View, on 6th floor, was ten times better than the much pricier Ocean View. If you can get a room that is closest to the Spa on the Garden/golf course side, such that you don't have to look in on all the construction, or Tennis Courts (this would be the very farthest rooms a the end of La Vista farthest from lobby) and if you can get it on the 5th or 6th floor, you will have a far better room than any full ocean view room in La Vista. The garden and golf course views from the upper La Vista levels are just spectacular, and you also have a huge balcony. The Ocean View rooms are smaller, cramped, and with very dirty windows you may not be able to open! But as I said, the value all depends on what you pay. Be prepared for most things in the room not to function and just decide to spend time outside the room. I am very picky about hotel rooms and had I not already read every single review on tripadvisor, I would have been shocked upon arrival and far more miserable- Luckily I arrived with low expectations. The out of date state of the rooms was less disturbing than the filth. One of our rooms had food cookies and pretzels on the carpet when we arrived, and a huge puddle. There was hair on the bathroom floor in both rooms we had. I do not think these rooms are cleaned properly at all and there is little hope they will be. On the plus side, the staff worked incredibly hard to get us a new room when I complained (the food on carpet was too much!)- Once we got over the hair-cookies-pretzels issues, I tried not to notice the many other new problems in our new rooms - the remote not working in one room, the cordless phone totally broken in the other, the coffee pot and safe not functioning in one room, and so on.... there are only so many times you can change rooms and you just have to decide to leave the room and hang out on the grounds and the pools or the Casino and enjoy the sun and sea. If you can't live with room problems and you need a fantastic four or five star room, don't go to this resort. At best three star rooms with one star cleaning.... But in my opinion its worth ignoring the rooms and just sleeping in them in the evening (and not much else). On the plus side the staff are really lovely and helpful and go out of their way to try to fix the problems that arise. Not that housekeeping will understand a single word of English, but the way I saw it we were guests in another land (U.S. territory or not!)Now the issue of security: There is absolutey none. On our first evening there, despite the resort being fully booked, it became clear that many many locals simply show up at the hotel and go straight to the different pools. In fact the Infinity pool at the Casitas was ONLY visiting locals (at a supposedly exclusive pool). We walked around there, chatted, took photos - noone will stop you - no one asks anyone if they are hotel guests. This became apparant through the trip. There is noone stopping you to see your room card for any part of this resort except Palomina. There is nothing to stop you from parking your car in various spots available all around the resort, esp. around the Casitas Village, and walking in, to any pool area at this resort, swimming, etc. and then leaving when you please. The same goes for any part of the grounds. We ventured into so many places we were supposedly not supposed to, and even as guests - it was a bit disturbing. We also had an incident where the tied up mini-bar (yes, the tie it up with a plastic cord!!) was cut open even though we had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door during the period we left our room, which we had to report to their security center. From the many detailed forms they brought us, it was clear that security problems were a constant issue. A DO NOT DISTURB sign means nothing at this resort. Someone WILL enter your room (and manage to cut the mini bar cord, and leave it cut). There were so many little incidences pertaining to lack of security to notice, all small, but nonetheless possibly of concern to those who may want a more exclusive or safe feel at a resort. This place is just too big to monitor and there is absolutely nothing to stop any person who wants from walking in to any section of the resort to break in to rooms, etc. Don't take valuables, don't leave anything around, go prepared to find locals in the pools at all hours and you will be ok.... but you just have to be mentally prepared for all this. I even found myself thinking, why pay thousands as we did? Next time I will find somewhere cheap to sleep and just come hang out at this hotel - its that easy! If its so prevalent on a sold-out weekend, and folks are so open about it, it must be occuring all the time and just accepted.Palomina Island is worth a trip just to ride the boat and see the place - but its not anything to write home about - yes, its nice for lying in the sun - but so is any beach in Puerto Rico. It is not a great beach for swimming, really. The level of seaweed and plant growth is just too much - you get all tangled up in it. I would not go there twice. Find a way to get to Luqillo which is a nice public beach... and I was not happy about the 1 towel policy once you get off the boat. They really can't afford to give you an extra towel? There were many water activities and most people seemed happy with the services- but nothing any different than a standard beach resort.The absolute best experience is to do the biolumenescent bay tour by kayak at the later night hours, in the total dark. There are many tour companies to choose from - avoid booking through hotel - you can book it on your own for half the price and its so easy to get to the docks from the hotel - there is info all over the web on the many companies in Fajardo. I have to warn you, however, if you have never kayaked - do not listen to the statements on how easy it will be, and how they will train you.There is no time to be trained to learn to kayak your way in weaving mangroves if you have no experience. But don't worry, they will either place you with a guide, or even pull you through.Most people do well but the guides are so great, they will save you even if you end up going in circles....Finally -avoid the restaurants - for some of the best Mexican food anywhere and fantastic prices - we ate there every night (!) go to the famous Lolita's. Wonderful staff, even better food. I can't recommend it enough! That was the best advice I got on tripadvisor for our stay - eat at Lolita's. And buy your breakfast at the grocery store to bring to the room - ours had a free fridge to use. Having a car rental will serve you well for all this...Would I recommend the place - I actually would, if the price is right. Its beautiful, the people are nice, and you just have to get into the frame of mind to not care a stitch about the room, or the lax security. You can then relax and enjoy the site.

<Content>3 star resort with 5 star prices!! I was attentding a company event in february 2007, other than the weather the rest of the stay was way below par for what this hotel charged for everything.The rooms were supposed to be rennovated which they were in early ikea , plastic laminate floors in the bathrooms.They were very noisy you could here the person in the next room snoring.The service was terrible and of course no beach and the private island is totally over rated. A hamburger was $16.00 us. this is not a four seasons. Save your money and book any where but here. ron , toronto, canada

<Content>Not worth the price Hotel in poor repair. I had stayed there just last year in a very nice room; however, I was placed in a marina room that was subpar.Food was way overpriced and, in many cases, pedestrian. The folks that worked there were very nice. New owners have a long way to go to restore desirability.

<Content>Good for a weekend of sun Just spent a long weekend (Thurs ~ Mon) at the El Conquistador in Puerto Rico. I read a few of the reviews here on TripAdvisor, and have to say they were mostly accurate and very helpful in managing my expectations.The hotel is huge (close to 1,000 rooms, several buildings) and does cater heavily to corporate groups. During my stay, there were bankers and insurance agents. It does offer all the horrors of an over-built, extremely touristy place with the expected customer base. My room in the main building wasn't bad -- essentially a low-end Hyatt/Sheraton type set up, but certainly no bedbugs (mattresses are encased in a sturdy looking cover) or dank bathrooms. Housekeeping was decent too. And just as most of the reviewers on TripAdvisors said, the employees are friendly/helpful, and the place is big enough to escape whatever scene you want to avoid. Yes, the food isn't cheap, but they have enough restaurants on premise to choose from, hi-end to mid-range. What's weird is things like bottled water have a wide price range depending on where you buy it. Beyond price, you can't come here thinking you're in for a gastronomic treat. The food, at best, is OK, and if you come from a place that's food-obsessed (NY, Chicago, SF, LA, etc.), you will be disappointed. For me, the best part was the access to their 'private' island (I doubt they really own it...it also allows non-hotel guets to visit especially if they come by their own boats) via high-speed boats that simply go back and forth from 9 am till 5:30 pm. Similar to the hotel, even though it's a small island with limited beach real estate, you can still find a way to 'escape' the mob. A quick hike up and then down a dirt road leads you to a completely deserted patch of beach (there are two such 'coves' as indicated on the island map), where I was every day. Every now and then another hiker or two would come around, but otherwise I had the small patch to myself and really liked it.  The weather too, was unbeatable. So while not exactly cheap, it's not a bad place to go for a long weekend.

<Content>Money, Money, Money The Conquistador is surrounded by a beautiful well mantained golf course. If golfing is your passion this is the place to be. There were several of us in our party and some of the group stayed in the newly renovated Las Breezes rooms which were very nice. The other half of the group stayed on the other side of the resort which was very outdated and in desperate need of repair. Bring your wallet, your bank card, your credit card and your first born because you will pay an arm and a leg for everything at this resort. A 20oz. coca-cola will cost you between $2.50 - 3.50. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is $9.00. Not to mention the outrageous resort tax and resort tarriff which is an additional $51.00 per day. There is also a service charge of @20-25% which is a built in tip.What I am most displeased about is the accounting department at the Conquistador. We are still in contact with them regarding charges that should not have been applied to our credit card. I would have thought that a resort of this magnitude would be a well maintained operation of excellence.

<Content>Definitely NOT a 5 Start Resort The El Conquistador may have been classified as a 5 Star when first constructed years ago but today I would classify as a 3.5 star resort. The location is beautiful! That said, trying to get to the beach requires getting on a cable car and then catching a water taxi to Palomino island. If you want to go to the beach, give yourself 30-45 minutes to get there as the hotel has 2 of these cable car type buggys and one has been broken for weeks so everyone has to use just one. Overall, This resort has fallen into disrepair with water stained ceilings, corrosion on many of the elevators, permanent stains on carpets and fabrics, ripped carpets, etc..The resort is under a major rennovation at the moment and the new rooms are going with a very Art-Deco theme. The porblem is that when you look out of these rooms, you are looking at a construction site with tools and heavy equipment everywhere as well as lots of noise. The couches in these rooms have 2 coushions on them but the look and feel more like crib matresses. They are plastic and feel like a rock.We moved our room from the new section to the building overlooking the pool. I would call these rooms vintage. I love old world spanish looking decor but the hotel rooms were dingy and lacked charm. Ripped carpets, plain walls, cracked tiles, and water stains were all apparent in my room and true also for the others I was traveling with (16 rooms in total).The pools were nice but the drinks were pricey. It was $60+ dollars for 3 frozen drinks and 3 bottles of water. ouch!We travel frequently and for the money spent, I think someone could do much better at on another island.

<Content>Beautiful but pricey The location is absolutely beautiful and the views spectacular. Palomino Island which is a ferry away that you take on the property was beautiful with tons of water activities. Upon your arrival you are treated like a king and our oceanview room was incredible! Unfortunately, we went when a million conventions were going on and reconstruction so we were unable to secure an oceanview suite. However, there are two problems with this resort. If you don't have a car or familiar with this part of Puerto Rico you are stuck on the resort. In fact the entrance to the resort is maybe a good 8 miles away so forget about walking into the main street. As such, you are stuck and can depend on only there cuisine which was mostly Italian ironically. The one resturant with Spanish cuisine (El Caribe) the food wasn't very good. The food overrall is very expensive and not worth the price although we did enjoy the breakfast buffet at Las Brisas. Again, expensive as you have to pay full price even for a child (my son is 3 and eats like a bird.) The second problem is lack of communication or training of the employees. We specifically went to visit Vieques and Culebra which is very close. We were told throughout our trip the only way to reach these islands was to rent a private boat for $2,000.00 for the day! On our very last day we learned for $20.00 we could have taken a cab to a ferry that would take us to these islands. They actually had a flyer that they never submitted to us although we asked the Consieur's desk about this, marina activities, bellhops, waitresses, etc.... This was our biggest pet peeve. They really didn't promote outside activities with other vendors and it was difficult to obtain this information even when you asked for it. I think the biggest problem at this hotel is the Consieur's desk where all traveler's really depend on. My father stated he felt like he was in prison. We left on Valentine's day to San Juan and stayed at El Condado Plaza. That is my next review.

<Content>Luxury and relaxation Lovely get away. Hotel is wonderful, up high overlooking the ocean. Food excellant, although pricey; consider the meal plan. Spa great. Pool is huge. Must take a launch to an island beach; always easier to get to, on the way back everyone tends to leave the same time, so there is usually a wait.

<Content>Great Place To Go!!!! From the time we were greeted by the resort staff at the airport, it was great!!! The hotel has shuttle at the airport that you can take to the resort, of course at a cost (about $60 pp). It offers round trip transportation along with free refreshments. On the ride we were a little worried because we had to ride through parts of Puert rico I would never want to visit. Once we arrived at the resort, we were more than excited. The grounds were beautiful. Check in was fast and the bell hop (Efrain) was very informative. Restaurants was great, a tad bit overpriced. Palomino Island was the best!!!! The Casino need s an overhaul, the nightlife at the resort could use a liitle sprucing up, but overall we had a great time. If you are looking for a vacation that offers total relaxation, you must visit the El Conquistador Resort. This is a family resort, so bring the kids as well. It is plenty for them to do. Check out the resort website, everything that it claims to be it is. For last minute trips, try booking through SITE59. Hope you enjoy as much as we did.

<Content>So many flaws, I started keeping a list If ever there were a hotel in need of a complete makeover from top to bottom, it is the El Conquistador. As another poster put it, this resort is way past its prime. It's a good thing they're remodeling. Very few things were noticably good. Lots were bad. Here is my list, starting with the good:My main complaint was the food and drink prices. I guess when you go to a resort, you are taking yourself out of the free market where competition drives prices down and you kind of expect it. But at the El Con, they've gone mad. A 2-person meal with wine was well over $100 (at all restaurants -- there were no bargain places). Small drinks by the pool and private island were $8 each. There was no escape other than to purchase an over-priced bottle of liquor or wine and make your own drinks. Good luck doing that on the beach (the only one is on the private island). We attempted to order pizza from dominoes and Pizza Hut, but they said that El Con security prevents delivery. Breakfast was $25 each... does that give you an idea of how bad this place was? As for the room, there were chips and stains all over including couch, lampshades, walls, floors, etc. It was small and there was mildew in shower. TV and _jambox_ (circa 1995) were awful. On one particular outing to find ice, I found that the 5th floor ice machine was broken... as was the one on the 4th floor. Finally I found ice on the third floor but couldn't help but notice that the stairwell light was out (and dangerous) and all three ice machines were completely different. A nitpick? Yes. But this is supposed to be a 5-star resort.When trying to rent a car one night (to get the hell out of there) we found that the car rental guy had skipped out 15 minutes early... dooming us to another night trapped at the resort. We later found out all rentals had to be 24 hours and were at least $80 for an economy... not worth it.The service was not really too bad except for an incident where we waited 30-45 minutes for a corkscrew and two wine glasses (after asking two separate workers) and finally I had to go get them myself from a bar near the casino. Took me 5 minutes.There was no wireless internet which, for a technophile like myself, was a major pain. There was wired internet in the hotel room, but that prevented sitting on the balcony with my laptop. Internet was $15 per day.The gift shops were overpriced and pretty crappy. Most of them looked like mostly empty shelves with a few dusty, random items placed on the shelves. On two separate occassions, I noticed that the cigar humidor doors were sitting wide open which dries out the cigars. Bring your own.The activities were there, but all expensive. Frankly, I didn't trust the hotel enough to provide me with a good value for the money, so I cancelled a scuba diving session. The private island was cool, I guess, and the ferries over there were prompt and fast (a recent improvement, I learned). However, the horseback riders went by at one point and I noticed... they weren't on the beach and they were walking slowly in a controlled single-file line. If you think you're going to ride a horse freely on the beach, forget it. Also, the beach was nasty with seaweed and jagged coral and rocks pretty much anywhere you attempted to walk. Hardly anybody was in the water.The casino was small and had no Texas Hold-em poker. Just mindless games of chance.All the gift shops and restaurants took paper records of all purchases. What was the point of the swipable card they gave us if not to charge things to the room? By the way, the cards had our names printed in black on a black background, so all the waiters and service people had to ask my last name. Again, a nitpick, but a further demonstration of the lack of attention to detail. When you added them all up, they got annoying when you're supposed to be having a good time.The final straw of this place's suckiness was the unexpected $132 charge for two people for shuttle service to and from the airport. There's nothing worse I hate than completely unexplained, unanticipated charges, especially ones that are an obvious money-grab.The best part of the resort was the infinity pool which is, technically, off limits to El Con guests. It's for the Las Casitas people only (the golf villas on site). But as you'd expect from the El Con staff, nobody cared or noticed that we just walked right in. That was the only part that was actually good.The bottom line is, by choosing this resort, you are submitting to the price gouging and crappiness. My travelling companion and I both agreed that Puerto Rico is probably best done in a 5 star hotel near San Juan. That way, the competitive forces of being able to walk down the street to a twice-as-nice, half-as-expensive steakhouse (not to mention other things like rainforest tours, scuba, etc) start to have a positive effect.Avoid the El Con at all costs. Seriously.

<Content>Cannot wait to go back! Is it too soon to book next year's trip?? We loved this hotel. Yes it had it's issues (loud construction on the partial oceanview and garden view rooms side of the hotel, very expensive food) but overall it is a beautiful hotel with great service. Rooms were beautiful and plush with huge bathrooms. Palomino Island is spectactular with a white sand beach and lapping waves (not the rough surf that the mainland gets). I thought the boat ride would be a pain but it was only 8 minutes and so nice to speed over the literally turquoise water. There are many fun shops to browse. The food of Puerto Rico is fantastic - just don't eat it here. Go to any of the local restaurants the Concierge recommends (especially Pasion down the road - the great food offsets the unpleasant management). Rent a car - it pays for itself and the hotel is very easy to get to.

<Content>Great week at the El Con Just came back from the El Con in Puerto Rico where we stayed in the Casitas in a 2 bedroom condo. We had perfect weather except for 1 afternoon - in fact we had to get out of the sun by 3pm everyday. The pools were clean and clear. The one slide was great - they are planning to build a new water park by next Dec. There were so many pools to chose from and the infinity pool at the Casitas South was incredible. The Palomino Beach was easy to get to - new boats go faster so it is only 10 minutes. Once you are there, a unbrella or cover is needed, the sun is so strong. The rental of floats, jet skis and snorkle equipment made it more enjoyable, but the water was clear and easy to spend the day in. All the chairs at pool and beach were comfortable and the towels large enough. The food service was good, but on island time. The restaurants are expensive (expected when on an island) and the Strip House, Blosssoms, and Stingray Cafe are great. The Italian, Otello's was ok. The casual places, Buena Vista and the one by the Marina were good, with Buena Vista being better. The Golden Door spa is exceptional. I had a massage and Pineapple Bliss Scrub. Both were great and they treated me like a queen. The spa is expensive, but you feel well taken care of. Overall, my 8 year old boys made friends and had a lot of fun and we enjoyed the place very much. We would return, but only until they finish the rennovations since it will be too crowded once up to occupancy.

<Content>Mostly Good Stayed in February over President's Week. We arrived a few days before the busy weekend. The pool was quiet and the staff relaxed. A few times the pool staff passed around complimentary fruit. The facilities are a bit tired, our casita could have used some updating and wasn't very clean.But it was nice and the service was good. We had reserved a newspaper to arrive daily and of course only got it 4 times. It was those little touches that were missing or ignored. Do not eat at the hotel. The food is overpriced and really not that good. We ate at Blossoms and Otellos are both were just ok. We had a horrible situation at Otellos but it wasn't the food. There was a group of 10, 4 adults, 6 over tired, over spoiled toddlers or younger and these children screamed endlessly the entire meal. The pathetic parents didn't do a thing to stop it. Now, the reason we blame the staff for this is that no one walked over and asked the parents to keep their children quiet. They didn't seem to care that the other patrons in the restaurant were being tortured.Pasion was fabulous, we ate there 2 times. Metropol was good, La Estacion was just ok. Funky atmosphere, but the food was just ok. We only went to Palomino once and it was nice but alot of work to get to from Las Casitas. We had a rental car (from Charleys, they were great to deal with) and it paid for itself in a week. We went to Luquillo Beach which was fabulous, Seven Seas Beach was beautiful. We even ate lunch at the Kiosks on Luquillo Beach which was great, and cheap. Having a rental car really helps make the visit more pleasurable.I'd recommend this hotel with some reservations but overall we had a great time.

<Author>PennProf
<Content>Had a great President's Day weekend I've read all the reviews on this web site before and after our trip. Overall I'd say they are fairly accurate, it IS possible to have a wonderful stay at the El Conquistador at a very reasonable cost. We upgraded to a newly renovated room in Las Brisas, which had brand new ultramodern furniture (and white LCD TV) and a spectacular view. When we were there they had a sign at the check in desk offering this. Also by staying in the central part of the large property, nothing was very far away. We actually took evening walks all around for exercise and to enjoy the lovely grounds, stars and fresh air. The newly renovated exercise room (included in the resort charge) was great with a view of the water. I am a golfer and i really enjoyed the course. It was great to have a Championship layout instead of a resort course. I played once at 1pm for a much more reasonable $100 and once at 3:30 for $70 (rather than the normal $175). The times I played the course was pretty empty (except for the plentiful iguanas everywhere) I also hit balls on the range for $15 (a little pricey but I got my money's worth with unlimited balls). Wife and daughter used the Spa once which they enjoyed.We did not spend time at the main pools which were quite crowded and more of the 3.5 to 4 star ambience. We loved the Island including the ferry ride. Yes it takes awhile to get there, its an island out in the ocean. The boats were modern and fast.Food was about what we expected, we alternated breakfasts between the Cafe Caribe (coffee shop) in the Lobby and the Las Brisas buffet. Prices in the cafe were pretty reasonable for basic breakfasts. Buffet was high at $25 , although we enjoyed the great fruit and omlettes and ate enough to skip lunch.The fresh local catch at Stingray's (dorado and tuna) was excellent and we went there twice for the same thing. The other hotel restaurants didn't appeal to us and appeared pretty expensive. One night we had salads and pizzas outside which was all we wanted. I played texas hold em in the casino (they have one table) and it was fun. In room internet was very fast if expensive at $15 a day. Service is available in the lobby for $5/hr, pcs or wifi.Staff was great all around.Just dont expect a five star experience, until the new owners are able to complete their capital improvements. We met lots of families and they were having a great time.

<Content>Extremely disappointed This is definately no longer a 5 star resort. This is a distressed property that was recently bought by a new company app a year ago but since the place is so enourmous it will take them forever to renovate all parts. The place is so HUGE and spread out that nothing is centrally located to anything. Be prepared for it to take about an hour to actually get to the beach since you have to take a boat to an island. We had to change our room. First room was in main part. I knew the room would be old and musty when I stepped into the elevator. Paint all chipped, etc. The room was HORRIBLE. Smelled old and mildewy. Everything old and nasty. Green scum growing on patio door. We upgraded to the LAS CASITAS and although it was better, by no means is this 5 star or even 4 star material ($500+/night!!!). You are also supposed to have a personal butler at the LAS CASITAS. Well, we received a phone call 3 days into stay to call him if we needed anything. Food was ok and way overpriced. They ran out of mint leaves for Mojitos (awesome cuban drink). We were here for a conference so a lot of our meals were paid for. I recommend staying away from this place for a few years until it is COMPLETELY renovated and even then I still wouldn't stay here. Again---way too spread out.

<Content>Beautiful location My husband and I spent a week in early January 2007 at the El Conquistador Resort. From the moment that we approached the shuttle at the airport until we were dropped off for our return flight, the service was friendly and efficient. The lobby and resort still had spectacular Christmas decorations up since they celebrated 3 Kings Day while we were there. Our room overlooked the pool area and out to the ocean. It was well equipped and comfortable. There was always a lovely breeze and the soft shimmery sound of the palms rustling in the wind was very pleasant. We particularly enjoyed Palomino Island where we were able to choose an area relatively isolated for the number of people who were over there. The resort could probably do a little work on the grounds over there but it was quite charming and a great place to relax and soak up the sun. The food was wonderful and the frozen mango mojito's were the icing on the cake! We would love to go back and spend another vacation at the El Conquistador Resort.

<Content>A specatcular resort The El Conquistador is a beautiful and polished resort. It is very large and self contained, with 4 truly high class restaurants and many other bars and eating places.The outstanding features are the views and the grounds which are well kept and full of flowers, and the private island (Palomino) with regular connection via fast Catamaran. Palomino has several beaches and is large enough to allow for a brisk 45 minute walk. The brushwork is inhabited by iguanas, birds, lizards and rabbits.The room was clean and elegant, but somewhat dated. The TV and the plumbing could use updating.The service was impeccable. The staff was friendly and professional, but not folksy. The only drawback was some construction noise and renovation work, but this should be solved within this year.We payed $299 per day for the room (taxes and resort fee included), which seemed to us reasonable.We stayed for a week. This was our third visit, and we plan to visit again.

<Content>Past Its Prime My overall rating is average, but it's a balance of extreme positives and negatives. On the plus side, the setting is spectacular. The hotel complex, set into the slope of a sea-side mountain, provides a unique panorama. The hotel beach, which is on an island three miles away, is also above average. On the negative side, the ocean-view room we stayed in has not been maintained well and was far too shabby and unclean given the rate we paid. The food was also overpriced and very poor quality. I believe that, for the same price, you can find a much more appealing place to stay in Puerto Rico.

<Content>This place is a dump I stayed at the El Conquistador in Feb 2007 and was shocked how much of a dump this hotel was. After entering the lobby you notice the cracks in the walls and columns and how everything is completely dated. When we were shown into our rooms which cost close to $500/night, I had no words to describe how disgusting it was (bulbs were burnt out, large dark stains on the furniture, curtains ripped, sheets had dirt/dried particles, once white towels were dingy grey, and the bathroom were gross (faucets didn't look even wiped down and fingerprint marks/dried liquids were visible). In addition the food was gross. When I returned to work, I found out a coworker also stayed at this resort and had a similar experience.

<Content>Itchy Nice hotel, great people working there for the most part. Loved the boat ride and the views. Island was nice but needs more regular detailing. Water shoes a necessity for enjoying water. Nothing to see there if snorkeling (gotta take a boat trip for that). Not the white sandy Caribbean sea type beach, but okay. Many storms headed overhead toward El Yunque right over the little Island on some days; local boaters park and splash there on weekends.But: Too many people on cell phones in too many places where you're trying to have a relaxing time; and too many corporate groups. Constant loud salsa beat every minute everywhere was taxing day after day. Are there really that many horn players in Puerto Rico? Otello's (Italian) was great, but undercooked pasta ruined the meal. No dentures please. Al dente with pink cement sauce wtih peas (each pea worth a poker chip). Smoky casino with great large tv screens for basketball. Great coffee shop has Internet rentals by the hour (not less). If you leave before the hour is up, people JUMP OUT of the walls to get on the computer for free for your leftover time. More restaurant reviews: Blossoms was JUST ok. Stingray was very good. Watch out for the ten dollar perrier or spring water there and at Otello's. El Caribe was bad for dinner but okay for small breakfast. Las Brisas breakfast buffet was great and worth it. All else was very high (over)priced. Save the great petite sandwiches at the coffee shop at the top of the Tram. Ventured off the property once for a dinner at Ocean View restaurant withinn walking distance from the Marina at the hotel. Nice and priced right meal, but shady characters in cars abounded on the dark secluded walk to and from that little circle and beach park with the bio bay operators. Again great hotel. Great golf -- not for beginners. Great hot tub -- but could be hotter -- overlooking the ocean. Oh, I forgot -- the kicker: I left with a tan and a chestful of red bites which broke out at home this morning, three days after checkout and back at the daiy grind. The Mrs. sez they're bed bug bites. I'm not sure. But I believe her. The room had old carpet, headboards and beds and a large dried blood splatter on the outside topcover sheet on my bed the first night. The comforter on top was old and pilled. The hanging art on the wall was made by a junior high art class? All in all a nice vacation, however

<Content>Worth the View however The Grounds and the views are breathtaking. The rooms are scheduled for renovation. We were told all will be completed by 2008. We were not pleased with the condition of the furniture, decor and fixtures in our room. Terribly outdated and in most cases worn or dirty.All food is over priced, however, Blossoms, and the Stingray Cafe served us fresh, delicious and superbly cooked elegant meals.Palomino Island is where thier beach is. Other than having to take the new faster ferry boat over, it is very nice. The water wonderful and the sand into the water was free of most rocks or other debris. Especially if when facing the Island you go in off to the left of the dock.There is a tremendous amount of walking to get about the hotel, so this is not good for those with physical handicaps or out of shape.The staff was always friendly and accomodating.There is a very poor nightlife. The weekends offer a bit more, but still lacks in anything lively.Personally, there are far better places to spend alot of money.

<Content>Nice Place This was my second time here. I was with my wife and a bunch of other couples. The hotel itself needs some updating but the grounds are beautiful. The food was very good and the staff was very pleasant. The views are magnificent. The beach , which you have to go to by boat (8 min ride) was very nice. Overall this experience was a pleasant one, but i wouldn't go back unless the hotel was updated.

<Content>Great Location....Good Hotel I should start this review by stating that my overall opinion for this hotel is above average. The Good: The location is wonderful. Perched about 300 feet above the Atlantic Ocean, this resort spots stunning views of the surrounding scenary. The hotel even has a Marina-level accomodation, so you can either stay by the sea or have a breathtaking view of it! The staff was superb. Every single staff member said hello to me throughout my 6 day stay. If there were problems, which I will get to a bit later, the staff addressed them with acute awareness and provided a prompt resolution. The island beach was well serviced with a restaurant and bar, as well as many hundreds of lounge chairs. The casino is small but adequate. The food was wonderful but pricey. The many pools were warm by day but cool at night, and were quite nice. This resort definately feels luxerious but there is much to be desired...The Bad: Maintanance was very bad. Throughout the stay, the elevators were out of commision on more than one occasion. The funicular was constantly breaking down...at least once a day...and always at the worst time. The hotel does provide a back-up shuttle van service, however when we were in a hurry this was not a quick solution. Our hotel room was nice but was very aged. We were located at the Marina-level with a nice view of the ocean. However there were lights that were burned out, and some moldings at the doorways were cracked. But again, the staff addressed most of these concerns with a friendly attitude and prompt resolution.The Verdict: For the price that they are charging, this hotel needs to be and is being improved. The contruction is not noticeable except when entering the hotel (I never heard any construction noise the entire stay). If you can find a good deal, and there are many out there, stay here! The grounds are beautiful. The atmosphere is wonderful. The food is great! As long as you go into this resort knowing the drawbacks, and there are some, the stay can and will be a trip of a lifetime. The key deciding factor in my recommendation was the staff. Without the warm and friendly staff, I would not have recommended this resort, plain and simple. So it appears to me that the hotel's brick and mortar needs to be improved, but its hard working staff does not.

<Content>Beautiful Resort I was fortunate to have been given this trip by my boss. I took a good friend of mine ( Jan. 20th-25th) and we had a great time. The views were terrific, the staff were very friendly and accomidating to your needs and wants. Our room overlooked the aqua colored waters with the palm trees swaying in the warm breezes. What a site! Yes, the food and drinks were on the high end but if you paid to stay there you should know that. The ride on the ferry to the beach was spectacular- it took no longer than 10-15 minutes and it was not an inconvience- it was an adventure. Check out the chickens and rabbits on Palimino Island- they will eat out of your hand! We went off the resort twice to eat in a little local restaurant - the food was good and less expensive than the resort. Overall the surroundings were fabulous and would recommend this resort to anyone who loves to relax in the beautiful sunshine, doesn't mind walking alot around the scenic resort ( wear comfortable shoes)and just needs to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Puerto Rico is just breathtaking and I hope to go back there again. Enjoy yourself...

<Content>Travelled with three children My three children ages 9, 14, 16 and I stayed at the El Conquistador from Jan 20-25, 2007. We had a one bedroom suite on the fourth floor adjacent to the Golden Door Spa. Our room was beautiful and spacious and if you can afford it, I highly recommend the bigger room when staying with children. The main entrance to the suite was awe inspiring. We just said WOW!. To the left of the open foyer was the bar. It had a marble countertop, two cushioned bar stools w/ backs, two refrigerators under the sink/countertop. The dining room had a six seating table, the living room had several wicker chairs w/ cushions a nice sofa and a full sized bed that you pulled out of the wall. The view of the ocean and Palomino Island was breathtaking. Down the hall was the bathroom with shower, safe and toilet room (yes the toilet is in it's own room).The master bedroom had a king sized bed, walk-in closet, master bath with whirlpool, shower and toilet room. It also had a wet bar with mini bar fridge under the sink. It had a beautiful entertainment cabinet with a tv, dvd player and Sony Playstation. You have to rent the games though. There was a small living room off of the master bedroom with a single pull-out sofa bed with tv  the works as well. The suite was beautifully decorated with a sort of Island Pottery Barn look.The food was spectacular at every restauarant we went to. It is VERY expensive though. It's about $17 for a salad or hamburger and at the restaurants everything is ala carte, ie: $9 for a baked potato. But we did not have one bad meal. The service is also very good.Taking the funicular down to the marina was a bit of a project. You couldn't just walk down and go to the beach. You had to take the funicular down to the marina and wait for the ferry to take you to the private island where the beach was. The ferry ran every 1/2 hr and only took about 8 minutes to get there, but we just missed the ferry and had to sit and wait for the next one so from the time we left our room it was about 45 minutes until we got to the beach. But when you get there it is worth the wait. We were on vacation and in no hurry to do anything. Once we got to the island it was paradise. You can rent innertubes or floats (about $10 for the day each). There is also jet skiing, snorkeling, etc. For a fee of course. Don't expect ANYTHING to be included. They charge you for everything.If I had one complaint to make about our stay it would be the problem w/ our shower. We rarely ever had hot water and everytime I called for help they told me they're having problems with the steam. One day we had no hot water at all.Mostly though it was a positive experience.

<Content>Awesome views When you first arrive at the hotel you are immediately taken care of. The staff is very friendly, the rooms nice (as nice as more expensive resorts), the views spectacular. There is also a great little island that a free ferry takes you to daily. The hotel itself has no beach so you have to go to the island. The only downside is the cost of food but the rooms are so cheap that it all works out.

<Content>Overall nice hotel First impressions: Well, this is quite a hike from the San Juan Marin airport. We rented a car and drove to and from the resort. It鈥檚 at least an hour away鈥攎aybe more or less depending on traffic. We were warned that it would take 2-3 hours to get to the resort during rush hour traffic鈥攚hich begins at about 3:30 p.m. We鈥檙e glad we did the rental car option, as we wanted to do a bit of exploring and try area restaurants. I will say, the driving there is a bit chaotic鈥攍ots of red light runners and people with cars that shouldn鈥檛 be on the road in the first place. You鈥檒l pass about 500 beer joints on the way to the resort, but that seems to be par for the course for the whole island from what I hear. It鈥檚 like an Americanized Mexico. Most people speak English and they take U.S. dollars. I thought the local prices of things were comparable or less than that on the mainland. As we approached the resort, it reminded me of Mexico鈥攄irty streets, chickens, and unmarked roads. The entrance to the resort is staffed by a guard. You will also see a lot of police cars on Highway 3鈥攁 welcome sight! They leave their flashing lights on all the time. You drive through part of the golf course to get to the resort. The lobby and reception area are very nice and breezy. I have heard from many people who have been to Puerto Rico many times and they all say that this is one of the very best resorts on the whole island. The views to the ocean are spectacular.Construction: They are building a new convention center area at the front of the resort, but we didn鈥檛 hear much noise and we were in a building close to the work area.Parking: There is self parking for $15 per day in front of the construction zone, away from the hotel, but it鈥檚 a good 10-minute walk from the hotel lobby. It鈥檚 $25 per day for the valet service, which was quick. It also seemed to rain frequently for brief periods鈥攕o chances are, if you do the self parking, you鈥檙e going to get rained on. To me, it was worth the extra $10 per day to do the valet parking.Demographic: I put the average age at the resort between 40 and 50 years old. There seemed to be a lot of people there from the East Coast. I honestly don鈥檛 remember seeing any children at the resort. It鈥檚 not that they don鈥檛 cater to families鈥攊t鈥檚 probably that the food is so expensive.Pools and beach: There isn鈥檛 a 鈥渂each鈥?at the hotel鈥攊t鈥檚 about a 25-minute ferry ride to Palomino Island鈥攖he private island for the hotel. We took the ride out to see the beach, but didn鈥檛 spend much time there. I heard that several of the boats kept breaking down. You have to take a funicular tram (only one tram out of two was working) down the mountain from the main lobby to get to the marina area to the ferry. Overall, it takes about 45 minutes from the top of the hotel to get to the beach. There are several nice pools throughout the area.Spa: This was the highlight of the trip for me. The Golden Door Spa is gorgeous and worth every penny. The cost is less than Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa, and the experience is wonderful. A 20% service charge (for the gratuity) and tax are automatically added to the bill. A 50-minute massage was $146 total, I believe, and a 25-minute herbal wrap was $66. With the spa service, you can use the workout area and attend fitness classes (areas looked nice), and also the steam room and Jacuzzi areas of the spa. There are separate areas for men and women with a tearoom in the middle that is coed. The steam room has Eucalyptus steamed in鈥攙ery refreshing. I liked the Gold Door products you get to use at the spa (all complimentary). I was able to book two separate appointments at the spa at the last minute. I was impressed with this. My masseuse said there are 60 massage therapists on staff, I believe. Service: We experienced pleasant service everywhere at the resort and also the local community. I will say that these people appear to be on 鈥渋sland time.鈥?If you鈥檝e ever been to Hawaii, you鈥檒l know what I mean. It literally took us 30 minutes at McDonald鈥檚 outside the resort to get our order with 12 people working behind the counter. Everybody is nice鈥t鈥檚 just a slower pace and can be frustrating if you don鈥檛 expect it.Rooms: There are about 1,000 rooms here, housed within 4 separate sections. There are rooms at the top of the mountain where most of the restaurants and lobby are. There are rooms down the side of the mountain. You have to take a funicular tram down the mountain to get to these rooms. It鈥檚 kind of a long walk and long wait for the tram ride sometimes. There aren鈥檛 stairs to get down there鈥攜ou have to take the tram. I鈥檓 glad we stayed in a room at the top鈥攊t seemed to take a while to get down to the lower level rooms. Our bed seemed to have a new comforter and pillows but the mattress seemed old. The rooms definitely need a little updating from what I saw and heard from other guests, but our room was kept very clean by housekeeping. I was surprised to see our room had a mini refrigerator and also a coffee maker. A lot of full-service hotels and resorts don鈥檛 have either these days. There鈥檚 a mini bar, private balcony with plastic furniture鈥ust your basic upscale Howard Johnson hotel in my book. The walls are paper thin鈥攜ou can hear absolutely everything, and I mean everything (!), in the next room(s). There is tile outside the rooms and housekeeping seemed extremely noisy. If you are a light sleeper, you would do well to bring your own ear plugs, a fan, or just stay at another resort. Most of the guests are older or couples, so it鈥檚 not like there are partiers everywhere鈥ut just normal conversation can be heard from the next room. I heard this comment from several of the guests staying there.Food: We ate at Otello鈥檚 and Strip House, on the main level, and the restaurant/bar and also Stingray鈥檚 at the bottom of the funicular tram. Otello鈥檚 (Italian) was very good. Strip House (steak) is part of a chain and is very upscale with dark red and black colored interior. Stingray鈥檚 is seafood and is very good. It鈥檚 close to the restaurant/bar at the bottom of the funicular tram on the marina, so if there is a sports game on TV, you can say goodbye to a quiet, romantic dinner. All of the food at the resort was good鈥攋ust really expensive, even compared to other resorts we have stayed at. It was $13 for a basic sub sandwich and French fries at the restaurant/bar. Otello鈥檚 entrees start at $25 each. Strip House is probably more. I ate a lot of appetizers. On the plus side, entr茅e portions are average to large, so at least you aren鈥檛 paying too much for a tiny portion.Shopping: There must be at least 15 stores in the resort. We preferred the stores here to those in Old San Juan (please see below).Outside the resort: The resort is close to Walmart, McDonald鈥檚, KFC, Subway, Quizno鈥檚, etc. There is a fantastic restaurant called El Pasion that is about 5 minutes away. Just exit the main gates and turn left and follow down to the marina area. El Pasion is upscale and the seafood is wonderful. Angel at the attractions desk recommended this to us and it was one of the best dining experiences of our trip. Also, Lolita鈥檚 in the city of Luqillo is very good and appears to attract a lot of locals.Attractions: I did the bioluminescent night kayak tour through the hotel鈥攁bout $72 total per person. This was really neat, and they claim there are only 2 or 3 areas in the world where you can see this. Microscopic plankton (algae) eat the roots of a special tree close to the marina and it makes them appear to 鈥済low鈥?at night when the water is agitated. You take a 2-person kayak out to the bay. As the oars hit the water, they start to light up. The water was very calm but it was pitch black. I am in good physical condition, but it was still a challenging trip. If you are the least bit overweight or physically challenged, I wouldn鈥檛 recommend this. The guide lets you jump in the water and as you move your arms and legs鈥攜ou appear to 鈥済low鈥?in the dark. It鈥檚 really neat.Rain Forest: I just wasn鈥檛 that impressed with this. The road wasn鈥檛 marked very well at all to get to the El Yunque Rain Forest from either direction. You have to turn through a dirty looking storefront area to get to the highway. You鈥檇 think they鈥檇 mark a national park more clearly. Hawaii is much better than this. There are some hiking trails, but we only drove through the park and then back out鈥攜ou drive up the mountain, turn around, and then drive back down. The welcome center was nice.Old San Juan: I don鈥檛 recommend this. It reminded me of a dirty Old Town Albuquerque or Santa Fe. There are a few upscale stores, Coach, etc., but it鈥檚 over an hour to get there from the hotel and parking is worse than New York City. A lot of the souvenir stores were crummy鈥攑lastic everything and cheap t-shirts. I liked the stores at the resort better than this and it was worth it to pay a little more to get better quality items. The streets are narrow and dirty. It reminded me of New Orleans but with narrower streets and sidewalks that are barely 4-feet wide. There are some historic sights in Old San Juan such as El Morro fortress, churches, and the governor鈥檚 mansion, but it just wasn鈥檛 worth it with the traffic and parking situation. I went back to the hotel and spoke with the concierge about this and she recommended certain parking lots鈥攂ut they were all full when we were down there.

<Content>Don't stay here -- spare your hard earned money... This place is run down and has very poor service. I had better furniture in my fraternity house. This place is tired and needs much improvement to be worth the price of admission. The staff is poor and most of the restaurants are of equal quality. I would have been better off staying at a Motel 6.... Stay at your own risk...

<Content>Okay hotel but definitely not a Luxury Resort I stayed at this hotel for three nights in mid January for a quick break after a business trip in San Juan. I was a bit concerned after reading the mixed reviews. After visiting I also have mixed reviews over the property.On the positive side, our room, which was not technically ocean front or ocean view had an amazing view of the golf course, El Yunque (the Rain Forest) and a distant view of the water. Definitely better than expected. The grounds were exceptionally beautiful and the private island was great. Although it took about 20 minutes to reach the island, it was worth the trip. (Later this month they should begin using the new high-speed ferry which will cut the trip down to about 8 minutes) Great, uncrowded beaches (although I travelled off-peak during the week). There was a great variety of things to see and do and the beaches were great (much calmer, clearer and warmer than San Juan). On the island we saw roosters, hens, rabbits, iguanas and even a stray hermit crab roaming the beach. The island also has horseback riding, jet-skiing, snorkeling trips and rafts available for rent (at a cost of course).Now for the negatives. While the room had a beautiful room, it was quite filthy. The bed cover on one of the beds had huge fresh blood stains all over it (on the inside facing the bed) and was covered in hair. When we called to complain we were told that we just shouldn't use the cover for sleeping as it was only decorative. After arguing with housekeeping for a while they finally removed it and promised to bring a fresh bed cover later in the day. During our three days, we never saw one brought in. They just made the beds with the sheet. Not a huge problem but certainly shows a lack of care espeically considering this is considered a luxury resort.The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the mattresses definitely need replacing now. The hotel is in the middle of renovations and we did not get a newly renovated room (not sure if any are available yet) so hopefully the problem will be fixed eventually. In the meantime get ready for an uncomfortable night's sleep.The hotel also recently installed an energy saving sensor that controls the air conditioning unit. This sensor is supposed register when you leave the room and automatically turn down the air conditioning until you return. The problem (and one that appeared to be shared by many due to numerous loud door slams we heard each night) is that it is not very good at sensing when you are in the room. Each night it took several tries of opening/closing the door before it would actually register us as in the room and keep the room at a comfortable temperature. Unfortunately it took us one night of roasting to figure this out. They should have some sort of bypass feature that allows this system to turn on when you manually adjust the air conditioner (as obviously you must be in the room to turn it on).Finally, like many other people indicated the restaurants were mostly overpriced for average food. Especially noteworthy was the $16 basic cheeseburger at Palomino Island and the $8 mixed drinks served in tiny, tiny cups. This hotel was ok although the pools and the rooms desperately need some updating. If you have a bad back or have trouble getting around this place is not for you. The beds will exacerbate back problems and navigating the hotel requires a lot of walking and climbing. If you can get a really, really good deal on the place and don't mind outdated, dirty rooms and overpriced food, then you'll this hotel is fine. The island was fantastic and for the most part the staff was nice (with the exception of the person who answered the phone at housekeeping). If not, I drove by the Westin and it seemed to be quite nice and was fairly close by. Even better it's right on the beach.If you go, I definitely recommend renting a car. A 3 day rental of a compact car cost $73 for 3 days including taxes. Driving was easy (the drivers aren't as crazy as in San Juan) and it provides you with a great deal of convenience. It is also significantly cheaper than the hotel's shuttle or a taxi. There are some great restaurants not too far from the hotel property. I highly recommend the Anchor Inn (take a left when you leave the hotel gates and it will be about a mile down on your right). Great food and service! Also, Cafe Caribe in the hotel had decent breakfast at a reasonable price (about $8 a person). They also had passable Puerto Rican food at reasonable prices for lunch and dinner.

<Content>Just Average We won a trip to the El Con for a week. The shuttle from the airport was comfortable. I would complain about the $45 cost per person for the one way shuttle trip if we had to pay for it. When we arrived, the wait at the check in counter took almost 30 minutes even though we were next in line. The staff member who checked us in was kind. We arrived two hours before check in and our room was not ready. I thought they would put us in another room since the hotel was almost empty but we had to wait for our room to be cleaned and to make it up they bought us lunch, probably because we were contest winners. When we got to the room, the water was not working. They told us that the pipes were being worked on and that the water would come back on at 4pm. The guy who helped us check in wanted to move us to another room in the Marina area but his supervisor told him not to because they would just have to move us back after the water is turned on. We took a nap and the water was on as they promised at 4pm. But the next morning we slept in cause we were on Pacific Standard Time and the water was not working again. So we called the front desk and asked how many days will they be working on the pipes. In a flash, the lady moved our room to the Marina. The Marina area was nice but the bed was not comfortable. Also for the hot tub you have to go the main level which is a tram ride up, then walk past shops, and an elevator ride to the pool level. All the rooms at the El Con are really outdated and old. The Marina rooms are a little cleaner. But the beds and maids are not as good. The restaurants are pricey and decent. The pool is not heated but opened 24 hours. The beach was okay, to us it was a little dirty so we only went to the island once and didn't swim. The ferry ride takes a long time. The casino was fun, I won the jackpot on a penny slot. The Avis Rental Cars are expensive. We paid $70 a day for a midsize with liability insurance. Parking costs $15 a day and there is a shuttle to the parking lot. I think we spent more on tips more than anything else. One of the things we really wanted to do in Puerto Rico was the Bioilluminescent Bay. Go to the one in Fajardo, it's great! I heard the one in Vieques has a lot of jellyfish. The hotel has a kayaking tour with Eco Action Tours for $65, including a ride from the hotel and back. We called them and booked the tour for $40 but had to walk to the place, less than 5 minutes from the Marina part of the El Con. They are the best tour company and Peter the one who runs it is awesome! He also does other tours and is very informative and funny.

<Content>A Lot to be Desired My travel buddy and I booked our luxury vacation in May 2006. We usually rent a car and explore and stop at a bb or hotel when we're too tired to go any farther. However, since we were travelling to Puerto Rico over the Xmas and New Year holidays, we decided to plan ahead. This time she convinced me to let's splurge a little and stay in a luxury resort and be pampered..............We booked thru Expedia. We thought we had a great deal - r/t airfare from Los Angeles, 10 days at a luxury resort with a room with an ocean view, and a car...........We arrived at the El Conquistador on Sat 12/23 after a very long flight. After a few wrong turns, we finally found it. The grounds as you enter are truly beautiful. After a while we see a self park sign - $15/day; valet park $20/day. This was the first time we had been advised that parking was another additional cost. The self park is not convenient at all. If you rent a car (and that is a must if you really want to see puerto rico) pay the extra for valet. You may have to wait 10-15 minutes to get your car, depending on how busy it is. We were not allowed to call down and have the car waiting. Not a sign of a luxury 5 diamond resortWe arrived before the after xmas crowd and check in was quick. The lobby was beautifully decorated and there were musicians singing and playing holiday music. A porter arrived to take our luggae. It took at least 15 minutes to get to our room - through the main lobby, past the casino, past the shops, down the funicular and UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS . We stayed in Las Olas Village which must be the oldest village in the hotel. While the view of the pool and the ocean below was beautiful, getting to the room through the corridor was horrible. There's no elevator (luckily we're in decent shape and needed the exercise but the poor porter carrying all that luggage) The carpets were buckling, ripped, and stained - we thought we were in another hotel. We didn't change rooms because we liked the view and the area was very quiet. No screaming kids. The room was large but the furniture and decor was 1970s. The ice machine was about a long hike. The one on the 2nd floor which was closer was inoperatable so we had to hike to the one at the very end of our 3rd floor. The ice machine room is also used to store extra beds..........another sign that this is not a Luxury Resort. The bedding and housekeeping left a lot to be desired. Supposedly, to help the environment, they change the linen every 3rd night or upon request. I'm all for the environment so I went along with that time table. However, when my sheets were changed, a torn pair was put on. I slept on them because i was just too tired to call housekeeping after a late night. We were there for 10 days and had to ask several times for refills for shower gel, shampoo, etc. There was 1 small trash can in the bathroom for the entire room. The food and drinks are so overpriced. If you don't have a car you're trapped and they have a captive audience. We went to the local market a few times and stocked up on fruit, snacks, and wine. The food in the high priced restaurants is just O.K. nothing to write about. We went on two tours - El Yunque National Forest Hike, which was a bit expensive but had a great guide. We could have driven up there ourselves but it was good having the guide to tell us about things and guide us along the trails................which are ok if you are able to walk unassisted. There is some hiking involved and when you book they don't tell you that or how long the hike is.The next tour we took which is way overpriced is the Bioluminescent Lagoon Kayak tour - it's pitch black; you're attempting to kayak through who knows what for at least 45 minutes - then you're in a lagoon and you splash around in chilly water, then kayak back for another 45 minutes. The El Conquistador IS NOT A LUXURY RESORT. Unless you get a great deal and rent a car, I would not recommend it. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

<Content>good, but not great- We travelled to the El Conquistador after several hours of agonizing over where to stay in Puerto Rico. I made my decision to stay there over the Westin based on the fact that it was a Golden Door Spa and I liked the idea of the private island.I want to say that this resort was really like being on a large cruise ship. Everything is very spread out, which will either add to its charm for you or start to annoy you. Around every corner there is another shop, cafe, or bar. This is good because you can usually get in anywhere to eat. The food is pricey but we enjoyed every meal. The Stingray Cafe and Strip House restaurant were our favorites. The Ballyhoo is also good and easy for lunch or drinks. Overall I would say if you are thinking of going I would suggest staying in the Marina area. The other rooms are noisey from the construction going on at the hotel. If you can wait a year you should, they are adding an amazing looking waterpark and updating all of the guest rooms. When this is finished it will probably be the nicest place in Puerto Rico.

<Content>Fabulous Spa with world's best Views I expected a great location from a world-class resort with amazing staff. I got that, but also experience an amazing Golden Door Spa experience. Unlike others in the world where you have to check in from Sunday to Sunday, my partner and I stayed only for a few days and did the spa 'a la carte.' We were fortunate enough to spend time over New Year's, which meant that the spa wellness classes changed from Dec 31 to Jan 1. We loved the amazing class schedule of things they have there: from mental brain training to the outside morning labyrinth with a natural labyrinth in perfectly-manicured grass (the other Golden Doors use concrete), awesome fusion creations of Yoga with T'ai Chi and meditation at their infinity pool of Las Casitas Village. They have classes named after treatments (Spirit of Life) and meals that carry the same name so that we had long experiences in the spa without ever having to leave. The instructors are amazing (we had Lawrence and Manuel) and massage therapists (Bill, Marilyn, Richard, Justiana) amazingly well trained....no wonder, as they train the staffs at other spas. Kudos to this amazing property with a great view of the Caribbean sea, one of the points of the old Bermuda triangle! We will RETURN to the Golden Door Spa and its Wellness Program!!!!

<Content>Best Spot Ever I go to El Conquistador about twice per year, and I am never disappointed. Outside of the great weather and the relatively short flight from the States (about 4-5 hours from Chicago), the place has pretty much everything I'd want to do on vacation. The golf course is really nice, and I've probably eaten at 10 different restaurants on the property. One of the restaurants has a huge buffet in the morning. The hotel also has an island just off the coast where you can lay on the beach, ride horses, rent jetskis, etc. The Spa is one of the better ones I've been to--a therapist named Christie gave me the best deep tissue massage I've ever had last time I went...which says a lot, because I had just returned from a rugby tour in Spain. The resort is giant and pretty awesome, but there's a ton of stuff to do around town as well. I found a couple good restaurants in Fajardo, and hiking in El Yunque (a nearby rainforest) was great. I also did kayaking through a mangrove system that opened into a huge bioluminescent bay. I think you can also charter a boat to go deep sea fishing--a couple guys golfing there caught an absolutely gigantic marlin off the coast. I'm probably forgetting something, but the concierge pretty much sets everything up. One of the better things about the place is that the staff is super nice, and they all speak English. People seem like they are happy to work there...I guess I would be too if I lived in 80 degree weather all the time. The other guests at the hotel are usually couples or families, although there was a large tournament last time I went that brought in a bunch of golfers. People are always friendly, and there are enough spots on the property that I can find peace and quiet (or a party, depending what you're into). Overall, the only reason I go someplace else for vacation is if El Conquistador doesn't have what I'm looking for--since I started going there 2 years ago, I havent yet faced that problem :)

<Content>Fabulous Resort My family and I spent a week at this beautiful property. The beauty of the resort was exceeded only by the attentive service of the staff. From golf, to spa to pool services the best we have experienced. The casitas were great. From the butler who provided service before we asked to the unbelievable views, it was a trip of a life time. It is the only resort we will return to - we've been spoiled.

<Content>Great staff and setting, 5-star prices for a 4-star experience Mystery Solved: We wondered  worried about all the negative guest comments that started popping up in December ahead of our weeklong visit. Our Marina rooms didn't have the mold or housekeeping problems, but we did experienced the financial mugging- the slap-you-in-face prices everywhere you turned. Somehow resorts like Four Seasons, Canyon Ranch, and Aman make you feel good about dropping 2 grand a night. El Con doesn鈥檛. The reason? It鈥檚 not an 鈥淟XR鈥?resort, it鈥檚 a short-term investment for Blackstone Equity Partners . Typically this means raising prices to service a massive debt load, adding on a few superficial improvements and flipping the property within a year. The business goal is a hit and run short term profit, not long term guest satisfaction. The danger is that they lose the outstanding staff, who managed to stay cool, calm, collected, pleasant, and most of all helpful even during the Christmas-New Year's crunch season. If you do go, try the outstanding Bioluminescence Bay Tour, and take a cab, not the overpriced hotel tour, to Old San Juan. It's beautiful, clean, and safe. The forts, run with the usual excellence by the National Park Service, are a must. Eat with the locals at El Jibarito on Calle Sol. For the beach on Palomino island- bring water shoes or sandals, like Keens. There's a fair amount of sharp glass and coral. And be nice to the El Con staff- they'll more than return the favor.

<Content>Paradise in Puerto Rico! My husband and I stayed at this beautiful resort 12/24-12/29 - our first visit to El Conquistador and Puerto Rico (but not our last!). The resort was busy and festive. Our room had a breathtaking view of the Caribbean. Our bed was so comfortable - we slept well each night - unusual for us when we travel. The highlights of our stay included lounging by the pool w/live music, Palomino Island (plenty of shade, not crowded, no wait for ferry), the exceptional restaurants (Strip House, Blossom, Stingray) and the Bioluminescent Bay kayak tour (don't miss it!). We enjoyed the tour of the El Yunque rain forest - our guide was interesting and knowlegeable and had an infectious enthusiasm (check it out!). We spent time at the resort casino after dinner on two nights. We broused the shops at the resort and made a few purchases (great selections on resort wear, swim suits, sandals). The ice cream bar was always busy - with kids and adults! We worked out in the spa gym twice and enjoyed walking the beautiful and extensive grounds for additional exercise. A romantic, relaxing yet active vacation for us. We brought our tennis rackets but never made it on to the courts. So much to see and do - we simply ran out of time. Would like to return to the resort and spend time at the spa, explore Palomino Island, visit old San Juan and take a day trip to the Virgin Islands. A new Ballroom is under construction but did not disrupt or impact our stay. We found the resort staff hardworking and eager to please. We didn't hear (or overhear) a single negative comment from other guests during our stay. The guests we met/encountered were enjoying the resort as we were. We highly recommend the El Conquistador and look forward to returning!!

<Content>Decent resort with great potential We arrived at the resort on the day of New Year's Eve. I was immediately impressed with the open air foyer but when I stood in line to check in, I grew impatient with the amount of time they took with the guests ahead of me. The views are spectacular from the property. Be wary of the 'village' you stay in - it can be a haul to get from one place to another. We ended up changing rooms to be closer to the main building. Speaking of rooms, we had a nice view of the tennis courts and the golf course - it was a spacious room but was screaming for an update. There was dual tape deck in our room (?$!%*). The decor was fine, but something was a little off. The bathroom was spacious as well, but again, needed to be updated. Once they're done renovating, I'm sure it will be 10x nicer. It's certainly a great place to take a family for holiday. There are plenty of activities for both adults and kids. Palomino Island is great - just have patience having to wait for the ferry, etc. The restaurants are WAY overpriced. You pay top dollar to get only average meals at best. The quality of the food doesn't jive with what's expected at a high end resort.

<Content>Great Vacation! OK, I felt compelled to check back on this site to see what had been written laterly, and really felt compelled to post another opinion based on our stay.We went to El Conquistador December 26 - Jan 1. Our experience was remarkably different from most overall, but consistent in some areas....We do Christmas week in the Caribbean every year and have somehow become accustomed to overpaying for our hotel, but this is always the best time for us to travel with our 7-year old who is in school.We had a GREAT time! The resort was PACKED with families, many from the Northeast. The vibe during the whole week was very enthusiastically holiday, and fun.Here are some specifics:--- Our hotel room was great, actually. They upgraded us from garden view to partial oceaan view. Yes, they are renovating, but they are doing one entire wing at one time, which is not seen by those stayin at the hotel. A new wing is being consteucted, but it does not get in the way of any view or walking path in the entire resort. Our room was clean, well taken care of by housekeeping. Many new room amenities - coffee maker, refrigerators, blowdryers, sound system, etc. Little things, but they are definitely trying to update the rooms as quickly as possible. It appeared that all our towels and bedding (down comforters and duvet) were brand new. --- They brought us Happy Holiday gift basket the first night with lots of local treats and snacks, it was very nice.--- On the first day at Palomino Island, we did need to wait for about 25 minutes for a ferry, but it was because the line for transport to the island was so long, and they limit the number of passengers on each ferry. The ferry consistently ran every 20 - 30 minutes, and we watched as they tested new 8-minute ferry boats which will be used soon.--- Palomino Island was gorgeous, and quite busy each day. The first two days after Christmas were packed - not many available chairs (and there are hundreds) but after that, the crowds slimmed down. They had wait staff bringing lunch and drinks to your chairs, had bands, and organized volleyballs games, even a sand castle contest for the kids on our last day.We even rented a car to try out other local beaches (Loquillo) and the rain forest. We left and went back to Palomino.--- There was only one time one of the funiculars going down to the marina area was broken and it was fixed within 15 minutes. If you have thousands of people taking anything up and down or back and forth 24/7 there will be problems. And the staff quickly fixed it.--- We agreed with everyone else that the restaurants were just ridiculously over-priced. Just outrageous. Food was OK. We went to Otello's (Just OK), Stingray (our best meal there) and Strip House (OK). We're lucky to live in a city with great restaurants and have pretty high standards. So we were disappointed by the food for the price, but we took another reviews advice and bought food for snacks and breakfast. They should have kids' meals at kids' pricing. $12 for buttered bow tie pasta is just manslaughter. Yes, I am embarassed to say that we paid that but sometimes on vacation you are irrational and say what the hell. Some nights we just ordered a pizza. We ate outside the resort and the hotel has a list for you to try. We ate at Con Pepe (I think that's the name) near the entrance ot the Westin and it was amazing, and much more reasonable.--- In general, the pricing for snacks, candy and drinks, even at the convenience store there, was about 4 times what you would expect to pay, even at the local stores ($3.99 for a bag of Lays Chips already marked as $1.39. $ 3.89 for USA Today. That kind of thing)--- The pools and grounds were beautiful. --- Our daughter did not do the Kids' Club, but we heard glowing reviews and the first few days there were about 20 kids in teh Club participating in activities. Each night they had movies and other games to keep kids busy. We were lucky to hook up with parents who had kids of similar ages, so making friends while there was not a problem for our 7-year old.--- Transportation from the airport was timely, nice, with drinks on board, but very expensive ($178 round trip for 3).--- We dive and snorkel, and had a good experience with Casa Del Mar, the Padi group on site.--- Staff for baggage was just waiting to please. Falling over themselves. It was great. We called on night for packs of coffee, not really expecting someone in housekeeping to have 3 packs at our door within 10 minutes. They had turn down service each evening and were exceedingly polite with every request we made.I hope to post some images as soon as I get the time to download our cameras. Hope this helps!

<Content>Absolutely gorgeous This was a dream vacation! My husband and I spent five days at the resort with our two daughters (19 and 15). It was the most beautiful place we have ever been to. We stayed down by the Marina and woke up every day to the glistening ocean. It was perfect! The rooms were lovely and clean. We had adjoining rooms and that was wonderful - everyone had their own space. We did it all! The pools were beautiful and the beach was out of this world. We will definitely spend more time at the beach this year. The spa and workout facililty is terrific and was used by all of us. The food was delicious at every restaurant. We truly had the vacation of a lifetime. We have already booked another stay for this year and can't wait!!

<Content>Don't Waste your Money - Listen to These Reviews I tried to be optomistic and not listen to the crummy reviews. I had a cheap rate ($155 per night) through the Hotel directly and thought it could not be all that bad. Well, it was awful. The rooms are certainly dumpy. I could have lived with that, if the hotel had not been in such a transition.The lobby and pool are still maintained well. The Palomino Island was nice but again, deserted and a little bazaar. Only about 20 people were there. I saw fire alarms not functioning and smashed and broken. The Furnicular had the engine cover propped open throughout our stay. Yes, I wondered if everything was really mechanically sound. It is obvious that they are running on half staff at the moment as they have no clientele and are running with a skeleton crew. I went 1 week prior to Xmas with 7 family members. The hotel is undergoing an entire multi-million dollar face lift. In 2008 I will not be able to afford it. It will be the most outstanding property on the island. However, at the moment, the hotel is just trying to get by with a few bookings and running on minimal capacity. It is a ghost town. The stores are closed most of the time, the resturants are spookily empty. Many things are just not up  running at the moment as they go through this transition. Yes, the staff are pleasant, but the hotel lacks spirit or a fun environment. It is completely DEAD! It was the holiday season and I expected a little holiday music, Island festivities etc... Zip, nada , zero. Pretty depressing. Long story short - after 2 odd nights, we shipped out to the San Juan Caribe Hilton for the same price. Whoa, we were greeted with salsa music in the lobby and steel drums by the pool. I realized, I had stayed at the El Con too long and should have left immediately.

<Content>This hotel is the WORST! We had stayed at Las Casistas several years ago and the property was fabulous. Great accomodations and fabulous service, but now that it is owned by Blackstone and managed by LXR it is terrible. Although we stayed in a new casita which was lovely, the service in the hotel was awful. housekeeping was irregular, sometimes there would be turn down service and sometimes not, sometimes we would get clean towels and sometimes not, no mints at turn down, stains on the sheets, stains on the towels, clogged toilets in all of the restrooms, dirty toilet seats, no pool attendant until late in the day. This hotel is not luxury and they should not bill themselves that way. Service was equivelant to a Holiday Inn or Best Western. BEWARE- there is construction and renovation going on all over the hotel, something that they don't mention when booking the hotel.Food was outragously expensive. Breakfast used to be included in the price of the Casitas,now it is 20.00 per person for a Continental Breakfast. You used to be able to workout in the Golden Door Spa for free, if you stayed in the Casitas and now it is 25.00 to walk in the door per person, transportation used to be included as well and now it cost us 264.00 for 4 people roundtrip.They nickel and dime you to death. DO NOT STAY HERE. I always stay at luxury hotels....Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons etc.... this is not luxury. They have also lost their fifth diamond.This resort is the pits!!!

<Content>Pefectly Respectable My wife and I set out with great trepidation for a 3 night stay at theEl Conquistador. We had booked our trip several weeks ago when the reviews were mixed but positively skewed; the week before our departure the reviews turned downright nasty. However, I am happy to report that the El Conquistador is a perfectly respectable resort and that we enjoyed our long weekend there.While our room was certainly in need of an upgrade, it was adequate. The grounds were quite pleasant and the view was very relaxing. We both got massages at the spa, and we both agreed it was money very well spent. Palomino Island is nice --- not spectacular, but nice. As other reviewers have noted, the food is quite pricey, but given the hotel's remote location, one doesn't have too much choice. The resort was fairly empty during our stay, but I imagine our stay would not have been nearly as pleasant when if it was crowded. The funicular down to the ferry launch to Palomino Island acts as a bottle neck, and I can imagine very long lines when the resort's at full capacity.We got a good deal ($500 pp for RT air and 3 nights), and I wouldconsider staying at the El Conquistador again if we got a similarly good deal. However, if the economics were similar or even a bit more expensive, I would stay at the Westin (much easier access to a beach of equal quality and a shorter trip from the airport), the Numero Uno guest house (quaint and close to San Juan) or give the Ritz a try before I returned to the El Conquistador.

<Content>Paradise Views, Amazing Time for FREE! It was my first trip to PR and will not be my last. I earned the trip through my business (southernlivingathome.com/racheljohnson). I am a Director with the company and we earned 5 days on the resort absolutely FREE. The room faced the tennis courts and the golf couse. I was still satisfied even though others were in the ocean front rooms and the casitas. Humid in June so the room was a bit musky. The infinity pool was amazing. Loved the disco and the shopping was great. Favaorite part was the private island Palomino...what a dream!!Food was pricey (we were given a cash allowence and went through it quickly). But the food was always very good.I am on my way to the Westin Our Lucaya in the Bahamas in January. Look for my report then. Again another FREE vacation...so how can I complain??

<Content>Disliked it so much that we moved to another hotel!! This hotel leaves much to be desired. We were amazed at its ranking and can only presume that it may impress people who are not frequent travellers and don't know how things ought to be. They have ads up around the hotel indicating that they are going to be undergoing major renovations, I can assure you that they need them.First of all - while they are not clear about this on their site, I will be - They DO NOT have a beach right at the property!! As they say, there is a beach on Palamino Island, and they have a boat which takes you there... BUT: you can't go at will, the boat takes approx. 20 minutes to get there, and, by the way - it really is not a 'private island'. (In Puerto Rico the 'shores belong to the people.' As such there are many local who take boats over to the island and hang out along the beach in front of their boats.)The boat leaves every 30-60 minutes, beginning at 9am and leaves the island before sunset. So much for hanging out on the beach!! When I go to a resort I like to be able to walk on the beach at will. You will not be able to do that here. They also have two little coves on the other side of the 'island' - but they explained to us that it's a 40ish minute hike. The island has a small mountainous middle, no shade along the way, and you can't swim once you get there as that side of the island is very rough and rocky. There is also no service on that side of the island. The only reason some people may venture over is curiousity, and/or the fact that one of the coves allows nude bathing. We didn't go to that part of island once they gave us all the facts. Most importantly it's much too hot to be stuck there without any service and without much shade.If you are beach lovers, as we are, the main beach on the island leaves much to be desired. You can walk the length of the beach in approx. 7 minutes. It's not a deep beach, so you're walking past people's chairs. We were terribly dissapointed.The hotel itself is quite rundown, and our room was really quite dirty. We called housekeeping and requested that they clean it properly the following day, but that didn't provide results. We gave details as to places which had most certainly not been dusted for many months, and the dust remained for the 6 days we stayed. After 6 days we realized that we were just so unhappy that it was silly to stay there any longer. We decided to move to a hotel we'd been to before, only a few minutes away, which has a very beautiful property and very lovely beach. (The Westin Rio Mar)The hotel is also not at all friendly to people with any type of mobility impairment. It is a huge complex with stairs all over. To get to the boat which takes you to the island you must get down to the base of the property on the water. While there are some ramps around, they fail to mark them with signs, so finding them requires extra walking, and that still doesn't ensure that you find an accessible route.The casino is extremely tacky and draws in many locals who seem to sit all day playing the 1 cent slots, and many chain smoke as they do so. The penny slots are on the edge of the casino alongside the lobby, so you must pass by them to get to other places.If you decide to go anyway, make sure to go to the small infinity pool at the casitas - there's a sign that it's only for guests at the casitas, but they don't mind. It's a semi-circular infinity pool at the top of a cliff and is the only place with padded pool chairs. Quite lovely... You can also request that they give you a ride back to the main hotel at the end of the day, and they'll pick you up in a golf cart type vehicle.One of the nicest places on the property is at the very bottom, beyond where the boat leaves to go to the island. There's a large grassy area with a few chairs (and a basketball court at the end of it) and it is on the edge of the water. As busy as the hotel was, nobody was there when we were. We'd go sit there after dinner, and it is very pretty and peaceful. They discourage you from staying at the rooms down there, as they say that you are 'too far' from the rest of the hotel. Frankly, you'd be right by the boat to the island, there are restaurants and a waterside bar and if you wish to go to the pool or the main hotel, you take the funicular up, instead of having to take it down to get to the aforementioned places. It's worth having a look at the photos posted by another recent traveller to the hotel - as we saw the same things - A lot of mold, dirt and disrepair.Once they renovate it will be much nicer, I hope, but there will never be a real beach for those of you seeking a 'beach' vacation.

<Content>Not so Honeymoon!! Where to start ..... When we arrived and self parked the car no one was on hand to help with off loading luggage. When checking in the front desk was very nice, but did not even tell us there was a bell hop service or even offered to get someone to help us with our bags. We had to trek them all across the resort and down the tram to marina where we were staying, and this is no small walk at all. When we get to our room the carpet is coming up and there is was a clothes iron mark in the carpet. We called them and asked to change rooms, and talked about sending a bell hop this time. After about a half hour wait the bell hop change us to another room, which was just as dirty as the one we had just left. Then again..... we changed rooms. The next one that we stayed at air conditioning was constantly making a LOUD ticking noise. So after the 4th move to the upper part of the resort and into a smaller room we finally gave up and stayed there. They only had one tram working the entire time we were there and made it a packed ride getting up and down to the marina to get to the beach. At one point both trams were down and we had to get a shuttle back around to the hotel. We rented a car from the hotel and drove to the resort. You have to pay $15 a day for parking and then there is this older van that shuttles you to and from the resort. The seats in the van are ripped and coming apart and the door is held on by a nylon rope that you have to pull to close. The gentleman who drove the van was great and enjoyed talking to him. There constantly adding on the size of this resort, and it shows that they already have too much to take care of. The resort is beautiful and there is all most more stuff to see there then on the island. Palamino Island was great .... loved the beach! Food was great .... never had a bad meal. Casino was a great place to play at in the evenings. Would I stay at this resort again .... more then likely not. They we're not very helpful when it came to the up keep of the rooms and the first night of our Honeymoon was ruined by having to swtich to 4 different rooms. I normally don't trust these comments on here, but this time I should have listened to what everyone had to say .....

<Content>A Disaster from Start to Finish Review Written Dec 10, 2006 - I visited the El Conquistador from Dec 2-9, 2006 with a large group of about 500 people for a corporate meeting/convention. To begin, our company provided us with some cash upon arrrival for use during the week. At several times during the week, about 20 or so of my colleagues were robbed from their rooms of cash, passports, cell phones and PDA's including from their in-room safe, which suggested an inside job. These robberies took place while we were in meetings during the day. Security was contacted and they made reports to the management. Those who were robbed were made to feel that it was their fault. Security even told one of my colleagues that the whole situation was overblown, which in my mind was absurd. Even one robbery was too many in my estimation!!Although advertised as a 5 Star Resort, the rooms were very tired and desperately in need of a complete overhaul. My first room (I moved after one night) when I arrived at midnight had water all over the floor and the carpet was soaking wet. The room smelled of mildew. The bathrooms were not clean either. Until the hotel addresses their security concerns, and does some major upgrading, I would recommend you pass on the El Conquistador for the time being. Hardly worth the money, and certainly not a 5 Star Resort in my opinion.

<Content>Okay but Not Luxury I just got back from 3 nights/4 days at the El Conquistador Resort in Fajado, Puerto Rico. The hotel is fine but in no way is it luxury except for the view. I have stayed at Ritz Carlton hotels before and I know what luxury is. This hotel is more on par with a Beaches resort which I have also stayed at. It's very big and from afar seems like heaven but when you get up close you see that the hotel is run down and in need of a paint job for starters. The furniture is worn and chipped. There are no a/c vents in the bathroom so it's a bit warm in there. The mini fridge is old and a bit smelly. Ask to stay in a room near the main building not near the marina. This is where everything (restaurants, casino, shops, pools, arcade, convenience store) is located except for one restaurant and one pool. You need to take a funicular to get to the rooms down by the marina. I stayed in a garden-view room which was fine. The view was of the nice tennis courts and the golf course. Very green and pretty. There is no need to get an ocean view room. If you have the extra money to spend, stay at a nicer hotel.The pools were nice as was Palomino Island (the private island where the beach is located). You take a ferry to the island. Once on the island there is a restaurant and a store. Palomino island is not to be missed. No need to bring towels. They are supplied once you get to the island. The last ferry returns to the hotel at 4:30 pm.I ate only at the casual restaurants. The food was mediocre but the prices were high. There are nicer restaurants but I am from NY and knew the food would not compare so I didn't bother to try them.I went on two days trips. A shopping trip to Old San Juan. It's approx. $50 per person and all it is is transporation to and from the town. You leave the hotel at 9 am and leave Old San Juan at 3 pm. You are on your own between 9 and 3 to go sightseeing (El Morro, Pigeon Park, etc.) and shopping. This trip is worth the money because it costs $100 just to take a taxi to Old San Juan one way.The other trip I went on is to El Yunque, the rain forrest. This is a must see. You leave the hotel at 9 am and return to the hotel at 1 pm. The tourguide Edwin is hilarious and very knowledgeable. He should have his own travel tv show. The first stop is at a waterfall just to look at, not to go in. It's beautiful. The second stop is at a tower. You can climb up the tower to the top (approx 90 steps). You can go at your own pace. The view of the three peaks of the rain forrest is stunning. The last stop is a hike. The first part of the hike is uphill and a bit tough if you're not in shape but then it's downhill and easy. Lots of things to see. Bring a bottle of water. Wear sneakers. No bathing suits necessary. People who can't walk unassisted should not go on this trip. This is not a place to go if you are travelling alone unless you like solitude. The hotel is very big and it seemed like we were there by ourselves. I had a great time because of the company I was with. If I needed to feel like I was living in the lap of luxury and wanted to be pampered, I would have been very disappointed.

<Content>El CON is a dump The rooms are the equivalent of a run down Holiday Inn the pools are filthy with broken concrete,moldy chair covers etc. After seeing 3 different rooms I paid $400.00 per night extra to move next door to Las Casitas. The views are good but until they spend millions redoing all the rooms and public areas it will remain no more than a 3 STAR resort.

<Content>Housekeeping not at the forefront of priorities Stayed at the El Conquistador for business and have to agree with the other reviews on the cleanliness of the rooms.It is one thing to be an older hotel in need of an update but it is entirely something different to be old and dirty on top of that.There was hair in my shower and on the floor.The bed spread was so old and worn down it was paper thin and that made me not want to sit down on it or touch anything.They are undergoing a much needed face lift in the rooms and other than that I have no other complaints about the facility.The spa was truly something special and the views are breathtaking.I have to disgree with some of the reviews regarding the restaurants, I thought they were all terrific and actually ate at Stingrays twice and had the exact same dish (Chilean Sea Bass) both times.Hope this helps!

<Content>Fine for the deal we got off season My husband and I found a good deal online for combined airfare and hotel accomodations through Travelocity for this hotel. I think it was about $1500 combined. We were in need of a 4day/3night get-away without our 3 young children for some relaxed down-time and sunshine and this fit the bill with a direct flight to San Juan. We normally stay at much smaller, more exclusive resorts and have been spoiled by those (Cap Juluca on Anguilla, renting a house on Anguilla, Las Ventanas in Cabo San Lucas, Caneel Bay on St. John). We read all the reviews and while a little nervous about what we were to find upon arrival, we ended up having a great time and the resort pretty much to ourselves due to this still being the off-season. I'm sure it would have been a very different experience in high season if the resort had been chock full of people, chaises in demand, elbow-to-elbow on the island, and full rates for average accomodations...would not have liked it with those factors. The positives of the off season is that we got the peace and quiet we were looking for...no problem getting your choice of chaises by any of the pools and on the island. We didn't have to wait in line for anything and nothing was crowded. We were upgraded to a full ocean view room on the 4th floor of the Vista wing. We were overlooking the maze green garden out to the ocean, so had no problem with privacy or noise from the pool/lobby as another reviewer mentioned. We were closer to the Golden Door Spa than the lobby. We were the only ones playing tennis on their courts. ($10 fee to borrow a raquet, $6 for can of balls and $35 for an hour on the court) The negative to the off season and renovation that's underway is that more than a few of the restaurants were closed for renovation. We ended up eating dinner at the asian restaurant in the hotel for 2 of the nights...one night at the yakatori/Benihana-type grill in the restaurant which was good and the other night in the Chinese part of the restaurant and had delicious peking duck (pricey, but tasty). Dinner out the other night was just down the road from the hotel at Pasion...a local spot...we were craving real authentic puerto rican cuisine and this was a nice change of pace. THe concierge recommended Pasion and it was easy to get to. Overall, food prices were on the high side, but that's what you generally expect at a resort. Although, breakfast was quite reasonable at the Cafe Caribe...about $8.95 for an entree. We liked the menu for lunch/drinks down by the marina the best...the bar along the water. Also, spent a couple of hours one morning in some chaises on the lawn by the water in front of Las Olas village...peaceful and away from the big resort.The views from the hotel are quite beautiful. It's set up high on a cliff and you feel as if you're in a plane...looking out onto Palomina Island, Vieques, Culebra and St. Thomas in the distance. The golf course, gardens and grounds are all well-kept. We enjoyed the boat ride out to the hotel's island...a nice change from the pool experience...to sit in a chaise and listen to the waves lap against the beach. To be picky about the island...it needed a good raking to clean up the seaweed and garbage that naturally floats ashore (plastic bottles,etc) and the menu could have been upgraded at the one and only cafe. Our room was fine...we were prepared for the worst based on some of the reviews that we read...and we called ahead to see what they could do about a room because we had read such horrible reviews. They upgraded us and while the tiles were chipped, the bathroom was in need of new grout and a fresh paint job, the furniture was tired...we were okay with what we ended up with. If we had to pay full season rates, it would have been another story! Luxury it is not, but it was perfectly fine considering what we were paying and the fact that we were away. It was clean and the maid service seemed more on the ball in our room than in some of the other reviewer's rooms.Service was very friendly and welcoming.Again, we're not big resort kind of people, but it worked for us for this quick get-away and El Conquistador served its purpose. Call for an upgraded room before you go...I just saw some photos of the room a recent reviewer ended up in and it looked horrible (mold, etc)! My review would have been very different if we had not been in a decent room.

<Content>Above expectations We bought our stay at the hotel at a charity auction on a whim so we didn't check the ratings out until after the purchase was final. The ratings were so up and down that we didn't know what to expect. The reality for us was a wonderful stay. We were upgraded to an oceanview room and the view was indeed lovely. The room itself was fine. Yes, the furniture was a bit chipped, but the carpet and bedding were fresh, the mattress was very comfortable, and everything was perfectly clean. The bathroom vanity was granite and the bathroom had attractive tile. We saw one of the rooms that was being renovated and the new rooms will be very attractive, but there was nothing in our room that was unacceptable (and yes, we can be picky).The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The shuttle driver was full of helpful hints about the hotel and the area. If a staff member was asked for direction, he/she would walk you to show you the way. The concierge staff was wonderful.The food at the hotel is expensive, but so is the food at every Caribbean island we've ever visited. We enjoyed eating at Otello's and found the service to be excellent. We followed the advice of other visitors and bought coffee and muffins at David's each morning and had a delightful breakfast picnic by the pool. We ate offsite at Las Vegas on the road to the rain forest and Pasion in Farjardo; both meals were excellent, but not cheap.We enjoyed our stay at the beach at Palamino Island and did not experience delays with the boats or overcrowding, even though there were six weddings at the hotel during our stay. Destination weddings mean plenty of guests!The highlight of our trip was an evening boat ride with Capt. Suarez at the bay. The concierge desk made the reservations for us and going by boat, rather than by kayak, was the way to do it for us. Since you don't have to focus on the work of kayaking, you sit back and enjoy the trees full of egrets and iguanas, Capt. Suarez's talk about the ecology and the area, and the magic of the lights. We swam in the warm dark water and made water snowangels as we moved. We watched the krill and sardines create abstract patterns as they jumped and swam. Since we had been at the Nature Preserve that afternoon (a bargain two hour tram tour for $7), we even knew the science of what was happening because our guide had explained it in detail. The English tour is at 2PM and the concierge made those reservations for us, too.

<Content>Great place to relax and enjoy the resort My wife and I stayed at the El Conquistador for our 1 year anniversary Oct 1st-6th. We read all the reviews prior to taking our trip so alot of it was expected. I think in general, all the reviews are accurate.Weather - Near the end of Hurricane season, we were somewhat worried about the weather, but it was 85-90 each day partly cloudy. When the sun was out, it was hot, there was a breeze by the pool and also on the island.Food - the food is expensive. $10-15 for a burger, $25-45 for a dinner entree. However, the food is good quality. Actually the breakfast at the Caribe Cafe was priced pretty well $6-9 for entrees, and the coffee shops had bagels, muffins that we priced ok. So you could start the day off with a good meal and a good price. We didn't do the buffett at Las Brisas, as it was closed (I think it was $20 a person anyhow).We found the Ballyhoo Bar and Grill at the marina to have the best lunch menu and moderate prices. The burgers, sandwiches and quesadillas were all good. The main grill on Palomino was closed and the secondary grill was ok, but the prices were higher. Alot of people have said good things about the Pizza at the pool, but we didn't think it was too good. Dinner at Otellos (italian) was very good. Dinner at Blossoms (Chinese) was ok. I think if they just lowered some of their prices $5-$10, they'd have no complaints. Hotel - As with others at this time, we were in the La Vistas section, we originally had a garden view, but they gave us a free upgrade to an ocean view, which overlooked the main pool/ocean and with a nice balcony. The sunrise comes up on this side. The room itself was in need of an upgrade. Just older stuff, it would be a nice room with renovations. They are doing major renovations to other parts of the hotel (Bristas wing) so I assume, they'll upgrade this one once the other is done. Renovations of rooms and a waterpark are said to be completed in 2006-2007. They are also updating their boats. In the offseason, it definately is a much more laid back hotel. It's like you have it to yourself, so it's quiet. Some of the restaurants are closed, since there aren't that many people but there are still plenty of choices. We spent a day by the main pool and that was nice, as we were close to our hotel room, and also close to the pool bar and servers. We also found the infinity pool in the Casitas, and that was a great view as well. I could see how these would be crowded in the main season. I thought it was pretty easy to get around with the funicular (tram) to take you to the marina section and the boat to take you to Palomino Island. We enjoyed the boat ride. We spent a couple days out at Palomino Island. It's definately pretty cool to have your own island. We took the first 9AM ride out in the morning and along with a couple other people had the island to ourselves. THere are plenty of towels/chairs/umbrellas to use on the island. It's set up pretty well. The water does have coral in it, so at times the bottom is rocky. We did find a nice patch further out that became smooth sand again. So try to go past the 1st section. If it's hot and you want a breeze, go right when getting off the boat (best beach also). But if the wind picks up and it get's cloudy, stay on the left side or close to the dock (less wind). Spa - My wife loved the spa. She said it was very worth the money. She got a 60 minute massage. She highly recommends the services there. She said the massage was great and the setting was perfect.Golf - I guess on tues/thurs during the offseason they have discounted rates on golf after 1PM. So it was $70 to play 18. (they are in the processes of building a 9 hole course). The golf course is really nice and all the tee boxes are positioned high, so alot of your drives will go quite a bit further 100-150 yards. It's pretty interesting. The course was very well taken care of. The fairways are pretty straight and open, so it's an easy course to play. Lots of iguanas roaming the fairways which goes along with the views of the mountains. All in all, this hotel is a good choice. I think once the renovations are completed, it may be a great hotel. In the offseason it's a good choice for relaxing and water sports. I would not recommend it for night life if that's what your looking for or for socializing, as there aren't many people there (I'm speaking about the offseason).But for a getaway of sun, surf, pools, golf, spa and food, it's a good choice. Also, the staff at the hotel was very friendly and attentive. **ps, if you connect in NY at JFK for Jetblue, the San Juan connection is in terminal 4, you have to take a shuttle train which can take time**

<Content>Beautiful It was beautiful. With $89 round trip airfare from Jet Blue, and $107 a night from priceline, it was only $890 for air and hotel for two people for 5 days/4 nights. It is hurricaine season in Sept, but Puerto Rico, unlike other Caribbean islands, hasn't had a hurricane since 1998. The forecast said scattered thunder storms every day, it did not rain once. The hotel is amazing! The main hotel is 300 feet above sea level, with incredible views from everywhere! We stayed in the La Vista wing, which was off the main hotel. We had a garden view room, which was less expensive, but we had a view of the mountains and the ocean was still off in the distance. A huge plus was that we could watch a beautiful sunset from our back porch every night. The las castias village was also a beautiful part of the hotel, they seemed more like colorful Caribbean condos then hotel rooms. And that part had the most amazing infinity pool 300 feet above sea level. (we wern't supposed to go there since it was specifically for Las Castias, but in Sept. it is so quite that we were the only ones there most of the time. By far our favorite part of the hotel. To get to Las Olas village and the marina, you had to take a funicular, which is like a tram that goes up and down the cliff. It works like an elevator, and seems almost like a nice trolley car inside. The trip down is not even a hassle with the amazing views, but you have to go at the right time because even in the off season there could be a wait. Unfortunately there is no beach on the premises, but from the marina you can take a 20 minute boat ride (which they are now working on a faster ferry that will only take 8 minutes) to their private island which is worth going to. The only thing for the budget conscious is the food and beverage. A burger at the grill is $18.00, and if you go to a nice restaurant, an entree will run you $22-45 depending on where you go. Also, a beer is $6. But the food is wonderful, 5 stars no matter where you go. We solved the price issue by getting 2 muffins, 2 bananas, and 2 juices at the bakery (muffins were so good!) for $12. Then we would split a burger or sandwich with fries at the grill, and when we did that they would give us plenty of extra fries and it was more then enough. Then for dinner we would splurge, because quite honestly, we're on vacation! (and the food was worth it). As for booze, there is a liqueur store in the main hotel with six packs of beer, wine, and bottles of alcohol, so we would just get a couple six packs for the room. People treated us there like we had paid $500 a night (which is what you'd pay in winter months). It was 5 star service all around, great shopping, casino was fun, there's a sports bar for the guys with any game imaginable. I would highly recommend it to anyone and we are definitely going back.

<Content>El Conquistador Resort-An Oceanfront Paradise! The trip to the El Conquistador Resort was both enjoyable and relaxing. My husband and I just returned from an 8 day stay (9/21-9/28). The resort sits perched atop a cliff with expansive ocean views from almost every location within the resort. The grounds are absolutely stunning. Once you turn into the resort you feel like you have entered an ocean paradise!We got a great Travel Zoo rate of $90 a night for a garden view room with a $100 resort credit with a 3+ night stay. I booked this directly on the El Con website. Just click on specials/promos at the bottom of the reservation page. When we checked in they upgraded us to an ocean view room in the La Vista wing at no charge.Yes, they are in the process of renovating the resort. When you approach the main entrance you see some construction. This is the new conference center and ballroom. All other current improvements are hidden from the guests. Currently the Las Brisas wing is closed for renovations. They have plans of the renovations posted in the lobby. The new rooms are modern and luxurious.It is currently low season and we felt like we had the resort to ourselves. The pools were not crowded, the private island/beach was almost deserted, and the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly.Yes the food is pricey but not overly outrageous. The pricing is consistent with other islands in the Caribbean. FYI, all of the restaurants are not currently open. Isabella鈥檚 is being renovated into a new steakhouse. Stingray Cafe down in the Marina was open. The food there was fabulous. The veal medallions, sea bass, and tuna were all excellent. You must try the chocolate souffl茅. Otellos, the Italian restaurant was exquisite. The food was absolutely wonderful and full of flavor. The veal chop, lamb shank, beef filet, swordfish, and lamb chops were all out of this world. The Tiramisu and chocolate mousse in the hazelnut basket were both worth the calories. We also ate dinner at Blossoms the Japanese/Chinese/Sushi restaurant. The Chinese food was good and reasonable. The Bella Vista Caf茅 overlooking the pool and ocean has great pizza that can be shared by two. This made for a very reasonable lunch. For breakfast we ate at the Las Brisas buffet next to the pool or at Dave鈥檚 cookies across from the casino. We went to the local supermarket for snacks and drinks. They do have these available on site if you do not want to venture off.If you want to venture off site I suggest renting a car at the airport and driving to the resort. It will take approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the resort. I highly recommend the Eco-Tour kayak trip to the bioluminescent bay and the Castillo catamaran snorkel tour. Both are a 5-10 minute drive from the resort. We also ventured off on our own to the rainforest. Having the car saved a considerable amount of money on hotel transfers/cab fare. You have the freedom to explore at your own pace. Yes the resort does charge $15 for self parking or $20 for valet parking. I suggest the valet since the self park lot is a distance from the main entrance and you need to take a shuttle to/from your car. My husband and I both enjoyed massages at the Golden Door Spa. The facility is beautiful and the staff is top notch.If you are looking for the nightlife and excitement of San Juan this hotel is not for you. If you want a laid back relaxing vacation far away from the hustle and bustle of town this is the resort you are looking for. A trip to the Casitas Village infinity pool is a must. This pool is for the private use of the Casitas guests but with the low resort attendance you will not be stopped.We will definitely go back to the El Conquistador once all the renovations have been completed.

<Content>Great time at El Con I spent 2 nights at the El Con (Sept 23-25) with 2 friends and found it to be well above my expectations based on other reviews. Overall, we were thrilled with our stay and had a fantastic time. The grounds are beautiful and the view is first rate. Room: On the Marina level, but overlooking the pool and ocean, and not right on the marina. It was clean and comfy with a beautiful terrace and large clean bathroom. Easy access to the marina and Ballyhoo bar were a plus. Minuses: Walls were paper thin (not a problem for us since it is the off season, so the resort was pretty quiet in general. But could be an issue if the resort was more crowded). The beds were ready to be replaced but were not uncomfortable. Dining: Being from the Northeast (NY, DC and CT) we didn't find the food prices to be outrageous - it was what we expected for a resort. We shared most of our meals, ordered half portions and always had enough to eat. All of the restaurants we tried were tasty - Otello, Blossom, Ballyhoo, Caribe Cafe, the place on Palomino Island and David's Cookies. Palomino Island: In a word, spectacular. Make a right from the ferry, past the rental shops for a cool ocean breeze and pristine looking beach. We didn't find the ferry to be a hassel and our boat even stopped to let people see a few dolphins who swam by us.Water sports: I went diving and my friends snorkelled with the in-house dive shop. They made it very easy - I dropped my gear off with them in the morning, and they picked us up from Palomino Island with the gear on board later in the day. It was not the best reef I've seen and it was a guided dive (with dive master Tito), but we had long bottom time (60 min) and after the dive there was time to swim on the surface with the snorkellers. Very relaxed pace overall. Things to be aware of: We got many conflicting bits of info from the concierge before our trip. One member of our party was told we had to book the shuttle bus from the airport in advance and another was told we could just walk up. We wanted to go to Monkey Island - one person was told we could just book the trip when we got there and one person was told that we couldn't book thru the El Con and would need to rent a car to get there or take an expensive taxi... It seemed to depended on who you spoke with. Going in off season: This is not for everyone. The weather was perfect and it was absolutely relaxing to feel like we had the resort to ourselves - no worries about reservations at restaurants (in fact we were given free wine for coming in at Otello), able to get 3 poolside and beach lounge chairs together at any time, etc, etc. However, some excursions were cancelled (trip to El Yunque) because there weren't the min number of people and the snorkelling was not confirmed until the last minute (I had wanted to do the morning 2 tank dive, but they only offered the afternoon snorkel/dive...) Also, the casino was empty and there were not the live bands, etc. that they advertise and that I imagine are there during the high season. This might be a better time of year for last minute travellers (so you can see what the weather forcast is like), those who want to lay on the beach/by the pool in relative peace and quiet, and families who don't want the hassel of crowds and lines. If you want nightlife, don't go during hurricane season... I would/will stay at El Con again. Even with all of these items, it was a terrific time and relaxing place to stay. Happy travels!

<Content>Absolutely loved it! Forget those other reviews! Wow, I've seen the previous reviews and I strongly disagree with much of what has been said. I also must tell you that I am a discriminating traveler who fancies resorts such as the Four Seasons and One  Only Hotels. Due to the fact that the hotel is currently under construction (and they do not make that a secret when you book), you NEED to ask them for their best available sections so that you are not placed in a old room that has not been updated in years. The reservation agents  concierge just need to be made aware of your needs. I give them five stars on service..everyone was always so accommodating and friendly.We needed something that was reasonably priced, but provided great service, food and amenities. The Conquistador was everything and more! 10 of my family members went for 5 days (all adults) to celebrate my Dad's retirement. We all stayed on the 4th floor in the MARINA section of the hotel. As for cleanliness, our rooms were spacious  spotless with an incredible view....not to mention that the views from every part of the hotel are simply breathtaking as the Conquistador sits on a bluff. The pictures featured on the website are georgeous and do not even do this place justice! BEACHYes, you have to take a short boat ride to the beach at Palomino Island, but its not inconvenient...it was actually FUN! Once you get to Palomino..everything is there for you. The water is so beautiful and the Pina Coladas are flowing (waitresses are on the beach). Palomino is pristine. It is so clean and there is so much to do. They have 2 great volleyball set-ups!POOLSWe spent our days in the sun. All the pools are beautifully maintained and there are serveral hot tubs which was nice..all areas are illuminated by festive spanish music which made for a fun atmosphere! If you want quiet, there are other pools you can go to in the Marina, Las Olas or Las Casitas.DININGWe ate so well each night. The FOOD WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! I highly reccomend Stingray's  Otellos. They were the best. We sat there for 3 hours each night..it was an event!The fish, particularly Sea Bass, was some of the best I have had in a long time! We also dined at a local authentic Puerto Rican restaurant called PASION DEL FAGON. It was incredible and should not be missed. We had a lovely meal there and the hotel concierge will get a cab to take you. I had an amazing lobster dish!Please do not be swayed by the negative reviews..you have to see for yourself and stay in the right section of the hotel (MARINA). It is unfortunate that perhaps the bad experiences were because the vacationers weren't well informed in advance of the modifications going on at the hotel. I heard the Conquistador hopes to have all rooms renovated by 2008 and I'll just have to make a trip and check it out :o)

<Content>Wonderful and yet nasty My wife and I (with our 19 month old toddler) just returned from the El Conqistador last night. We couldnt wait to post this review. The hotel is a study in contrasts. I have never had such an experience with a hotel before -on the one hand the grounds are immaculate, in excellent condition, and the views are absolutely beautiful. The lobby is as expected for a 4* hotel. However, once we stepped into the elevator to access the rooms, the beauty ended. The elevator was dingy, the corridor access and area just outside of the elevator was filthy -downright nasty, with baked in dirt and filth marks on the outside of the garbage receptacle just outside of the elevator. We noticed cigarette butts, dirt, significant dust bunnies (more like dust elephants, given the size) and stains all over the tiles. We felt like we were dirty by the time we got to our room. What was worse is that the dirt and filth remained for the duration of our stay -from Thursday to Sunday. And yes, the room was very dated. That by itself is not bad, but the bedspread was NEVER properly made up, and by the third day we became convinced that it was not that the maid was inefficient, but that the bedspread was old and too worn to ever look neat. The furniture was part rattan, part antique and part modern (they had a dvd player alonside a 1980's cd player), all in serious need of a brush of varnish/paint and repair.The views from the room -we stayed in the La Vista wing - was really special, except that you dont risk opening your doors much for the noise from the lobby and pool areas just below. Neither do you risk opening the shades for the view unless you dont mind flashing everyone in the pool and general activity area, as all the oceanview rooms are in full public view of everyone in the pool and activity areas.The less said on this subject the better. You can do much better going into Fajardo and buying at Sizzlers or Wendys. In fact you can do better just eating at a mall food court. Unless of course, you really enjoy bland overpriced food (my wife keeps reminding me that the food isnt awful, just tasteless, and that it could have been worse.) TRUE.The service was generally good. Puerto Rican hospitality is very positive and warm and the hotel was no exception. From the concierge to the bellhops, to the parking shuttle driver, the service was above par.And speaking of parking. You should drive, but remember that parking is a nice distance away and the wait on the parking shuttle to the lobby can be dreadfully delayed. Worse, Friday night we found ourselves driving around in circles for over 20 minutes in the parking lots just trying to find parking, which was non-existent. We noticed that they are now building a parking ramp building -which is well overdue as the resort is HUGE, like mad HUGE. This becomes a nightmare when you want to checkout and its a Sunday. Its like check-in day at a cruise terminal. Crowded. If you like massive resorts, you will like el Conquistador, especially after they complete their renovation, which the frontdesk staff tells me will be completed by this time next year. I for one will want to see if the hotel itself will match up to its grounds and views by then. If you like an intimate setting, it is NOT for you. Staying their is like a mini city on a hill which feels like a mega all-inclusive, but has worse tasting (and expensive) food.All in all I would definitely return, if only out of curiosity after their renovation.

<Content>Worth a Visit Despite all the negative reviews we read, we booked a trip and were pleasantly surprised. While we agree with all the criticism over dated rooms, long bus ride from airport, high restaurant and activity prices, we felt the beautiful scenery and views more than compensated. The resort is atop a cliff overlooking the ocean. Both the grounds looking out to the mountains, and pool areas were wonderful. We thought we would hate having to take a shuttle boat ride to get to a beach, but that turned out to be one of the highlights. The private island and beach were very large. The area around the boat dock was mostly families, while the more distance area was almost all adults. We ate at four of their fine dining restaurants and thought the Chinese, French, and Steak/Seafood ones were absolutely wonderful. While the prices were high they were similar to other fine dining restaurants at resorts. On the other hand, the Italian restaurant was one of the worst dining experiences we ever had. The food was tasteless. The service was horrible. That restaurant should be avoided.But despite all the negatives, for the overall value, this place is a good location for a quick Caribbean get-away.

<Content>Puerto Rican Paradise! Once you stay here you will not want to stay anywhere else in Puerto Rico. I just returned from 5 days at the El Conquistador and found it to be a absolutely wonderful! We took advantage of the summer special of $99 a night. Paying such a low price we really didn't expect much. But we were delighted to find the room was clean and very spacious with a spectacular view of the ocean from our private balcony! The setting of this sprawling property is on a cliff overlooking the Caribbean and let me tell you the views are breathtaking! I would start my day by grabbing a coffee early at David's Cookies off the lobby and just sit outside on one of the patios and look at the magnificent views around me. The pools are superb--clean and well maintained, as is the entire complex. The various restaurants on site tended to be pricey, but there are enough choices to eat reasonably without leaving the property. The staff was top-notch, friendly, and helpful. One thing to keep in mind: parking is $15 a day, and there are hotel taxes added on to your bill that you should be aware of when you book. But for the deal I got, and the sheer beauty of this place, I will be back!

<Content>A Fantastic Resort and Island Let me start of by saying if you travel to the El Con you will have a wonderful vacation. Pleas do not believe all the negative hype on the site. It鈥檚 just not true. We recently returned from an 8 night stay at the resort and found that it met or exceeded our expectations. We had a party of 7 (4 adults, 3 children ages 10, 13 and 14). We are from NJ and CT and have traveled to many locals with and with our children over the years. We can be picky but I must say everyone had an enjoyable time. Here's the deal-We arrived at the resort Tuesday July 25th. We rented a minivan which I would suggest doing. It gave us the freedom to explore and go off the resort to local restaurants for dinner. The hotel shuttle is about $66 R/T per person. Our two families split the rental which came to about $250 per family and we had use of a car all week long. They do charge daily for parking but I suggest when you depart you ask for some of that to be removed from the bill. We waited for our car from valet one night for about 45min. We mentioned that before we checked out and were only charged 3 nights for parking. The staff is very accommodating but you'll have to put in a little time and effort to get exactly what you want/except. Check-in was somewhat slow. The rooms we had been promised were booked (In the Las Brisas bldg). Apparently there was a large wedding taking place over the weekend and the entire building had been reserved. They put us in the Vista wing of the hotel overlooking the pool with a spectacular ocean view. These rooms were a bit smaller than what we had reserved. The told us they could move us on Thursday to a newer building adjacent to the vistas. This building had larger rooms (King bed with pull-out couch) and had 6 floors instead of 4 and a balcony. They put us on the 6th floor. I suggest this part of the resort or Las Brisas when traveling with kids. The resort is large and you will be in a central locale to all the resort has to offer. The rooms we were in were not falling apart. They were very clean; beds were comfortable and not really outdated. The bathroom was quite large and in great shape. AC worked well too. The resort has many restaurants. The prices tend to be somewhat expensive but no more than you would pay at any other resort. I must say that we didn鈥檛 have one bad meal at the resort. The food was very good. You can do a casual meal outside on the patio overlooking the pool or a more formal one at Stingrays or Blossoms. Do yourself a favor. Get some food for the room like bagels, cereal etc if you want to save a bit of money. The room has a coffee machine. We also bought some rum and beer on hand to make drinks. The only issue I has was paying $5.50 for a bottle of beer. Go to the local supermarket and get a Styrofoam cooler for $2.00 and fill it up. Rooms also have small refrigerators too. The pools were clean and refreshing. There are 3 pools and a waterslide on the main level. I would also suggest going over to Las Casitas to swim in the infinity pool. Although it states that only guests of the Casitas can utilize the pool, we went several times and were handed towels from the staff. No one will bother you. It鈥檚 a beautiful pool with a magnificent view. Palomino Island was also a favorite among our group. Taking the boat ride to the island is fun and enjoyable. Once you arrive on the beautiful island, everything you need is there. Food, drinks, lounge chairs, towels, snorkeling gear, jet skis etc etc. The beach is a bit rocky when entering the water but once you get into the beautiful Caribbean, you鈥檒l forget all about it. The resort is going through a $95 million renovation. I will admit it does need some TLC here and there but you will not get the spectacular views, beautiful beaches and above average accommodations at another resort in Puerto Rico. We all enjoyed our vacation and all agreed it was well worth the money spent. PS- Don鈥檛 miss out on the Bio Bay tour, it鈥檚 so close to the hotel. Ask the concierge to give you the info for Island tours. Ask for Havier. It was a FANTASTIC experience

<Content>Great Resort in Puerto Rico Hesitant at first because of some of the reviews that I read on this site, I was not sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with the resort. It is a very large place with many different things to do. The resort is very family friendly with many pools scattered throughout the property. I found the resort and room to be very clean, however the rooms were outdated. The beach is not at the resort itself. There is a ferry that brings you to the beach which is on a beautiful island about fifteen minutes away by boat. The beach is great with plenty of lounge chairs and a snack bar and places to rent water toys. The beach is unbelievably clean and beautiful. There are many places to eat at the resort ranging from very casual to formal. The food prices at the resort are high but I found the quality of the food at the restaurants to be excellent. The Chinese, Italian, and Steak restaurants were all very good. Be ready for the high priced food. I booked a partial oceanview room and the room had a great oceanview from its balcony doors. I would recommend staying in the marina area because the view of the ocean is fantastic and the ferry to the beach is closeby. However staying in the marina makes for a long walk up to the rest of the resort, which I did not mind. If you don't want to walk a lot ,staying at the main area of the resort is recommended.

<Content>Had a great time at El Con I got a little worried when I read some of the reviews. But, don't believe everything you read. My wife and I decided to get away before school started. We chose El Conquistador based upon a recommendation of a friend. What a great resort. The resort was very busy when we arrived but check-in was done smoothly as we were checked in by a clerk at a separate registration desk. We booked an oceanview room and we were given a room in the Marina section of the resort. The room was clean, but you can see the room definitely needs an upgrade which the bellman told me they were getting ready to do. The Marina was great..It was a much quieter area of the resort. The funicular ride (tram that takes you down the mountain) was a little tiresome after a few days but it wasn't bad getting around. Palomino Island was amazing. We went Jet Skiing and kayaking. The drinks and food at the resort are expensive but we were already told about that by our friends. Blossoms was the best restaurant with phenomenal Chinese Food. The Las Brisa Restaurant Breakfast buffet was also great. There wasn't alot of entertainment at night, but the Casino was fun, even though I lost. The best part for me was the Golf Course which was in great condition and has amazing views. My wife really enjoyed the Golden Door Spa. One night we did the Bio Bay Tour where you go by Kayak through one of the only Bioluminescent Bays in the world, it was right next to the hotel. Overall, we had a great time. The rooms need help and the food and beverage is pricey. The front desk clerk at check out told us at check out that the resort is undergoing a renovation of all of their rooms and are adding a waterpark. We will definitely be back.

<Content>Can't Wait to go Back Yes the rooms need an update, but they are clean and comfortable. The staff is gracious and willing to help. There was a huge local convention which made things a little crazy but we had no problems. Getting into the restaurants( which are expensive but not any more than other resorts) was easy. David's Cookies had some cheap options for breakfast. The food in Isabela's was great, especially loved the Sea Bass. This was our 3rd time at the El Con and we can't wait to go back. We spent a lot of time at the Las Olas pool which was really peaceful. It looks like they are adding some new stuff. They have pictures of the new rooms in the lobby and I heard some of the staff talking about a Waterpark they are building in the Marina with 3 Slides and a lazy river.We will definitely be back.

<Content>Unbelievable!!!!! I usually do not write reviews on this site, but it made me very upset to read what I was reading before I made the trip to El Conquistador. I went with my wife and 2 kids age 3  5 with an open mind. Everyone that I has spoken with said this place was Breathtaking and you have gotta go! I read these reviews and did not really know what to think? Well, We just got back last night and we had the best vacation we have ever had!!! The views are breathtaking. We stayed in an Oceanview room overlooking both the Atlantic and Carribean. I personally am very picky in my hotel rooms I usually stay at Hilton, Embassy Suites etc. The room was fine especially once you look outside the balcony and see paradise. The rooms are a little outdated, but very clean and extremely acceptable to our taste. The beds were very comfortable and everything worked great!! When you go to a resort like this, you are going for paradise not to stay in your rooms all day. We were in our rooms in the morning before breakfast and at night to go asleep. My wife and kids hung out at the pool for 1 day while I played golf. The golf course is outstanding and well manicured. Shot 77 with a double bogey on 18???? The pools are clean and a blast!!! We has the best time on the private island. If we had to do again, we would spend everyday there, It is truly Gilligans Island. Grass umbrellas, horseback riding. Absolutely the best time you will have!! The boat takes about 20 minutes which seems like 5 minutes. The boats leave El Con and the island about every 30 minutes. If you want more wind and breeze, go to the right side of the island when you get off the boat. Truly Paradise, we did not want to leave!! We got married in Jamaica and this place literally blows that away!!! cont--------

<Content>worn-out, bad service observed whirlpools with mold, pools that require resurfacing, old very worn rooms with broken decorations and balconey doors that were broken, also broken tram(funicular)...there are only 2 and one was not in operation..no sign or warning.carefull around landscaping in the pool area as several exposed electrical wires were observed. reservations for dinner were lost...even though we called and re-confirmed upon check-in. bar unable to make mojito(no mint leaf)-a signature drink of Puerto Ricobar did not stock Bacardi Limon either.-produced on the islandservice was not a strong point of this facility..the view is A+++ , the private island is OK, all meals RESORT priced $$$$ consider this a nice place to stop before or after visiting El Yunque for an expensive drink and a very nice view but not to eat or for overnight stay..should only consider an overnight stay if you can get it for less than $175.00 with all the service , resort and parking fee's( the daily service fee's add up to about $55.00)this resort will be undergoing major updating during 2006-2007...may wish to wait till 2008 for overnight stay.

<Content>El Con was Okay We visited the El Conquistador for a long weekend to attend a friend's wedding in May. Having read all of the reviews we were a bit concerned but we ended up having a very good time. We're not picky travelers and we got a rate of $160 per night through Priceline so we weren't expecting too much.Our room was in the La Vista wing of the resort. Worn  tired is how I would describe it. There were scuff marks on the walls, subtle but noticeable stains on the carpet and the furniture just looked old (not in a quaint way). On the plus side the bathroom was large and we had a fantastic view. There was a fridge in the room which we took advantage of by stopping at the grocery store to stock up on beer, soft drinks and snacks. Some friends who stayed in other parts of the hotel said they had great rooms but we never got a chance to see them.While the restaurant prices are very expensive, I didn't think they were that outrageous relative to other resorts. The food was generally decent but nothing special. However, they do nickel and dime you at ever turn. $15 for satelite parking, $5 for internet access, $2 to make a toll free phone call, $4 for water, expensive rental fees for beach toys even though they charge you a resort fee, etc...The biggest negative is the beach situation. There is no beach right at the resort so you have to take a ferry to their private island. It took exactly one hour to get to the beach from the time we left our room. The ferries supposedly leave every 1/2 hour but on our return we waited over 45 minutes for it to arrive. Some people in line waited over 30 minutes and didn't even make it on. God knows how long they waited for the next one. On top of that the beach is only average by Caribbean standards.On the plus side we thought the service was always friendly and generally efficient. The pool areas are nice and we never had a problem finding chairs at any time of day. Overall the grounds are well kept.We were there with a group and had a great time but I would not have been happy had we paid top dollar and I certainly wouldn't hurry back.

<Content>El Con; the good the bad and the other... I just got back from a four night trip to El Conquistador.I have read a lot of reviews before my trip and having experienced this hotel, I can say that I agree with both the negative and positive. I will start with the positive. The views are beautiful. The gardens are very well maintained. Most of the staff are extremely attentive and helpful. We had our shower and toilet fixed very quickly. The island is the place to be, there are hiking paths to quiet and private beaches on the other side of the island. I would like to recommend Balyhoo restaurant and Stingray cafe, both places have good food and good drinks, they are also by the water. And now the negatives. I read all the reviews that talk about the price of food. Yes, $3.50 for a 16 ounce bottle of water in the Palomino Island cafe is much but what about paying $3.25 for a Wall st Journal?Or $20 for a one way cab trip to a restaurant 7 minutes away from the resort? Not to mention Caribe restaurant(which my girlfriend named Jock strap cafe)where the low qulity of food, high prices and terrible service make this place an ultimate no-no. The island's main beach is very loud and crowded I have to say that this place is not very romantic . There are so many people. So much noise and excitement. It seems like a perfect place for families. There is some exciting action for everybody. Even the cute grandmas that were left at the slot machines.They will charge you for everything and the markups of stuff like newspapers, water and other basic things are outrageous.The rooms need updating; my TV almost fell because the cabinet was so old. My toilet and shower gave me trouble on the first day(they did fix it right away)The spa is very good and the service is good as well.I would suggest a visit to El Con if you are staying at the village(which looked terrific) or if you want to go on vacation with you entire family.

<Content>They saved my Vacation!!! I was originally staying at Paradisus Resort (See my review) but Paradisus was terrible. I called The El Conquistador and was able to book one of the private Villas at Las Casitas Village. We packed our bags, left Paradisus and took a cab to the El Conquistador. Actually the El Conquistador sent the cab for us as Paradisus could not locate one!!!  If you want to experience luxury, great service, superb food and friendly smiles than Las Casitas Village at the El Conquistador is the place to go. Our one bedroom Casita overlooked the ocean and had a huge balcony where we sipped wine in the evening and had coffee in the morning. The beautiful Infinity pool was busy but the two other private pools for Las Casitas guests always had Lounge chairs and friendly staff to serve you. I wish I had written down the names of the great staff that serviced our needs. I did meet one of the Food and Beverage Managers Ms Keyla Tarabochie who went above and beyond in getting us dinner reservations and spent time helping us plan our days so our dining experiences would be the highlight. Even the little snack bar named Virgin by the main pool serves a crab cake cobb salad worthy of any fine NYC restaurant. If the whole management team is of the level of Ms. Tarabochie than this resort will always succeed. Having just had such a bad experience at Paradisus my expectation level was low. Each day as I walked throught the beautifully landscaped grounds of the El Conquistador I was so pleased that I made the decision to leave Paradisus. I soon realized the my original expectations of Paradisus were being exceeded by the El Conquistador. Each day we planne to take the Ferry to the El Conquistadors private Island and beach but could not tear ourselves away from the luxury and service of Las Casitias. Now we have a reason to return. Thank you to everyone at the hotel that salvaged our vacation. The hotel and staff are tremendous.

<Content>Loved this resort. It is paradise I just came back from staying at El Con for a week with my husband and 2 kids ( 8 and 12). We loved every minute of our stay. We checked in a day before Southern Living group showed up so the check in took 5 minutes. United Airline had sent one of our suitcases to Chicage so the front desk sent us tooth brushes and tooth pastes as soon as we walked into our room. We had a deluxe ocean view room in Las Brisas only a floor down from the main lobby. That was a major plus since everything was very close by. The most important thing in this hotel is location of your room, cause it is so spread out that getting to the main lobby can be a pain if you are in the La Marine village and have to take the funicular.The staff was great and everyone that we came across was very helpfull and friendly. We had rented a car which I would definitely recommend. We drove to the rain forest and Old San Juan and had dinner at Old San Juan one night. As for everyone complaining about food prices, you have such a vast choice of restaurents in this hotel that you can eat any way your budget allows. There is David's Cafe in the main lobby with a cup of coffee for $2.00 and a Muffin for $2.75 or you can eat at Caribe Island ( 2 eggs, toast and coffee for $7.95, or french toach for $6.50) or the breakfast buffet for $20.00 per person. The restaurent by the main pool (cafe Bella Vista) makes the best Pizza, that I shared with my husband for $13.00 and we had 2 pieces left over. The restaurent at the beach is pricey but gives you big portions that most people were sharing a sandwich. One day I shared a chicken sandwhich ($16.00) with my daughters and they put them in 2 plates with plenty of fries and cole slow for each of us, another day we shared a club sandwich for $13.00. We didn't eat at the signature restaurents (Otello's, Blossom's, Isabellas). We went out for dinner couple of nights but had breakfast and lunch at the hotel everyday. Definitely go to the Palomino Island it is great. While sun bathing you will be seeing roosters (my son had never seen one so he was very excited) , chickens, rabbits, lizard, star fish, etc. Infinite pool in Las Casitas Village is a must see.Our room was spotless clean and apparently one of the nicer rooms so we had no complaints. We had stayed at the Omni resort in Orlando in our last vacation and we didn't know what to expect of this resort after reading some people's comments but we loved every minute of our stay. This is a beautiful resort and would love to go back. Once the renovation is completed it will be the jewel of Puerto Rico. So relax and have fun you will love El Con Resort.

<Content>El Conquistador was great hotel to stay Just returned from stay at El Conquistador and had a great stay from 6/15 to 6/19/06. Weather was great. Their island is wonderful. They only take your room key on island and yes you have to take a boat over but they run both ways every 30 minutes. Was very concerned from reviews I had read before departure, but we did not have any problems with hotel staff or food. The rooms do need remodeling and that will began in 2007. They are currently adding an additional 200 rooms. The El Yunque Rain Forest was great. We did the hike and It was so much fun. Also rode horses at foot of the rain forest. My daughter did the bioluminescence excursion and said it was awesome but not for small children. Very dark and at times you have to hang onto the trees while others are passing your group and one never knows what is in the tree at the time you go to grab on! I passed on this one. Group leaves at 8pm and returns at 11pm and lots of hard work. Yes the food is expensive but hey your are on vacation-enjoy. The property was beautiful and grounds were well maintained. The Golden Spa was wonderful. My daughter and I had a great time. We went to have a good time and we did. Excursions were all worth the money. We booked on line in advance because they do sell out fast-so don't wait! Others with our group did complain about the trip into San Juan. It was 3 hours on the bus and they were rushed once they got there.This was our first time to Puerto Rico and we had a great time. The El Conquistador should be back up to high ratings once remodeling is complete. That end of the island was so beautiful we just enjoyed our trip. We were nice to the staff and they were nice to us.So if you were concerned about having a terrible vacation from the prior reviews -be happy and enjoy your stay at El Conquistador!

<Content>Beautiful resort but pricey! My husband and I stayed at this resort for a trip I had won through Southern Living at Home. I have to say that I was very nervous with all the bad reviews of this hotel but the trip was free so of course, we took the chance. The bus ride is a long one, but I caught a nap! Our check in was a little bit different since the resort was sold out for SLAH. Check in was not the greatest, we went to check in at 3:45 after standing in line for quite some time (again, due to 1100 people checking in that day) and was told that the room would be ready at 4pm. I had to stand in another line to see if my room was ready and finally it was at around 4:30ish. The bad thing is that while we waited for our room, there wasn't a single bar open. We went to the casino and the guy there was very nice and went back and got us 3 beers and a pina colada on the house and urged us to complain to the front desk. They ended up giving us an oceanview room so we were pleased. We found the staff to be very, very nice. If I would have paid their normal rate, I might have been a little disappointed in the room. I would say it was average. The room had a good amount of space with a nice balcony but it could use an update, but nothing appeared to be dirty and we didn't see any signs of mildew or anything else that others have complained about. The bathroom area is huge and there is a very large walk in closet with a safe. THe actual bathroom with the toilet and shower is small but there is a large dressing area that has a fridge and very big mirror and sink to get ready in. That was a definite plus! ONe thing I will warn you about is that the prices there are OUTRAGOUS! I almost passed out when I saw the menus! 18.00 for a hamburger, 16.00 for a hot dog, 9.00 for a glass of wine at one of the restaurants (for an average Pinot Grigio) and 7.00 for a Corona. We wised up pretty quickly and jumped in a cab the following morning to the closest grocery store. That ride cost us 40.00 but the rate is set by the govt. We stocked up on liquor, snacks and other stuff because we were not paying those prices! The Bally Hoo bar down by the marina had reasonable prices, 10.00 for quesadillas I didn't think was too bad and they were good! The only other place we ate at was at Stingray. The food was excellent and the prices not too out of line. Waiting for a taxi is an issue, we had to wait for an hour to get a taxi and found out later that we could have walked there (which we did on the way back). The conceriege didn't relay this info to us but we went to Ocean View. If you are looking for a quick dinner, you won't get it there but the food is great, it appears to be a hole in the wall that is family owned but again, you aren't there for the atmosphere! We all laughed about it later, I think we were there about 2 1/2 hours. They do the best the can and we were glad we went.There are definitely some negatives to this resort but some awesome positives. We had no problem at all taking the ferry over to the island, we did have to stand in line at times but we loved the island. There are wild rabbits there that are huge and they will walk right up to you and let you feed them. That was cool. The swimming was great, lots and lots of seaweed on one side. The other side is extremely breezy and the beach is rocky rather than seaweed. Lots of people were finding starfish in the water. Some idiots decided to take them home which we knew was illegal but they don't seem to realize that a living creature is inside the starfish. We played with our for awhile and swam around with it and it's awesome how gently it latches on to your hand and is very flexible in your palm, we of course put it back where we found it. We did spot several jellyfish so be careful and I got a great glimpse of a large stingray. We snorkeled of course, it's better snorkeling on the other side where it is breezy but be sure to bring your water shoes.Overall, great trip since it was free and the views are spectacular. Being more prepared with snacks going in would be good to save some money!

<Content>Nice trip but the El Conquistador Could Use an Update My family stayed here for a week and we really enjoyed our stay despite the negatives. My family is actually rather picky about where we stay so the fact that we had an enjoyable time unlike others is pretty amazing.There was a shuttle waiting for us when we arrived. It was a very long shuttle ride especially since we arrived on a Saturday which is when apparently all of Puerto Rico goes to the beach. It took nearly two hours to get there because of traffic but there was nothing that could have prevented that. The entrance area of the hotel is really nice as is the lobby, with many areas available for lounging around. These areas came in handy when it rained later in the week because there was actually somewhere to go other than our room. Our room was in the main hotel yet it was still quite a hike from the casino and pool area. We had an oceanfront room which as everyone has said was pretty outdated. There was however a balcony which was great for reading and looking out over the ocean. It smelled rather moldy. There were several times when we needed something (a pillow, towels, etc.) and the front desk said they'd send someone as soon as possible but no one ever showed up and we didn't get what should have been in the room already. Going to the beach I have to admit was a pain. Several times one of the faniculars were broken so everyone had to wait for the one. Don't get me wrong, the island was great, but getting to and from the island required way too much planning for vacation! Since the boat only ran on the half hours if the fanicular took longer than expected you were inconvenienced. If we wanted to get to the island by 11:30am we typically had to leave our room by 10:30 to insure that we would get on the 11:00 boat. This didn't always happen as planned and as one could imagine it was irritating after a few days of only one working fanicular. It also rained once when we were on the island. The storm clouds grew in a matter of minutes and everyone started running for the boat line as it instantly began to pour. Obviously everyone didn't get on the boat (we did) and there wasn't enough head covering to protect everyone from getting soaked. Plus, the ride back to the hotel was REALLY choppy.The spa was great but not the best I've ever had. The food wasn't that exceptional given how much it cost but there were quite a few options which was nice. The pool was enjoyable but typically packed. Take advantage of the happy hours here! The casino was fun. However, one night someone won several hundred dollars on a slot machine and the following day that particular machine was removed! You really don't have to leave the hotel because there's enough at your footsteps to entertain you. The hotel also seems to be a place where many of the well off locals seem to go for long weekends. While I was there there we also a few Puerto Rican conferences which meant there were tons of kids around the pool. All in all I don't know if I'd stay here again. Our stay wasn't terrible but it's not entirely worth the money. I would probably stay here again if they updated the rooms. Don't stay here if you aren't comfortable taking a boat to the beach!

<Content>Ignore bad reviews - this hotel was amazing!! My husband and I just got back from an 8-day, 7-night vacation at the El Conquistador and could not have had a better time. I am disappointed that other reviewers on this site are steering people wrong. I was expecting something terrible and nervous about our choice in hote. I was very pleasantly surprised. The resort grounds were just spectacular. From the minute we arrived the staff was so nice and accomodating. Our room was great. It was very large and so was the bathroom. Sure, an update would be nice, but I thought the room's decor fit nicely with the island. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. For the amount of time you actually spend in your room during vacation, it was perfect! I have no complaints. My husband played gold several times and thought the course was one of the best he's played. I went to the spa twice and loved every second of it. Sure the food and such was a little expensive, but not out of the ordinary from what you would find at any other vacation resort. Getting around the island was a little difficult and expensive, but there really wasn't much reason to leave the hotel. We do scuba dive, so we had to rent a car to get there to avoid high taxi prices, but it was fine. I would stay there again and again. Don't be afraid of these ultra-picky traveler reviews. It was amazing!

<Content>Don't bother - expensive, tired rooms, generally not helpful staff We stayed at this hotel a few nights for an event, so it was not our choice of location. But let's start with the good things:1. The grounds are lovely and well maintained2. The private island and beach there are very nice and worth the boat trip. There were plenty of chaise lounges and nice facilities on the island.3. It's a large resort and can handle a lot of people.Now the less desirable things:1. It's an hour or more from the airport in modest traffic. If you take their transportation (big bus, why bother) it's $33 each way per person. Rent a car instead.2. Check -in was miserable. Check in staff was not helpful nor friendly. Same was true of checkout.3. Room are very tired. DON'T stay in the marina area. Our first room was large but had no AC. When we called to have it fixed they moved us. Second room was tiny and needed repairs. The third room was in the las brisas building on top of the hill which was much better. It was clean and had been refurbished. It's sad that it took that much work to get a decent room (and hours of our day). 4. Bell staff is miserable. 90 minutes to get luggage delivered shouldn't be tolerated. Take your own.5. The marina village and las olas were very isolated and you had to take the train all the time (busy and a delay). It's ok if you want to go the beach but to have to take it for food, beverages, etc is tiring.6. Everything is too expensive for what it is.7. Food was decent but not great. We tried 4 restaurants -- all were not what we expected for the price. By the way -- they are in the process of tearing down one of the nicer garden areas and building a large waterpark. I can only imagine how difficult it will be to get around on the little trains once that is built.Stay somewhere else. This place is not worth it.

<Content>Wasted Money - El Conquistador Resort  We visted the El Conquistador Resort  Golden Door Spa in May 2006. It is not the lavish resort advertized on it's web site. Instead, the room decor is shabby at best. Additionally, there was mildew in the grout of nearly all the tiles in both the entryways and bathrooms. The carpets were stained and dirty. The air circulation vents were covered with mold, meaning that when air was circulated, mold spores would also be circulated throughout the room and inhaled by the occupants - a health hazard, particularly for those with asthma or allergies. The hotel changed our room several times and all were in similar condition.The air conditioning and satellite television went out several days prior to our arrival and was not repaired during our stay. It was 100 degrees during the day and 85 degrees at night. We were in a room that was at the base of the cliff on the marina. The resort uses funiculars (elevators) to move guests from the base of the cliff to the other levels of the resort. There are only two of these and one was out of service, meaning that we waited outside in 100 degree heat for more than a half hour to catch one. Elevators were also chronically out of service.Positives: We found the staff to be the most courteous we have ever encounted. The private island is lovely.We were miserable. We left the resort several days early. The resort agreed to issue a full refund for the entire stay, but once we returned home we found out that they only refunded a portion of our stay. We would never return to this resort or recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Tired, rude, and over-priced I agree with other posters that the rooms were a bit tired, the pool was less then pristine (and the hot tub kind of swampy), and the prices were OUTRAGEOUS! But what really bothered me about this place was the apathetic and at times down-right rude service. Where do I begin... I was repeatedly met with eye rolls and one syllable answers when I aksed various hotel staff for directions or other assistance. I saw a couple of the guys in our group order drinks from the casino waitress. She turned to them and snapped, you gonna pay for it? I'm not getting them unless you tell me who's gonna pay for it. Even if the drinks were not on the house because they weren't sitting at a table at the moment, she was ridiculously rude. One couple in our group had their camera stolen from the casino and security seemed as if they couldn't care less. They were told that although the security cameras caught the thief on video, there was nothing that could be done about it. The whole incident seemed fishy. Another person prebooked the shuttle bus back to the airport on her final day, only to arrive and be told that the bus was full and she'd have to wait an hour for the next one. She barely made her flight. Overall, I was extremely disappointed in El Conquistador. It is clear to me that this place is just gliding by on its reputation, hoping to squeeze the most money out of their guests while doing the least for them. I would not recommend this place for the price!

<Content>you've got to save up for this one Ay caramba is this place expensive. We were there off season for a meeting, so the room was reasonably priced, but this resort sure makes up for that in charges for everything you can imagine ($10 for a bell fee, which they don't let you know about until it winds up on your bill, 25$/day for internet connectivity, etc). We had a simple lunch by the pool of hamburgers (which were actually quite good), but which cost $18 apiece. A small bottle of water is $3.50. fortunately most of our meals were included with the meeting, but we still spent a lot for snacks. The resort is far away from anything else, we couldn't rely on our trick of stocking up on water and snacks at a local convenience store. The food is actually pretty good, but not worth the prices charged.The rooms are really outdated, but I understand that a major rennovation is planned. One thing to note is that the maids only change the linens and don't clean the bathroom. We got a little sand in our tub, and it stayed with us for all 4 days that we were there.The pools are pretty but too small for the size of the resort. You have to take a boat over to Palomino Island (25 min trip) to get to the beach. The island and beach are breath takingly beautiful, but the boat lines can get quite long and there only a small awning to wait under; we stood in the blazing sun for almost an hour as there were so many people waiting that we watched two boats come and go.

<Content>5-Star?? Very disappointing.... Just came back from spending 2 days at El Conquistador. We were really looking forward to our stay there for which we had really high expectations. For a long time, we had heard so many great things about this hotel so we were really disappointed when we got there. From the moment we pulled up to the Valet ($20/day) we realized that we weren't staying at a 5-star resort. Noone bothered to greet us, much less help us with our bags. My husband had to go look for someone to leave the car to..... Lady at the Front Desk was just average not very service oriented. We went to the infinity pool at The Casitas where they didn't have any towels available, we asked the attendant twice and he just responded that they were out. The gentlemen didn't bother at all. If you are not familiar with Las Casitas, they are villages within the El Conquistador complex and they average nightly rate is around $600 or higher...I think towels in the pool should be included at that rate. Overall, the serivce was awefull and definitely not what you expect from a 5-star resort. The rooms are completely outdated and in dire need of a rennovation. Also, don't expect to watch TV in bed as the TV is set up on a wall where it makes it impossible to watch from the bed. Haven't they heard of pull out shelves that tilt to make viewing possible??In conclusion, the concept of this resort is great but they need some serious work. Service is lacking and rooms need to be updated.

<Content>NEEDS TLC!! Jsut got back from Memorial day weekend and have to tell you that the rooms in this hotel are not only dated but in terrible need of attention. I understand they were recently bought by LXR and hope that they invest what's needed to revamp this property. Our A/C did not work well and they had a lame excuse for not washing bed sheets. According to a postcard they tell you that they are ENVIRONMENTALLY sensitive and that if you don't place the card on your bed they will not change them.. Give me a break!!! Food is OK but expensive. Palomino island (the beach) was very nice. The pool had loud local music and too many KIDS!!Hope this review helps a little.

<Content>Beautiful~ I just recently stayed at the el conquistado. I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences EVER! May 25-29... I just got back yesterday. Now I read I think EVERY one of these reviews, yes there are a FEW things I agree with completely, others dont even come close to accurate-TIPS---Dont stay at the casistas villages- its 700 hundred a night for crap- we met 2 people that stayed there and brought us over and number 1.. our view was better they had palm trees in the face- and it was the president suite- it was OKAY- our room was actually more up to date then theirs were- number 2- the people in the casistas that sit by the infinity pool are absolutly SNOTTY! They actually stick their nose up at you--DO get a REFLEXOLOGY MASSAGE it was sooo good we actually cancelled our other 2 treatments--DONT go to the blominessance bay tour- My mother in law got so bit up she had to go to the doctors today- and its not worth the money--Do split lunches and dinners- they give you enough to make 2 people feel full-DAY 1- We arrived on thurs LATE night it was about midnight- So we get out of the airport looking for this bus that says el conquistador on it to find this lady outside with an el conquistador shirt on saying that something messed up with the time of the buses and either we can wait an hour for the bus to come or they will pay for your taxi here- So my mother in law and i decided to save the 66 bucks and take the cab ride- It was very nice and air conditioned- It DID take about an hour to get there which really isn't fun when you really just want to get there already -but we arrived and had this little ad from a Marie Claire magazine which we found a week before we left stating we can have up to a 200 hundred dollar a night upgrade if we bring it to the front desk.... well let me tell you- our room was absolutely amazing... The BEST view ever.....DAY 2-Wake up early go get the BEST REFLEXOLOGY MASSAGE I have ever recieved it was soooo amazing- Go to polomino island which was beautiful - the only thing i didnt like about there was there was seaweed and stuff on the top of the water which i find is gross- OH YEAH - and share the cheeseburger its 16 bucks... ha... that is the ONLY thing that i found to be overly expensive- and the 6 dollar bottle of figi water- but THATS IT... i seen everyone on here saying how expensive everything was- well im from NJ and its actually cheaper there then here- Later then night i took her to blossoms... we had the filet mignon and lobster.. hibachi style- it was beautiful- We had 4 mai tais and shared the filet and lobster which it said they charge you a sharing fee of 20 bucks...but they didnt even charge us for it... as well as the ice creams and singing they did for my mother in laws birthday - everyone was VERYYYYY NICE-DAY 3-We stayed at the pool and met the BEST bartenders ever.... When you go stay at the swim up bar and theres 2 people there that i suggest- Angel Perez .... hes extremely nice and hooks you up with everything...hes from bk ny and it amazing...and a girl by the name of angelise...shes great too... we wanted coconuts so bad because we never tried one and the second day at the pool they suprised us with them....they usually dont give them at this time of the season- it was really cool.. and i mean we must have drank 20 rum and cokes and then shots and everything else and our bill with the tip was 100 bucks... NOT BAD AT ALL---Day 4- we decided to do the bloominessance bay tour which sucked completly at night- it was disgusting-thats enough about that-But everyone was extremely nice.. they even gave us a 50 dollar credit for waiting for a cab 2 long... and a bottle of champagne AND a beautiful cheese platter send to our room- oh yeah and def go to the fajardo mall- and if you want some good local rice and beans REALLY cheap go to estabans--- OMGGGGGGGGGGG its amazing food.. we were talking about it the entire trip and even now i could get some-overall, it really was an amazing trip- and if you go the splash bar and you see angel and angelise tell them - the 2 ladies from nj say hello we met him and her over memorial day weekend- ...Have a great trip- this is def a place to see-- the views are beautiful - the grounds are beautiful - the people are beautiful- and there is no bugs! hehe--i dont understand why everyone says the staff sucks... when in reality it was the best staff i ever met-i didnt even want to leave...

<Content>El Conquistador Hotel and Spa No Way Jose!!! My wife and i have been all around the world and have grown accustomed to resorts that actually meet their 5 star rating. The El Conquistador did not!The room we had, located on the sixth floor facing Palomino Island, was outdated and no way could compete with the splendor of the ocean view.The fixtures, furniture, and clothes drawers were pre 1980. The handles fell off the drawers, even after a resort maintenance employee spent several hours attempting to fix them.The overall rating on this room should have been a minus star! The staff were outstanding, friendly but not very expeditious. Things took a while to happen.The golf course on the other hand was magnificent. The course is well maintained from tee to green. The Arthur HIlls design was difficult from the back tees, though subtle and negoiatable for my wife, who played from the ladies tees. The fee was rather high at $165.00 per guest!The food no doubt is grossly overpriced. The casino provided just one Texas Holdum table which was surprising considering the three nights i played, potential players left frustrated that vacant seats never became vacant. Made money at the table! Be prepared to pay outlandish prices from USA Today $3.70 to $16.00 for a simple hamburger at Palamino Island, to over $200.00 dollars for dinner for two at Isa Belas.You must have a rental car, otherwise you are stuck at the resort with limited things to do. Palamino Island is nice but not more than two times. In closing i suggest waiting for the major rennovation to reach completion and maybe then you will not be confronted with the 3 inch roach that spent the last night with us, much to our disllike. Couldn't catch that little sucker, finally decided to sleep with one eye opened.

<Content>Close to Paradise!! I just read the review, which will be prob the one prior to mine and priceline for $105!!! I thought I got a good deal for $130. Plus we got upgraded to ocean view with a balcony. Now we really couldn't complain at all!! That's A+ for customer service!Yes, the rooms were a little outdated and run down, but there were floor plans of a renovation later this year. It entices me to come back again in the future.And yes, the food can get pricey, but that's expected. We had a rented car, so we ate some of our meals off-site.The place is very well maintained. The fernicular down to tram was a pretty ride down to the marina. The beach is a short ferry ride away, and when you're on vacation, it really didn't matter, what's the rush...It wasn't crowded with people at all, and we were very happy with the weather.We did the bioluminescent bay tour, make sure you bring bug spray! We were attacked with bug bites. The tour was well worth it, def. one of a kind, but not recommended for high maintenance folk.Yes, I would def. stay here again....

<Content>Great Place! I must say that my wife and I were a little skeptical of the El Con based on some of the poor reviews but we just got back from a weeks stay and it was GREAT! Here are the few minor negatives:1) Yes the rooms are a tad outdated and need some updating. The fact of the matter however was we slept in the room and that was about it. We didn't go to the resort to rot in our room. Furthermore we had a beautiful view of the gorgeous golf course, the mountains and the Atlantic Ocean.2) Yes it is expensive. Be ready to spend some serious money on food. Having said that we thought the meals were very good and we were on vacation and ready to spend the money realizing we were at a resort which usually means big bucks for the food. We actually made an excursion into town and bought things like water, soda, chips, wine etc. It helped offset some of the expenses. We also ordered room services for dinner a few times which saved us a few bucks and we had romantic dinners on our terrace.The positives:1) The layout of the resort and the location is awesome. Set in the cliffs of PR overlooking the Atlantic  Caribean.2) Great Golf Course. Play after 4pm and get a discounted rate.3) Great Food. We tried almost every restaurant and loved them all.4) Great Pools. There are 5 pools and a private beach. You can always find a lounge chair and never feel like you are on top of other visitors.We just really had a nice time....other hints: Go to the Rain Forest its only about a 15 minute drive away...Plan a trip to the Casa Bacardi---lots of fun and the tours are free!! Rent a car at the airport. You can get a car for about a $300 a wk and park it at the hotel for $15 a day. It is worth it to have the flexibility to do what you want when you want and it ends up saving you money on tours and taxi's.I can't recommend the El Con enough. Do not be afraid of the negative reviews.

<Content>MAking sense of conflicting reviews We stayed here 5 nights for a wedding and enjoyed it with some small caveats. First, use priceline. This is the only resort in Fajardo so you'll know you're getting it. We got it for 105. The rooms are fine, not 4 seasons but you're not paying 4 seasons $. Even our garden view room had a nice view and the ocean view rooms have a great view. Its best to stay in the main area to be near all the activities and stores. If you like to gamble, the casino is a great addition. The pools are nice and weren't too crowded. It is true that the food is expensive, but its not bad. The biggest downside for us was the fact that the beach is on the island. Its a schlep to get there. If you're going for a beach vacation, try somewhere else. We rented a car which was good to get provisions to save on cokes etc (there is a fridge in room), but we didn;t use it otherwise because parking (which is 15/day, another legitimate criticism) is pretty far from the main area so its not convenient. The wedding was held on a spectacular cliff and they do a very good job of this. On balance, its a value on priceline, a nice property, but an inconvenient beach place.

<Content>Would Love to go back! Absolutely gorgeous - even though we were there during a rainy week, we didn't mind! The ride to the beach was my favorite. It's a bit too expensive for us to return any time soon but for any of those with the expendable income - you will love to spend your time and your money here. Maybe you'll get lucky in the casino and recoup your losses? We're not big gamblers, but had fun every day and every night. Room was clean and more than comfortable, but for the money, I would expect nothing less. Our trip was near - perfect!

<Content>Inconsistent hotel with tired decor First the positives:1. The employees at the hotel are very nice and want to assist you.Now the negatives:1. Hotel Decor is tired and run down. (Renovation is starting this year)2. Constantly getting charged for little things: A. Local call to a Walgreens ended up being $25 on phone bill. Hotel explained that it was the transfer charge from phone co??? Call was 1 mile awayB. Charge to use the gym was $25 per day. The hotel did have a free gym. but the equipment was so bad and out of commission that the nicer gym on premises charges $25 per day. They should be embarrassed by the free gymC. On Palomino Island a charge for a cup of water from the tap?D. Hotel shuttle from airport $30 per headE. Luggage tranfer fee on bill when checking out $20 at check in and $20 at check out. I did not realize this and tipped the bell hop separately.3. Food choices were expensive and not that good. Average dinner for two was running $200 at one of the 4 restaurants that were open. There are also 3 pool bar/marina bar type places for burger/beer and dinner for two there (burger and beers for two) $80. Also food was rather bland and boring at all places4. Very few palces to sit and read a book quitely. There is music blaring at the main pools. Construction going on around the mid level pools and constant boat engine noise at lower pools....There is an infinity pool in Las Casitas section that is really nice, but was told this is only for people in Casitas section. I still stayed and read my book. The staff was pleasant about it.5. Beach access is via a ride down the funicular onto a 20 minute boat ride and last boat out is 3PM, last return is 5PM. That romantic sunset walk on the beach is out of the question as there is no beach available after 5. YOu need to plan ahead to be at the beachI have stayed at many nice resorts and hotels around the world. This is the first negative review I have written, but felt that strongly about my stay that I had to write

<Content>Will Not Return The rooms at this resort are filthy and outdated. The bathroom in our room wreaked of mildew and the ceilings were warped and had water stains as did the carpeting. The room was never properly cleaned during the five days we were there and I had to request things that should be supplied like clean towels and wash cloths, clean drinking glasses and coffee. The maids just rinsed the drinking glasses and coffee pot each day and set them back on the bathroom counter. It made me wonder if they even replace them with clean ones before the next guests. Each evening we would bring our wine or cocktail back to our room with us after dinner and the next day the maids would rinse those glasses and set them on the bathroom counter. By the third day I was so frustrated I took ALL the glasses and set them on the floor with the dirty towels and a note begging them to please take them and leave us clean towels and wash cloths. We asked for, but did not receive a king bed. We had two full size beds that felt like army cots. We were lucky that our TV and alarm clock worked because we talked to others in our large group who told us theirs were broken. Everything else about the resort was OK other than the dirty swimming pool. The staff was very pleasant and friendly, but then again we didn't have any problems to report like theft of property or something else that would need extra attention. The casino was fun, but beware of the slot machines. I lost $30 in less than ten minutes and never even won a quarter! Very tight. My husband did OK with blackjack though. One lady at his table was annoyed with the dealer because she was stone faced and never cracked a smile. When this lady tried to lighten her mood a little the pit boss got very rude with her and told her to be quiet. I would have got up and left, but the lady stayed and kept her mouth shut. I have written this review as honestly as possible because I would hate to see some young couple save their money for a nice honeymoon and be as disappointed as we were. We were fortunate enough to be with a group that paid for our trip or I would be livid about the whole thing.

<Content>It was only two days, but... The El Conquistador is a lovely resort with many things to do. It was only two days, but two days were enough to see the resort, dine in their restaurants, spend a few hours at their private island, play in their casino and relax by the pools.Excellent friendly service at check in! We were allowed to check in early as well as getting two rooms closely located since we requested the deluxe ocean view. Room rates are EXTREMELY overpriced for what you get and when you book online, you are paying just the room rate. Upon checkout you get slapped with the room tax AND resort fee (and more than likely all the room charges for drinks and meals).Plan on eating/drinking at the resort's overpriced prices. You will feel like you are staying in a resort compound since the location of the resort limits access to the Fajardo area...unless you have a rental car. There is an Avis counter to rent a car for the day so you can do a day trip to El Yunque (don't miss the rainforest) or venture to Luquillo Beach for lunch.Palomino Island was fun and while your food/drink options are limited, it's an amenity not had by many resorts. Pack some snacks, water, or whatever you can so you're not stuck paying their high prices.One thing that would be a useful amenity is self-serve laundry. That way you don't have to pay over $50 to get a few items done through their laundry!Overall it is a very nice resort but don't restrict your caribbean vacation to be there only or you will miss out on so much more of this beautiful island!

<Content>Loved it I must be honest we where nervous after reading some of your reviews. It was a toss up of this resort or The Ritz. We chose this resort for the fact at night there might be something to do without leaving the resort.Arrived On Thursday May 4th and had no problems with the transportation and check in was very smooth. Within minutes we where escorted to our room with an ocean view down at the marina. It was a little bit of a hike but it was very private and cool. I would agree that the rooms need an uplift. We had a large room that was very clean and a deck that was right next to the marina. We ate at the main pool for lunch and agree it was overpriced but must say the chix wrap was awesome. Dinner that evening was at blossoms which we are sushi fans and must say it was outstanding and no more expensive than at home. Friday's dinner was at stingrays my wifes fish was outstanding and my scallops where just ok. saturday we ate at the italian place that was outstanding as well. We felt that everything and everybody was great and accomadating. The only incident we had was with the dive shop, they where dead wrong and I wound up not being able to go with them, but the Concierge took care of it and hooked me up with another place that was much less expensive and great people.I would go back for 3 days again.

<Content>Beware of this Property First and worst is the theft ring that works the property from the inside, while the resort claims this is not a usual problem .. the more we investigate the more we find this is very much the norm, even rampant there and we have only been checking into this for a few hours since we returned. We spoke with other guests that left at the same time who had money, laptops, and jewelry stolen. The police was even called but Never responded. I had an mp3 player stolen from my room and my video camera from the banquet room it is very obvious that keys are used and nothing is forced.While the view is spectacular, our room was not. We were dissapointed to find the bathroom to be very worn with peeling toilet seats, cracked sink and mildew in the shower/tub. They even had VHS player instead of DVD.. that speaks to when the rooms were last updated. But this was just the begining. Our first experience with the wait staff was bordering on rude almost everywhere we went. Almost all the food was dry and rubbery and seems to be that boxed, frozen and fried foods from costco type companies.. nothing is very fresh at the pool and beach areas except the nicer restraunts that have decent service and are only open at night. I left the resort crying for real food with some actual nutritional value. There are no vegetables and you would think that fruit would be a big part of a tropical island but to my surprise they were stingy with the fruits and vegies all over the island. The El Conquistador has no real representation of Latin food so the Puerto Rican experience is non-existant here. We left the compound to get that.The beach was tiny and you have to go to Palomino Island to get to it, they have Reggaeton music blareing through a bad sound system the whole time so you cant enjoy the sound of the ocean. (It's also at poolside too, but that is a party atmosphere) the cocktail service at the beach was served to us by people who would rather be anywhere else, and usually were.The staff at the entrance of the hotel (bellmen , valet etc.. were very nice until our exit)You are held captive unless you want to rent a car at 100.00 a day to start. They told us not to go anywhere unless you take one of thier tours due to unsafe conditions around the island. So you can stay and keep using your room key to charge to. We did rent a car and enjoyed other parts of Puerto Rico which were amazing though.. I would stay somewhere.. almost anywhere else! We felt safer everywhere except at the El Conquistador. The Security presence is mostly at the entrance and exit areas and that is it.The hotel is still investigating our theft claim and I can only hope they will do something to make us feel like they care, but I am under the impression they are quite aware of this problem and have decided to do nothing about it, or ..... you fill in the blanks on that part... I did.We had the enjoyment of having a great Travel Agent who booked all the check in logisitcs for us so the the front desk issues were easy to handle. This was a corporate function and our agent was right there on site taking care of us. He was the best thing about the trip.

<Content>Puerto Rico Wedding Getaway I was disappointed with the El Conquistador. Of course I am used to staying at nice hotels so I guess it depends on your frame of reference (recent hotels: Westin, JW Marriott, Atlantis, etc.). I found the rooms to be overpriced for the accommodations offered. I understand that some of the rooms have been somewhat renovated, but mine wasn't. I went for a friends wedding with a group rate of $275. My roommate was able to get the government rate so it didn't hit as hard $185. I still felt taken advantage of at this rate however. The rooms were comparable to a Holiday Inn. I felt the springs in the bed - not good (I really missed my Heavenly Bed). Also, there couldn't be any insultation between rooms because I could hear conversations in the next room. The rooms are just plain old.The hotel was recently purchased and there are plans to renovate the entire resort I'm told. I would probably consider this property again after the renovation if I wanted to be isolated. The resort is at least 1 hour from the airport, which depending on your origination city could be a pain. Also, you will spend a lot of time and money if you want to see anything else that PR has to offer. The food was extremely expensive -- $18 for a personal pizza and $3.00 for morning orange juice. The view is spectacular as is the Golden Door Spa. Only thing is that they add a 20% gratuity for you without your knowledge. I asked to add a gratuity upon departure and they told me it was done already which put me off a little b/c what if I wanted to leave more or even worse what if I didn't enjoy my massage? My friend that was married stayed at a villa at Las Casitas which runs from $600-800 a night. Again overpriced. While the villa is much nicer than the regular rooms it still lacked the luxury touch in furnishings and overall ambiance. The view is spectacular however. At that rate, one should walk in and say WOW, but it was a letdown.The staff is great -- very friendly and helpful. Outside of the view, the staff is the best asset at the Conquistador. They also had a kids club which seemed to have plenty of activities for the children. The pools were plentiful and although I didn't have time to make it to the island EVERYONE agreed that it was fantastic. It takes 30 minutes to get there by boat. There is no beach access at the hotel, but there is beautiful scenery.My trip was fine because it was short (4 nights) and purposeful. I lowered my standards in order to celebrate with my friend. Under different circumstances, I would have switched to another hotel. My last visit to PR we stayed at the Intercontinental. I found the accommodations there better than the Conquistador.

<Content>o.k. if you don't mind spending money Per a number of other reviews, this resort would be fine if you didn't care about a budget. I would not rate it a five-star resort--the rooms were fine, but nothing fancy. The grounds are beautiful, but you are captive at the resort and forced to pay very high prices at the restaurants. A trip to a neighboring restaurant (10 minutes away) cost us $90 (9 of us going), as we were forced to take a hotel taxi. The restaurant also had to have some connecitons with the restaurant, as it was also very expensive. The high side of the resort is the private island, which is quite unique. Presumably rather crowded, but we went out there at 3 pm, and practically had the place to ourselves. My husband ran around the island (don't know if this had anything to do with the fact that there are two clothing optional beaches) and was amazed at the size of several rabbits he saw. We only ate at one restaurant while at the resort, mainly because of the price. We ate lunch at the caribbean themed place in the main area, and it was really overpriced, with mediocre food and quite bad service. We had drinks down at a lower area bar, and several of our party had burgers there, which seemed fine. Had breakfast at David's coffee bar, which was overpriced but not as bad as the breakfast buffet.Some friends of ours who were at the resort at the same time as we were had money taken from their childrens' wallets, which were left out. The robbers took just some of the money, presumably thinking that no one would notice. Very sad they had to steal from children.I also had a spa experience, which was fine, but not worth the outragegeous prices they charged. So if you plan to come to this resort, come with lots of greenbacks and not great expectations. Some nice features, but definitely not what they charge.

<Content>Wonderful Place, Enjoy yourself The wife and I stayed at the resort from 4/13 to 4/19th. After reading some reviews we were a little nervous. But, everyone has an opinion, so here is mine with a few tips. We took the Bus(they supplied us with transportion from the airport to the resort for a total cost of$132.00(includes return) Sit in the front so you check in first. The bus had drinks and a short movie. We arrived early, but I was told the later you arrive, traffic is a little crazy and adds time getting to the resort. If you have kids, or are looking to save some money the food and drinks may be a little high at the resort for you, so rent a car(Little over $200.00 for the week). Driving around is not bad. You can eat at some of the local places near the resort(sizzlers, Ponderosa, Mcdonalds) and shop for snacks and drinks at WalMart. You can also tour the attractions, Old San Juan, the rain forest, etc. You can also rent a car for the day at the resort, it cost us $109.00 for the day. The tours from the resort cost about 50 per person. We arrived at the resort, checked in and was escorted to our room with bags. On the way we were given a tour. We stayed in Las Brisas. I recommend this part of the resort, you are near the main building, main pool and close to the funiculars to go down to the marina. Our room was very nice. The room and bathroom were clean. Our room was cleaned everyday. Where to eat. We ate breakfast at the Las Brisas grill. It cost us about $15.00 a day. The food was great. We also ate at the Sea food place down in the marina, drinks, appitizers, meal cost with tip around $189.00. The food was great. Yes a little high, but I am on vacation. We also ate at the italian(othello's). It was fantastic, our bill was about $149.00. I was full after this place and I can eat. Where to Swim. If you have kids they will enjoy the main pool. water slide, games, and other kids. If you are alone no kids, go to the second level, or even better go to the pool located near the marina, these were very peaceful. The private island is very nice. We paid 30 for lunch that was delivered to us on the beach. I highly recommend that you get down to the marina around 8:30am so you are on the first boat to the island. They were running 2 boats, and it takes 20 minutes to get to the island. You can be waiting at least up to a hour for a ride to the island if both boats leave at the same time. If your room has a mini bar, drink the soda and beer in it. Soda was around $1.50 from the mini bar and $3.00 everywhere else on the resort. Not really to much to do after 6pm. They had a show a few nights, and the casino gets packed. Not much for the Kids to do at night, so you may want to bring some games for them. The staff does a great job, we had a wonderful time, the place is really nice. Be patient slow down and enjoy yourself.

<Content>Good Trip, Won't Go Again Pros: (1) Beautiful scenery and views, (2) helpful staff, (3) Palomino Island, (4) the funicular and ferry (unusual features), (5) kid friendly pools, (6) accessibility to El Yunque. (7) decent room prices through Hotwire.Cons: (1) Absurd food and beverage prices, (2) $15/day parking (used as a penalty for going off resort), (3) a few noise-y neighbors, (4) room doors slam with dangerous force if balcony doors are open.Tips: (1) Bring snack, breakfast, and beverages from local grocery stores, (2) play golf at 4 p.m. for reduced rates, (3) take Forest Service tour of El Yunque, not the hotel tour, (4) take local biolumescent tour, not hotel tour, (5) visit Palomino Island as frequently as possible.Summary: It's not really Puerto Rico, it's a resort complex harbored from the real PR. If that's what you want, and don't mind paying high prices for hot dogs ($9), sodas ($3), beer ($6.50), and french toast ($15), not to mention dinner, then it's a fine place.

<Content>Beautiful hotel. The El Conquistador is a beautiful hotel, and I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Puerto Rico. The grounds are expansive and the landscaping in beautiful. We didn't have any problems with check-in, or with the staff. The pool are is very nice and it has great views of the ocean. I tried the scuba diving and it was amazing. There is a nice casino, and a game room for the kids. The restaurants were expensive, but that can be expected. I have stayed in many hotels in the caribbean and all of the restaurants are overpriced. I ate at Stingrays-fish, otello's-italian, blossoms-chinese and japanese, and isabella's-international. All of these restaurants were very good. We waited a long time for our food, but that is expected during easter week. the one downside to this hotel was getting to the beach. The hotel is on a high cliff so you first must take a funicular to the marina at the bottom of the cliff. then you must take a ferry which runs about every 20 min. to Palomino island. Palomino island is beautiful but the trip is inconvenient. other than that, i had a wonderful time and i would return.

<Content>Great The hotel was beautiful, but I did notice that the rooms near the pool needed to be redone. I had a wonderful time, the funicular was fun and the boat trip to the beach was great. Only thing i did not like was that when you eat lunch at the beach, there are chickens, roosters, birds and lizards all around your table. Food was great though. When you do leave, make sure you call the bellman to pick up your luggage early because it took them over an hour to get our stuff and we wanted to relax and have lunch before we caught our flight and I was so upset that we had to rush. I called the front desk 4 times and still no one could help me but say they should be there soon. then upon checkout the front desk was horrible, they conveniently forgot to discount our credit for booking and did not charge our room per day like we instructed them to. Also, be prepared to spend alot of money because lunch for 2 averaged about $70.00 and about $200-250 for dinner. Hotel is lacking in the management department, I think they need to be re-trained to get people in and out. Grounds were kept very clean and our room was very clean - place should offer all inclusive average hotel was $400 a night plus food = ridiculous amount of money being spent.

<Content>Spectacular Views and High Prices How much are breathtaking ocean views and a slice of a pristine, private beach worth? My husband, 18 year-old daughter and I spent six days on a Spring Break at the resort April 8-14 and think the key words hotel management communicates are: captive audience. We had a wonderful time but by the end of our stay our ears kept ringing from the constant cash register that went off each step we took on the grounds. For those who take a budgeting vacation with their physical vacation, this review may be irrelevant. However, if you want some details on value for money, please read on:First, the garden view room we booked was, including taxes, $350 a night (two small double beds) at an AAA discount in Los Olas. Our room had a spectacular partial view of the Caribbean (we got lucky?), a walk in dressing closet (nice touch) and large outer BR area (sink, vanity). The room istself was dirty. The carpet had not been vacuumed in quite some time (debris, dirt) and the sitting chair had decaying something-food (?) debris on it. During our six day stay our room and Los Olas hallway and stair carpeting were never vacuumed nor did we see or hear a vacuum in any part of the hotel. The entertainment center in our room was broken and never got fixed (phone call put on hold- I gave up waiting).We are glad we rented a car from Avis on site (nice touch) as we had a great time exploring El Yunque on our own (no guide needed) and old San Juan. Renting a car in San Juan for the entire trip would be recommended (save a bundle on food alone) but one needs to consider the hotel charge of $15 a day to park on their grounds. The room price does not include the $66 per person one way shuttle fee (not advertised) to get you to the resort. For three people- add $400- k-ching! When we arrived we were told our luggage would meet us at our room. Four hours later we phoned the concierge and asked for our luggage as we wanted to start our vacation (swimming). It arrived 20 minutes later. We began wondering: Is the view what we're paying for? The hotel cuisine: Forget the hotel food. It's mediocre and way overpriced. We were not in a hurry and I'd like to be kind. The truth- the service was often negligent and indifferent. A better idea is to rent a car and get to the nearest wonderful local restuarant: Passions, Anchor Inn, Lolitas, The Brass Grill, the open air roadside diners and bakery at the Yunque junction are far better for taste and value then anything the hotel offers. If you want to experience Puerto Rican cuisine (we did), the resort doesn't offer it. It's not unfair to say the hotel prices are absurd. The cheapest breakfast I had was at David's Cookies- a walk up counter-$9: one bran muffin- $3, one Dannon yogurt-$3, and one 16 oz (no refills) coffee-$3. Compare this to Starbucks (David's coffee tastes like watered down Hills Bros.) at $1.70 and a similar muffin at $1.65. At the local bakery three of us ate six delicious local cuisine pasteries and three cappacinos for a total of $8. Stir fried plantains were $1.We ate a wonderful dinner of steak fajitas at the Brass Grill for one third of the price of similar steak entrees on site. Dinner and dessert at Stingrae's was $167 for three people. The best parts of the hotel were what came with the room price: the beatifully manicured, lush grounds, the spectacular ocean views, the boat ride out to the private beach, the private, quiet beach itself, the nice lounge chairs and beach towels. We also liked the ability to rent a catamaran and snorkel (fun!). However, the idea that this resort offers something different for weeks on end is overrated. It's more like going to Disneyland and deciding which ride you want to go on again. A Next time at El Conquistador? no thank you. I'd rather spend a week on a spectacular Pacific coast beach looking out from my $150 a night spacious room!

<Content>Had a good time, but..... I read so many reviews prior to going on this trip that I wasn't sure what to expect. So, first, the resort is very nice with absolutely beautiful views. We stayed at the Marina section which was not by choice but ended up OK. Our rooms (we had adjoining for my husband and I and two children, 13 and 9) were fine. Although they could certainly use a facelift, overall clean. Problem was that in the marina, you are away from the main resort up top and have to take the trolley car up. Advantage - one step closer to the ferry for the beach (lines do get long). Disadvantage - boats start motoring up at around 6:30 a.m. so if you're a light sleeper and want to sleep in, this is not the location for you. Next, the pools. Not sure here what everyone loved about them. The pool by the marina was truly dirty. The main pool was very crowded and in need of uplift. I didn't see one pool that went deeper than 3 1/2 feet or so which didn't thrill my kids. The beach - very nice but very shallow with coral and seaweed everywhere. You have to be careful. And yes, it could be cleaner in the sandy areas. We did the horseback riding which was fun and we rented wave runners which the kids also enjoyed. The staff - very nice and pleasant. No complaints there. Restaurants - just OK. Very, Very expensive. I originally come from NY where I am somewhat used to seeing high prices. The resort's prices beat that. Drinks were ridiculous. So either bring your wallet and credit cards and suck it up, or decide to go on your diet during the vacation. We went to Old San Juan one day which was terrific! The forts were amazing (even my kids enjoyed it), views beautiful and then we walked around the town and had lunch in one of the many restaurants there. We rented a car for the day which seemed to be the most economical way to go. (We were told that a cab ride was $115 each way, and unfortunately, the concierge didn't have any tours going the day we wanted to go. Renting a Dodge durango cost $110 for the day.) The bus ride from the airport to the resort is over an hour. The bus is comfortable and provided softdrinks. So just sit back and relax. Would we go again? No. Did we have a great time? Yes. Don't worry if you've already planned your trip and are reading reviews like I did. You'll have a great time.

<Content>Had a very nice experience Stayed at the El Con 4/7-4/13/06. Had a very nice experience. Rooms were in the La Marina Village and were very large and comfortable. Would recommend staying there if you want to be near the water. Also quieter and easier to catch the boat to Palomino Island. Food is expensive but similar to any luxury resort. The resort staff were very nice and helpful. Resort is very large and not easy for those who have difficulty getting around. Funicular is slightly inconvenient but an experience as the views on the ride as well as from most of the resort are spectacular. Golf course is beautiful and tennis courts were in good condition and fun to play on. Wife and daughter had a great experience at the Golden Door Spa. Lots of kids so it is nice for families. Palomino Island is lovely, water is clean and warm. Plenty of chaise lounges. Never had to fight for a good spot by the water or a chair. Boat ride to Island slightly inconvenient but fun. All in all a very nice vacation and would return especially after upcoming renovations.

<Content>It needs the upcoming $75 million renovation - but we had a great time My husband and I spent last week at the El Con and, overall, we had a lovely vacation. However, as past reviewers have remarked, the rooms are in sad shape and the service is touch-and-go depending on who you get. With respect to the rooms: Upon our arrival, although we had reserved a garden view room, they had upgraded us to a ocean view room, which was a very nice room but for what my husband labeled the dinginess factor...cracks in the tile, rust in the tub - stuff that happens in a bathroom used everyday for like 15 years...we weren't thrilled. When we walked around the grounds and took the Funicular down to La Marina Village (a sea-level village at the bottom of the funiclar) we decided they looked newer. We went back up to the front desk and requested a room change - which they accommodated with no problem. There are many, MANY children at this resort and it is utter chaos up at the main hotel all the time so if you want something a little quieter, check out the Marina Village. Another plus is that its steps away from boat guests take to the private beach island the El Con uses...Be forwarned, however, if you like to have a cup of coffee on your balcony first thing in the morning - its not that easy to do from Marina Village. There is no place to get any breakfast stuff without going up the funicular - which sometimes has a line of guests from the main hotel going down to the boat for the beach... but that's your preferenceThe food: The food at this resort is grossly overpriced for the level of quality - plain and simple...(and that's coming from a new york city resident where EVERYTHING is overpriced). We had the breakfast buffet on our first morning there and yes, it was good, but we didn't go back b/c, personally, i don't eat $40 worth of breakfast any day, nevermind EVERYday. We would grab a muffin and a cup of coffee and head to the beach. One day we rented a car and busted out of the compound (as we affectionately called the hotel) and drove to Old San Juan and ate in a great place there - the Parrot Club. Another night we took a cab about five minutes away to another local place which was good also. Be warned, though b/c a cab for about 5 miles cost twenty dollars EACH WAY! (they don't want you to leave the compound ;) Overall, I'd say that since the weather and our relaxation was more important than the food (to us) it was all palatable...but if you're looking for gourmet - you won't find it here. The service was inconsistent. Like the gentleman at the front desk our first night who was helpful and friendly, the service was nice. However, we encountered a woman at concierge that really irked me. We went to make three reservations for dinner for the week. and on the paper where she wrote them down, she had the day of the week with the wrong numerical date - so when we asked her for which date the reservations were, she was blantatly annoyed we corrected her-excuse me? like, how dare us ask her to fix it. and, for the record, she had effed up all the reservations and made them on all the wrong days...i wasn't asking for her to apologize, it was a simple mistake, but to be overtly angry at me for asking her to change it? unprofessional and unappreicated...we were deciding b/w the Ritz in San Juan and the El Con before our trip and, based on past Ritz experience, you can bet your a$% that the concierge there wouldn't have treated us that way. On a separate occassion, however, a different woman at the conceirge desk was very nice - so, like i said, inconsistent. The wait-staff appeared overwhelmed most of the time, but friendly, so i felt bad for them more than annoyed that they were slow..plus, its vacation - we didn't wear watches so who knew how long we waited for stuff ;) The Good News: According to an employee at the El Con, next month will begin a $75 million overhaul of the property with about $35,000 designated for each room - the renderings of the new rooms, etc., were in the lobby and looked very nice...we will certainly go back at some point to see how it turned out...but not until then. If you've got a vacation planned - no worries, we had a great time...the views are great and its nice to be way outside the city - feels sort of off the beaten path... The weather was spectacular and, overall, it was a relaxing experience, which is the point of a vacation, right? :)

<Content>Needs to step up a bit Overall we had a good time. In the past, it was 1st class all the way. Wyndham sold their interest about 2 months ago. I agree with previous posts that many rooms need to be redone. My room was certainly nice, but some furnature had stains. My resturant reservation for Stingrays was lost one night and this caused a major problem. The manager stated that this happens often and I should have booked directly with the resturant. He had many empty tables but would not accomadate my party. I ate at Ballyhoos, which is an outdoor bar/resturant right in front of Stingrays. Stingrays tables were empty for 1 1/2 hrs. The concierge stated that since the program was updated for reservations some get lost. The resturant managers are supposed to get a print out every night and check it against their list. While I was talking to the Concierge, another guest told me that I didn't miss out. The portions were tiny at Stingrays. Everything else was fine.

<Content>OK if you don't expect too much Actually stayed at the adjoining Las Casitas villas. The good: The villa is terrific for kids, with two double beds and a pullout queen size couch there is plenty of room. The kitchen and ability to have the staff stock it in advance saves time and money and provides an element of relaxation that one can't get in a cramped hotel room. The views are fantastic and the property is generally clean. The nearby marina offered some off-site local eating opportunities and a nice jumping off point for a bioluminescent lagoon tour. The pools are adequate and the kids (6, 9, 11) seemed to enjoy them. They had almost as much fun chasing geckos and frogs. While there is no beach on the property, the resort's beach at Palomino Island was relatively quiet and fun. The best parts of the tour were provided by non-hotel tour guides. We took a private tour of El Yunque through the hotel with a guide named Juan who was pleasant and knowledgeable. After getting us to the forest and showing us where to go, he helped us find a terrific Mexican restaurant on the way back, helped us negotiate the purchase of a hammock from a road-side vendor, and was a pleasure. Similarly, Capt. Suarez captained a small motorboat into the bioluminescent bay and pointed out to us iguanas, hawks, and other sites that made the trip highly memorable. The snorkeling tour through the hotel's affiliate was also worth the trip.Now the BAD. The butler is a joke. Other than schlepping the bags to and from our room, he was generally unavailable and unhelpful, albeit pleasant. When we asked about a trip to the neighboring island of Vieques, he simply left an internet printout of the boar schedule in our room. Pure gimmick. Don't expect anything from the butler that you couldn't get from a decent concierge. We discovered on our last day three cockroaches in our room, which freaked the wife out. Not what you want in a five-star property. The lack of an on-site beach is a pain and nobody (even the butler) told us that even if we showed up for the boat on time, we may have to wait an hour or more because of crowds. (You can go early and get a wristband for an appointed time.) The food was mediocre and generally overpriced. We also encountered some surprising outages. The ice cream shop was generally always out of ice cream. Nice. The staff was not especially helpful and sometimes simply pointless. When we asked to have a paper delivered to our room, they twice promised that it was coming. It didn't. Ever. The island that serves as the property beach was unkempt, with trash littered through the bushes. Blame that on the facility and the pigs who just toss their trash around. Oh, and this may not sound great, but a LOT of New Yorkers stomping around irritable, sunburnt, and often on the phone.Will we go again? No. Are we glad we went? Overall, yes. The highlights, though, were the result of things near the property, not the property.

<Content>Thumbs down to this one.... Beautiful grounds! When we first checked in, they gave us a room....it was disgusting! Not cleaned from the previous visitor: towels everywhere, bed not made, garbage all over the room. The second room was another disaster! Mildew all over the shower walls, the tub was so dirty, I wore flip-flops to shower. And to top it off, the ceiling leaked 3 of the 6 nights we were there. The food and drink was outrageously expensive! The Golden Spa was not very organized! I ended up not getting a massage because the front desk messed up my appointment! Not a satisfied customer on this end. We spent so much money to stay at this resort.....I would NOT recommend this one to anyone! Thumbs Down!!!!

<Content>Can't wait to come back! I just returned from a magnificent trip to the El Conquistador that I took with my family, my cousins and their children. From the moment we arrived to the maginficent open air entrance we were treated like royalty. We took the shuttle bus that the hotel offered and we were glad we did as we considered renting a car just to do some exploring. But, with all the activities the hotel offered we were happy as clams to just stay at the resort. We were there for nearly a week and never felt that we needed to leave for anything, there was always more than enough to do. The kids loved taking the 15 minute boat ride to the hotels private island which was a blast in itself! Where can you go now a days to a place that has a private island with a beautiful beach which has snorkeling, wave runners, kayaking, hiking, horseback riding, etc.? My husband and I played golf one day and the course was absolutely gorgeous. We have played courses all over the country and this is beyond compare to any we have played. It was challenging with it's slopes and traps but layed out well enough where the gal's wouldn't feel intimidated. We also visited the famous Golden Door Spa on several occasions and each visit was better than the last. I would highly recommend the Spirit of Life if your limited in doing one treatment. I walked out of there feeling like a noodle! The studio a the Golden Door also offered daily fusion classes such as Tai Chi, Pilates, Yo Chi (Yoga and Tai Chi), cycling, water fusion and so much more. I'm not much into working out but I did manage to take a few classes and all were well worth the experience. I took away from each class something that I have incorporated into my life such as breathing techniques, stretching and to learning basic yogi, tai chi and pilates. There were enough pools to please everyone and never had to look for a chair as there were always plenty available plus they had the nicest plushest pool towels I have ever seen at a resort. Not like those skimpy towels you get at other resorts. My one pet peeve is to go to a resort where the people go out early and reserve chairs only to see them sit empty half the day! It doesn't happen here! There were too many restaurants to choose anywhere from Pizza, Sushi, Tepan Yaki, Steak, Seafood, the best burgers at Virgin Burger from which you can see the Virgin Islands to fine dining so all of us were very happy. The prices were similar to those of other resorts we have stayed and the quality and presentation was better than I could have ever expected. Though we're not tennis players the courts looked very inviting. We did have time to do the evening Bio Luminescent Jelly Fish Tour which is located just around the corner from the hotel. What a fun experience and I would highly recommend it to everyone. We were all novice kayakers and got the hang of it within a short time. The staff went out of their way to please not only us but other guests as well which was very refreshing to see. The staff all seemed very happy and very willing to answer any of our questions or requests, they even remembered our names on many occasions, how often does that happen anywhere else? The views from the hotel are maginifent with the water being as blue as you can imagine. All in all our experience was top notch from the friendly staff to the gorgeous rooms to the wonderful food and the fabulous activities. We can't wait to return!

<Content>A Letter to my travel agent: Tell Customers To Skip PR and ElCon HI Paulette, after enjoying old San Juan for a day, I went to the El Conquistador and I was really disappointed. The pictures on the Web made it look like it was a five star hotel one of the best in the world, but at best its a three star. The rooms decor was a bit tired, the food (even bar snacks) was absurdly expensive and mediocre, the beach was a ten minute water taxi away, and the golf course booked up with convention delegates. Once you left the resort, you might as well have been driving around a place like Lynn Mass or Lowell; Strip malls and Burgher Kings, Dollar Stores lots of traffic, not much to do except a walk in the Rain Forest. So knowing that my temper and frustration level would rise quickly, no matter how much I tried to make the best of things at El Con, I left PR after one day for Saint Thomas and St John where I spent an enjoyable three days at the Westin hotel, a great place, thats extremely well designed, and run. I bar hopped. visited the incredibly picturesque island on motor scooter, rented a Zodiak inflatable boat and went snorkelling. By the way, I had a frequent flyer to PR on US Air then from PR to Saint Thomas by Cape Air is only $200 much cheaper than American Eagle. Robert Hargrovemeistro02445@yahoo.com

<Content>great spring break with family just got back from a week at the el con with my family including four children ages 15 through 4. After reading all the reviews I was a bit apprehensive about staying at the resort. The resort was spectacular. The service was great, the staff friendly, our room was clean and the surroundings beautiful. The pools were awesome and we never had a problem finding a chair. We rented a car at the airport and endured the traffic in Puerto Rico. It took us almost two hours on a Friday night to get to the resort. Once there we were all pleasantly surprised. The funiclar and ferry to the private island were working perfectly. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes for the ferry. The island is beautiful. The food, although a tad expensive, was quite tasty. My kids loved the chicken nuggets and my husband ate the fish and chips every day we were there. The towels were plush and never had a problem finding chairs in the sun or shade. My kids enjoyed playing basketball. We rented a tube for the day as well. Breakfast was expensive so we stopped at walmart and bought cereal, milk, water and snacks. We ate breakfast on our balcony every morning and saved quite a bit of money. The restaurants in the hotel are expensive but good. Blossoms is excellent. We went there for a birthday dinner and they brought out some cake for our son at no charge! Since we rented a car we ventured to Old San Juan and the Rain Forest. Old San Juan was awesome with great shops and restaurants. The rain forest is a must. So much to see and quite beautiful. We also took the ferry to the island of Vieques. The ferry to Vieques from Fajardo takes about 1-1/2 hours. Not quite what we expected. The island has a lot of deserted beaches. We went to one public beach and actually saw three horses running on the shore. We ended up leaving on an earlier ferry because the kids wanted to get back to the El Conquistador and swim in the pool. I would definitely recommend staying at the El Conquistador. Don't believe all the negative reviews you read. The weather in Puerto Rico is gorgeous as is the scenery. The only negative was the driving in Puerto Rico. At times it was scary. The drivers seem to have their own rules of the road. If you go to Puerto Rico, stay at the El Conquistador.

<Content>El Conquistador, Puerto Rico-- Needs Face Lift! The El Conquistador Hotel in Puerto Rico sounds fantastic on paper (guide books; travel magazines; etc.), but unfortunately does not live up to all of the hype.After landing and heading to the shuttle bus, we anticipated a short ride from the airport to the resort(30 miles per the website). No where did it mention that 30 miles in San Juan translates into a 2 1/2 hour drive during heavy traffic drive times. After a 4 plus hour flight (from Dallas) being stuck in a shuttle for another 2 1/2 hours was draining to say the least. The driver did his best to make us feel comfortable on the ride (rum was included), but it did not make up for the unanticipated delay in reaching our destination.When we arrived at the resort, we were made to stand in a long check-in line with only one hotel employee working the front desk. Surely they could have radioed ahead during the 2 1/2 hour drive to let them know that we were on our way. There were only three couples on the shuttle bus....how nice would it have been to arrive to an efficient check-in process that would allow us to get to our rooms and decompress after the long travel day?! No such luck!We were shown to our rooms and were immediately disappointed at the overall lack of cleanliness as well as the shabbiness of the furniture in the room. Sections of the curtains had fallen off of the rods and the ceiling was covered in mold (from the humidity). Upon entering the bathroom, the smell of urine hit us in the face. Fortunately, we had brought spray disinfectant with us so we were able to eliminate the smell, but the general icky - this place needs a good cleaning - feeling prevailed. The floors did not look like they had been vacuumed recently and the walls desperately needed new paint. It is important to note that we stayed in the rooms that were considered some of the nicest on the property. They were water front and were approxiately $400 per night. For this rate, we were expecting very nice accommodations. Not so in this case.On a positive note, the resort has a very comprehensive list of amenities - golf, spa, numerous restaurants, casino, disco, etc. The convenience of not having to leave the resort to eat and play was a big plus. Shopping at the resort was varied and fairly resonably priced as resort shopping goes. The food was above average with only one meal being a disappointment - a steak dinner at the Sting Ray restaurant. The steak was overcooked and overpriced. And, the wait staff was hurried and not very attentive. But, I'm happy to say that the rest of the resort restaurants provided fairly tasty food at a decent price.Another bright spot was the island shuttle service, restaurant and facilities. Guests are shuttled from the resort to a private island for beach time (no beach is available at the resort itself) and the commute is a pleasant, 20 minute boat ride. The island itself is lovely and clean - with beautiful beaches and water views. There are plenty of lounge chairs for guests and the drink/food service on the beach and in the restaurant is friendly and prompt. A real treat are the island bathrooms. They are spotless! In fact, much cleaner than the bathrooms at the main resort. Kudos to the maids who keep those sparkling!!!Overall, my travel companion and I were disappointed in our stay at the El Conquistador. For the price, we expected more luxurious accomodations and employees who were more focused on customer service. I think a face lift (room renovations) and training for the resort staff in better customer service (the island staff should be exempt - they do a great job!) would go a long way in improving the experience for vacationers at the resort.

<Content>Great Resort We are a family of four. 2 adults and 2 children ages 7 10. We traveled with another family with children ages 4  6.We had a great trip and a very positive experience at this resort. The people who helped us both check in and out were very helpful. The resort is beautiful with awesome views. It was very clean and tons of shops, restaurants and a game room. We visited the beach several times. It was a great beach with a soft bottom in the water. We rented rafts/tubes every day ($10.00 for the day) for the kids. We also played volleyball and hiked up a trail to the top of the mountain. We rented wave runners one day as well and had a blast. There is plenty to do on the island. We never had a problem finding a spot to hang out and always got a thatched umbrella Just a note.... you must charge food/drinks,wave runners,etc. to your room. The island does not accept cash. This was not a problem for us. It did take some time to get to the beach. You had to get to the marina level then take a boat to the private island. We do like being closer to the beach but the beach was awesome once you got there.We also visited the pools and hot tubs several times on our trip. The towels they lend you at the beach and pool are very nice. By the pool they have a place where you can borrow board games and cards if you are looking for something to do. There are several hot tubs and a nice water slide for the kids. There was also a volleyball net to play in the pool which was a lot of fun. The towel service stops at 5:00pm So if you plan to swim in the evening get a few extra to be able to have dry towels for later on. It does get a little chilly in the evening. There was always a breeze.The food was expensive and just ok. We knew this before going to the resort.We ate at the more casual places/bars etc... This was fine for us with all of the kids.The rooms were fine too. Yes they could use a little updating but they were clean and had everything we needed.All of the employees we met were very friendly and helpful. The resort was great. We would go back.

<Content>Overrated and overpriced Just got back from six days in Puerto Rico. The El Conquistador did not meet our expectations in terms of their rooms and amenities. So if you are expecting luxurious rooms-read on...we were booked for five nights but ended up staying only three...switched to the Westin in Rio Grande which I highly recommend-they've just been through an extensive renovation. (This is something the ElCon will be doing but it will take a few years-it used to be a Wyndham resort-and was just bought by Blackstone Real Estate Group).The ElCon did not tell us that mid-way through our stay that they had booked a HUGE broadcasting convention-and that WBLS radio station (in NY) would be broadcasting shows and blaring music until 12:30-1AM right outside our window for a few nights! The whole point of the trip is that we had wanted to escape New York City and all its sounds. When we first got to the resort-we ended up switching rooms 3 times (something I've never done) but worth the effort. First two rooms had broken lamps and shower rods and the bathrooms had dirty floors and showers with mildew stains on tiles and curtains. The third room was in La Vista area/wing of resort (near spa)-had a great view of Palomino island but no amenities of any kind. No bathrobes or turn down service and the beds honestly felt like cots. At $359 a night for an ocean view room-I would DEFINITELY like amenities! (Also-very important, that does not include the extra $89.75 in resort tax and tariff fees they bill you at the end! Comes out to a whopping $448.75 a night. For that you get a great view w/terrace-but not a great room. Food left little to be desired-very over priced and not that good overall. OK, there are the negatives-here are the positives:Palomino island-private island with breathtaking views and good beach (free ferry shuttle from resort). Golf-excellent Arthur Hills golf course (again VERY expensive for a round and rented clubs-and I think you should get AT LEAST free bottled water-which you don't) but one of the most beautiful courses I've ever played. Stingray restaurant (down in Marina area)-expensive but worth it: great food, great atmosphere and view. Golden Door Spa-my friend said the deep tissue massage was intense and that they had a relaxing waterfall hot tub in the indoor spa area. Rainforest day tour (not hiking one)-get Edwin as your tour guide and have a fun, lively trip (roughly $99 for two people). Oh, one note-the ElCon Bioluminescence Kayaking Tour at night ($133 for two people)-is the one at Laguna Grande NOT Vieques. Most of your time is spent paddling through the mangrove trees to get to the bay in complete darkness-and its rather difficult paddling against the current going back. Not for first time kayakers at all. We own kayaks and found this trip challenging (mostly because it was very difficult to see anything in the pitch black). Also, the time spent at the bioluminescence bay itself is roughly ten minutes. Very cool once you're there to see the water light up around you. The trip to Vieques is the one most often highlighted in tour books but I don't believe the ElCon offers that particular trip-or at least they didn't when we were there. Ok-back to the positives: DEFINITELY go to the infinity pool by the casitas village at the resort. Go out to eat in Fajardo--either to Lolita's (good mexican restaurant in Fajardo/Luquillos area) or Passyons (great local spot with authentic PR cuisine nearby). Also, check out the ElCon web site-as they do have promotions available with certain bookings that will save some money in the long run...But if you want to save $120 a night-I personally think the Westin is the way to go. It has ocean view rooms w/terraces-a private mile stretch of beach (right off resort-no ferry service) good room amenities (Westin Heavenly beds and robes)-2 golf courses (Rio Mar CC) and like ElCon they had many different restaurants and a casino at the hotel. Also-there were no extra room tax and tariff rates and the rate INCLUDED breakfast (comparable if not better than the $50 buffet breakfast for two you got at ElCon). Again, skip some of the restaurants at the Westin (Palio was over priced and had just OK food) and go to ones outside the resort. We went to Antojito's (right outside resort and down hill to the left)-good local spot-w/good food-mofangos-reasonable and very friendly staff. One downside of the resort is that their shuttle service to the golf area or tennis area was not reliable-no one seemed too concerned to get us to our tee time in time. But at the Westin you have breathtaking views of the rainforest and good views of the Atlantic ocean and you are that much closer to Old San Juan if you want to take a day (or night) trip there. Love the NE/Eastern side of Puerto Rico-but wish I had read a review like this before we booked our trip!

<Content>one of my favorite resorts We just got home from this resort (our 5th visit) and we did notice some problems so we talked to many of the staff people and they informed us of the many new changes that are coming now that Wyndham no longer owns them. Apparently, the new ownership plans to remodel every room, build a new funicular that will cut across the high hill, build a new water park for children, have an adult only pool, etc. In two years these changes will make it the wonderful and elegant destination it's always been. They don't intend to raise rooms rates as they recognize that they're high already. They want people to get what they pay for in service and room appointments. We intend to go back in two years to see all these new changes, in the meantime hang in there, they're working on it.

<Content>Loved this hotel My husband and I loved this hotel! There was sooo much to do. It was like a mini city! 5 restaurants, HUGE beautiful pool area, lots of shops, casino, private island with an awesome beach, excellent views! The rooms were just ok but we spent so little time in our room that it did not matter. Having just come from the Horned Dorset in Rincon we were looking for a little excitment! The Horned Dorset was beautiful but sooo boring and quiet (and very expensive at $600 a night). We did not want to leave the Conquistador! The food at the restaurants is just ok but it is really nice to have such a huge selection of food right in the hotel. The pool area was awesome! we stayed at 5 different hotels during our trip to Puerto Rico and this one was by far our favorite (and the other hotels were more expensive also). We would love to go back soon!

<Content>Great for teens! Loved the Conquistador - it was perfect for travelling with 2 college students on spring break. There were many families there with teenagers as well. Upon arrival, I noticed the recommended evening dress code. I was worried that the place would be too upscale for our crew, who usually preferred casual beach vacations. But they both took it in stride, and by the end of the trip actually enjoy getting out of their beach clothes and dressed for the evenings. This is also a great place to introduce the kids to casinos - go early when it's not too crowded.Food was pricey and mediocre at the beach and pool bars. We expected a $10 cheeseburger to at least be tasty, but it was just adequate. Sub sandwiches consisted of 1 piece of lunch meat on a thick piece of bread, not enough to keep a hungry crew satisfied. Individual pizzas were the best bet. However, dinner at the fancy restaurants was awesome! I would recommend stopping at a grocery store on the way to the hotel and picking up snacks for the room and the beach - cheese and crackers and chips and such. There is also a room refrigerator. We took the kayak tour (expensive but really a once-in-a-lifetime experience!) Also the snorkeling tour on the catamaran. A really fun experience, although the reefs were not as colorful as other islands in the caribbean. Make sure when you reserve a tour that you write down the time and location where the tour departs. We didn't, and almost missed the bus because we were waiting at the wrong place.The funicular and the boat to the island were a blast. Really added to the ambiance and adventure. The hotel was generous with beach towels - really thick plushy ones. There was so much to do here, and prices for activities were similar to other resorts in the states. Service was excellent, and everything was really clean - never saw a spider once. We had rented a car and planned to tour the island, but we hadn't planned on traffic in PR to be so horrendous. After a stop-and-go trip from the airport to the hotel in our rental car, and discovering that there was just so much to do at the elCon, we decided to stay put until our last day, when we stopped by the rain forest on our way back to the airport. Got thoroughly soaked, so take good rain gear! All in all, a very successful trip, and we would definitely go back!!

<Content>Beautiful Setting, Fair Service We just got back from our first visit to Puerto Rico. The beaches and water are absolutely beautiful. The El conquistador has such potential, but for almost $400/night we expected much better service than we received. Like so many other people have mentioned, there was a convention there with 1800 people, and it sure appeared that they were getting the royal treatment. However, for the average person on vacation, some of the staff seemed to be bothered by the fact that we might need to check out, or order lunch, or whatever we happened to be doing. We requested a room in Las Vistas, based on recommendations by other travelers, however we got a room in Las Brisas. The view was stunning, but it sounded like there was a subway running up and down the hill during all hours of the night, due to the funicular (trolley) that transports people up and down the hill. It totally ruined the serenity of such a beautiful setting. I'm not sure if you could hear it from other locations throughout the resort, but it was a real drag for us. If you do plan to spend some time there, consider the fact that you will need to budget more than you'd expect for food and beverages. For 2 pizzas (enough for 3 people), 2 beers and a Sprite we paid over $50; a burger and fries: $16. The food was good, but expensive. We ate outside of the resort most of the time. Don't get me wrong, we had a great time in Puerto Rico. The surroundings of the hotel were beautiful, it just wasn't worth the money we paid to stay there. We will go back to Puerto Rico, but not El Conquistador.

<Content>Very disappointed Just to let you know before I begin my brief review, I had been to this resort twice in the past (and I would have given it an excellent rating those two times). Upon returning this time, I was extremely disappointed. The grounds seem to be falling into severe disrepair, with little being done about it (you may not notice this as much if you've never been there). The service was horrible for the amount of money we were spending there...waiting for food in restaurants was anywhere from 1 - 1 1/2 hours. The rooms were less than stellar (mine actually had mold coming out of the vents). Arrived at the airport on the El Conquistador shuttle to go home and they didn't put our luggage on the bus. We barely made our flight after much yelling at resort manager on duty.The only nice aspect was the weather! Low 80s and sunny every day. The resort is no longer owned by wyndham and going through a trasition phase, and this is extremely obvious to those staying there.

<Content>wonderul and relaxing! My boyfriend and I just returned from a 4 day stay and we enjoyed every moment.I was weary on all the mixed reviews, but only when you stay there can you find out how the resort really is. As usual, it was expensive, but totally expected. Our room was in the Las Olas part of the resort. That part of the hotel is right in the middle of the lobby (top top portion) and the marina at the bottom. Our room was clean. The furniture was a bit dated, but who cares, it's the experience we were looking for.Palomino Island was great. The ferry left every 30 mins so it was perfect. Plus if you missed one, you can have a drink at the bar in the marina while you wait. We had a couples massage at the Golden Door - AMAZING! As for the food, we ate at Blossoms (sushi was great) and Stingray (which was amazing!) for our main dinners. The pools were wonderful and not overcrowded. The staff was great and answered all the questions we had. We also did the biolumniscent kayak and that was great as well.All in all - the best and most expensive vacation by far. We were totally relaxed and didn't know what to do with ourselves, since we were SO happy. In about 5 years, this place is going to be even better and we both agreed, even more expensive and harder to get a room. If you go, enjoy! Don't let the bad reviews get you confused or worried.

<Content>Overall a Great Trip We just got back from El Con. Overall it was a great place. Positives: 1. We had good service overall. 2. The views are spectacular. 3. It is a huge resort, but they have a lot of pools and Palimino Island so it never really feels crowded. 4. My wife went to the spa and said that it was wonderful. 5. Grounds are in good shape. 6. Staff was friendly.Ok. Here are the negatives: 1. Room was somewhat dated, but very comfortable. 2. Elevators are slow and sometimes they don't work. 3. A lot of hidden fees. They charged a $37.00 resort fee and the sales tax on the rooms is 25%. Expect to pay about a $100 per day in fees on top of your quoted room rate. I was very upset about this. They said that the resort fee is to run the boat and to run the funiculars. My comment was they should have given me a credit on my room since I had to use the stairs on more than one occasion to get to my room. They wouldn't do anything about it. 4. Don't go off of the resort unless you have your own car. It was $40 round trip to go about 5 minutes away. The concierge said that the cab fare wouldn't be too bad when we asked him what it would be. He knew that it was $40 because we asked another concierge about it the next day and they said that this was always the far. Cab driver said that they have to give a kickback to the resort. I felt like I was taken advantage of and it ruined a good night for us. 5. Food in the resort is average at best and where we ate for dinner off of the resort wasn't much better. It was called Passion. On the way in from San Juan the cab driver stopped at place on the side of the road and we had great conch and shrimp salad. By far the best food we had on the trip and it was $12 for both. After saying all of this, I would go back. I now know what to expect. The views were great and the weather was perfect. Overall a good experience.

<Content>Would get married here, it's so nice... Three of us went here for our last spring break trip EVER, and had an amazing time. We'd read the reviews and were a little worried (as we'd already booked the trip), and ended up being completely amazed with our experience. The flights down and back were great, and we rented a car. Renting a car, btw, is the way to go; Fajardo is quite a ways from the San Juan airport. The rainforest is nearby, as are a number of grocery stores and fast food restaurants. The reason I mention the latter is because food and drinks at the hotel are a lil on the pricey side, but very good. But honestly, it's no more expensive than if you went on a cruise or anything like that; you get what you pay for (for the most part). We had a wonderful room in the main part of the hotel (upper level), with a great view and a large iguana that lived in the palm tree outside of our balcony. Service was great and hotel employees were very friendly and helpful. I would totally get married here- it's that great. Would go back in a heartbeat! The photos on their website are representative of the resort, so you're in for a feast for the eyes.

<Content>Wonderful the stay After reading the reviews I was a little worried about my upcoming visit. However, it was wonderful. The prices were a little high but that is to be expected for staying on the resort site. We were looking to relax and not involve a lot of activities. This resort was perfect for just that. We didn't leave the property, it had everything we needed right on site. Relaxing on Palomino Island and the pool areas then after dining we generally migrated toward the casino. Everyone treated us like royalty especially Wilma in the casino she was wonderful. Our rooms were in the main hotel area they were clean and the view was great. I would definately visit this resort again.

<Content>Can't Wait to Go Back Just returned from a 4 day stay at the El Conquistador Resort, where I stayed in the Las Casitas Village and I am already trying to plan a second trip back next year. Whether you are relaxing by one of the many pools, at the beach, on the golf course, in the spa, or if you are feeling lucky in the Casino, you felt like you were in Paradise. It is a great place for a family vacation, romantic getaway, or a group of friends. What really made my stay that much better was the friendly staff who continuously went out of their way to make sure my family and I were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. My stay at El Conquistador/Las Casitas Village was trully a memorable one and I cant wait to return next year. Words or pictures dont do it justice, you really need to experience this resort yourself.

<Content>Wonderful relaxing get-away My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the El Con where we had a wonderful, relaxing Caribbean get-away. Based on the wide range of prior reviews, I was a bit anxious about the place but can now heartily recommend this resort to those seeking magnificent scenery and a relaxed atmosphere. Overall, we found the accommodations to be comfortable, clean, and spacious. We were initially booked into an ocean view room in La Vistas overlooking the pool area which was adequate. However, the hotel staff were very accommodating in moving us upon request to Las Brisas wing to a more spacious room with a balcony providing a better view and secluded feel. Las Brisas is very convenient to the main hotel area with pools, casino, restaurants, as well as to the funicular to access the marina. Yes, the furniture is a bit dated and there were just a few stains on the carpet, but easily overlooked in comparison to the positives. In terms of service, the staff were helpful, polite, and efficient...but you do have to account for island time and not put yourself on a tight schedule. We had better luck with face-to-face requests versus trying to get staff on the phone.We opted to rent a jeep at the airport and were very glad we did as it gave us flexibility to sightsee, tour El Yunque Rain Forest on our time table (this sight is a must for nature lovers), and cut down on eating expenses by purchasing drinks, wine, and snacks at a nearby grocery store. One warning, driving in Puerto Rico is not for the faint-hearted. The jeep came in very handy given the road conditions. If you can get off property, I would highly recommend the food and service of El Pasions Restaurant located just down the road. Be prepared to pay resort prices for all food on site. We did enjoy a superb seafood meal at Stingrays (at the Marina)...the atmosphere, food quality, and service were well worth the price.The beach at Palomino Island was very enjoyable and well cared for. If you decide to snorkle, I would suggest going on the morning excursion as the afternoon anchored at only one site. Again, if you slow down and enjoy, you will not consider the boat ride over to the island or the funicular to be an inconvenience. Although we took the advice of others and closely checked our bill upon checking out, we found no inaccuracies. This resort is not for the penny concious but I would highly recommend it to others and would go again in a heart beat.

<Content>Go for the Casitas! The El conquistador Casitas were awesome. The one I stayed in was huge with a full kitchen and ocean view from the balcony. It was clean, airy and felt like a vacation home not a hotel room. The Casitas are a bit more pricey than the hotel rooms at the resort but definately worth every penny. Don't forget to hit the CasinoYou'll love it!

<Content>Reviews made me leary, but all was well. I've seen some negative reviews, but our experience was terrific. The room was quiet, comfortable, and clean. The meals were great and sure expensive but not out-of-bounds for a nice resort. The private island is a little cumbersome (tram-ride, then boat-ride), but a great experience. The beach there had great sand, plenty of nice chairs, excellent service, and plenty of activities. It was also peaceful with none of that island musak you find at so many resorts. The resort's pool space is big enough so you won't feel crowded. At check-out I heard a few people talking about billing inaccuracies, but our bill was correct. The resort is getting due for some renovation and some surfaces are on their 10th coat of paint. Maybe 5-6 years from now the renovation need will become more of an issue, but not yet.

<Content>enjoyed the el con we recently stayed at the el con.I too was very scared about the reviews we had seen and we did not know what to expect. We have stayed at many different places including sandals, beachs resorts, ritz carltons , westins, 4 seasons , jack tar village , gran lido jamacia , disney cruise , royal carribean cruise etc ,etc . the elcon was a very nice and relaxing place to stay. the staff was nice,and attentive.I speak spanish and did not have to use it once ,in fact our bellman was from the us as was a bartender we used. my wife and 3 kids 11,10,8 were on the trip. we stayed in an oceanfront room with 2 double beds and 1 cot.the room obviously is a little dated but very clean.the bathroom was very spacious and clean. cleaning of the room and making the beds etc was always done in a timely manner when we were out during the day. we stayed in the brisas wing which was very convienent to all the restaurants ,main pools and the casino. I played golf 3 times with my son. they give juniors a discount to play for 50.00 .the golf course is beautiful and very challenging . watch out for the iguanas! the pools are clean.there is a small water slide for kids at the main pool. palamino island is nice ,15 minute ride over on a boat that leaves on the hour.the bar there has chickens and roosters running around which i thought added to the atomsphere. my wife and kids went waterskiing ,which was safe and easy to arrange. dinners were good but expensive , we ate at blossoms chinese , otellos, stingrays, and the pizza bar near the large pool. if there is a next time i would maybe rent a car a venture out locally,that would , could decrease at least the food bill. my wife and daughter did do a spa traetment and the wife did say the spa was nice and getting a spa treatment allowed her to workout in the spa gym,25.00 without a treatment .she also worked out in the free gym and said that was also acceptable. downsides to this place are distance from airport,,1 1/2 hours, cost of food for dinners, rooms alittle dated,charges for the airport shuttle. if you want a nice family trip with golf onsite, nice pools,clean,safe etc you will like the el con . it is pricey but to put it in perspective one week here is about the equivalent of one week at beachs turks and cacaios or one week on the disney cruise ,both of which we have done please enjoy

<Content>We would come back My husband and I just returned from a three night mini-vacation at El Conquistador. After reading reviews on this site only the night before we were somewhat apprehensive and determined to ask for a room upgrade. (We had used American Express points to book the room.) Upon arrival, we asked for an upgrade but could not get one as a huge conference of 900 insurance agents was at the hotel. With apprehension, we arrived at our room with garden and El Yungue views in the main hotel. The room was large, with a pretty patio overlooking a beautiful view of the tennis courts, golf course, El Yunque and the Atlantic Ocean in the distance. At night, the sound of the rain forest frogs filled the room. The room was a little musty upon arrival but we never noticed it again after turning on the air conditioner. The bath room was large and had a huge closet. The food was pricey but decent, and the service was good--with the exception of one breakfast at a coffee shop like place where the service was terrible and the food arrived cold. I dont understand the griping about the funicular and the boat trip to the private island. People dont know how to relax. We found the boat trip out to the island to be fun--it added a little extra adventure to the stay. The island was very pretty and we had a great time on the rented jet skis. Great tip--skip dinner one night and book a tour by kayak or boat to the bioluminescent bay in Las Croabas. This was one of the most amazing experiences we have ever had. We went by small motor boat into a mangrove laden channel which opened into a large protected bay. The water glows with thousands of tiny plankton. We swam in the water which is like having your body and surrounding water illuminated by thousands of tiny fireflies. On the way back, we were accompanied by thousands of tiny glowing fish who jumped out of the water all around us.

<Content>Great Family Resort for budget unminded Sure it's expensive, but the Resort is beautiful, weather superb and staff attentive. Stay in the Marina section Bldg 1 and you are guaranteed to enjoy yourself. Rent a car from Avis $200 for 5 days and drive to resort and grocery shop for extra's. Make reservations for restaurants as soon as you arrive for entire stay for dining options.Go to Palomino Island for beautiful swimming. Rooms at the Marina were clean, had great views and afforded a relaxing atmosphere without the crowds. Get the family get a way, 1 night free,access to golden door spa,etc. Ask for hospitality suite if you need to stay the afternoon after your checkout to take a shower and change before your trip home.The negative reviews were misleading and untrue as far as I was concerned, but reading the reviews gave me great bits of info of what to do and what to avoid. Have fun you're on vacation!

<Content>Best service at the El Conquistador!! Wonderful hotel! Just returned from a few days at the El Conquistador. I was a little nervous that the resort would be too crowded, and since I love the beach I was a little hesitant knowing that there is no beach on the property, but on the hotel鈥檚 private island. However, my fears were soon allayed. As soon as we got there the hotel staff made us feel very welcome.We were upgraded upon request (which I was surprised by given that it was a holiday weekend.) I have stayed at a few luxury resorts and 5-star hotels, but overall none were as nice as the El Conquistador, and the service at the El Conquistador is absolutely unparalleled. Every member of the staff that we met鈥攔oom service, housekeeping, concierge, marina activities, those running the shops, etc.鈥攚as friendly and attentive.We used the hotel kitchen to store some of our own food. As soon as we arrived we were met by someone from room service who took the food to the hotel kitchen. It was warmed up and delivered to us on time and was always nicely presented. There was one night when they forgot to warm up and deliver our food. Room service was so apologetic, and when they did deliver our dinner, they did so at no charge.In terms of the resort itself, the place is magnificent. There are six pools, so if one pool is a little crowded there is bound to be one with fewer people. And since some of the pools cater specifically to children (with a water slide, volleyball net, etc.) those are the pools with most of the kids. The other pools are generally quieter. Going to the beach was a little bit of an ordeal. You have to take the funicular down to the marina and from there the ferry takes you to the island. The ferry comes every 陆 hour (although when we went it was a bit late). The island is really nice: there鈥檚 a restaurant, clean rest rooms, and there are a range of water activities. There is some seaweed in the ocean, but the water is nice and clear.One thing to note: Make sure to look over your hotel bill upon checking out. We noticed a charge that was not ours; we also noticed that the hotel neglected to charge us for a few things. They rectified the situation immediately and were very good about it.We had wonderful experiences with the concierge. We wanted to rent a car one day, and as we were a little last minute there were no cars left at the hotel鈥檚 rental company. The concierge called a few other car rental places in the area until they were able to find car for us. The marina activities desk was equally good in terms of helping us arrange tours and activities.I would definitely recommend this place. The rooms are very nice, the service is absolutely amazing, and the resort is beautiful!

<Content>Great time at El Con We just returned from a trip around PR with 2 nights at the El Con. We loved the hotel even though we are not really resort people. When we checked in, my husband decided we should have a better view than the garden view I had booked. The man at the front desk offered several options and recommended La Marina if we wanted a good view, the sound of the ocean and privacy. He was so right. This part of the resort is newer. The room was large and clean and the whole experience superb. The resort was fairly empty when we were there and we felt we had our own little corner of paradise. The staff was very nice and friendly and the service was excellent. There are those add-ons, tariffs etc. others mentioned, which I agree should just be included in the price. All in all, I would love to return to La Marina at El Conquistador.

<Content>Better than what I expected My wife and I stayed here for a week in early February. I will admit if you are part of a conference and you have problems with your room you will get preferential help. The rooms in the Grand Hotel are small, not big enough for a couple staying for a week. Not much closet space. What the rooms like in style the ammenties make up for. The resort is absolutely beautiful! Yes, be prepared to pay high prices for food, drinks, other things. There is alot of overhead for a resort this size. But if you want to pay less for dinners there are a few very good resteraunts that are about a 10-15 minute walk from the end of the marina.I found the staff in general to be polite and very courteous considering the arrogance and rudeness of some guests. One guest chewed out a porter because he brought luggage on the funicular to a guest's room. How else are you going to get luggage to a room by the marina?I was also apprehensive about staying here after reading many of the reviews but the experince exceeded my expectations.

<Content>Hidden daily taxes The resort was beautiful and the room layed out well, with a walk in closet. After check in the bell hop said we were given a Stevie Wonder room (blind view) and he went to the front dest and demanded another room with a better view for us. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. As I read in these reviews before we went the food was overly priced and not so good. We had a car and went off site a lot. We walked a bit pasted the marina to other seafood resturants recommeded by the locals. The worst thing was the hidden fees. We were charged an extra 37.29 a day resort tax and an additional 47.46 a day resort tariff. This is an extra 84.75 a day. Why not tell me my room fee with this added in so there are no hidden fees. We also payed an extra 15.00 a day for internet and 20.00 a day for parking. This all adds up. We thought that the internet cafe had free internet but no, it was 4.95 an hour. By the time we checked out the beauty of the resort was lost in the feeling of being nickeled and dimes to death.

<Content>So bad it was actually funny Where to start? Deluxe Ocean view rooms were directly above staff parking lot, with staff entrance immediately below our private balcony. Air conditioner did not work at all in one room, and flooded the foor and rug in the other so that mildew odor became unbearable. Calls to front desk and hotel manager meant 15 minutes on hold -- and generally surly, unpleasant explanations that we must be operating the airconditioning improperly. THe food was truly ghastly -- everything deep fried, dried out and oversalted to the point of being inedible (except for the buffet breakfast -- fantastically expensive, but in offensive and the pizzas at one cafe, which we lived on during our interminable stay. THe place was dirty, dingy and musty. Vactioner beware.

<Content>Everybody just relax I am posting for those people who have already paid for their well earned vacation and are terrified by the nightmare postings on this website. I just spent a week there and me and my girlfriend were really happy with the experience. The views are unbelievable. Their private beach was stunning (yes- you must take a 15 minute ferry to what is basically their own island). Our room was great (we stayed at the marina, with gorgeous views of the ocean and proximity to the pool. I would suggest avoiding las olas as it was like a ghost town). The restaurants are pretty decent, and of course they're overpriced. It wasn't pleasant to pay $26 for a plate of pasta that costs $15 in new york city, or $19 for a wrap that should cost $12. But that's resort pricing. They're not trying to scam you, it costs hotel a small fortune for all the service and transportation of food. Yes, about a third of the equipment in the gym (incidentally it had the best view from a gym I have ever seen) was out of order. Yes the funny faniculars usually took turns breaking down. Yes the transportation to and from the airport was 60 round trip a person and it takes 1.5 hours. This hotel recently changed ownership and I don't think I will either be able to afford it nor recognize it 2 years from now. If you are staying there in the near future, understand that it is in transition to become much more luxury. Most of the staff was pretty great, although you did run into the occasional incompetence. In the meantime, if you need to go somewhere to recharge, please don't feel like you just paid for a lemon of a vacation by some people's horrible experiences. If you don't like kids, don't stay there. tons of em. If you can't bare to pay $140 for the *fancy* dinner for 2 while on vacation - go somewhere else. You will have no choice but to eat at the hotel. If they put you in a room with no a/c, wet floors, a dead corpse in the closet or whatever else people are saying on this site.... maybe consider leaving the hotel and suing them or declining the payment to your credit card. Enjoy your time there and remember to bring TONS of sunblock (at $12 a bottle you will not want to buy it there). Also- make sure to make reservations at the good restaurants- you will be shut out!

<Content>Vactioner Beware! We went for a long weekend to get away from the Winter months at home. We were hopeful seeing the website pictures, etc. but leery due to some of the reviews we read. We decided on the resort also because most of the nicer resorts in San Juan were booked.When we arrived early Friday afternoon in Puerto Rico we were excited to see a bus awaiting to sweep us away to our Carribbean resort. We waited for approximately 45 minutes before our bus ride left the airport. The complimentary drinks on the bus were picked over and not even worth the bother. The bus ride took nearly two hours because we later found out we were in rush hour traffic. It seemed as if we would never get there and the bus ride twists and turns and is slightly nauseating. Upon arrival and check-in we were a little exhausted by the trip on the bus and then navigating around the resort and finally reaching our room. The staff seemed very pleasant at the check-in desk and the bellhop was very helpful and delightful. We settled into our room which was average in appearance and fair to average as far as cleanliness. We dined at the Stingray Cafe and the fish entrees we had were delicious and the service was beyond amazing!We were warm and muggy much of the time during the night, the air would not adjust to cooler. My husband did a minor bathroom sink repair. On Saturday morning we awoke to discover the sheets twisted because there was a regular flat sheet instead of a fitted sheet on the bed. Saturday we rode the ferry over to the Palomino Island. We hiked the entire island and we were a little disppointed in the majority of the island. Over much of the terrain near the populated beach it looked as though they were in the process of landscaping because there were tractor/bulldozer tracks. We ate lunch at the outdoor Iguana's Cafe and were a little preturbed at the constant pestering the roaming chickens gave us. The food was average for cafe food. The water at the main beach area and the surrounding ocean scenery was quite peaceful and beautiful. The ferry ride to and from makes for a fun trip but slightly annoying when you think about it - why not just have a beach right at the resort area? Also, the Palomino Island is apparently not a private beach but rather has quite a crowd of locals with loud music and large boats anchored right at the ferry drop off area. We did not elect to do the horse back riding - I'm not sure where all you could have ridden the horses, after scoping out the island it seems as though you would have had a medicore dirt trail ride with a short time on the beachfront. We had some appetizer foods mid-afternoon at the Bally-Hoo Bar and Grill, food was good and the nice flat screen t.v.'s were nice for viewing the basketball games. We ate at Blossoms that night and the food was good, pricey though.We elected for room service for breakfast and the food was average but the price was a bit much. The food was fresh but you could tell the long journey from the main resort area to our room mid-way down to the ocean was a long and tolling journey. We returned back to the Palomino Island and enjoyed another day in the sun! One of the definite highlights was the beautiful weather all four days we were there.The pool areas were average, although at the end of the day they looked pretty well beaten. Definitely not quite as crystal clear and dreamy as the pictures on the internet made it appear. It seemed as though the El Conquistador is trying to hard to be good at to many things and is left with being fair to average on most points. On Monday we left the hotel and check-out was more than depressing! We found out just how much we were nickel and dimed and just how pricey it was. There was a good bit of confusion on getting onto the bus...one of our bags was almost left behind!We toured around Monday in San Juan and we thought it was beautiful and wished we had stayed in the San Juan area (which is right at the airport). San Juan looked more historic and charming whereas the El Conquistador Resort looked outdated and way to pricey for what you get.If we returned to Puerto Rico we would definitely elect to stay in San Juan. We would not recommend that anyone stay at the El Conquistador based on quality and price.

<Content>You can do better First, we were given a room which had stains on the bed, and music played outside our window all night long. This place is very expensive. Even if you get a cheap deal on the room, be prepared to spend a lot on everything else. For those who care about culture, there is none here. It is secluded from the rest of puerto rico, there is nothing within walking distance. For those who families, so does everyone else at this hotel. Just be careful about letting your teens roam at night.For those who care about dinning service, it was infuriating. At one of their resturants which requires formal atire we were given food that was the equivalent of instant pasta. In addition, they do not ask you to taste the wine, and tried to scam us by giving us a different vintage of burgundy than was on the menue. They have no knowledge on any dinning ediqute.This place is a five star in architecture. But everything else is at best a 2.8.

<Content>SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE my husband and i just returned from this hotel after spending a full week; having read all of the reviews i had alot of apprehension prior to our leaving,we had documents from our travel agent promising an upgrade even though we paid for a deluxe ocean front room, the room they took us to was overlooking the childrens slide slight view of the ocean in the far ground and a queen size bed.i spoke to the front desk and we were switched to la brisas king bed big room big terrace overlooking the ocean and the sea, room was okay. buffet breakfast 1st morning decent variety of selections the cost was not posted anywhere the charge was 19pp, not bad so the next morning we went back after having the same buffet as the previous day the bill came and it was 25pp when the staff was questioned NOexplanation given.the grounds are beautiful well cared for, the private beach is very relaxing but a bother to get to.the meals in the hotel where we exclusively ate were pricey for what was offered. if you like salad or vegetables you will be out of luck here lots of carbs with every meal.the staff is very accomadating and very pleasant,the resort is a popular site for corporate events and we got the impression that the resort caters to the large groups rather then the vacation traveler.

<Content>Loved El Con I am struck by the contrasting posts on this site and having just returned from a very pleasurable 4 night stay at El Con I still don't see much down side. Yes it is expensive. It's that kind of resort. We (4 adults) read the reviews and avoided some mistakes that others made: We booked on line through Expedia and got a deep discount on the rooms, got lucky and were upgraded to the main hotel with a spectaclar view of the ocean. We also booked a car on line and it was waiting for us at San Juan Airport. Big savings on just the bus trip alone. We spent most of our arrival day touring Old SJ and had a nice dinner at a quaint restaurant. We also went off campus often not just to avoid the high prices at the resort but also to taste local cuisine. We had stopped at a supermarket and picked up a few things as we were not interested in 3 squares every day. This resort is more expansive than any I have ever stayed at, by an order of magnitude. I played a round of golf - a little pricey at $165 including cart - but coming from the cold northeast worth the price for a round of winter golf. The course is carved out of the hills and with nearly every tee box elevated to nosebleed heights spectacular views are the norm.Tip: Lower the bar of expectations when traveling in the Caribbean and don't sweat the small stuff. It makes no sense to let little things upset your vacation.

<Content>A Nightmare vacation My husband an i and my parents arrived there very excited, My husband was there for the Medical symposium conference.We checked in to a nightmare of a room,my parents an I were given adjoining rooms, mine was a room for the handicapped, which only had a shower. We had no air conditioner for the first three days we were there on the second day i let housekeeping know that the room was very hot and humid making our clothes and our bedsheets very moist and musty, it was so humid on the second night i actually had an asthma attack, i went down to the front desk and it took them till the third day to fix the problem.The worst part was the shower , since it was a room for the handicapped it had an open shower which allowed the water to flood the bathroom everytime you tried to shower it got so bad that the water was actually seeping out in to the hallway, making it a very dangerous situation. Again i told housekeeping and the only thing i got was a bunch of rolled up towels along the floor to soak up water again they never reported the problem. On the third day i slipped and fell injurying my right knee when i hit the floor, also the water reached the closet in the bathroom and all our shoes were soaking wet the maid helped me put them out on the balcony to dryI was in tears. At that point i went to the front desk to complain only to be given the run around, it took 25 min of waiting before anyone would actually come out to speak with me, i would think that if someone got hurt at a major hotel someone would be out in 2 seconds to handle the problem, Well i lost it and demanded to speak with the Hotel manager, which by the way we never saw, they sent the room director who basically said they didn't have another room to give us at that time, and who never reported the fall i took in the bathroom no incident report was ever filed by Mr Angelo Perez. I was appalled at how insensitive this whole situation was treated. We arrived there on Feb 5th and were not offered a room change until Feb 10th which we turned down since they would not move my parents with us. He did offer us a complimentary dinner at what he said was their best restaurant,to which we were told we would have to pay for our own drinks, at the restaurant we were seated at a table in a corner near the kitchen, making us feel like bad children, it was a lackluster meal at best and we felt like we were being punished. My husband conveyed this entiment to the Room director on Feb 11th, he called us back and said that they wanted to move us to one of the casitas, in their haste they deactivated our room keys with all our things still in our rooms, i lost it and went back to the front desk and told them to let us back in our rooms and that with 2 days left in our stay we would not be moving there really was no point . On Feb 12th Mr perez ask my husband to meet with him,we were offered a 1000.00 refund for our trouble and 2 free nights, only to find out that out of the 1000.00 credit they were deducting the 2 free nights and the complimentary dinner they had given us on friday night, when i asked about that the response i got was well we have to pay the restaurant for the meal somehow, it was awful. They also over charged us for the transfer from the airport to the hotel which they had to review and take off and.The fact that i fell in their hotel bathroom, or had an asthma attack directly related to the hot , humid room or that i had to wear wet shoes to the so-called complimentary dinner and the attitude we recieved from the staff, seem to have no effect on them at all. It was shameful and humiliating for us,My expierience at this hotel will never be forgotten, but the worst part is that in beingan Ocuupational therapist and my husband a physician we made it clear that if that bathroom was a hazard for us imagine how dangerous it would be for truly physically disabled person, to which the response was what would you like us to do?If you plan to stay there, make sure you are told everything, the hidden housekeeping charge of 3.00 per day the charge for the bellman as well as a resort tariff, whatever that is. The rooms were dusty and dirty, plates removed from our room were left in front of our door all day with flies buzzing around it was disgusting i had to finally take the plates away myself and put them in the ice room, also the ice machines on our floor were broken, and the worst was having to push dirty wet towels around on the floor used to soak up the water on the bathroom floor after showers, they did send up someone to unclog the drain, but the water still flooded the floor, so we resorted to taking showers in my parents room, which had a tub. The food is very expensive and and not very good at all, which we elected to eat outside of the hotel.It was an awful hotel and made for a very bad vacation , so i caution anyone before choosing this place.

<Content>Fantastic time Having just returned from visiting the El Conquistador with my husband and another couple (all close to 60 years old), I must say that all 4 of us were very impressed with the resort and had a terrific time. I read every previous review before leaving and was extremely apprehensive about what we may encounter. From pick-up at the airport until we were dropped back off there 8 days later, our experience was fantastic. Having traveled extensively and stayed at other great resorts over the years, I feel I have some basis for comparison. Service was prompt, friendly, and efficient; the grounds were well-maintained and very lovely; the rooms were clean and, while somewhat dated, offered lovely views in comfortable surroundings.I was prepared to ask for an updated and quiet room based on other reviews I read here. At check-in, before I could make my request, we were told that we had been upgraded automatically and had a very nice room...which certainly was true. We stayed in room 4436 in the La Vista section and had a fantastic view of El Yunque and the golf course with the ocean in the background...and beautiful sunsets. We rented a car from Avis ahead of time to be picked up at the resort. It was considerably cheaper to do this prior to arrival and we found it cost the same to rent for 5 days or 8 days so got a car for the entire 8 days. The driving was fairly easy and not a problem to get around as in some Caribbean countries. The food was good at the resort, with a nice mix of prices. We really enjoyed the private beach and found the food and drinks over on Palomino Island to be very reasonable and quite good. David's muffins (especially carrot raisin) were a hit with all of us as were the ice cream cones near the casino. Highlights were kayaking on the bioluminescent bay (a must), ferry to Culebra Island (fantastic beach), horseback riding on Palomino Island, and hiking through El Yunque. Oh, also the Golden Door Spa...a somewhat rainy day was made very special by the Caribbean Escape package getaway!It looked like there had been lots of recent painting and repairs to the exterior. Things looked fresh and clean and in good working order. Almost all of the staff were super friendly and helpful. We would love to go back again whenever we get a chance. I truly can't understand the negative reviews...we all had a relaxing and glorious time.

<Content>perfectly acceptable I too became concerned about staying at this resort after reading the reviews. However, they allowed me to set my expectations accordingly, and to become surprised when the facility and the staff greatly exceeded them. The resort was perfectly fine, and, except for the cost of the food, a pretty good value. Beautiful grounds, pool area, and unbeatable views. The rooms where not spic and span but acceptably clean and again not as bad as other reviewers made it sound. We stayed in La Vistas and though the furniture and other room accessories were worn, tired and even broken, the carpet, bedlinens, and accent pillows were new. Staff was friendly, housekeeping did a good job. Restaurants were fine, we were there for the sun, spa and relaxation, not the food. The spa was great. so set your expectations and don't fret about your plans. Its fine.

<Content>Beautiful property! After reading all of the reviews of the hotel, I was very excited to be able to see it first hand and give my own opinion. I've been in the hotel business for many years and done a lot of traveling to various places and various types of properties. Overall, it was a very enjoyable trip. The facility is beautiful (grounds, pools, island etc.) It is older, but pretty well kept up, not perfect, but certainly very nice. The only real complaint for our two families that visited were the guest rooms. They were tired. Not dirty, just older. Bedspreads and carpt were fine. But, when tile and furnishings get older, they are hard to keep looking fresh. We had one room with ocean view in the Las Vistas building and one overlooking the marina in that section. Both just need some perking up and new furnishings. The bathrooms need new tile etc. When you pay these prices...you do want to have a very plush room to go along with it.The nicer restaurants were expensive, but you have other options at all times. We enjoyed Blossoms (Asian), Isabelas (steakhouse) and Stingray (seafood). Anyone that says that there were no other options, didn't take the time to look for them. If you didn't want to spend the money on the finer dining restaurants in the evening, then you certainly could have enjoyed Bella Vista (over the pool), the cafe, or the marina restaurant. If you didn't want to have the breakfast buffet, there is a cafe or a couple of different places to get quick things. We thought lunch on the island was fantastic! Probably the best fish and chips I ever had! Prices were a bit high...but not for resort standards. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the burger place at the main pool...but heard it was great! The childrens menus were very reasonable everywhere.It was high season, but we never had trouble getting chairs, umbrellas, or towels. We found the workers very nice. Service is slow...again, pretty standard for that area. But, everyone was very pleasant. We were not charged for anything that we didn't order and felt completely safe everywhere we went. The property is undergoing a lot of renovation over the next couple of years and will be very fun to visit again when it is complete. But, I wouldn't hesitate going back before then.

<Content>The Worst Vacation Place This had to be the worst place we ever stay at. We arrive there very excited looking around the grounds, were very beautiful and got a nice welcome and then the nightmare began. We went to check in to our suppose to be villa looking over the gardens which was a parking lot, no restaurants open, nothing in villa not even a bottle of water and had to walk to main hotel which was a hike to get something. We check out the next day, and move to the Ritz Carlton in San Juan. We were charge for breakfast that was suppose to be including with room. Everything we were told about this hotel was a lie, even the help said since the new owners, no one knows what they are doing and didn't blame us for leaving. Be careful if you are considering this hotel its not what it seems like, the villas are time share apartments, that are dirty with nothing inside, and there was no room service as promised, no restaurnt, no pool towels, or food or drinks around pool, no restaurant, no internet connection I could go on and on anything you see in the advertisement on computer wasn't there.

<Content>"OK, but wouldn't Go Back" The hotel is situated on a mountain top with a fabulous ocean view. The resort offers many options for dining, both quiet and active pools, casino and shopping. It was overall nice. However, our room was quite dirty albeit spacious. The ceiling leaked and the slider door was broken. We were there 6 days and they never found the time to fix. We had a nice view but no king size beds were apparently available and we paid the top price. The hotel was tired ie. peeling paint, dead flowers in pots, stained bedspreads... We wanted to take the rainforest tour but they won't go unless there's 6 people or you pay the full price. We saved money by renting a car and visiting ourselves. Best tip I can give.. the National Rain Forest has a ranger station half way up. They give fabulous personal 1 hour tours for $5 a person. Cynthia was great! Hotel is OK, but definitely ask for an updated room and expect typical resort pricing for all food, beverages and activies.

<Content>Wonderful! My husband, two teenage girls and I stayed there last summer(when it was a Wyndam) for a family reunion on my husband's side. We had a wonderful time. Service was always friendly. Our rooms cleaned nicely and daily-very nice and accomodating maids. Our room was modern, clean and had a big walk in closet! And a great ocean view.The resort is beautiful and big! It is surrounded for miles by the spectacular golf course. Palomino Island is a must! The water there is chrystal clear and so warm-I could have gone there every day during our week long stay. The lobby is very attractive, with lots of areas for visiting, reading, playing card games, etc. I did not see any neglect as some reviewers have written. The only two down sides to the hotel were: Very medicore food. Expensive as you would expect at a resort, but boring. I would have like to see local food on the menus rather than bland americanized food. Very crowded pool area. Seems June and July are when the local kids come to spend the day at the pool, and it was far too noisy and kid laden for us. We skipped the pool and went to the island instead. I would recommend the hotel, except for in June and July when it is so crowded with kids.

<Content>Had a great time My husband and I just came back from a trip to El Conquistador. I thought I would post my experience since I read all reviews good and bad about the El Conquistador. First of all the rooms...We stayed at La Castitas. The room was mediocre, roomy, but dated, and kind of dirty. Big deck and one of the best pools I have ever seen. We knew people staying in the Marina and in La Vistas (I think that is the name of the wing). The Marina is really loud, we hung out at a bar one night right across from the rooms. Our friends who were there complained the whole time about the commute up to the main area of the resort, and going down to the bar took pretty long. Our friends at La Vistas had no complaints, and this definitely would be the area I would stay in if I had a choice (of course second to Las Casitas). The location is the best for location to the main pool, the spa, golf etc. If you are going with kids, this is definitely where I would stay.The spa is unbelievable. Great massage, clean and beautiful interior. The fitness room was well equipped and they offered tons of classes, but they were beyond my budget. Dont miss out on the spa.The food was just okay. Isabellas was overrated ($30 entrees). Davids cookies had a good latte and good selection for breakfast. The best at the entire resort was a restaurant bar overlooking the main pool, I think it was called Bella Vista. Hands down, one of the best pizzas I have had (it was around 18.00, but between two people we never finished it). Yes the food was expensive, but you can find what you suits you on the resort. If it deters you, I would weigh out the costs of a suite with a kitchen versus what it would cost your group to eat out every night. If you do get a suite, you can rent a car and drive to the resort, pick up groceries on the way (lots of places) and drop off your car once you arrive to the resort. In Las Casitas they offer grocery shopping for a fee of $25. no matter how much you buy. I am not sure if they offer this to all of the guests.SPeaking of the drive from the airport, it was pretty bad. Soooooo long. About 1 hour 15 min. to the resort and 1 hour and 30 min to the airport. The casino was a great time. I won two nights!As far as the employees and service, it wasn't 5 star, but I had good experience with the employees. Very friendly and helpful for the most part.The location is a haul to get to, but the views from this resort are pretty awesome, and our overall stay was fun and relaxing. I would recommend this resort, but caution the long day of travelling you have to do to get from your front door to theirs.

<Content>Beautiful! My husband and I went to this resort on business in early January 2006. After reading the reviews on this website I was terrified where they were sending us! Wow! Thankfully, the reviews I read were nothing like the resort! The resort was beautiful, relaxing and had breath taking views! We had a room over looking the mountains and the golf course. It was so serene to go out each morning and just listen to the birds and look out at the beautiful, peaceful scenery.The food is a bit expensive but you can save money other ways. We rented a car and were able to run to Walmart for breakfast goods and snacks. Also, if you rent a car you can try some of the local places for dinner. We LOVED El Passions Restuarant (we went twice!) which was very close to the resort. They have some wonderful local Puerto Rican dishes and service was great. Try the Mofongo!!! Lolita's Mexican restaurant was also good. Polomino Island was beautiful but eat before you go over, unless you like to eat with Chickens running around your feet. We liked to have lunch down at the Marinia. Very peaceful there. The Hibachi Grill Blossoms was wonderful (and a bit pricey). Going to Old San Juan is a MUST! IT's not only beautiful but it has some neat shops. We ate lunch at a great restuarant which claims to be the birth place of the pina colada! Overall, this is a great resort! I would definitely go back in a heartbeat! Puerto Rico is a beautiful country with many perks since its an US territory. (no customs, they use dollars, everyone speaks english)

<Content>El Conquistador a resort in decline. I recently returned from my third visit to the El Conqistador resort in Puerto Rico and clearly this is a resort in decline. The rooms were fine but service in all aspects was deplorable. We had two rooms in Bldg. 3 and neither were cleaned properly for the week we were there. Toiletries were replaced seemingly based on whatever the maid had on her cart. We'd get 5 mouthwashes but no shampoo, conditioner but no soap, decaf coffee and no regular. One of my sons dripped ice cream on the floor in the bathroom which I didn't notice until 3 days later. Obviously the maid didn't think the floors needed cleaning. One of two elevators didn't work the entire week. There are boats that ferry you to the private island which is very nice. Of course one of the boats broke down delaying our return to the hotel. In Sting Rays we waited over an hour for our dinners and finally got them only after I threatened to leave.We had approx. $250. taken from our room as did another party in our group.One guest was billed $200. from a restaurant he never visited.The pools were shut down early one day so they could set up for a large group that was having a party. Needless to say the kids weren't happy.I arranged for 20 people to take a tour of the rain forest only to arrive in the lobby at 8:30 and be told we didn't have a reservation. The concierge did a wonderful job in finding us a bus quickly so it did end up well. The list goes on and on. There were persistant rumors that the hotel had new owners and that they were going to put millions into the resort in 07. I'll wait to see if that happens and then consider returning. It really is a beautiful location and the golf is supposed to be outstanding. Without a change the El Conquistador is off my travel list.

<Content>Have you really been there???? Sheesh, people. My wife and I fretted over our decision to stay at the El Conquistor for weeks based on the surly reviews we saw on Trip Advisor. I have no idea what ax these folks have to grind, but here's the real skinny:The El Conquistador is a world class resort. There is no way pictures can do it justice because it is built on such a grand scale.We found the food to be very good (exception being the Caribe Coffee Shop which seems to cater to families with kids). Yes, things were a bit pricey, but what do you expect at a resort of this caliber? The prices weren't any worse than what we see here in the Dallas area.The rooms were magnificent. We caught a deal through Hotwire and were worried we'd end up with a room in the dungeon, but we ended up with a gorgeous room, huge bathroom, large balcony and a view of the golf course with the ocean in the distance.We found the casino to be lively and somewhat lucky. The private beach with free ferry service was the most relaxing part of the stay.Please don't let the negative folks cheat you out of your El Conquistador experience.

<Content>A good time at the Elcon. After reading earlier reviews, of course I was nervous. On the way there, it was very hard for me to feel good about the resort because of the reviews on here as well as the fact that only two weeks before I was at a fabulous all-inclusive in the Dominican Republic. I knew I would be comparing my experience with everyone on here as well as my trip to DR! Luckily, I am an open-minded person and I was able to separate the paradise I had been in, for the new paradise of the Elcon. I also never believe a critic until I experience it for myself. I am giving the truth here....you can trust me. I am totally honest. I'm not one of those boorish travelers either. I don't complain and am faily easy-going. So I won't be complaining about dust bunnies-not that I like them, but I can live with them.When we arrived we were not sure where to stay. The place is huge-so many places to be. We met up with a bellman-Angel Torres. He was a huge help. He showed us different rooms throughout the resort and told us everything else we needed to know about the place. He must have spent a whole hour with us! We decided to be in Las Brisas Wing-closer to the lobby and pool. The Marina is pretty, but the boats are noisy in the morning and the Funiculars-while fun and a quick ride- would have been a pain to constantly be up and down on. If you are lobby-goers and like to be around the casino and restaurants, internet cafe etc, then the Marina will be too far for you. At first we thought that we should be in the Marina because it's so much closer to the boat to take to Palomino Island (the private island of the resort), but the ride on the funicular down was not that long and we only went to Palomino once anyway. Everything inside the resort is outdated. It is still pretty, but old. Keep that in mind. You will see wear and tear everywhere, but while we were there they were painting, cleaning..so they make attempts to keep it nice. It is pretty inside....definitely....but if you want polish, perfection and new, this is not the place for you. The rooms are definitely not the best. They are old. The carpet needs to be changed and the tiles on the bathroom floor and walls are cracking. The room is not as clean as it could be either. It's not filthy or grimy or anything, but there are dust bunnies, stains on the carpets. The hardware is old. I am good at letting that stuff go because there is so much beauty around the resort that you hardly notice that it is antiquated. The views are spectacular. I did not know this before I went, but you are so high up (where we stayed) that you have a panoramic view of the Caribe as well as the Atlantic. It's breathtaking. That alone makes Elcon awesome. The food is excellent...all over the resort. The Caribe Cafe was great. The best Banana Smoothie I have ever had. The ice cream was delicious too. All the restaurants were incredible. You must have Pizza outside-forget the name of the place. DELICIOUS. It is all expensive though indeed. However, that's the way it usually is at resorts. We skipped breakfast, had cookies or muffins at David's one day and went out for lunch outside the resort one day. We went to Metropol, a Cuban place. That was delicious too. It is definitely wise to skip a meal if you can once or twice to save a little-if you are concerned about money.Palmomino Island: It was okay, nothing to write home about. A small island...calm waters, great for the kids. Sand was a little rocky and not as white as I expected. This is where I got into trouble because if being in DR two weeks before. That was a beach with waves and a lot of sand.....we were right on the Caribe there-out in the middle of nowhere. If you want that kind of beach, then you will need to travel to area beaches while at Elcon. Just keep in mind this is a small island, so it's different. Still, it's nice.....but it's simple. Nothing to ooohh and awww about. I liked the boat ride though.....no matter what kind of boat, I love it!The Spa was the best part. Best massage and body treatment I have ever had. I live in New York and I have been to the best spas in the city-world renowned places that people die to get into. Golden Door has them beat as far as I am concerned. Prices were reasonable too. I was impressed.We hired our own driver to see El Yungue-the rainforest and Old San Juan. We did it for about 4 hours each. El Yunque cost us about $180 plus $30 for optional tip. Old San Juan cost us $210. We tipped again on that trip, but I forget how much...maybe an extra $30-40. Not cheap.....but worth it because we wanted to go on our own time and at our own pace. The hotel offers group tours for just a tiny bit less, but if they do not have enough people, they cancel......and you go for the whole day and possibly lose pool/island time. Alberto Soler was our driver/guide. He was great. Request him and you will not be disappointed. He is worth every penny. When you go to the Old City, go down San Francisco street and have lunch at Mallorca. It is a local place. We were the only tourists in there. The food was great and so were the pastries. If you are like me and believe when in Rome......, then you want to be here and not in the Puerto Rico Cafe down the road where you will be stepping over tourists. Anyway, I am already writing too much. It is expensive, but most vacations are. Truth be told, we spent what we spent on the all-inclusive....maybe we spent a couple hundred more, but in the end, it was pretty close. Vacations are not cheap, but in the end, it's always worth the expenditure......even when it puts us into debt. One thing I will complain about-something I think is aboslutely stupid is that the resort will charge you for the airport transfers. Come on Manangement-we are already paying enough-some things need to be complimentary.Looking forward to returning someday. The hotel is not owned by Whyndam (SP?)anymore. Blackstone bought it and is going to begin remodels soon. It will be nice to return when it is all finished. They know they are sitting on a huge nest egg because of the views. The food is great as well as the casino too.....I can see this resort being in the top ten once it updates. As old as it was-it is one of the best places to stay on the Island. The experience would have s----- if we stayed at the Ritz like we originally planned. So we were pretty pleased. If anyone has any questions you can email me, ----. I'd be happy to help.

<Content>NOT the Wyndham El Conquistador Resort My husband and I stayed at the ElCon Resort the week of 12/9 thru 12/17/05. At the time we made our reservations the hotel was advertised as a Wyndham Resort; however, upon arrival and check-in, we were told that the hotel had been sold 6 months earlier and it would not honor any Wyndham rewards or specials such as Wyndham By Request, etc. Interestly enough, EVERYTHING in the hotel (pens, menus, guides, soap, shampoo, writing paper, etc.) still has the Wyndham name and logo on it! In fact, if you go to the Wyndham website, it still lists the ElCon as one of its hotels. Nevertheless, the hotel will make no effort to accommodate those who are under this false impression--an impression which they (the current owners) have done nothing to change. Additionally, although our room was completely prepaid, at check-in we were also told that we MUST give them our credit card, which would be charged a minimum of $1,000 up front for any incidentals we might incur. (FYI: Should you decide NOT to charge anything to your room account, your card is still charged, you do NOT get a refund at the end of your stay, but rather, the hotel will refund your credit card approximately 2-3 weeks after your departure!!!) It has always been my experience that hotels keep your credit card on file as a sort of quasi deposit until check-out--at which time YOU can chose whether to have that card charged or pay in cash, or whatever for any such incidentals. Perhaps this charge is common in the resort hotels, but again, I have never experienced it anywhere else. In any case, when I refused to give them my credit card for that purpose, they insisted I leave cash in lieu of the card. Again, $1,000+. Nowhere in any literature about the hotel, on the website, or at the time of my reservation was there any small print or mention of this charge. After much back and forth, we agreed to leave $400 for possible incidentals. (Be sure to get a receipt, because even though they have all the information on their computer, they will NOT refund your money without your receipt!)After all of this, when we did try to charge our breakfast to the room, we were told we could not--that we were on a cash only basis. We then would have to go to the front desk and go through the whole process again with whomever was on duty. I will say that for the most part, the staff was very polite and even apologetic throughout; however, the management was quite the opposite. As others have mentioned, the hotel discourages you from leaving the property unless you go through the hotel for car rentals, tours, etc. Essentially, you are in resort prison. We asked one of the concierges about getting out (to the town of Fajardo), and were told it was a 5-10 min drive or 20 min walk. We chose to walk and found out that the 20 min was more than an hour to get to nowhere! But we figured okay, we would just take a taxi back. What we later found out and what she had neglected to tell us was that Fajardo is closed on Sundays and there is NO taxi service! About the only thing open (besides church) was a Subway shop. So we got a sandwich and headed back (on foot) to the resort. About a half hour into our walk we were fortunate enough to get a ride from a woman returning from church, who informed us that we were lucky we hadn't gotten robbed (or worse) as we were walking through a really horrible part of town! (The road, by the way, the concierage suggested we take.)Our next trip out we rented a car from Avis, which is located in the lobby of the hotel. However, do NOT rent a car through the hotel! If you rent a car through the hotel, you will pay about $100/day. We went to the Avis site online (from our room) and got the same car for $59.95/day. And forget about the tours the hotel offers. Besides being overpriced, they also cancel the tour if there aren't 6 or more people booked.Lastly, on our final day, we checked out and brought our luggage to the front of the hotel to meet the hotel's airport shuttle. We were told our luggage was safe, and so we left it there and went to one of the shops in the lobby to pick up a few gift items. We later found out (at the airport) that wasn't so. Our (very expensive) laptop was now missing. We called the hotel, were transferred all around the hotel--to shops, front desk, and finally security. They couldn't have been any less interested. We called several times, and finally reached someone who said they would look at the security videotapes and get back to us. It has been weeks. We have heard from no one. Our calls do not get answered or returned.Having said all that, on the brighter side of things, the weather was, for the most part, very pleasant. We stayed down at the Marina, which was private, quiet, and had a beautiful view of the ocean. Of course, the only way up to the hotel is by the funicular/cable car, which is nice when working. (For a few days, one of the two cars was out of commission.) It would be smart for the hotel to put in a staircase, if for no other reason than for emergencies when the power is out and so are cable cars. Anyway, it didn't much affect us, but there were many times when guests from up top missed the boat to the island because there was only one car in service. And although the boat to the island is supposed to run every half hour, it was randomly changed to every hour.Being down in the Marina, we were able to escape the resort and walk to a less glamorous part of town and get some good local food at reasonable prices. We found a little bodega, and were able to get some snacks and cervezas for less than the $100 we would have paid at the hotel!Our room was clean and comfortable enough; although the decor was like something out of the 80's. The bathroom was huge, lots of marble, and spotless. The maid sersvice was fine, although it took three days to get a coffeemaker that worked. Having visited Puerto Rico before and all the usual sites, we weren't looking to be entertained this trip, just relaxed. So, staying down at the Marina satisfied that desire. When we wanted to go somewhere like San Juan or Old San Juan, we rented a car.Personally, I wouldn't recommend this hotel at this point in time. One would think that as new owners, Management would do everything possible to make their guests' stays great and memorable. Instead Management treats the guests as though they are doing them (the guests) a favor by letting them stay there! So rather than having a great and memorable stay, one leaves with just a memorable one--and an unfavorably memorable one at that.

<Content>amazing property but.... We stayed at the Conquistador from the 26th until the 31st. It is an amazing property!!, truly one of the best hotels I have seen (and we travel quite often). The hotel, the Island, the pools, truly beautiful. But, some things need to be polished. First, the incredibly noisy band in the lobby, please lower the volume!!. It is impossible to talk or even ask for a drink while the band is playing. Seriously, the noise is unbearable. Asides from this, the rooms need to be upagraded a bit. The quality of the food in most of the restaurants need to improve. We liked Isabella's, but franky the rest were just eeehh whatever.

<Content>Lot's of Plus's Few Negatives This was the second time that I have stayed at this hotel. I will first start with the positives as there are many. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Lobby, pool area, views, shops, and the beach especially. The staff I found to be very helpful and pleasant on all occasions. I needed a few things from housekeeping and they were promptly brought to my door within 10 minutes. The water taxi to and from the beach is very enjoyable as well. It takes about 15 minutes and it has beautiful views of the hotel and surrounding areas in the beautiful blue water. We actually ate at every restaurant in the main hotel. I found the food to be very good. The Italian restaurant Otellos was the one I liked most. We traveled with our 8 year old son who has autism and everyone was friendly and accomodating to his tastes in restaurants. In two instances they made me something not on the menu for him. The casino while small was very nice as well. We didn't actually gamble this time but it was clean and lively and open aired. Not smokey or crowded in any way. The pools were clean. There is a main pool with a slide and a volleyball net. Then there is another pool with a water platform and a swim up bar. Both areas had food and drinks to be delivered pool side or sit at a table. There was a game room for kids, and two ice cream shops with access to the internet if you needed it. It was 4.95 per hour for usage. I took advantage of the shuttle service provided by the hotel. While it was not cheap (60 rt per adult and 40 rt per child) it was convenient and direct. Took just over an hour from San Juan airport. Check in was quick and it was the holiday week. I never saw a line at the counter at all. That goes for the boat to the beach or any restaurant seating. The beach is on a beautiful private island with nice sand and the water is warm and aqua. Some days there was a little seaweed but others there was none. There were plenty of lounge chairs and towels were provided as soon as you got off the boat. There was drink service on the beach as well as delivery of lunch if you wanted it. We chose to eat at the tables in the small beach restaurant each day and there was never a wait for a table either. Again, keep in mind it is Christmas week. Still no wait. They had jet ski, snorkle rental equiptment, etc right on the beach. There was also horse back riding I believe. Now all that being said.. What I was not happy with while it would not prevent me from returning again I was on a ground level room with a garden view in the La Vista wing. The room was in need of a major renovation. Carpets a bit dingy, no ventilation in the bathroom and pitted fixtures in the bathroom as well. The linens were clean but old and in need of a replacement. This hotel was recently sold so I know they are about to do a major renovation. I did pay the lowest rate available for my room and they went up several levels from my rate which was 375.00. All the rooms are the same size. Very big. 575 sq feet and I knew I would have no ocean view which i didn't care about. Actually my view was of the golf course and garden and was quite nice. As I said the complaint was on the run downness of the room. It was a little musty too. I had brought a scented candle with me and was glad that I did. There is an 11% tax rate and also a 11% resort fee which I believe is going up to 15%. It brought the room up to 450.00 and I don't believe that for that price I should be unhappy with the room in any way but I was not thrilled. Secondly, there were children's menu's in each of the restaurants which was great. The food otherwise was a little pricey but something I'm used to living in New York. What was really pricey was the cost of soft drinks and juices. When two eggs, and toast cost 6.50 in the coffee shop and a juice cost 3.00. I thought that to be a little high. Nothing that can't be fixed with bringing in juice boxes for my son. I did not use the spa so I can't comment on it. My husband golfed twice and while not cheap he loved the course and did well on it. Golfing at any resort is not cheap so we expected that cost. 165.00 per round. We love this place and will return again. I suppose had I made a fuss I could have switched my room but I didn't. Maybe next time I'll specificy before I actually get to it and settle in. Feel free to ask any questions you might have.

<Content>Beautiful grounds, expensive food I spent five days at El Conquistador this December, with my two kids (3 and 6) and my parents (in their 60s). We got a fairly good deal on the air+hotel package, so despite all the reviews I read here we decided to take a chance. Overall, we had a very pleasant five day trip to PR.GROUNDS + POOLS + BEACH: The resort grounds are indeed beautiful. Well maintained and groomed. They impressed both my parents and me. The pools (three in the main complex) are nice and my kids loved them. My six year old loved the slide (open 10-5) and all the pool toys (we got them for free at the pool desk). We had some minor problems getting towels after 5pm. The staff I spoke about this with complained too many guests left their towels behind so they, the staff, had to go around collecting them the morning after?! Palomino island beach is beautiful! My kids both liked the short boat ride (10min) and enjoyed the beach. The beach got busy each day around 11 or noon and you had to search a bit longer for the right spot in the shade. My three year old does not like to wear a swimsuit but we were a bit looked upon, as she played naked on the beach. That was a bit of a surprise to me. ROOMS: We opted for the garden-view rooms, as they were closest to the restaurants and the pools. The view was nice, overlooking the golf course with a partial view of the distant Luquillo beach. I was happy with the room size and cleanliness. I had a king size bed which was enough for my two kids and me. My parents had two full beds, in the room of similar configuration. The bathrooms were spacious and clean. Keep in mind that this resort is probably about 20-30 years old. We had and used the in-room fridge and occasionally watched TV. There was a VCR there as well which we did not test. Both rooms were made before noon on each day of our stay.FOOD: The food is the weakest point of this resort. First of all, it is expensive. Hot dogs for $10, cocktails $8, small pizza for $19. We ended up eating at Cafe Caribe one night and had breakfast at David's Cookies. The dinner for 5 (3 adults + 2 kids) ran about $90 but was nothing special. Breakfast was about $25 for five of us (croissants + coffee). I would not mind the prices that much if the food quality was exceptional. Unfortunately, it was mediocre. For instance, the hot dogs were small and the buns were of the worst kind (very dry)---something you get at a local fair from a girl scouts' stand for $1.50. We loved the fish and chips at Palomino island, but the prices were even higher there than in the rest of the resort.We took advice from another TripAdvisor review and ate outside most of the nights (we had a rental car for the stay). There is a number of restaurants in the vicinity of the resort. We ate at the Anchor Inn one night (5 min drive). They had decent seafood and local specialties. We also went to the Metropolis restaurant that serves good Cuban food (about 10 min drive). Both nights we paid about $80-$90, but the food was much better than what we got at the resort. Finally, on the last day of our stay we went to the Luquillo food stands for lunch. This is a strip with 20+ food stands near Rt.3, next to Luquillo beach, that serves local food. Be forewarned: it is mostly deep-fried but very tasty! We spent about $20 on drinks and a small lunch for five.ACTIVITIES: Beach and pool were the two places where we spent most of our time. One day we went to San Juan to explore the Old City. It was drizzling all day but we still enjoyed the fortress and walking around the narrow streets. We also spent an afternoon in the El Yunke rainforest. It is about 30min drive from the resort but well worth it. The view of the island from Yokahu tower is stunning. Given the kids age I decided not to hike a lot, but there are certainly many trails for those inclined to explore the forest, waterfalls and many streams.GENERAL: Before embarking on this trip I bought a Lonely Planet guide to Puerto Rico. I always found these guides useful and this one was no exception.CAR RENTAL: We decided to rent a car for the five days we spent in PR. This gave us the freedom to explore beyond the tours offered by the resort. It also proved useful for eating out. Self parking in the resort is $15/day, $20 for valet. Our total rental from Budget was about $250 for five days, plus about $40 for gas. Probably slightly more than the airport shuttle for five, but well worth it. However, be ready for some traffic in PR! It took us about 1.5h for the 35 or so miles from the airport to the resort, around 3 in the afternoon. Rt.3 is particularly bad, with frequent traffic lights. On our second trip from San Juan to the resort we decided to try a different route, suggested by Lonely Planet (52 south, 30 west, 53 north). What a mistake! It was a rush hour and despite all the roads being limited access (toll+freeway) it took us 2 hours to get back. A part of this was because of the traffic signs, rather the lack of those. A bit frustrating, but no worse than driving in New Jersey or in Boston.

<Content>Repeat visitor very pleased My family of 6 people including my three children ages 1,2 and 9 and our nanny stayed at the EC from Dec 18-24 and had a great time. We have been to PR 7 times and always love this place. Our rooms in the La Vista bldg were large, clean and comfortable. We had two adjoining rooms which is a must for our large crowd. We were originally placed in Las Olas. When we arrived there with our 14 suitcases and a double stroller, we found that there was no elevator. We called the front desk before unloading our bags and even attempting to enter our room and we were greeted by a very helpful staff member who immediately changed our rooms to the la Vista Bldg. We stayed in las Brisas last year and found La Vista nicer, more conveniently located and newer. We had a beautiful view of El Yunque and a gorgeous sunset every night. Each room had excellent air conditioning and a functional refrigerator which was essential for us with our young children. We were on the Four For Free package which I highly recommend as this includes your transfers from SJU on an air conditioned motor coach and breakfast daily for two people per room. This makes the financial pinch of the stay much more tolerable.Though not in plain site, there are ramps everywhere (other than in Las Olas) to make access to all parts of the hotel easy. The place is a city and you really don't need to leave the resort. Yes, Yes, the food is expensive. I said this in my review from last year. We spent between $140 - $180 for dinner each night. That is the price you pay for convenience. Blossoms is as good as any Hibachi-teppan yaki Japanese restaurant and Otello has very good Italian fare. I had a very good steak at Isabella's and the fish is very decent at Stingray. The food at Cafe Caribe is not very good but is good enough for the young kids if Mom and Dad want to have dinner alone. Cafe Caribe is also pretty reasonably priced. The best meal of the day, however is breakfast. The buffet in Las Brisas is very nice. The restaurant is newly remodeled since last year and the food is great. They have a secret for making oatmeal that is not to be believed.The pools are beautiful and Palomino Island is magnificent. The boat ride over and back is very enjoyable. Our weather was the best we have had in Puerto Rico. Sunny and warm with highs of 85 -87 degrees each day. When it is 5 below 0 in Chicago how could you possibly go wrong? Furthermore, PR is easy access from the states. There is no immigration or customs and if you can get a direct nonstop flight which we had, the travel is not that bad, even with young children.Overall, the EC is a wonderful hotel for families traveling with children who want a sprawling resort with all amenities from pool to spa, tennis and golf and a casino where you can still find $5.00 tables. The service is accomodating with a great wait staff. Perfect, no....but they do really try hard to help. After our problem at check-in which was quickly remedied we did not have another glich for the remainder of our stay. We are two time veterans of the EC and 7 time vets of PR. We sing songs of praise for both the island and the resort. Bon Voyage!!

<Content>Unless you are being paid to stay here, don't We stayed at the El Conquistador from December 20, 2005 through Christmas Day. I am a travel agent, and would not recommend this resort to my clients.Upfront summary: Unless you have very low expectations for quality and service and have very, very deep pockets, I would not recommend a stay at the Wyndham El Conquistador. It is a 2-3 star resort with 5 star prices. LXR Luxury Resorts purchased it about 6 months ago, however, there are severe management/operational problems with the resort.The hotel is about 30 miles from the airport, and takes about an hour and a half to travel to the hotel. You can arrange for a shuttle from the hotel (call ahead to arrange this). This will cost $32 per person each way.The hotel looks great from the outside, but don鈥檛 look too closely, otherwise, you will see the circa 1960 veneer. The common areas are showing wear, and the guest rooms, although large, have definitely seen better days.The hotel grounds are expansive, and there are guest rooms spread all over the resort. Depending on your room location, it can take you 20-30 minutes to get to the main lobby, incorporating a couple of elevators and the Funicular (trolley-like vehicle).Some of the issues we experienced:-Air conditioner didn鈥檛 work properly-Housekeeping extremely inconsistent: rarely replaced coffee/creamer/soap/washcloths/towels-Asked for an extra luggage rack twice (5:00pm and 6:30pm). Finally arrived at 10:30pm-Refrigerator in bathroom had a puddle of water in the bottom of it-Light bulbs were burned out-Bathroom floor dirty-Dust bunnies in corners-Lumpy bed-We made a list of room problems and brought it to the front desk. They did finally send housekeeping and engineering down to fix some of the problems.-A ceiling tile fell down in room (narrowly missing my husband as he was exiting the bathroom)- 3 days into our stay, the front desk called and offered us another room. When asked why we were being offered another room, the front desk didn鈥檛 know. We refused, fearing it would be worse than the one we had. We found out later that it was because they couldn鈥檛 fix our air conditioning.-We received turn down service twice (the day after our complaint and Christmas Eve). We aren鈥檛 sure if we were supposed to get turn down service every day, or whether management was trying to make amends. In any case, it was inconsistent service, and the maid complained the whole time she was in the room.-It is a $40 taxi ride (one way) to the town of Fajardo (5 min away); $110 taxi ride to Old San Juan (one way). We found out that the hotel apparently charges the taxis/sedan drivers a fee to service hotel guests. The hotel should at least provide a free shuttle service into Fajardo, since it is so close. You get the impression that management doesn鈥檛 want anyone to leave the resort property, since they make it very expensive to do so. A number of guests made the comment that they felt like 鈥減risoners鈥?-If the hotel doesn鈥檛 have at least 6 guests signed up for a tour, they cancel the tour. We were cancelled twice for the Old San Juan tour.-Cost to rent a car at the hotel for the day is a whopping $100. This is through Avis. You would do better to rent a car at the airport.-You can鈥檛 be in a hurry if you need to take the Funicular, which is needed for rooms at the lower levels, and to get to their private island. The Funicular doesn鈥檛 always stop at the Las Olas level (middle level), even if you push the button. Get on when you can. There is no other way to get to the main hotel level. -Management did send people to service our room after complaints, though in many cases, it took 2 calls to get them to service the room. Many other guests had similar complaints. The couple of times we made comments to managers, they shrugged their shoulders as if they weren鈥檛 surprised.-They have a free workout room on the Las Olas level (there is also a workout room at the Golden Door Spa which costs $25/day, if you don鈥檛 have a spa service that day). However, much of the equipment and TVs were broken, and they don鈥檛 offer headsets for the TVs.-Expect to pay very high food prices on the resort. For example, a hamburger ordered through room service is $21 (which includes all the fees and taxes). -The resort charges an additional 22% for resort tax and resort tariff on top of your room charge. Make sure you figure this into your final room charge.-Examine your room bill carefully (keep all of your room charge receipts, if possible.) There were a number of discrepancies on the bill-all in the hotel鈥檚 favor. Be careful to always fill in a total on each receipt you get, otherwise, it will be 鈥渇illed in鈥?for you, and not always with what it should be.Spa issues:-When waiting for Spa services, they consistently got husband鈥檚 name/gender wrong even though his name/gender were correctly listed in the reservation system. Once, the spa staff didn鈥檛 even show up for my husband鈥檚 treatment (even after I told technician that he was a man and was on men鈥檚 side, not the women鈥檚). Next day, I had to send my spa technician from the lady鈥檚 waiting room to the men鈥檚 waiting area to make sure that he got his service.-Many of the showers out of order-No shaving cream for either men or women-No razors in men鈥檚 spa-Toilet paper gone in most stalls-Poor maintenance or servicing (most times the water pitchers were empty), and the spa is generally dirtyOn the good side:-They had free holiday drink and food tastings beginning Dec 22nd for the holidays. Unfortunately, they only had enough food for the first 45 minutes, so if you got there late, there wasn鈥檛 anything left.-It appears to be a good resort (in theory) for families, since it is self-contained, and has a number of pools, golf, horseback riding, tennis, etc. That is, if you can overlook the other issues.-The Wyndham El Conquistador does have a private island, with a ferry to the island every half hour. The island is very nice, and is a good place to relax. It is the only place on the resort to 鈥済o to the beach鈥? However, if one of the ferries has to make a cargo run, you have to wait an hour for the next one.-Two of the better values in the hotel restaurants are Bella Vista Caf茅 (near the main pool), and Sweet Corner (at the top of the Funicular, in the Promenade). Decent food and good prices. Stay away from Caf茅 Caribe. The food is overpriced and not very good.-Most of the staff is pretty friendly, with the exception of management and the maids.-If you get a chance to go to the El Junque Rain Forest, and they don鈥檛 cancel the tour due to insufficient participants (6 people required), this is a great experience. Also, the tour van driver recommended Pasion Restaurant in Fajardo. We were able to arrange for the van driver to drive 6 of us (to keep the transportation price down) to the restaurant that night. Definitely worth it, though it is mostly a tourist restaurant. We split a 2.5 lb lobster with sweet plantains, a bottle of wine and a salad for $94. If you have a car, or can get reasonably priced transportation, you should visit this restaurant. It is a 5 minute drive from the hotel.-If you want local food, without the resort prices, take the Funicular down to the marina, walk past the parking lots, down a dark 鈥渟cary鈥?alley to the area outside of the resort, where the locals hang out. There are a number of 鈥渟hacks鈥?serving food. The Ocean View is one of the better ones. The food is reasonably priced, and you can get some good local food.In the main lobby there are architecture drawings indicating that the hotel will be undergoing renovation in 2007/2008. This is way past due. Although this will take care of the d茅cor, the management problems will probably still remain.Bottom line: Unless you are being paid to stay here, DON鈥橳, or wait until renovations are complete. In either case, expect to pay top dollar for your stay.

<Content>Nice hotel in Puerto Rico We stayed in this hotel during christmas weekWe were uncomfortable to go to this hotel at the beginning based on the reviews and we believe most of the people's reviews were correctHotel is beautiful, very very nice grounds, very nice private island .There is no more free upgrade . You have to pay for a ocean view room !Food is very very expensive and very BAD !I wonder if anybody reads the reviews from the hotel management so they can correct this issueThis is a 4 star hotel and it will always stay 4 star hotel. It is not for budget travellerPina colada's are not good at all too...each drink is $8.00 and for parking you have to pay $15.00 per dayWe strongly suggest to rent a car from the airport to hotel--it is well worth it --We rented a car from Avis Car Rental and we were very impressed with their service qualityWe visited Culebra island one day --there is a ferry from Fajardo to CUlebra Island every day --. This island is a MUST SEE ...it is like heavenOld San Juan is really nice and there is a lot to seeFood in old san juan is much better than Fajardo --where the hotel is located --

<Content>Very nice, but very expensive I just returned from 5 nights (Deluxe oceanview at Marina) with my wife at El Conquistador Dec 19-24. Prior to leaving I was a bit nervous based on some recent postings, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The grounds are beautiful and the staff very nice and helpful. The food is very good but extremeley expensive (casual dining $15 sandwich, fine dining $30 plus entrees, drinks $5-10, adds up). There are a lot of great activities close to the resort, including rain forest and night kayak tours, and Spa was great. Each wing of the resort has its own pool, the nicest being at Las Casitas (must check out the infinity pool even if just for a peek). Our favorite day was a trip to Culebra, which is a beautiful island off the northeast coast. Only costs $4.50 round trip for a 60 minute ferry ride from Fajardo (avoid front very bumpy) and $4 round trip taxi to Flamenco Beach where you can rent chairs and eat cheap. Definitely worth it; I've never seen a nicer beach. The resort was very quiet while we were there, which was the nicest part. I would probably not come here during peak season because getting around the resort will take too long (it is very spread out requiring rides on various elevators/funiculars) and also not a an ideal place for those on a budget. Otherwise, a great time at a beautiful resort...A few tips to save money: bring own snacks/liquor, eat at Pasion restaurant really good off resort, and avoid the private taxis that hotel supplies charge twice as much as public taxis. Must See: Culebra, Casitas Infinity pool. Skip: Palomitas (better islands to see)

<Content>FABULOUS RESORT!!! I read trip advisor frequently and also travel much.....business and pleasure. I became a bit skeptical after my husband and I had booked an unbelievably cheap deal for 5 nights at the El Con. After reading many of the terrible reviews, we decided not to expect alot. BOY WE WERE WRONG!We are currently on our third night here and are still astounded. EVERYONB has been super friendly, but I believe you get what you give. MY hubby says I could strike up a conversation with a tree!We rented a car and drove from the airport...traffic the entire way. When we got here...heaven! Upon checkin, I sucked up to the front desk person. I asked him if he was the Alex I had read about who was so nice. Funniest thing......both front desk people named ALEX! After laughing, I said it would be wonderful to have a king bed with coeanfront view. He said that was possible, but an extra $70/night. I slipped him a $20, and he went in the back, returned a moment later, and said we would get a special private upgrade from the hotel.Bellman takes us to our room in the Las Brisas wing....and my husband's jaw drops! Magnificent view and very nice newly decorated room. Very large dressing area, sunken tub, walk-in closet. Separate sitting area. GREAT COMFORTABLE BED!Had a massage this morning at The Golden Door Spa....a must do! I had the 50 minute Golden Door massage...best ever. We have eaten at Caribe Cafe twice and it has been fine. Also ate lunch at the Green Iguana on Palimino Island....very good.Palamino island is super and beautiful.Anyone who wrote a bad review was either an inexperienced traveler or doesn't know how to get what they want. Don't complain.....be nice and ask for what you want. Don't come here if you are on a nickel and dime budget....it is not that type of a resort. Enjoy...enjoy.....we will surely be back!!!

<Content>Supper Rude People  This is our 2nd time at this resort. 1st was in 2003-we were disappointed that time. But last month we decided to give it another try. My husband  I decided to give it 1 more try about this hotel. But to our disappointment it was the same expensive and VERY RUDE  CLUELESS PEOPLE. It was our 10th Wedding Anniversary. The bellman was lazy, we have arranged that our luggage to be delivered to our room when it is ready, while we went and visit some friends who were staying at another resort. When we got to our room later that night, I called for our luggage because they have not brought it to our room, we have to go get our luggage ourselves, I was so tired of waiting for the bellman. The 1st night Our bed was kind a lumpy and theres hairs on the bathroom floors So the next day we asked for another room, the room that we finally move was in a better location and the bed felt a lot better than the 1st one but, there were hairs behind the refrigerator and the refrigerator was filthy. I was so grossed out that my husband had to cleaned it so we can use it. The maid does not really clean the room, I think they only come in and changed the towels. Food was super pricey but tastelike a fast food, The waiter 1 time can not get my order for the 1st  2nd time. By the time my dinner came my husband food was cold. One time at one of the restaurant I asked the waitress for a glass of water she said she was busy, and the other waitress swho said she supposed to never came back. People who give this resort a good reviews probably had not been to the West coast, Hawaii or Mexico where real nice people and service is excellent. We travels a lot about 5X a year for pleasure and to relax worldwide. The setting  structure of the resort is really breath taking but SERVICE IS THE WORST that I have ever experienced and room are TERRIBLE VERY DIRTY. WILL NOT EVER RECOMMEND THIS RESORT TO ANYBODY- I might if I really hate that person. The Spa was nice-so relaxing that was the best of our stay. Other than that this resort need to send all the staff for Hotel  Restaurant Management  Service courses and classes.

<Content>Our Vacation Exceeded All Expectations... Upon reading all of the reviews and speaking with friends who had visited in recent years, I was a bit leary about our stay at the El Conquistador. I was expecting nice facilities, attentive staff, but overall a place that had seen its best days years ago.My husband and I visited during a slow week which might account for some of our positive thoughts (I can see how it could get a bit chaotic during busier times). All staff were polite, attentive and eager to please. While not new, our room was spacious, comfortable and quite clean.The spa was fantastic! We had a two-for-one deal I took full advantage of and loved the services I received (Golden Door Massage and a heavenly reflexology treatment)!The grounds were well maintained and inviting. The casino was not particularly busy, allowing my husband to try his hand at all of the games he never tries on our trips to AC and Vegas!The food was so-so at best and the prices were quite high. Living in NYC we are accustomed to high prices, but here even a meal of 2 sandwiches and sodas ran us close to $40.The beach was beautiful, it felt like we were on our own private island. If you are a beach person, the 25 minute ferry ride might seem a pain, we really enjoyed it and found it to be relaxing.Overall, if you can get a deal like the one we got (2-for-1 on spa services, water sports, transfers and golf) and go during an off week, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. We had a very enjoyable vacation comparable or even better than ones we've had when we've stayed at places like the Four Seasons and I would come back here in a heartbeat!

<Content>Superb Resort We stayed at the Conquistador resort for 3 out of our 7 days in Puerto Rico. After reading the recent reviews, we were somewhat wary of what we had gotten ourselves into. However, our stay at the Conquistador was excellent. We were booked for a Garden View Room but were upgraded to an Ocean view. The only drawback of this room was the distance from the main hotel where the main activities and the parking lot are. The room was clean spacious and tastefully furnished. The service was great as everyone was friendly. We would without hesitation stay at this hotel again.The only drawbacks were the expensive restaurants. However, we were aware of this and rented a car and dined at local restaurants which gave us a sense of the local flavor. If you do stay here, I recommend renting a car to save money on the shuttle from the airport which is pretty expensive as well as getting cheaper food from outside. The only drawback is parking at the hotel which cost us $15 a day.

<Content>Beautiful hotel and grounds, but a theft problem It really was beautiful, and I thought the room was very satisfactory, the balcony access was lovely, and the grounds were really splendid. The jacuzzis were perfect temperature and the pools well maintained. However, our room had no safe, and I had $80 removed from my wallet. It was in my purse, an obvious place, but I didn't think much of it. We went out swimming in the morning, and I put the do not disturb placard in the card slot for the door. When I returned the placard was on the floor, and the money was gone. Management acted clueless. I guess the lesson of this is to put your cash in a safe. I was sort of disappointed by the incident because whereas it wasn't the end of the world, having anything stolen is a let-down.

<Content>Great overall experience! Just got back from the beautiful El Con. resort and had a great trip! The resort common areas are beautiful, there are plenty of places to sit and enjoy the views and the room was nice. It certainly was not Ritz Carlton caliber, but we were more interested in the outdoor facilities and the common areas than the rooms. The private island, called Palimino Island, is stunning. It was a nice treat to take a boat there and back, the sand is white and soft and the water is a bright turquiose-y blue. The pool areas are all great, with waiters looking to bring you drinks everywhere you turn. The spa is great, although some areas could use some sprucing up, the treatments were so relaxing and the aestheticians were excellent.In the evenings, the casino is a fun place to be, with fun dealers, who speak english and spanish perfectly. It was a little smokey, but I didn't really expect anything different.My biggest complaint is room service. DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT IT. The first thing we ordered was a salad, which I very explicitly explained to the english speaking person who took our order that I wanted plain. I said plain lettuce, tomato and cucumber. No onion, no dressing, nothing on it, not even oil or vinegar...really, this is important, it has to be plain. She replied that this was no problem, they call it a health salad, it has nothing on it, but she can send up dressing on the side if I want. I declined, saying I really just wanted the vegetables. 1 hour later (yes 1 FULL hour for 3 vegetables) our 2 salads arrived. They were perfect, except for one thing. They were COVERED in grated cheese, and I mean COVERED. EW. I couldn't eat it, and couldn't wash it off, and had to send it back and forget it. The next day we decided to try something easier. Fruit Loops and a grapefruit. This took OVER an hour to get to the room and the fruit loops were STALE. Then we opened the cover on the grapefruit and were happy to see exectly what we wanted, except the inside of the cover was smeared with chicken or beef fat (very greasy and brown) and the remains of someone else's meal. It was the most revolting sight over my fresh crisp grapefruit. Once again, we had to send it back.They did apologize and give us credits for both meals, but if I were going to this beautiful resort again, I would avoid room service altogether. After that display, who knows how clean the kitchen itself could actually be.All in all, this was a great vacation, in a great place, where you feel seperate from the rest of the world.

<Content>Great for Families but poor-standard service The night before I left for my trip I came across this Web site and read a lot of very negative reviews. After I checked weather and saw a lot of rain forecasted, I braced myself for a bummer of a vacation. Thankfully, that was not the case.When the plane landed we were greeted promptly and courteously by the hotel shuttle bus and were taken to the hotel. The ride wasn't bad and there were plenty of cold drinks on board.The entrance to the hotel grounds are beautiful and the golf course is absolutely lush. The lobby was clean, inviting and tropical and we checked in with no problems.Like many have said, we too found our room to be on the dirty side. A few lightbulbs weren't working, the shower walls were filthy and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a very long while. Although I made coffee with the complimenatary coffee pot on the first day, the grinds lay in the basket even after we checked out - not cleaned once during our stay. In terms of the room, use the safe. Someone who entered our room stole $57 that I had tucked into a zippered compartment of our suitcase. It was casino winnings from the night before - easy come, easy go. Also, our maid shut our door while cleaning our room which goes against most hotel policies. And, like others, housekeepers often didn't show up until well past four in the afternoon - after a call to housekeeping requesting service.I had my two children (6,4) with me and they spent nearly every day at the Kids Klub. The two counselors were very warm, friendly and responsible. Everyday, the kids did something like snorkling, a trip to the beach, playtime in the pool, etc. When it rained, they had x-box and playstation. They really showed my kids a great time and that was one of the best parts of the trip.Having them in camp, I got to enjoy relaxing by one of the three pools. They were all cleaned and well maintained but the kiddie pool and cliffside jaccuzzis looked murky and in need of cleaning. One day it rained and the hotel didn't offer towels between 12 and 4. The restaurant food was fair to good but very, very pricey. The cheapest entrees I noticed were $28. We did enjoy our dinner at Stingrays and I'd recommend the Tilapia dish.It rained two days we were there and I got to use the Golden Door Spa facilities and everything was great. I enjoyed the clean healthclub and thought it was one of the better hotel fitness facilities I've been to.The hotel is under new management and there was a lot of talk about the improvements they plan to make. One of the waiters told me that December - May is really the height of their season and when you can expect the most traffic and activity. He did say during that time there is a lot of fighting for lounges, towels, service,etc.I'd go back but I'd like to see some improvements in the room care and cleanliness at a minimum.

<Content>loved it! Great room, great views, beautiful escape! My husband and I had the best time here. Yes, the rooms are not brand new, but they are spacious and the resort has a lot to offer. We very much enjoyed the jacuzzis overlooking the ocean, palomino island and the absolutely stunning grounds. It was a truly gorgeous peice of property. We played golf, and the staff was very friendly. The worst aspect about this hotel are the outrageous food prices. But there are alternatives near the hotel if you have a rental car. If you want a few days of rest and relaxation, this is a great option. If you are wanting an authentic experience, this is not the place. But when my husband and I went looking for something authentically puerto rican, we always felt ill at ease. The fitness room, with floor to ceiling windows (the free one) is a very relaxing and pleasant work out. Overall we were not sure we would like this place, but ended up being very pleasantly surprised. We would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>Fantastic IF you have a rental car My wife, daughter (13), son (11) and I stayed November 21-25, 2005. Booked the Our getaways by request package through the hotel's own web site. It was a great deal: 4th night free, and 2nd room at half price; also buy-one-get-one-free spa treatments, golf, tennis, and water sports. I was happily surprised that they met my request for connecting non-smoking rooms, one with king and other with doubles (so the kids could have their own room).Yes, the food is over-priced and of so-so quality (this is common at most mega-resorts, not just El Conquistador), so you have 2 choices:1). go in knowing this, budget for it, and enjoy this fabulous resort anyway;2). do what we did: rent a car, and get supplies at one of the many local supermarkets. The rooms have fridges, so you can keep breakfast and lunch foods in the room, then take your car into town for dinner. Use the in-room coffee maker to heat water and have oatmeal in your coffee cup.Our favorite Fajardo restaurants: Edy's seafood (humble establishment - very good, reasonably-priced) and the Metropole (very nice, good value - try the Festival Cubana!). For a cheap meal, get take-out and have dinner on your balcony - you probably will have a better view than any restaurant. Ask the concierge for directions to the bakery in town that serves breakfast (I can't remember the name) - the 4 of us had a very nice breakfast there for under $20.The public spaces are stunning and in pretty good repair. The rooms are showing their age - I could list a dozen little problems, but they are minor compared with all that is great about this resort.Palomino island is wonderful. We sailed - preferring the Hobie Cat over the Sunfish, and jet-skied. We found the staff and the guests to be quite friendly. Three of us started a volleyball game, and within 10 minutes five other folks asked to join in, and we had a great time playing 4-on-4. Yes you are a captive audience so again, the prices are high. But it's all about attitude: we just mentally budgeted $100 for over-paying on drinks and food - in the end, we didn't even spend that much, so we ended up ahead of the game. The spa is very nice and the treatments are reasonably priced. One point of confusion is that they have one policy that you must be at least 18. Yet they offer a teen special with a minimum age of 14. Well, my daughter took the special and loved it.The price list on your in-room phone says that local calls are a dollar or two, but be aware that calls to a cell phone can be expensive. We made one call to a local number that turned out to be a cell phone - we were charged $26.00! (The front desk reversed it.)The hotel is very convenient to the El Yunke rain forest, which is a must-see. The trails are easy to navigate for anyone in reasonable shape. After a strenuous hike, go down to the falls - it's an easy 15-minute walk down a paved trail, and you can jump into the stream, and even stand right under the waterfall - fantastic!The bioluminescent tour is nice. As you'd expect, the hotel's tour company costs twice as much as the in-town companies. So again, we took the rental car into town and went with a company called Yokahu - they were fine.We rented with Budget, but there may be some advantage to going with Avis, since there's an Avis office right in the resort. Self-parking is $15/day. We did get lost a couple times driving in Puerto Rico - but it's not much different than driving in Boston. Nearly everyone speaks at least some English, so getting directions was easy. Biggest complaint is that slow drivers like to putt in the left lanes, so there's a lot of lane switching. In summary, if you can book a package deal or some other discount, get a rental car, and don't sweat the small stuff, you'll love the El Conquistador.

<Content>"no photos here....just the facts..." Okay. Where do I begin? My wife and I went to the el conquistador from Nov 17 - 21. We flew on Spririt airlines. It's the only direct service to San Jaun PR from FL. I highly recommend using them. No frills, but very reasonable service and price for the flight. Many of the reviews we read before going were mixed as noted in most other peoples comments. It can make choosing el conquistador difficult. One must remember that your not in America when traveling to PR or elsewhere. I never get those who complain about visiting other countries. They travel abroad and then want it to be just like America. My advice for these types, a bit uptight, finicky, and need perfection, you might want to stay home and vacation in FL. PR is American owned, no passport needed is needed. There is no language barrier, most speak excellent english.We went on the getaway package. Buy one spa service and get the second free, as well as water stuff. Only negative to it. You're only allowed one servie per day under the special buy one, get one. No big deal, we just scheduled one service per day :-). We took the el conquistador bus from the airport. No reservations needed. Just get your luggage and walk to the bus area outside. You can't miss the bus, there is writing all over it with el conquistador logos. It's a bit of a walk and $32.00 per person each way. Something no one told us about. As expected, an hour bus ride to the hotel. It's NOT 1/2 hour as they may tell you. The resort is spectacular! We had been upgraded to a full ocean view with a walk out balcony. Incredibly beautiful views. We were in Las Vistas part. A very good location. Close wlaking to spa and casino and restraunts. I heard Las Brisas section is very nice also. Only some rooms have a walk-out balcony, others just a railing from preventing you from falling out. I think the confusion from all the different hotel ratings comes from the room. If your going to look at the room as most important part of your trip and rating this hotel, that's real important to you, this would be a three star room/hotel. It was older, but clean. My wife and I find that the views are important for romance, the service, beach, food, and drinks. In which case this is a five star resort. The food and service are excellent! If money is not five star french rest. was awesome. There is plenty to do for activites if you're into that. We prefer to lay back and relax. One review I read said you were not experiencing the PR culture at the resort. As in many places around the world, you're not. It is secluded, but they do have van trips into San Jaun and cabs if you're into that.The spa was fabulous. Service awesome. We highly recommend the spa! We liked the boat ride to the beach - 20 min - no additional cost. Beach and drinks were awesome. My wife says I'm rambling on, but my last comments are regarding the price. I wish this resort were all-inclusive. It's not. I figure we spent an additional $600 - $800 here over the four days, rather than an all-inclusive resort. The drinks are $8.00 each. Morning breakfast is $50.00 for two. Dinner at any place is $80 - $120 for two. We figured we spent about $25 for lunch because we always split a snack. It'll vary on what you drink. We had three drinks each while on the beach. Probably another two or three thru the day and night. We're not real big drinkers. If you are, it could get expensive.Bottomline, yes it's expensive, it's a wonderful resort. If you're worried about saving money, look for an all-inclusive. I hope this has helped someone. A2 out.

<Content>Birthday on the beach I wasn't sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews on here. My husband and I stayed at the resort for 4 days in November and we really liked it.First, it is not a budget place to stay--the rooms, food, etc. are expensive. But we ate well and at a reasonable cost by avoiding the restaurants in the main part of the hotel: we ate at the more casual places on-site and the prices were about what we would pay back home in NYC. (Same with cocktails.) The food of Puerto Rico was not represented at any of of the restaurants, which I thought was a shame. And I'd definitely recommend skipping the breakfast buffet--it's really way overpriced unless you're a big eater.We had a room with a full ocean view and it was big, with a nice bathroom and balcony. Cleaned every day, everything was in very good condition. The staff were very pleasant throughout our stay, whether they were cleaning staff or the concierge. They helped us book a nighttime kayak trip to a nearby bioluminescent bay (this was a fun trip and I'd recommend it to anyone).The pools and the beach were fantastic. I can't say enough good things about them. The fitness center was good, but not deluxe (we just used the free one and not the one associated with the spa, which costs $, and which is probably deluxe). As another reviewer mentioned, you shouldn't stay here if you're hoping to see the real Puerto Rico. It's definitely a resort where you're meant to stay put the whole time. But if that's what you're looking for, you can't go wrong here.

<Content>Nice but... Let me start by saying that my sister and I won our trip to the El Conquistador from Harper's Bazaar magazine, so other than gratuities at the spa and on our meals, we didn't pay for anything, except the horse back riding we did on Paolmino Island and the optional excursions to the Rain Forest (my sister) and Old San Juan (me). We had read the reviews here before we went, so we weren't expecting much in terms of service,but we were pleasantly surprised to find that the resort was virtually empty the first 3-4 days we were there, ensuring that we received plenty of attention. I will mention, however, that we noticed a distinct difference in the quality of service once the hotel began to fill up towards the end of our stay. For example, our room wasn't cleaned until after 4:00 PM on our last full day there, where it had been serviced by noon at the latest every other day. We were surprised by this, since the hotel was still certainly far less than full, so I can only imagine what it would be like during busy season.We stayed in Las Casitas, the supposed luxury part of the resort, and while our suite was certainly spacious, the furnishings and the mattress were nothing exciting, and I've certainly experienced better in much less expensive accomodations at other resorts and hotels (I travel several times per year on business).Also, beware of the in-room movie system: Once you start a film, there is no way to pause or rewind it. I didn't discover this until after I had ordered (because that's when the message comes up on the screen) and I wasn't expecting it, because every other hotel I've stayed in recently with an in-room movie system has the same control options you would have if you were watching a moie on your VCR at home.As for the food, it's quality was better than I expected, in light of the poor reviews here. However, given the incredibly high prices, I don't know that I would have eaten dinner at the resort more than once if I was paying for it myself. My sister and I especially enjoyed both Le Bistro and Isabellas. Note: If you decide to go to Palomino Island, bring snacks or something to have for lunch, because a chicken sandwich, a burger, and one Mai Tai cost us $50! I can see the point of paying more for gourmet food in attractive surroundings, but for a burger at a plastic table, $50 is over the top.The spa was fabulous and (relatively) reasonably priced. I had 3 treatments, and they were all wonderful: Hydrotherapy, the Golden Door massage, and a Pineapple Body Polish. None more than $115. The therapists were skilled and friendly. Go, if you get the chance. Finally, about the office staff and our butler at Casitas, no one could figure out exactly what was covered by our travel award certificate, despite several emails before we arrived and numerous conversations afterwards (although everything did work out fine in the end). We also had to call to more than once to request bath amenities, coffee supplies, and a grocery list (which we found was useless, because it had no prices listed and they won't buy any beverages for you). Oh, and the Infinity Pool: It really is as magical as they say it is. If you're not staying in Casitas, still try to sneak over and see it. But even if you can't, the free scenery and views from all around the grounds are still gorgeous. And the singing frogs at night were a magical experience.

<Content>It's a bad as they say! We just returned from staying here four nights for a convention. The majority of what has been written about this hotel is true. Our first room was a disaster: 1st floor over a service road with trucks doing landscaping, delivery, etc. Room very tired  worn, no key for the safe, missing lightbulbs in 3 of the lamps so this already dark room was like a pit. Room was fairly clean but with a musty smell. To the hotel's credit, they sent someone fairly promptly to fix the problems. We asked to change rooms the next day  the woman at the front desk was very pleasant, understanding  helpful They moved us to a higher floor on the opposite wing. It was just as run-down looking but much brighter  everything worked. Be aware: even though this was the wing off the front of the building, there is still a long walk to get to the main bulding for meetings, restaurants, etc. Try not to leave anything in your room. The spa is excellent-enjoyed several services there. There is an excellent fitness center in the spa but it costs $25 per day to use if you're not having a treatment. The hotel's fitness center(free) is very small but has sufficient equipment, It's down the hill so you need to take the funiclar to get there. In fact, getting anywhere in this hotel requires lots of walking or elevator/funicular combination. Not a good choice for anyone with mobility problems. But the worst part of the experience was how expensive everything is! I live near New York City  am used to high restaurant prices but this was outrageous! All the restaurants are horribly overpriced  the food is mediocre at best, $28.95 for pasta at Othello's for example. I wouldn't mind paying if the food was outstanding but it's not. Breakfast in the Cafe Caribe was horrible. The buffet breakfast in the retaurant is $22 but they don't tell you that you can have just the cold buffet for $17 or that you can order a la carte. An earlier review mentioned the nickle  diming  it certainly is true. However, I was able to pay cash for coffee at David's Cookies  in the shop. You are charged a $24.95 per day Resort Tarriff  a $24.95 per day Resort Tax on top of your room rate plus $3.00 for maid service. Palomino Island is beautiful  well equipped but a huge pain to get there. On a positive note, we found the staff to be helpful  for the most part friendly. The grounds are gorgeous  the views are lovely. The Blackstone Group has bought the hotel but they have a huge task ahead to make it into a 4 or 5 star property. For a convention it was tolerable, but I would never, ever stay here on my own.

<Content>We had a fabulous time!! Several weeks before we were to be guests at the El Conquistador Resort, we read reviews online and became anxious that we were making a mistake. My husband and I were accompanying our children and grandchildren on a four-day vacation and had high hopes of a clean and beautiful setting with child-friendly swimming facilities, a relaxing spa, and a lovely golf course. We were discouraged by the reviews that rated cleanliness, personnel, and access to the beach as troublesome. I cannot believe that we came close to cancelling our reservations and looking for an alternative resort, because we could not have been more delighted with what we experienced!! The El Conquistador was glorious!!! It was picturesque, comfortable, clean, pleasant, accommodating, expansive, and the food was great! We expected the prices to reflect this caliber of resort but were quite pleased with the Family Getaway Package. We were NOT nickeled and dimed to death and would go back in a heartbeat!! We highly recommend it to others. What a memorable and fantastic four days!

<Content>The death of a great resort... At one point in time, this probably was thee place to go, but not anymore. The views, the landscaping as you drive up, the fountains, and layout of this resort are gorgeous- BUT it doesnt make up for the serious flaws. It is truly a shame that the staff and management have this beautiful establishment but are letting it decay before their eyes.Flaws:-OVERpriced food (22$ chicken and cashew nuts at Blossoms; 8$ for fried plantains - 4 pieces- plaintains sell 4 for a dollar down the street so they just made 7.87 on you; 15$ fruit platter; steaks run over 35$) -Jaccuzzi's dirty, chipped and cracked; only half full with luke cold water (same temp as the pool); there were dozens of centipedes in one of them-front desk staff- snooty and rude; he made me feel cheap by saying very loudy in front of others that I get less-of-a-room b/c I booked on orbitz- he also continuously called me by my last name only even though I corrected him to say miss or call me by my first; he did not instruct me how to get to the room;-NO activities when it rained. No shows, or coordinated activities; the only pool table we found was in the cigar bar; my friend and i resorted to playing air hockey in the very cramped children's game room- even the casino was small and pricey since they no longer take coins- you end up spending more than you want to;-bed was very uncomfortable;- a/c went out during the storm and didn't go back on- they're response was that it's the tropics, this happens-the tours they offer are extremely overpriced- El Yunque is free; horseback riding is 20$ half a day down the road; old san juan is an hour drive (cheaper to rent the car for the day and drive there) This is a resort, a place to re-sort and not worry about anything; not think just do- and this wasn't the case. The conceriege was the only helpful person around (she pointed me to my room and gave me maps to el yunque and san juan). I strongly urge you to not choose this hotel, and if you did change it. We stayed when it rained a great deal so it is possible that I'm jaded but still their should be more for your money. If you do go here, I urge you to rent your own car; bring your own games/activities; eat out often (el mason down the street is great for breakfast and lunch; the loquitto kiosks are good for lunch and dinner; we found a nice restaurant in don pepe on 3 west and el ranchero); if you drink- bring it in. the gas station on the corner of avenue conquistador and rt. 3 sells beers, liquor and wine (not a huge selection though) or buy it in the duty free shop at the airport. Don't be shy or lazy in asking for a room change if there is a problem. Overall, I wouldn't suggest staying there, there are dozens of other beautiful hotels in condado, old san juan, isla verde for much less money.

<Content>What a relaxing Trip!! Like many others, I read all of the horrible reviews for this resort and I was really nervous about our trip. My husband and I went to this resort for our second honeymoon. We couldn't have asked for anything nicer. The one huge WARNING I would give people is that they do not recommend using cash on this resort. Everything is charged to your account unless you ask to pay cash but they never have any on hand and if you don't have exact change you will wait forever for change. The account thing is VERY convenient but if not careful it can really add up quick, so if you plan on paying with cash then remember to bring a lot of change. We stayed in The Casitas and they were fabulous! The villas are gorgeous and the service was spectacular. You also recieve a few perks like free contintenal breakfast, free internet service and a 24 hr butler at your beck and call. The infinity pool at The Casitas was the best one by far. It was overlooking the water on the cliff and the view was breath taking. You also have a full kitchen and if you have the oppoitunity to shop and keep stuff to eat and drink, this would really cut back on cost. The one thing that really stands out in our mind was when we were getting ready to check out, it was pouring rain. We called our butler and he brought us the bill to our villa, carried out our bags to the shuttle and left an open umbrellas at our doorstep for us when we were ready to go. The restaurants are good but they were expensive. I would compare the prices to amusement park prices. The drinks were what we found to be most costly. Two drinks and a tip would cost us a twenty spot. A few rounds definitely added up. We liked the Ballyhoo bar  grill at the marina. They were friendly, food was good and they had a TV. Definelty go to the burger  shakes grill by the pool. Their menu was interesting. Try the sloppy joe wrap! We had dinner at one of the dress code restaurants called Isabellas. This was a steak/seafood restaurant that was very good but again very pricey. Everything is a la carte and the side dishes are big so you can share one of those. After dinner we went over to Drake's cigar lounge. There is a pool table, couches and after dinner drinks. That was my husbands favorite.Palomina Island is everything they say...gorgeous! When I think of the Carribean, this is what I picture, palm trees, horseback riding on the beach, crystal blue water, white sand and tiki huts. Try the Dirty Banana drink, it is very yummy! The only two complaints that we had was that we wanted to be away and relax and everyone at that resort had constant cell phones ringing that drove us nuts and the elevators did breakdown a lot, but in the big realm of things it was better for us to walk. Otherwise everything was very enjoyable, but I feel our opinion may be different than those that stayed in the hotel because that's where most of the complaints came from, so we definitely recommend The Casitas.

<Content>A wonderful trip with a 3 yr. old , but all reviews true! Well I had changed my resort from the Dorado to the Conquistador and I am glad I did because it was great for my 3 yr old, but before I get into the kid aspect I will give you my most honest opinions.The Conquistador is no longer a Wyndham hotel its now owned by a new company (Blackstone Group I think its called) so I was a little concerned upon starting our vacation, but there was no way to know that it had changed especially since everything still said Wyndham on itand they did honor our wyndham by request card! The transfer provided from the hotel was great clean and efficient , it was a 45- to an hour drive to resort ,but a pleasant drive. When we arrived at the hotel we were checked in and taken to our room. This is the part of the review that rings true about the staff issues.We were taken to our room down by the marina. The bellman took us the back way to our room ,I was mortified he took us the way of the help all I kept thinking was what kind of resort is this no flowers , no palm trees it was horrible. When we reached our room there was MOLD everywhere the paint peeling in the bathroom and dust caked on the vents,All I could think was what kind of hole did I pick for us to vacation in! the bellman then went to show me the armoire and the DOOR FELL OFF! The bellman then skooted off as if everything was fine  we didn't even matter and this was a normal hotel room (mind you this was the deluxe oceanview)I immediatley called the front desk upset and said this was not ok. Now I understand that I am on island time but I had a hungry and tired husband  child well anyway 45 minutes later they moved us to a much, much nicer room that was clean and really nice with a great view. I have to be honest the newer staff were alot more accomodating and helpful than more senior employees . I think the only other big issue I had was that no one came to take away old roomservice for almost 48hrs trays just sat with left overs and soon enough a glass was smashed in front of our room. Its almost as if roomservice clean up had no importance throughout the marina area its strange!but I noticed people started putting their trays by the icemachines just to get it away from thier doors! but anyway besides that we had an incredible time. The food was pricey but very good, we were disappointed that there was mexican food but not puerto rican. The hotel itself is large and if you are physically limited (bad back etc.) I'd rethink it. The views were spectacular the overall cleanliness was very good in the resturants and bathrooms. The little shops were great to shop in! The art work and sculptures in the hotel were beautiful.The outdoor cafes were relaxing and lovely! Now onto my favorite part Palomino Island.I loved it ,we all loved it was like a getaway each day within your vacation.The ride to the island was maybe 10 min. and it was a beautiful ride. Nothing could be more beautiful!It was just perfect for us snorkeling off the beach and the water was so calm my little one could just wade in it without any problem. the water was so clear that you could watch the fish swim around you ,my 3 year old loved it! It was a very child friendly beach!!! All of the restaurants had chocolate milk and kids meals so that was great and the waiters at the Cafe Caribe were great with my child ,very friendly and quick great service. The breakfast buffet at la Brisa was great and it only ran us $44 before the tip. I have to say all of the waitstaff we encountered were very good! Funicular was a blast for my my child , it worked great and was very clean. We rented a car one day!I would not recommend it the roads are lawless until you get to the highway and that is if you can find the highway there are no signs,not stop signs, no yield signs and no traffic lights it was crazy and we gave up rather quickly especially once we ended up in the town of Fajardo.Leave driving to savy travelers. The pools were located nearby to all the different areas they were treated every morning and always clean. We would definatly go back to this resort because it was a great safe place for a little one and incredibly relaxing. The front desk was very accomodating as were the waitstaff,I think that just as in any hotel some people love their jobs more than others!! If you want a nice quiet getaway this is the place to go!!!

<Content>Bad experience We stayed at the Wyndham for a convention. We did not book the normal hotel, we book the las casitas. In spanish it means little house. The casita itself was nice but the service was horrible. We were supposed to have a butler on call 24 hours a day. Out of 7 days, we saw him upon arrival and once by the pool. He gave us his cell phone number, but conviently never answered, and I don't mean unreasonable hours, I am talking 2pm. We were told that if we got our grocery list in by 12pm we would get our groceries the same day. We wrote a grocery list at 9am. My sister called and told them she would bring it down, she was told that someone would come to get it. I went to some meetings and came backat 2pm, the list was never picked up. I called and was told we would still get our groceries the same day. Needless to say we got our groceries 2 days later with no explanation as to why items were missing.The hotel food is expensive and horrible. I spent $40 on a seafood pasta that I only ate 2 bites of. From that point on we cooked our own hamburgers and hotdogs. The establishment is so far away from everything a cab ride to the closest restaurants runs you about $20-$40 for a 15 minute ride. They have one club in the hotel. It is tiny and the music is not pleasant. This resort is designed for those who want to stay beside the pool and at the hotel 24/7. Once at the hotel you are stuck, because the closest city is San Juan and it an hour away(just imagine the price.If you are young and active this is not the place for you. If you are a food lover, this is not the place for you.On the last day, we were told to call someone to get our luggage 15 minutes before our departure time. The las casitas are not in good walking vicinity of the main hotel which means you need a bellman to help with your luggage. I called 1 hour and 15 minutes before our check out time. After waiting an hour we started lugging our luggage in the hot sun to the hotel. After about 5 minutes we were helped. We missed the main shuttle to the airport and had to plead to get on a secondary shuttle. The airport is an hour away, and we almost missed our flight because of their tardiness. I paid way to much for the las casitas for the service to be so bad. Avoid this place unless you want to stay on the hotel grounds with nothing to do except the beach and the casino and if you don't care about good food.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised! After reading recent reviews, I was reluctant to continue my vacation at this resort. We found the staff to be pleasant and accomodating. The rooms were clean. The resort is so large, I only saw a portion of it and was unable to go to the spa which I hear is beatiful. The funiculars function day and night and the shuttles to Palomino Island are available until 5:30 pm. The island is beatiful and relaxing - your own paradise. The only complaint I would have is the overpriced restaurants. I would suggest renting a car as the shuttle from the airport is $60 round trip per person anyway. If you rent from Avis, you can park on their lot on the resort and avoid the $10 day parking fee which should have been included in the resort taxes. You can take a day trip to both Old San Juan or the Rain Forest during the day. There are many restaurants right in town and you can stock up at the local supermarket or Walmart and keep some items for snacking the fridge in your room. I was pleasantly surprised.

<Content>A disappointment I have been to Puerto Rico and stayed in San Juan hotels on several occasions. I found these to be more luxurious than the El Conquistador.I eagerly anticipated my trip here despite the reviews. Because of a pharmaceutical convention, all guests were subjected to an hour an 45 minute check in after a non airconditioned ride arranged from the airport which, it seems I paid for twice and as of yet, have been able to resolve.Once we arrived at the check in desk, we were told that it would be at least two hours before we could check in as it was check out time and rooms would need to be cleaned. ( this was at 2pm --hotel policy says check out is at 11)We attempted to get lunch and were ignored at the outdoor cafe and then went to Cafe Caribe where the hostess wipe the menus off with a rag and on to the floor. So while I ate my 40 lunch consisting of a cheeseburger and fries and kids chicken fingers I got enjoy looking at someone else's tomatoes and lettuce on the floor. Finally our room was ready. The accomodations at Las Olas appeared pleasant. However, as we were unpacking hair appeared on the floor near the refrigerator. (we were women and children traveling). The hair was also noted on the shower stall walls and on the bathroom floor. In addition , it was spotted in folded towels. I have never been so repulsed.Never once did we walk in our room our shower without shoes after that. Clearly, the room had not been vacuumed or cleaned after the last guest left. Not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.Other complaints were the ambivalence of the staff. I would not say they were rude, basically they ignored or humored you. Called for more towels, and they never came. Asked where I could buy bandaids and was assured security would bring them right down and never cameFinally the unclean pools and lack of policies at the pools needs improvement. We were swimming at the pool one evening when a guest allowed her infant to swim diaperless in the pool. No rules posted prohibiting this but we got out and did not return.Overall the scenery is astounding and Palamino island is nice but the facility caters to large groups and is indifferent to the individual. You can definitely tell staff considers it just to be a job. Additionally, the facility is filthy, overpriced and offers little to do.

<Content>What an AWESOME experience! We had a wonderful time at this resort. Like many other of the guests on this site, I was expecting a bit of a rundown place or a property of neglect upon check in. Mind you, I travel a lot and have seen my share of reputable establishments as well as places no better than shanty towns. This by far is one of the grandest and the nicest resorts I've been to. I am hard pressed to suggest anything that needs improvement. The service was excellent, the facilities very well-maintained and the food was great. We landed in SJC on a Sunday evening close to 11 pm. We took the airport shuttle (not complimentary but totally worth it) to the resort and were pleasantly surprised and greatly relieved to partake in the complimentary Bacardi Rum and Coke cocktails available on the bus. Since we were the only ones on the shuttle, we had the driver's undivided attention. We were able to ask him all sorts of questions about the resort, the island, and the people. When we arrived, the bell hop was efficient in collecting our bags and waiting while we checked in. At the front desk, I asked if the hotel was sold out for that particular week. When she said no, I asked if it would be possible to be upgraded to an ocean view room. She readily agreed and put us in a room on the fifth floor of the La Vistas wing. The ocean view was breathtaking. We could see Vieques Island and the Wyndham's private island, Palomino. All I could think about as I was drifting off to sleep was how spectacular the view would be when the sun rose. The next morning, after picking up some coffee and pastries from David's coffee (good enough even for coffee snobs) we had breakfast on our balcony and counted our blessings. On our first day we toured the resort to check out what facilities were available. We took the ferry over to Palomino Island and lay underneath one of the beach huts for a quick nap. The last ferry shuttles you back to the resort at 4:30 pm. It's too bad that they don't extend Palomino's hours into the night. It has the potential to be a popping hot spot if given the chance.We rented a car from the resort (Avis is on site) and found the local strip mall. There was a Wal Mart, a Walgreens, McDonalds, Pueblo (grocery store) and even a Payless Shoe Source. I had seen reviews about Fajardo itself and that there are certain areas that would make you step on the gas pedal. We drove through Fajardo Centro at night and everyone was nothing but friendly. We also drove through Luquillo at night and found the same thing. Looks can be deceiving and I think if you look for trouble, eventually, you will find it. We went to the local bars and hung out there at night. It was just my boyfriend and I; and I was probably the only Asian in Fajardo and maybe only one of three on the entire island. One El Conquistador drawback, the nightlife is lacking. The casino is a happening place on the weekends, and Casablanca's has good music, but no one is there to enjoy it. So, we did the next best thing, we hung out with the locals. Our favorite hot spots: El Rancho and the Brass Cactus, both in Luquillo. One night we drove to Old San Juan and went bar/club hopping but the drive back was torture because it was real late and you just wanted to be home. Musts in PR: El Yunque Rainforst, Luquillo (food kiosks), Playa Azul or Costa Azul (in Luquillo), Old San Juan, Plaza Las Americas Shopping Center, and the Bacardi Factory (even though you will find that Don Q rum tastes SOOOOO much better). Overall, we would come to the resort again. Definitely felt that one week was just enough to figure your way around and get into the swing of things. If you can do two weeks, you're better off.

<Content>Room for improvement but overall great stay- RENT A CAR! This is our second stay at El Conquistador. I have seen many negative reviews of the hotel and I am surprised. I think the hotel definately can make improvements but overall, it is aboove average.WYNDHAM BY REQUEST MEMBER- If you are planning on staying here, enroll in this program. It's free and you get to set some preferences on your room and get a complimentary snack and beverage at arrival.ARRIVAL FROM AIRPORT- The hotel provides a shuttle, we rented a car at the airport. It is very easy to get to the hotel and it is only about a 45 minute ride. You get there via a major road (rpute 3) with MANY shops and restauratns. It's a good opportunity to scope out the area for places to eat since it is very expensive to eat at the resort.CAR RENTAL- Highly recommend. Yes, expect to pay $10/day for self park or $15/day for valet (we did this) but the fact that you are able to got out to eat and get snacks at Walmart instead of eating at the resort makes up for the cost.ROOM- We were happy with our rooms. We reserved run of the house and so were a bit nervous about where we would be assigned. The Wyndham by request members benefit allows you to select the type of floor you want to stay in. We selected higher ground floor and so we got the top- floor #6 on the Vistas wing off the main lobby. Absolutely stunning! We had room #4627 overlooking the cliff,, palomino island, Las Casitas and the ocean. Wonderful breeze and breathtaking sunrises. My parents were accross from us in #4639, also breathtaking views of the golf course, mountains and El Yunque RAinforest, stunning sunsets and beautiful at night. The rooms were cleaner than when we stayed the first time. Pleasantly surprised with the size, separate toilet area, huge closet in bathroom, vanity and sink and tub. Our room had 2 double beds, with a table and desk and patio also with table overlooking the ocean. Room had snack bar and an additional refrigereator in the bathroom. THIS IS WHERE RENTING A CAR COMES IN HANDY! There is a Walmart and Walgreens about a 10 minute ride from the hotel. We stocked up on soda and snacks and packed them in our fridge. Prices are outrageous at the resort. If you are on a budget, recommend you go out on your own to eat and also sightseeing.SERVICE- Mixed emotions about this one. Very slow pace in Puerto Rico, prepare to wait! We called housekeeping for towels and have yet to get them. Expect to wait 5-15 minutes for valet. Keep in mind we went in September which is slow season. Called the concierge desk, phone rang and rang, no one ever answered. Tried to rent a movie, system was down and had to call the front desk after 3 attempts and about 10 minutes later we got through. Really, not efficient service. We arrived early and waited in line to check in- we were told to come back to get the keys which is fine but we had to wait in line again. Had some money to change and were told they could only change $50.00 for us. The Bell services is great, seems this is the only area in the hotel that is efficient and quick. Overall, everyone is pleasant. RESTAURANTS- Cafe Caribe is affordable and they are the only ones to offer authentic Puerto Rican food. Dinner for 3 including something to drink was $66.00 with the tip. David's Cookies is a good place to get snacks and coffee. Ordered room service on one day, delivery was pretty quick and the burger was very good. Paid $15.00 for a burger and fries. For breakfast, we did not want to pay $20/person for the buffet (we did last time and were dissapointed; flies on the food). So we went to David's and got a huge croissant, ham and cheese sandwich for $3.75, this was very reasonable for us. The rest of the time we went out to eat. Metropol Restaurant at the plaza offers great Cuban food. ANCHOR'S INN is a must- owner Pedro is a great guy. We go here whenever we stay in PR. To get here, leave the hotel and at the main entrance/exit take a left. Follow the road for about 1/2 a mile, Anchor's inn will be on your right side. The Camarones al Ajillo or shrimp scampi is very tasty. The best entree was the Chillo (Red Snapper) cooked to your liking, we had it fried. Remember, food is prepared fresh so there will be a wait. For breakfast there is also the local panaderias or bakeries. For $7.00 four of us bought, sandwiches a la plancha (ham and cheese on bread flattened on the grill; like panini), a loaf of bread and butter, 4 coffees and 2 juices. YOU WILL NOT GO HUNGY IN PR- there is food everywhere and vendors line up the streets. Luquillo Beach, right after El Yunque has the famous Kioskos (Kiosks that line up the beach). Here for $15.00 4 of us ate chicken on the grill, fried plantain, 2 empanadillas, green bananas, and drinks.PALOMINO- This is the hotels private island. We cold have stayed here all week. It is very relaxing and convenient. Only about a 25 minute boat ride from the hotel. There is a restaurant that offers food and drink. Lunch for 4 was $66 for chicken tenders, fish and 2 chicken sandwiches- very different from our lunch at Luquillo beach, A beer and 3 pina coladas totaled $26.00. Two years ago when we went we bought a cooler at Walmart and packed in drinks and snacks. The resort seems to be more money hungry and now prohibit coolers. We still packed snacks and warm soda and water in our back packs and asked for ice at the restaurant. BRING YOUR WATER/ROCK SHOES. Some of the beach areas are rocky.SIGHTSEEING- Do it on your own! We were shocked to see that the hotel charges about $65.00 for the El Yunque rainforest excursion. We went there for free. Just drive down route 3 for about 20-25 minutes and drive through the forest. We went to Viequez for a day. The ferry leaves the Fajardo marina which is about 10 minutes from the hotel at 9:30 (there are other schedules but if you want to spend time on the bech, you have to get there early in order not to miss the ferry back; the last one leaves Viequez at 6:00 pm). Tickets are only $2.00 per person, ferries are big with some areas airconditioned. Takes about 1 1/2 to get to Viequez. When you dock there will be taxies waiting for you. Ask for Fernando from El Ardillo Fast Driving. Nice guy with lots of knowledge of the island. Showed us 2 beaches so we could pick which one we wanted to stay in. We were pressed for time so we went to the only beach with public toilets and showers and a small snack bar. Fernando asked us for a pick up time and came and picked us up. We went to Sun Bay beach or as they know it SOMBE; half moon beach lined with palm trees and wild horses. WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE! The water is rougher than Luquillo and definately Palomino and get's deep only after a few feet so stay close to shore as there are no life guards and in our case, no one around. Viequez is very relaxing and the peopl are very laid back. Very small and everyone know each other. Economy is suffering because of the removal of the US Naval base. You can also get to Viequezs via a car Ferry that takes about 2 hours.ADVICE- If you can, check the internet for hours of operations on places you want to visit. Many places are closed on Monday and Tuesdays like Luquillo beach. Remember thought that unlike the US, all beaches in PR are public it's just a matter of whether you can get in. We went to Luqillo on Monday the gate was closed but we parked where the Kiosks are and just walked down the beach. Some places I tried calling nver answered there phones and some published schedules had changes. Just ask the locals. BUY PUERTO RICO by Lonely Planet tour book, is the most comprehensive I have seen and we have found places that even us as Puerto Ricans did not know about.

<Content>A Beautiful Getaway I read all the reviews about rude staff, expensive meals and marginal accommedations. My wife and I experienced nothing but rest, relaxation and good food. Not once did we come in contact with any member of the staff that were rude or impolite. Service was top notch. Was the food expensive. It sure was but I found it no more expensive than the trips I've taken to DisneyWorld in FL. Anyone who thinks they are not going to spend serious money on food should not go to first class resorts. We paid $50 every morning on breakfast. Was it worth it? You bet! Patrons were treated to a first class resturant that offered a beautiful view of the water no matter where you sat. The tables were covered in white table cloth with good china and utensils. Anything you can imagine for breakfast was available. Gut busting omlets, fresh fruit, freshly made waffles, fantastic coffee and it was all you can eat! Dinner was equally great. We ate at the stingray cafe and at Isabella's. Both resturants rated five out of five stars in my book. Was it expensive? You bet your butt! However, seeing the look in my wife eyes as she enjoyed her dinner and fine wine was well worth the price. If you plan on eating at the better resturants be prepared to zip the numbers off your credit card. We spent $150 at the stingray and about $200 at Isabella's, including the tip. For those who do not like to spend money on pricey food I would suggest the Carribe Cafe next to the casino. They have great local food with the kind of prices you would pay at IHOP or a TGIFridays. We ate there a couple of times with no complaints. I really enjoyed the local dishes. They tasted just the way my mom made them. As a matter of fact I could have sworn my mom was in the kitchen! It was great. The room we had was clean, roomy and comfortable. The furniture was clean and recent. From my wife's point of view, the room itself was a little dated and it needed attention to detail but stuff like that don't matter to guys. Consider to that the resort has been around since when my mom was a little girl in Puerto Rico. She is in her sixties now. The room was good to go in my book. The private island was great and my wife and I had a great time. Bottom line, the place is on the expensive side but worth every cent. If you don't want to spend money on a nice vacation, don't go to the Conquistador. And just in case you are wondering, my wife and I weigh 135 and 180 respectively. :)

<Content>Beautiful Resort Beautiful resort with exquisite views and vistas. The staff was cordial and accomodating. Beware thoogh that you will be paying a pretty penny for any services. Don't even think about eating or drinking anything from the refrigerator or snack bar. It is $6.00 for a quarter of a container of pringles! If you consume any of these snacks or drinks they will happily refill it for you the next day but be aware when you check out you will be hit by a bill of a couple of hundred dollars, for what might have costed maybe $50.00 in a supermarket. My tip is go to a local supermarket and buy snacks and drinks for a fraction of the cost and put it in a second refrigerator in the bathroom. This will save you lots of money especially if you have hungry kids looking for a snack like we did.

<Content>Great place - Wonderful staff Read the reviews before I went and got a bit nervous. From check in with Alex V. who upgraded us to a fabulous room to the young man who brought our luggage - it was perfect. Every member of the staff was polite and incredibly helpful even going out of their way to help. Vivian P. at the concierge desk is a gem!In 5 days we waited only once for the funicular and the wait was under 2 minutes. Several great pools to choose from but we spent most of our time at Palimino Island. The service in both Otellos and Isabella's was outstanding and the food excellent. Buffet breakfast was good and there was plenty to eat. The staff was terrific and kept our coffee cups filled! Loved the 2 for 1 at the Golden Door Spa so much that we went twice for the Golden Door Spa Massage.Stop at the grocery store in order to save money on the booze or your Grey Goose martini at Drakes Cigar Bar is going to cost you $20.Although it was considered the rainy season the weather could not have been more beautiful.Go! Relax! Indulge! Enjoy!!!!

<Content>Dream Wedding We got married in El Conquistador in Puerto Rico on July 16, 2005. It was like living a dream! The staff, starting from the wedding coordinators, Nelly Rivera and Luis Camacho were excellent in trying to accommodate us and our guests in every way they could. The food was excellent and the weather was fantastic. We recommend any couple that is planning a destination wedding to truly consider having it at El Conquistador, you would not be disappointed!!!

<Content>Beatiful Resort that needs to work some major issues There have been enough reviews of this hotel (seemingly mostly negative) for anyone reading these posts to make their own opinion on whether they want to stay at this resort. I just wanted to add my 2 cents as I have family that regularly stays in the Casitas area of the resort and let me in on some information that any new guests should know.First, this is no longer a Wyndham property it has been bought by a company called Blackstone (I am not familiar with them at all) and the resort is going through a major transition. Please keep this in mind when making your reservations. I made my reservations for this resort back in May as an American Express promotional; through the Wyndham reservations hotline and had a difficult time with Wyndham customer service once I checked into the resort. I had reserved an oceanview room and upon check in I had a lovely view of the tennis courts, also once the luggage was delivered to the room there was white paint on one of the pieces and to put the icing on the cake I did not get the Wyndham by request amenities in the room as promised. I tried to resolve these issues with the management of the hotel but I got a frustrating run around ultimately only being able to leave a voicemail to a generic voice mail box as the resort manager could not be found. Once I ran into the brick wall of no customer service or satisfaction - I called the Wyndham 800 number directly and receieved no help and I mean nothing! I was told since the resort had been transferred to new owners only 2 days prior to my arrival they would not be able to do anything for me. This made me extremely angry since this was not communicated to me at anytime prior to arrival to this resort. Wyndham gladly took my money for these reservations (I had to put down a 2 day deposit via my credit card) and kindly said I was SOL . I will never stay at another Wyndham property because of this - I will gladly put my money towards other chains in the future.Not to bore you with the details - it all eventually worked out once security got involved to help me with my problem with the paint on my suitcase. The security manager saw how upset I was (and I was also on the phone with American Express to try to stay at another hotel) moved me to an oceanview room and cleaned up my bag - thanks again Felipe! Once I actually got a manager I even got my Wyndham by Request amenities but this was a day later.I hope that the new owners will restore this property to the glory that it once was because this truly is a lovely location for a resort.

<Content>Bioluminescent Bay Hey folks this is just some advice in reference to those of you planning to stay at the El Conquistador Hotel. If you are interested in going on the biobay tour you dont have to book it thru the hotel which charges $65. All you have to do is take the funicular down to the Marina area and walk towards the left which will lead you thru two parking lots. After passing the two lots you will find a pathway which will lead you to Las Croabas Bay, there you will find the operators which provide the tour into the biobay. You can choose from amongst them and save yourself about $20 in the process.

<Content>DISAPPOINTED! Disappointed!My family stayed at the Wyndham El Conquistador from August 2nd through August 10th.This resort COULD BE awesome (the views are spectacular); but it is poorly managed and not very well maintained!We joined Wyndham By Request which provides a welcome amenity (stale peanuts) and our package was the Family Getaways. The kids eat free off the Children鈥檚 Menu (WARNING: Not every restaurant is included and the Mexican restaurant at Las Olas had closed down)!Our room was within the Las Olas village. Everyday I had to call to ask for the bathroom to be cleaned (or cleaned again because it was still dirty). We had to take the funicular to get anywhere. At first this was cool, but after a few days it got tiresome.We went to David鈥檚 Cookies (and left); the display case had bugs flying around inside the case with cookies, pastries, etc鈥UCK!Palomino Island is nice. You MUST wear water shoes. There is coral and rocks everywhere. Also, watch out for jellyfish.Some of the pools had MOLD on the sides and ALL chairs had bird droppings.Every dining bill was wrong (overcharged for kids-eat-free, mistakes, etc)! My wife and I would check our folio on the TV every night and we would have to call for an adjustment.The gym at Las Olas and the Golden Door Spa was good and well equipped. The Marina village had a small playground and a basketball court.Our children (ages 7 and 4) went to the Kids Club a few times. They have trained/certified counselors and the kids go swimming, arts  crafts, movies, PlayStation and they get lunch.We had walked around La Casitas Village and went to the infinity edge pool a few times (beautiful and unbelievable views)! The food is good (not great). The portions are small and very overpriced. The service is horrendous! We saw a couple after 20 minutes leave because of NO service. At times, our server would disappear and I would have to go find him/her to ask for a menu, order food or to get another drink. How can La Casitas be a five diamond resort??? We ate at their French restaurant one night and our server brought the tray with our main course next to our table and had walked away! After ten minutes, I got up and 鈥渟erved鈥?our own dinner dishes. They charged us a 20% service charge for that too!This is NOT a 4 star resort (3 at best). It could be 4+, but the workers are poorly trained (service is very bad) and the property is not well maintained.Don鈥檛 use the hotel or Concierge services for sightseeing. Get info and maps from them. You can $ave money and rent a car and see the rainforest and old San Juan yourself. Also, you can walk to the town for the kayak guides to the Bio Bay. Ask for Captain Suarez if you want to take a boat instead of the 2 hour kayak tour.My family had an enjoyable vacation, but my wife and I were very disappointed with the service and cleanliness!

<Content>Don't go.. Not what it seems I should start off by saying My husband and I have 4 children and thought we were getting away to a luxurious retreat together, BOY WERE WE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The inside of the hotel was clean, I suppose that's because they didn't want you to run out right away. The outside was absolutely atrocius, the pool was dirty, the bathrooms were so smelly and disgusting I had to walk back to my room to go. Our room by the way had gum on the head board and a pack of someones cigarettes still next to the bed upon check in. Customer service was certainly lacking, don't dare ask for any help or to clean the pool. I felt like I was back in Disney World with the amount of children, I am not against them, But they were all locals getting everything for free or almost nothing on the friends and family deal. They rip you off for everything. We were going to book a trip to the bioluminecent bay it was 65.00$ a person we walked right around the corner from the hotel and got it for half the price throughthe same company and it was the same trip, the Wyndam charges double and takes there half. My husband wears a suit and tie everyday for work, there was no way he was putting pants on to eat on vacation, I could see if he a tank top or something but he had Khaki shorts and a golf shirt, but was unacceptable, yet men were wearing jeans. The whole place needs to be taken over, it has wonderful potential. Needless to say we won't be returning and from the talks we had with people there neither will anyone else.

<Content>overrated, overpriced disaster the staff in this hotel were rude and obnoxious. The food was expensive and awful. The room we were placed in was damp, moldy and our comforter on our bed had large yellow stains on it. The best choice on the island for a high scale hotel is the Westin.

<Content>Las Olas Rooms I agree that the reviews for this resort are quite scary. This resort is for relaxation! If your looking for nightlife, then check out San Juan. I stayed in the Las Olas part of the hotel, you have to take the funicular to get anywhere else but It was fine. The rooms are average, nothing special, clean, my only problem was that the sheets felt damp sometimes. The pool on our side is more relaxing, not as much kids as the other pools. Palomino Island is beautiful! Who cares about the ferry ride, which is also beautiful!!! Golden Door Spa is great. I enjoyed Isabellas and Blossoms for dinner.

<Content>Don't Do It! If you are going to Puerto Rico and have heard El Conquistador is the place to go, don't do it! Despite just some of the many issues we had with the hotel; rats in the hallways, cockroaches and gnats in the rooms, over-priced food, dirty swimming pools, strange aromas adrift in the hallways and rooms, the hour and a half wait for a ferry ride to the private island beach (the only beach nearby), the three hour $60 hotel shuttle ride from the airport to the resort (which rendered our suitcases and clothing wet), the $75 charge the hotel wanted to charge us to check out an hour late (even though they had a 50% occupancy at that point), our lost dry-cleaning (which was eventually found), and erroneous charges on the bill...The biggest concern is that the staff is, for the most part, extremely rude, shows no urgency to meet your needs, and is very inconsistent in what they tell you. A few examples: The main ATM the hotel has is in the lobby. A few folks from our party had tried to use the ATM but it was not dispensing any cash. They had asked the front desk if something was wrong with it, but got no response. After a few more tries they gave up. A day later, one of the people in our party was checking their bank account, and $500 was shown as being withdrawn at the ATM. Other folks checked and sure enough money was missing from their account as well. When folks approached the hotel front desk about this concern they were told that it wasn't their issue and it had to be addressed directly with the bank. We had taken a Dive Trip on the second day we arrived. We had a great time and three other folks in our party were convinced to take the Resort Certification and do a dive trip with the resort Dive Shop a few days later. One of the dive masters, which we hadn't had on the trip before, was completely rude, sarcastic, and impatient with the new divers, which is undoubtedly a dangerous situation. When these folks had submerged below water, things got much worse to the point that one of the people we were with had decided not to take the second dive. They were ignored and at some points felt in danger. Besides this, at one point, there was a child snorkeling without a life vest who had gone a ways to far who was having trouble breathing. Since our dive master was too busy doing her own thing, one of the people in our party had to swim out to get this child. We had called to inquire on the time the airport shuttle left the hotel for the aiport on our way home. We were told that there was a shuttle every 20 minutes. When we arrived to the lobby, we were surprised to learn that the shuttle actually leaves every hour, which put us in jeopardy of missing our flight. When I had told the person at the front desk that I was told every 20 minutes, she was very confrontative and combatitive about who I had asked and that no one would tell me that at the hotel.The issues don't stop at the trip. Good luck calling to get another copy of your detailed bill. When we called in for this invoice, we were put on hold for at least 30 minutes because no one wanted to help us with this. We had to call in again and were promised the bill within 10 minutes, to which we have yet to receive.Again, if you have heard the El Conquistador is the way to go, don't do it! Quite honestly, I would even second think going to Puerto Rico at all.

<Content>Not a 4/5 Star Report - Not Close I'll start by saying we did have a great time largely due to the company around us (we had a wedding party) and the fact that the actual location and scenary are incredible. Where the Resort falls VERY short is on facilities, service and prices.Physical Location:The resort is located on a bluff overlooking the ocean and docks at roughly a 300ft drop. The view from rooms facing the ocean are incredible. Water clarity is great and it very much looks like a page out of any Carribbean ad. The golf course could be great but it's a bit undercared for with dry patches. Palomino island is a great beach but it's a bit of a trek to get to and fro. There's a ferry (20-25mins ride each way) that is free, though I understand they used to charge for this. It takes some time if you're not an early bird due to lines. Miss a ferry and you're waiting 45mins before you board the next. Add it up and it's at least a 1/2 day event to go to the beach. Don't forget anything in your room as it won't be convenient to take a trip back.Facilities:The actual hotel is kept clean enough to look good in pictures. However that's where it stops. It seems that this resort is at the end of it's lifecycle and that significant investment is required to bring this back to it's potential as a 4 or 5 star hotel. Bathrooms show wear, many fruit flies, mosquitos and nats in rooms, mildew smell in some rooms, visible cracks in drywall and waterstains are not uncommon. Pools are in reasonably good shape but show signs of aging. Knowing it's a tropical resort, they need to take the precautions to keep pests to a minimum. For example it very common for restaurants/hotels to put a bit of clorox in drains every night to prevent bugs and is very effective. Not done here. In addition, we did see waterbugs/cockroaches in the hallway. In one instance, a guest had left their pizza in the hallway after room service - we had a chance to witness rats eating the leftovers. Don't know who to blame but that's not acceptable for any resort claiming to be a 4/5 Star destination. Also, they do need an upgrade to the Funicular (horizontal elevators that get you to sea level) need upgrading or other options, including stairs.Service:Rude across the board. From the moment we got on the shuttle (took 3.5 hrs due to some traffic and rain issue) to the casino (had horrible odds at craps table vs. Vegas). Virtually every interaction where service was subpar (which was often) there was a take it or leave it attitude. One you're there, you a captive on the resort and it seems they know it. The service issue was consistant with much of the service outside of the resort so it might just be that it's a Puerto Rico thing however a resort should be able to raise the bar within their confines to differentiate, especially at the prices they charged - which leads me to my next topic.Prices/Value:They do know you're captive. Drinks range from $6 for beer to $8 for a margarita. Dinner at the restaurants were roughly $45/entree. The gouging begins with rules such as $20 surcharge for sharing entrees. $65 for a 2 hour late check out (2PM) - $100 for a 4PM late checkout. This is inconsistant with the Island Time approach to check-in where your bags won't find you for another 2 hrs after you get off the shuttle. They should at least be consistant with how they approach these issues. It's largely ok for them to make you wait but it will cost you dearly to make them wait at all. All this with occupancy at 50% on checkout date. At the end of the day, the itemized bill they gave me at checkout was incomplete. It should $1700 of charges. My credit care is showing $4400. I waited 20 mins on hold to get a person that could help me. They reluctantly agreed to fax me the entire itemized bill and said I'd receive it in 20mins. It's been an hour and I'm still waiting by the fax machine. Btw, Internet connections are $14.95 a day - not free as advertised.Additional Features:Restaurants - Good food. Japanese steak house good but overpriced. All restaurants require slacks -but the Japanese steak house had a few pair of loaners and there was no additional charge (amazing). I was skeptical but they were nice slacks and served the need. Considering the AC in the restaurants, I can see why they require slacks ;-)Regular steak house was good as well. All the higher end restaurants actually had good service. Nice change of pace.Cafe on the main floor which we used for breakfast was overpriced and service was of the usual rude caliber. Trust me, they definitely believed they were doing you a favor. Food was acceptable but things like a fruit plate (requiring freshness) was of surprisingly horrible quality considering this is the tropics. I have better quality produce in Denver, CO.Scuba DivingVery mixed results. First day was great with a two great service-oriented dive masters from Europe. Scored high on safetey. Great quality - great local captain. This propmted us to to an all day event where our group sponsored a dive trip to Culebra Island. One Dive Master on the trip (Main land American) spoiled it. From safety to attitude, she put the entire party at odds with her. Net/net, she had an attitude and she was loose on safety. We had 3 resort certification divers with us and she actually swam away from the group she was responsible, leaving two to fend for themselves. On the second dive (which was not the originally planned site but due to her own laziness, she made a decision to dive where we had lunch) she swam with the certified divers. Two of these were on their first open water dive and one Resort Diver ended up with our group. After I repeatedly let her know that two newbies were at 500psi (you start at 3000psi), she kept swimming with no sign of moving to surface. Again at 200psi, I really had to grab her an show that they were nearly out of air. She put one on her secondary, and kept swimming without interlocking arms. This is usually done to make sure that her movement doesn't jerk regulator out of her buddy's mouth. In this case, the diver had to keep up with her. As if that wasn't enough, she jerked eradically when she saw a fish she wanted to see, nearly yanking the air out of the diver's mouth. For the other newbie diver (who was not from my party) I had to put him on my secondary and bring him up. When we got to the surface, she was the one that was pissed b/c no one told her of their air issues. I've been diving for some time and have never seen such neglegance. That was bad.Bio-Luminscent KayakingExpensive but very cool. Resort outsources this to another private company. All went well. You do need to be physically prepared to Kayak a bit through a pitch-black but calm stream to the lagoon.

<Content>Mixed review for El Conquistador I just returned from El Conquistador from a stay with 2 older children 16 and 20. Our opinions are definitely mixed. The shuttle from the airport took nearly 2 hours when we arrived and over an hour even for the 5am return shuttle and cost us $192 round trip for 3 travellers. Our room was average but conveniently located on the main part of the hotel for the pool, casino, etc. My daughter and I had to ask 4 different people before we could figure out how to get to the fitness center- an elevator plus funicula ride away. Sometimes it took 15 minutes to get the funicula back to the main hotel. It also took awhile to get to the beach- funicula ride plus water taxi that only runs every half hour. The beach is beautiful but the bottom is rocky in parts. Service is relaxed to say the least. We frequently had to ask multiple times to get things but on the other hand you can sit in the casino bar and watch the Yankee game and no one will hassle you to buy drinks. Staff are friendly but have no sense of urgency and checking in can take huge amounts of time. Overall my children and I really enjoyed the beautiful beach and pools and were very relaxed. We found the buffet breakfast the best value for the money. The food is expensive but typical of resorts and there are 16 restaurants to choose from so there is always somewhere to eat where you don't have to wait which is a plus. Overall we enjoyed our stay despite the drawbacks.

<Content>Inside Theft Ring...Stay away from the Hotel I was one of several guests staying at the Wyndham El Conquistador Casita Village for an event at the hotel. Several guest had their rooms robbed of money hidden in various, inconspicuous places. One guest had $600 taken from their LOCKED SAFE. Their key was hidden in the bottom of their suitcase. They never take all of what might be left in the room. What they take is a portion of your money - enough to question if you've spent it or inadvertently misplaced it. Several reports were filed with the police and the hotel claims to have done an investigation and found no fault with their staff and is not liable.So, in other words folks, spend thousands to stay at this hotel, walk 3 miles to get to the beach, have money stolen from your locked safe or suitcase and then be told that you should never leave money in your room! Several guest left the hotel prior to their departure date, fearful of what else could happen. PLEASE, PLEASE do yourself a favor and not waste your time vacationing at an establishment that clearly has a well-established, inside theft ring designed to place the traveler at fault!!!

<Content>Beautiful Propery I was a little nervous after reading some past reviews, but we had a great time. We had no problems regarding the funicular or the ferry to Palomino Island. I recommend joining Wyndham by Request to take advantage of their 2 for 1 offers (golf, spa treatments, etc.) As others have stated, food is very expensive. Rent a car and go outside the hotel to some local places (Lolita's for Mexican- A La Banda for seafood and steak). The golf course was amazing but bring a lot of golf balls. It get's a little easier if you play it a second time. My wife and I both enjoyed the spa. The casino was small but adequate (not too many people playing craps). On Palamino Island we used the wave-runners, which were fun and we also went horseback riding (a waste of money). The pools were also very nice and there are 3 or 4 of them to chose from. The staff was friendly and helpful our whole stay.Yes, the rooms themselves were average at best, but the overall property was beautiful and if you're looking to get away for a few days, I would recommend staying there.
