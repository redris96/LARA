<Content>Location, location We found this hotel thru a Go San Francisco online offer - 2 nights for 2, queen bed, plus two one day Go San Francisco cards. Booked over the phone. Hotel appeared to be newly renovated, very clean, friendly staff. Included continental breakfast was very basic - breads, cereal, juice, coffee/tea but got us up and going. The location at the end of Chinatown and beginning of Little Italy just off of Columbus was great for doing all of the tourist things - not far to Market St. one way, and the wharf area the other way with great restaurants close by.

<Content>Would definitely stay again We were very pleased to have found this gem in San Francisco. Not many hotels for this price have such great access to the city, great rooms (big bed and lovely bathroom), cheap parking, and friendly staff for such a good price. We didn't have much of an outlook but it was very quiet and felt safe. Located at the top of Chinatown, it's close to the variety of restaurants and bars of North Beach, and within walking distance of most of San Fran's sites. I've told lots of family and friends to stay here and we definitely will again!

<Content>Would definitely stay again After our original hotel booking fell through a day before we were dueto fly out to the states the race was on to find another decent hotel which we could afford. And SW was the place.Initially we went with it because at this late stage it was the only decent looking place with rooms for under 拢100 a night but on arrival we were very pleasantly surprised.The check in was efficient, the room was great (clean, unique asian decor - what more do you want?!) and although the breakfast was quite basic, it's all we wanted to start the day considering the vast array of eateries in San Francisco (including Cafe Zoetrope whcih was a 2 minute walk away).Location-wise it was fab - on the edge of china town and north beach, so within easy reach of downtown and the bay (we walked everywhere but it was easy to get cabs if you're not that way inclined!).Although the staff weren't over the top friendly they got the job donewithout any fuss so no complaints there either.A great place to stay.

<Content>Would not stay again Ok if you do not plan to do anything in your room but sleep. No breakfast or coffee before 0700, bad coffee, skimpy breakfast-not worth it. No free internet, no free phone, they don't call cab for you, no safe for money/valuables, no central place to sit, some desk clerks were apathetic or rude, others were excellent. Only the suites (they have only 2) have coffee makers or refrigerators. I asked for a coffee maker (I like Starbuck's)-'can't give you because of policy'. Alarm clock is at desk table screwed to outlet-not at bedside. Called for wake up call-they called 15 minutes late. They shake head yes to everything-don't assume that they underdstand.

<Content>Cheap, Good Location but NOISY! PROS:- Cheap. About $140 in central San Francisco (Chinatown) is good. If you're on a tight budget, you might don't care about the noise.- Fresh. Everything felt clean and nice. The rooms are small, but I like paying for what's important = location, and not for a giant room.- Good Central Location.CONS:- Very Loud/noisy! The windows didn't stop the sounds from an active nightlife outside. Sirens and even people talking loud in the street could be heard throughout the night. If this wasn't the case, I would have rated this hotel a 4.

<Content>A Very Pleasant Stay! This was the most reasonably priced room I could find, with many tourists and a major convention in town. I loved staying in Chinatown, and the hotel is in walking distance of many tourist attractions. The rooom was clean and very quiet, although somewhat small. It was a short bus ride to the Convention Center. I would stay here again.

<Content>Clean,quiet and a wonderful location We just returned from a trip to the west coast and after staying in multiple hotels throughout CA it is a pleasure to recommend this hotel. I just read a review posted from last fall where they stated that the rooms were small,etc. Yes, much like hotels in Paris, this hotel room was small but more than adequate for our family of four that includes two teenagers. The hotel is very clean, quiet and the staff is very helpful. The breakfast is classic continental---pastries, coffee,tea  juice which was fine for our family. We highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in the beautiful city of San Francisco.

<Content>Disappointed! The internet advertisements really made the place seem very classy, but the reality is not classy at all.  Our overall impression was one of cutting corners - cheapness, from the beds to the skimpy breakfast buffet. The coffee very weak. We just abandoned their offering and went out to eat. But that is not all. The rooms are so small you can barely turn around. You literally have to rotate in place to turn around. We got a two-bed suite for two adults and two children, and you could only see the TV from one of the beds. The beds are crammed in to the room so tightly, that two of the four people must crawl in at an uncomfortable angle against the wall.  The extremely hard, short beds were made with all top sheets, no fitted sheets, and the bottom sheets were short, not tucked in, so the bed was always messy and uncomfortable.  We had to ask for more towels  washcloths as the room was supplied with only two of each -- for a four-person room. It is a hassle to have to ask for more toilet paper when you are on the toilet and there is no spare roll in the cupboard! The tissue box in the room had only 5 tissues in it. We had to ask for more of those too.  The rooms have overhead fluorescent lights. This is not my idea of classy. It is harsh and glaring. We had to laugh when, after all this, the handles broke off the cupboards when we opened them. Don't get an outside room on Grant or Broadway, as the partiers on the street will keep you up all night -- even with the windows closed. The location was handy for dining, and for shopping on Grant Street in Chinatown. The parking under the building also handy, although I have never had to pay $20 extra per day for parking before.  The staff was very nice. No problems there. The elevators are very quiet and quick. Would I recommend it? To a single traveller or a couple, the location convenience might outweigh anything else. To a famiy? No. We paid $160 per night with parking, and there are definitely better deals to be had in San Francisco.

<Content>Two Good Nights at the SW We stayed at the SW recently. The hotel is located right on the edge of China Town. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms were a little small but comfortable and very clean. The complimentary breakfast was as other reviews have said, not very extensive. We liked being able to stay in the heart of San Francisco at a place with reasonable rates for room and parking. Ask about their Go San Francisco package. It was a good deal.

<Content>Nice place, great location At 119USD a night for a queen bed it's a very good deal! The location in Chinatown is very convenient as you can walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Downtown and Financial District in 15-20 minutes. The rooms are clean, and most of all it's very quiet at night so you can sleep very well. The only downside is the breakfast they serve next to the lobby as it is very light and is a painful experience when it's very crowded. A door to door shuttle to the airport will cost you 15$. You can buy prepaid internet access for 7$ per hour. People at the reception are nice and helpful. I recommend it.

<Content>Don't stay here!!! My friends and I chose to stay at the SW Hotel for its location and clean appearance. Over the course of our one night stay we found that we had been fooled. Upon checking into our room, there was not a single bar of soap, lotion, shampoo, or box of tissues to be found. When we complained to the front desk about this, they merely said we should have opened the mirrored cabinet on the wall. I didn't know washing your hands was supposed to be an investigative activity. Worst of all, as I climbed into bed at 1:00 in the morning, I flicked a small bug off my comforter. Tired, I thought nothing of it and went to sleep. The next day, I was itching like I had the chicken pox. I found huge bug bites all over my body, which continued to show up for days afterward. I called the hotel to notify them of their bed bug problem, and all they could say was sorry, we'll let the general manager know. They did not offer any kind of compensation for my troubles. Needless to say, my bug bites are still not healed, and I had to wash everything that came in contact with my suitcase. I will NEVER, EVER, stay at the SW Hotel again!

<Content>Awesome Location, Clean, Comfortable, Spacious, Cheap Private Parking My wife and I stayed at the SW Hotel(Which stands for Sam Wong the owner of the hotel) for an overnight excursion in San Franscisco on July 2nd. What we wanted in our hotel was that it was in a central location where we could walk to many of the main attactions, where nightlife and great restaurants where next door, that it was affordable, clean, comfortable, and had cheap unlimited in and out priviledge parking. Based on other user's reviews that we read, the SW seemed to fit the our specifications. The SW Hotel is definitely all of these! Located on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy: Fisherman's Warf, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, The Transamerica Building, and the Hyde and Powell Cable Car line are all within walking distance. The staff was friendly, our room was very clean, comfortable, and spacious. It also had free wireless internet access and unlimited daily in and out access to their own private garage which has a cheap fee of $20 a day compared to $30 in most places. Based on other's reviews the rooms on the street side of the hotel tend to be noisy because of the busy intersection this hotel is located at.(Broadway and Grant) The concierge automatically recommended the rooms towards the back of the hotel before I could even request for them. Even though our room's window had a view of another room window, our room was indeed quiet and we had a good night's rest after a full day of sight seeing. If you are looking for no-frills and a comfortable night's rest, the SW is for you. We are definitely staying at this hotel on our next San Franscisco trip.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the SW hotel for three nights in March 2006. The hotel is well situated between the very authentic and busy Chinatown and the fine Italian restaurants of North beach.The Hotel appeared to be deserted the entire time, I think we only saw one other guest. Looks like it has been recently remodeled to a good standard. Some nice Chinese style furniture and decor. Our room was a little small and had a horrible view but was clean and practical. My wife and I enjoyed the short walk down to Fisherman's Wharf and the surrounding areas. The eatery choices were quite excellent. Parking was interesting. The one way in lot underneath the hotel was a real problem getting into. The most bizaare parking lot I have ever seen.Overall I give the hotel 3/5. You pretty much get what you pay for.

<Content>at chinatown/north beach, walk to union square and fisherman's wharf This is a four story hotel. We rented a double. When we got to the hotel, it was about 1:00pm and checkin was at 3:00pm. We were checked in right away and given a key to our room. The room was at the front of the hotel.The room at the front of the hotel was quite small and since it was adjacent to the street the noise level was high. It had a shower but no bathtub. Since I am familiar with the area I expected the noise. So, I turned around and went down and asked for a room at the back. (I probably should've just specified it at checkin time.) They gave us a room at the back with no questions.The rooms in the back have windows but there is only a small space between the hotel and a brick wall in the next building. (2-3 feet?) So, don't expect a view there. However, it was quiet and peaceful there. Also the room was larger and there was a full bathtub. There was also a desk suitable for working at.The shower was okay, but the water pressure was a little bit low and the water seemed to get colder during my admittedly long showering. We didn't try the free continental breakfast. Despite reading someplace on the internet that checkout was at noon, it was at 11:00am.On our final day, we left our bags at the front desk while we went around in Chinatown. Then we came back later and picked up our bags.The location of this hotel was superb for our purposes. The staff was professional and efficient. I would definitely consider staying here again in the future. However, next time I will get a queen. For only ten dollars more, it's worth it.

<Content>complimentary breakfast buffet lacking Fun location on the edge of Chinatown with lots of great resturants in walking distance. The room was very clean but small. The complimentary breakfast buffet was less than I exspected. Only inexspensive bread products with one two slice toaster. The staff told me it was a buffet because you could eat all you wanted.

<Content>Great location but that is about it The SW Hotel (named after Sam Wong) is in a terrific location, right between Chinatown and North Beach. If you are going for a weekend, be sure to get the 333 deal -- $333 for 2 nights, including tax, parking and a Go San Francisco pass good for admission to various museums and such. A very good deal in The City, especially given the location.Our first night was very quiet because we had a room that looked out on the interior air shaft. As others have said, the rooms are small, the walls are thin and the mattesses very firm. We could hear the enthusiastic couple next door the second night (but just for a little while, as it turned out.) The interior rooms may be quieter than those fronting on the streets, since Broadway and Grant are both very busy and the hotel is only four stories high.The continental breakfast was really not much...bread, half-bagels and palmiers. We headed to the Ferry Building where there is a fabulous farmer's market on Saturday and Sunday with incredible things to eat.It is an easy walk to either North Beach or Chinatown (and don't miss the City Lights bookstore a block away). We ate at Citizen Thai at the corner of Grant and Vallejo (just a few blocks away) the first night. A terrific spot and wonderful food. The second night we ate at El Raigon, a great Argentine restaurant on Union Street in North Beach (again, just a few blocks away.)

<Content>Great Bargain. Very nice for the money. I had a last minute to trip to San Francisco on business. Unfortunately, it was almost impossible to find a room due to some big convention. I booked a room at the SW Hotel to give it a try. It is much much cheaper than the usual hotels I stay when in San Francisco.My view of the hotel is that there was a little bit of a musty smell in the hallways. You could notice it in the room but not as bad. The rooms were clean but everything in the room was old (including linens and towels). The important point here is CLEAN. Bare bones....don't expect big puffy white towels and robes. However, for the money, I believe the hotel is a bargain.Continental Breakfast wasn't much, but again, for the money, you can get breakfast elsewhere and still come out ahead.Location is great if your are going to China Town or North Beach.....not as good for going to the Financial District.

<Content>Nice location, not comfy My husband and I just got back from our San Francisco vacation. We travel there quite often, but this was the first time we have stayed in the city itself. We only stayed at the SW hotel for 2 nights, then headed up to the wine country. My first night was AWFUL! You can hear every single noise that people around you make. And of course, I had someone upstairs who was up till after midnight and up again at 5:00 am. The rooms are small, so I'm really not sure what they were doing up there, but I had to buy ear plugs the next day, and slept better after that. I agree with someone above that the blinds let in too much light. So, bring a mask and ear plugs. The bed itself was very hard, and we both were hurting the next day.Continental breakfast consisted of bread. And being on Weight Watchers, I found it hard to find something to eat. We ended up shopping the nearby markets for fruit every morning. Parking was expensive, and very small, but it was better than fighting traffic in the city.The biggest plus is location. The SW is in the heart of it all, and was within walking distance of everything we needed. The staff was very polite to us as well.

<Content>Excellent value and location! SW hotel sits on the edge of China Town and North beach. A fantastic location for walking to all the attractions - Union Square is 10 mins walk away and Fishermans Wharf a 25 minute walk. The hotel is also on the doorstep of the Italian Bistros of North Beach or restaurants of China town.The rooms are very clean and comfortable with double beds, private baths and televisions. Decore is very functional if slightly cold. One negative point is the lack of saftey deposit box. Reception will look after your passport buit there is no other facility to keep valuables. That said, the hotel seemed very safe and we left cameras etc locked in suitcases when we weren't taking them out! Also the blind in the room let through alot of light - light sleepers should bring black out material or eye masks with them. Breakfast wasn't great but there are lots of places locally to eat.This is excellent value and a very good three star hotel. We also found the staff very friendly who couldn't do enough to help! Would highly recommend SW to travellers looking for a great location and clean simple facilities.

<Content>Excellent Value and Location The SW Hotel is an excellent value. If you want a location that is right in the bullseye of Chinatown and North Beach and just a short distance to everything else, you can't beat the SW Hotel. My room was small, and there was no view, but it was clean, nicely decorated, and felt secure. The hotel has an understated class to it, and the staff was professional and responsive. The cost was about half of anything else comparable. I did not have a car, and think that parking and traffic might be an issue.

<Content>Needs a Lesson on Hospitality We stayed at the hotel from February 19-22 and were looking forward to our visit to SF and stay at the SW hotel given the reviews and the affordable rates. However, right from the moment we arrived we experienced unprofessional and poor hospitality. The security guard that mans the front door was not friendly and actually quite rude when we arrived - given the hotel's location there is limited parking for arrivals - thus, we were quickly told that we had to move our vehicle even though we were guests. Once we arrived at the check-in, the front desk agent did not greet us with a warm and friendly demeanor and it felt as if we were interrupting her social time with another hotel employee. All was not lost during our visit- in that we had a nice room for the rate we were paying. The street noise can be annoying at times - but, location is very convenient to Chinatown and North Beach. But, if you were to ask me again - I would not recommend this hotel to anyone - stick with one of the major brands or Kimpton hotels - overall simply more polished and professional.

<Content>Fantastic value Stayed at the SW for an extended weekend in January. Since we had little time, the incredibly central location was attractive, with it being practically right on Broadway and Columbus, and it certainly did work for us. There was so much that was just steps away. The decor here is amazing. It's very, very clean and well kept, the service is great, and they have a nice little continental breakfast included. For the $100 price range, this is about the best value I have ever encountered.

<Content>Excellent location, excellent room We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of July and found the place to be excellent. The room was very nice and clean and the location fantastic, China Town is just outside, the major shopping areas are a 10 min walk in one direction and Fisherman鈥檚 Warf is a 10 min walk in the other. The staff were very pleasant and helpful the breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice between toast, muffins etc. The only downside was that the parking was a bit expensive at $20 a night but there was more then enough room and the car was in a safe place. Would recommend it and would most definitely stay again.

<Content>The best My husband and I have enjoyed our stay at Sam Wong, not once but three times. The location of the hotel is excellent. The hotel boarders China Town and North Beach, Little Italy. Don't let the hussel and bussel of the area fool you, the hotel is still amazingly quiet. The underground parking is safe and convenient. The rooms are small, but extremely clean and inviting. The staff is friendly and helpful.
