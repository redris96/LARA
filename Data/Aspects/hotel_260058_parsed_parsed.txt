<Content>Lovely place, great value for money My boyfriend and I stayed in Hotel Linda on our first night of out 4 day tour in the Netherlands, and we regret not staying there longer and travelled to the different cities in out travel plans on day trips . We stayed in an en-suite, comfortible bed, extra blankets, tv with plenty of channels, big windows ( great dark curtains!!), small bathroom but had a bath and all the basics, it was clean, got plenty of towels and champoo  shower gel.Breakfast was quite ok for the 鈧?5 BB we payed, different types of breads, hams, cheeses, cereals, eggs, croissants, yoghurts, tea  coffee, juices... quite satisfying to start the day.Service was brilliant, lovely receptionists  staff.Finaly to top it off the hotel was quite central  tram stop is a 2 minute walk. Overall a short but brilliant experience in Hotel Linda, we will definately be back!

<Content>great hotel having just returned from amsterdam, i wanted to share our experiences. Despite all the reviews for the hotel, we found it very clean and tidy. We had two rooms and although rooms were very compact, they had everything we needed.one room which was behind the reception, could be noisy at times but perfectly manageable.the telephone wasn't working in the room but was fixed after a couple of days.The staff were very pleasant and helpful,i would recommend this hotel .

<Content>Nice Low Budget Hotel ! Me and my boyfriend stayed in Hotel LInda for 2 nights. I have no complaints about our stay. I had a lot of problems for searching a hotel in Amsterdam before we left, but I think I made a good choise. The hotel is clean and nice. The rooms may be a bit small, but for that price you can't expect much more I think. The only 'problem' I had was that the toilet was a bit smelly, so we left to windows open our whole stay, and it helped. The breakfast is good. I have no complaints about the staff, they were nice. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to see Amsterdam, and not pay to much for a hotel. The hotel is near public transport.We payed 145 euro for 2 persons for 2 nights. I can compare, our friends also went to Amsterdam the same date. They stayed in a hotel 50 km outside the center, and they payed 100 euro more then us. And they also said that their room was small, and they only got to see the city for 2 days, we got to be there for 3 days.

<Content>Better than expected I was a little bit wary about this hotel from reading other reviews about bugs and such, but I am glad I went with the flow and stayed at this hotel. Some people complained about the distance from the red light area, but if you get tram tickets (right outside Centraal Station at the iTourist center) for three or four days (unlimited) then hop on the 4, 24, or 25 you are straight into town in less than five minutes. And the trams run pretty much all the time. The only frustrating thing about this hotel were the tiny endless stairs, but we are relatively young and were able to walk up no problem. Tiny but clean room with private bath. Would definitely stay again!!

<Content>Bed Bugs Myself and my friend stayed in this hotel in May 08. Our room (101) was small, the view was non-existent, and the room was hot. It was a last minute deal and was convenient for the city centre so we thought it would be OK.After 3 nights we were COVERED in bites - we initially thought this was mosquitos but it became clear that it was actually bed bugs. There were blood stains on the sheets (we now realise from squashed bugs) - we asked for them to be changed, which they were, but it did not help the situation. We found a number of bugs in the bed and there were also suspicious black splats against the wall.Judging from the some of the other reviews, there is definitely a problem with insects at this hotel - but appears to be confined to certain rooms.We have both returned to work with nasty red spots all over our face, necks and arms. It is not just the odd bite - we are covered - which suggests a serious infestation.Please do not stay here. If you have already booked and they try and give you room 101 - SAY NO!

<Content>Scarey stairs... Staff were welcoming, and helpful. Four of us went, two of us had a huge room, really spacious and lovely, the other two had a tiny room though. Rooms were clean and well kept. The stairs getting to the top floor, (4) were the scariest things ever. Nearly vertical, they are hard to climb at the best of times, let alone with any luggage or after a drink!!Breakfast was nice, only problem was there werent enough seats to had to stand around eating breakfast some mornings. Location is good, with a tram stop just outside, and within walking distance of the centre.

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous Just returned from a 5 night break in this hotel which we booked online. It was brilliant for the money we paid. The room was very clean and the reception staff all friendly. Towels changed daily and beds made for us. Buffet breakfast most enjoyable.The location was good, very near a tram stop and it was easy to get wherever we wanted to go.The only negative comment I can think to make is that there weren't enough coathangers in the wardrobe!Will definitely return!

<Content>Staff have no respect for sleeping guests The staff were friendly and helpful, and while the room was small that didn't really bother us as we were just sleeping there so only needed a bed and toilet. We got room 503 which was in the basement, right beside the staff exit and delivery entrance, where all the linen cupboards are and where the staff toilet is. At 2am every night we were woken by staff shouting at each other, or running down or up stairs to use the toilet. At 7.15am every morning the delivery door would be slammed shut shaking the whole room.The breakfast room was also directly above our room so at 730am we would hear all the chairs being scraped about the floor above.Finnally on our last night the fire alarm went off at 2/3am. Was only for a second but woke us up and found it very difficult to get back to sleep as we could hear receptionist talking as well. The fire alarm going off isn't hotels fault normally but this lasted only seconds so could not have been set off by anyone other than staff.I suspect if you get another room in the hotel (except 502 which was in basement as well) then this hotel would be fine, but I won't be staying there again as the risk is not worth it.

<Content>Good value, good location Good budget hotel in a convenient location, close to transit. In a mostly non-touristy area, so if you are looking to get away from the masses and meet some locals, you can do that here. But it is also close to major sights and transit, so easy access to the tourist sights as well.Rooms are basic, as is breakfast, but pretty good for the price. Everything very clean. Friendly staff and free Internet in the lobby. Bustling street market nearby. Rooms that face the street do get traffic noise, but also an OK view of a canal.

<Content>Good locatiion Took a gamble here given some of the reviews.Reception staff were friendly and helpful.We booked late so got room 100 which is right against footpath and reception area.Footpath and road noise was barely noticable but lobby noise (ie people using snack machine and talking) was.Breakfast was good but get there earlier than 9:30am.Location good (tram 25 from Central station, 5 or 6 stops).Rough and ready but hey......its amsterdam and this place is fine for a couple of days in town.

<Content>The best for the price This hotel was the only one reasonably priced for the middle of June when booked a few days earlier. I stayed 5 nights with my wife.Our room was on the third floor (4th US). It was reasonably sized, the bathroom nearly new, the windows solid and blocking the noise pretty well, and the bed with double pillows. Fairly quiet except for two evenings when the 4th floor occupants were apparently dancing. A call to the reception helped the first time right away, and only my wife heard the second time. Breakfast was pretty good and everything was clean.The hotel is next to a tram stop, one long block from the Heineken museum, and two long blocks from the Museum square. Perhaps not in the middle of action but also without a corresponding noise. About 7 min nice walk to Rembrandt square. Plenty of restaurants, some elegant, and a grocery store within a block.The stairs are very steep but this was part of an attraction being in an old house.I would gladly stay there next time. One warning. This hotel is also backpackers in the basement. However, they appeared civilized. IM

<Content>Scary stairs! Our family of four had the quad room on the fifth floor. The biggest negative for our three night stay at the Hotel Linda was the challenge of getting up the stairs, a tiny circular stairwell with steep small stairs at all four flights and the steepest set of stairs at the top. Carrying luggage is extremely difficult, and ascending and descending feels hazardous. Our fourteen year old son fell down the steep top flight and was rug burned and shook up. The room was decent size and clean with a good view of the street in front and canal. But at night the heat was such that we needed to keep the windows open. With open windows the traffic noise kept us awake. Tough choice - lay awake sweating or hearing the traffic noise.On the positive side, the clerks were friendly and helpful (except about our request to move to a lower floor. ) Breakfast was good and included in the room cost - scrambled eggs, cereal, etc. A computer in the lobby was available for lodgers to use for free- it stayed busy but it was possible to get on. The hotel, on the outskirts of the canal district, was a long walk to the action in the core of city center, but it's an easy bike ride. Rent a bike; it's the best way to get around Amsterdam, for natives and tourists. A car in Amsterdam is bad news. The hotel parking was not availible for us - we found parking on the street right in front of the hotel and put 18.90 Euros in the meter every day (we never drove the car once we arrived in Amsterdam; bikes took us everywhere.Primarily because of the imposing stairs, we would seek a different hotel should we return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great For Mountain Goats Having made a last minute booking through HostelBookers for a low budget group of 14 pax coming to a Rugby Tournament, the pax got exactly what they paid for, namely a cheap, clean and conveniently located place to sleep with no frills. Watch out for the dormitory (10 + 4) as it is on the 3rd floor right at the top of the steepest set of 3 staircases I have ever seen. Fine for youths but watch out if you have any heavy luggage or are scared of heights.Also watch for an additional 5% City Tax that is payable on top of the bill. The Hostelbookers confirmation merely confirmed the room balance. The extra 5% was noted on their web page for the Linda but was missed at the time of the booking and came as an unpleasant and unwelcome surprise.

<Content>Good location! Stayed at the hotel Linda for four days in March. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean and tidy, particularly the bathroom which looked as if it was new. Sometimes a bit too noisy at night, but that was probably due to staying at the first floor. Location was excellent, right next to a tram stop (takes about ten to fifteen minutes to get to the Dam), about a 15 minute walk by the Amstel to the flea market and a grocery store nearby the hotel(easy when your on a budget!). Allso Albert Cyupstraat (the marketplace) practically next door, and about a ten minute walk to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. All and all a good value for money.

<Content>no problems! We stayed at Linda hotel for a few nights,and were pleasantly surprised, considering the reviews written from some people! The bedrooms were clean and airy, the bedding etc carefully tidied during the day, the staff very pleasant and helpful, and a good selection for breakfast. The steps were incredibly steep to the 4th floor bedroom, but no problems for a fairly fit person!We booked on the internet, and had no problems with this-we had our room keys within 5-10 mins of arrival. In all, an enjoyable stay. For a cheap stay in an expensive city for hotels, not bad!

<Author>ward962
<Content>good value for money Booked a double room for 4 nights. Room was very clean and en suite looked new - shower excellent. Rooms are small, double bed and dressing table with chair - no wardrobe, but it didnt matter. TV was fine, with loads of channels. Breakfast was plentiful, basic continental food - but loads of staff to help and food just kept coming.Staff where particularly helpful and genuine. The stairs to our room where very very steep - which was ok but you would need to request a ground floor room if you have trouble with stairs.Transport links excellent - Tram number 4 direct to city centre, just accross the road. Found a FAB market just round the corner.If all you want is a clean and safe place to rest your head, then i would recommend this hotel - after all we didnt spend any time in the placxe except to sleep!!!

<Content>Loved it, just loved it!! My friend and I were looking for a cheap, clean hotel with good location and a friendly athmosphere for our weekend in Amsterdam. I'm happy to say that despite all the bad reviews, Hotel Linda was the perfect choice. Friendly, helpful staff, great breakfast (the eggs just kept on coming - waaay after 10 pm!) clean, cosy room with view thowards the river (and just enough wardrobe space for two jackets), and the stairs are no problem - Seriously! I wouldn't stay anywhere else!

<Content>Two very enthusiastic thumbs up We were expecting the worst after reading all the scary reviews (after we had bookedpaid), but our stay could not have been more pleasant. Loved the stairs, loved the breakfast, loved the staff (especially how they kept bringing us new towels and toiletpaper), loved the clean rooms and loved the location - walking distance from everything. The smoke alarm only went off once, we got to check in early and Hotel Linda is recommended to everyone who do not need an elevator to secure their happiness. And by the way: the rooms do have tv.

<Content>Not if You want to sleep... Only saw reviews on this website after we had booked and payed for our weekend trip. Thougt we'd give it a go despite some of the things said about it. Our experience with the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was very small but clean. View towards inner courtyard was not very nice and made the room very dark. This was nothing however compared to the sleepless nights we had. We are not in anyway against partying and enjoy a good night out as anyone else, but this was ridiculous. All night partying with smoking anything but normal cigarettes which filled the corridors and our room with a nasty smell. The fire alarm kept coming on during the nights and we had receptionstaff coming into the room during the night to check if it was us smoking... There we were me and my husband in pyjamas trying our best to sleep at three in the morning...Breakfast was a rather sad affair with coffee from a machine worse than in the office...You get what you pay for though and although Amsterdam hotels are expensive, next time I will happily spend more money on another hotel.

<Content>Good Accommodation. Nice hotel, with reasonably good sized room (smoking rooms available too), cleaned daily. The staff were fine, no frills but pleasant enough. The breakfast was continental as expected and with a good choice. The hotel is situated about 1 mile outside of Amsterdam Centre and is next to tram and bus stops if you can't face the walk. We walked in everyday and thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity of exploring some of the less well known areas, little markets, antique shops etc. It's also near the Heineken Museum if that's your kind of thing. So, on the whole a good place to stay in a good location, for a reasonable price. I would recommend to anyone really, but especially couples and lone travelers. The stairs are typically steep so might not be ideal for anyone infirm.

<Content>OK - don't agreee with some of the other reviews Booked this then saw some of the reviews and was afraid it had been a mistake. No problems at the hotel. It was pretty much as expected for the price. No problem with the e-booking. Receptionist was friendly and offered to move us from 3rd floor to 1st floor as one of us was an OAP. Glad of this as the stairs were steep. Room was a bit small but not a problem. En suite facilities were new and excellent. Everything clean. Breakfast room was a bit spartan but food was average and good choice on buffet.Hotel was fairly central and very convenient for Albert Cuyp market - very good market - and for museums.Would be happy to stay there again but would not want to be in a basement room.

<Content>clean room, good location No matter what all of the other reviews say i give a big thumbs up to Hotel Linda. We booked the hotel with a little apprehension however I'm gald to report we had a great stay.As you can imagine, hitting Amsterdam mid August accommodation wasnt easy to find. Using a discount hotel website we booked Hotel Linda 3 days before our departure from home.The hotel is located only 5 minutes from Dam Square on the tram or 20 mins walk. We had a double room overlooking the canal. The room was bright and looked like it had been recently refurbished. The ensuite was clean and shower was great. We had a continental breakfast included in the price and although it was quite basic there was plenty of it. Staff were friendly and helpful and they offered luggage storage on our departure day.The only slight flaw was that the room was very warm and although we had a fan the windows didnt open. All in all a great stay and would definately reccommend.

<Content>Mosquito Problem One of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in. We had a ground floor room, which was very small and dirty. The bedding was ripped and had cigarette burns. There was nowhere to put your clothes because there was no wardrobe, only a coat hook on the wall. The weather was warm, so the first night we left the window open slightly but my husband was bit a few times by something, probably mosquitoes. The second night we made an effort to kill anything that was flying in our room and made sure that the window was closed but we were both bitten to death. I don't know where the mosquitoes were coming from, but you killed one and then found another five flying around. Looking closely through the window there was hundreds buzzing around the glass.We have been to various places around the world, but we have never been bit as bad as this. Reading through other peoples reviews (which I wish we had read before booking this hotel) it seems as the hotel has a big problem with this.This is NOT a hotel I would recommend, in fact I would recommend that people would stay away.

<Content>Not as bad as people say!!! 5 of us (all girls) stayed at Hotel Linda in October 2005. We weren't expecting much and we were not disappointed! The room was basic and quite small, but it was clean and tidy. The shower was clean, with good pressure and was hot. No complaints except the t.v needed fixing, although we did not watch it anyway! And it did get very hot in there during the night. Staff were friendly and we even had someone help carry our bags up the 4 flights of winding stairs. All in all, was reasonable for what we paid, and i would go again.

<Content>had a great time !!!!! a group of us stayed at the hotel and were a bit wary as there are some bad reviews for it. We are glad we gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt, we had a lovely time. The hotel was clean and welcoming. the rooms were very nice and the staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast room was small but the breakfast was typically european and there was plenty of it. We will definately stay there again and recommend it to others. Well worth the money!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>What a dump! Arrived admittedly earlier but the helpful girl said our room was ready to go. After climbing 4 impossibly steep flights of stairs with our cases (no help offered to me or my girlfriend inspite of a porter who just sat there), opened the door to find a filthy bombsite.Came back down with our bags the girl was surprised but said we could leave our bags in the room and it would be ok when we got back, it wasn't. The room was Disgusting! We had to sleep with t-shirts over the pillows because the cases were smelly and dirty. The bedside lamp looked like a fast track to electrocution.the bathroom surpringly was ok.Didn't try breakfast as we thought it better not to risk it.The location of hotel linda was good as were the two girls who ran reception. But you could do alot better for your money believe me.

<Content>is not in bad condition when I read yours opinions I was worried, but when I arrived to Hotel Linda I find a room with bath clean simple and in the average. The price that I paied is fair. The rooms are restructured recently.This Hotel it's near Museum and with tram N.4 or 24 we arrived in few minutes in the central of Amsterdam.

<Content>We'll try everything we can If we had read all these warnings before we might not have booked a room at Linda. Looking back on our 7-nights'-stay there, we seem to have been lucky, though. Breakfast was fine. The rooms have been refurbished during the last few weeks (new carpets, TV/phone); ours was light, clean, quiet, and worth its money. BUT: Not all of the rooms are like that. Most of those facing the Stadhouderskade (a loud and busy street) have sealed windows and no fresh air! We were given one of those first, didn鈥檛 accept it, and could change into another one at once (first floor, backyard side). We later discovered that there are even rooms in the basement which must be even worse (neither air nor light). So take a look at the room they want to give you before you pay! Insist! And be prepared to complain! We complained a lot, and were probably regarded as a nuisance, but if they try your patience, you might as well try theirs. It's very likely that they WILL try your patience: staff are extremely, stunningly unhelpful, making up contradictory excuses for things going wrong. The friendliest reply we got was We'll try everything we can - but this seems to apply only as long as it doesn鈥檛 involve making an effort for anything, and in the end amounts to very little anyway. Our biggest problem was with the hotel-owned car park, which costs 鈧?0 per day, which can't be booked in advance, and used only under the precondition that you don't move your car during your entire stay. If you do, you'll lose your parking space, even if you've paid for it - I spare you the various absurd (and inconsistent) explanations they gave for that. As we wanted to use the car for trips to the seaside we went to the Stadstoezicht (city authority for parking) in Weesperstraat and bought combined day parking tickets for 18鈧? This is still quite cheap for Amsterdam standards, and you're perfectly flexible. (Needless to say that we found out about this alternative without the assistance of Linda staff who even tried to stop us from doing that by giving wrong information.)

<Content>Hotel Hell I have stayed in hotels all over the world - all varieties and this was by far, the worst hotel ever. Carpets and walls are filthy! Stairs are treacherous! Supposed parking consists of a driveway in the back where they cram as many cars as possible. They require that you leave the carkeys with them in case they have to move one car to get another car out. Outside temperatures were cool but the room was stifling! Opening windows onto an enclosed atrium revealed no air flow but plenty of cigarette butts and empty wine bottles. Stay away from this hotel at all costs! There must be better and at better prices. Never again!

<Content>No air! The hotel was well-located and room itself okish apart from nicotine stained walls but the big problem was that there was no fresh air, the large windows led out on to an internal 'atrium' which had virtually no air flow - enough to make you feel cooped in. We asked to change but this wasnt possible. Breakfast OK but nothing special. Rates good but no so good I would go again.
