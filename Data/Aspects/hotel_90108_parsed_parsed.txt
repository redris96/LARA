<Content>If you want to be off the beaten path this is your place This was a very odd property. As a SPG member and Starwood timeshare owner I try to stay in Starwood and had never been to W before. The property was nice and the room beautiful but the hotel is in the middle of a parking lot and had no beach access during part of my stay. There is also no pool to make up for the lack of beach access. If you want a relaxing place for a short stay perhaps however if you want to be in the busy life of Waikiki this would be a poor choice.

<Content>Less Than Impressed Stayed at the W Honolulu Diamond Head for one night in December 2008.Before I get to the meat of the review, I do want to say that the staff was friendly and outgoing. They seemed genuinely interested in helping and being pleasant.Despite that, I did experience a number of problems during my stay and even the friendly staff seemed to overlook things now and then.- On-demand TV quit on me. 30mins in to a movie I was watching, the on-demand stopped working. Just went to a black screen. Could not get it to work again during the rest of the evening or next day.- Room service item I ordered was uncooked (frozen, even!). I guess the soup I ordered is prepped and then put in the freezer, to be thrown in the oven when someone orders it. Seems someone forgot to throw it in the oven, though, and it arrived totally frozen. Not sure how that was overlooked. They replaced it, but offered nothing in return but the replacement (no extra entree or beverage or even credit on my folio).- The chair located at the desk in the room was disturbingly dirty. Maybe it was just the white upholstery that made it stand out that much more, but it was unappealing to the eye, to say the least.- TV picture quality was below average. Most channels were a bit grainy.- There were some errors at check-out with my folio (I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and so earn points on stays at W hotels, and I was credited with an incorrect number of points and so had to follow up with SPG later on to get my missing credits).The above all left me feeling less than impressed, especially after having stayed at some incredible W properties in other cities. The physical property itself also feels fairly dated, and even ocean-view rooms are actually partially-obstructed ocean-view rooms, given other, taller, high-rise properties sit between the W and the water. So long as you're expecting that, there are still some decent views to be had (of Diamond Head itself, especially), it is close to the water and has a nice park in front as well, but you're not quite waking to the sound of crashing waves and a view of the blue ocean.Again, staff was very friendly and so I never got too frustrated during my stay. Only being there a single night, I just figured I'd be gone soon enough and so it wasn't too much of a bother. But had I stayed more than one night and continued to experience issues, it would have gotten old quickly. Further, the W is not priced in a way or located in a spot, in my option, that makes the occasional mishap worth dealing with on account of savings.With plenty of other options in Honolulu, I'll be passing on the W next time around.

<Content>Overpriced, but sexy hotel in a strange area I was in Honolulu for business, and my travel agent suggested that I stay at the W in Diamond Head. This proved to be a mixed blessing. It is way, WAY too far from downtown which was where the office where I had my meetings was, and I was pretty far from the activity of Honolulu itself. However, the W is near Diamond Head which made for some close trips to Hanama Bay for early morning snorkeling. The room was large and tidy with a nice view of Diamond Head. The staff was courteous. The bar at night was great. Overall, it was overpriced for the location, however, and I would not necessarily recommend staying here when you compare the value to the other hotels in Honolulu.

<Content>don't stay here There are much better places to stay on Waikiki - not a convenient location as it is in a more residential area and you need to walk 15 minutes to get to the rest of Waikiki.They mischarged our room for a bottle of wine from honor bar which we did not have. The staff at front desk had to finish their gossip on the phone before talking to us and kept us waiting for several minutes -- not professional.Shabby room - no tea, no coffee maker (had to special request both), old CRT tv (no flat screen??), carpet was wet when we arrived.view of diamond head and a parking lot. first stay at a W - not impressed.

<Content>Not your typical W The W Diamond Head is a neat little hotel, and that's about it! We recently stayed 2 nights at the hotel, and found this hotel to be adequate. First of all, the hotel entrance is very small and hard to find off the road, which made it very frustrating. There's no self parking and the hotel only has one elevator. The check in process was fairly efficient, the lobby is very modern and decorated in typical W Style, the concierge and valet were very nice and friendly. We were told that there was complimentary breakfast, which turned out to be just coffee/juice, that forced us to try the hotel restaurant. The restaurant actually served surprisingly good breakfast options at a reasonable price (for Hawaii standards), the Hawaii sweetbread frenchtoasts were delicious. The rooms are just ok, not much of any ocean view, the bathroom could use some updating, and you have to call concierge for coffee/tea maker. The two biggest complains I had with W is that it was not close to much of anything, and the hotel does not have a pool. There was another Starwood property couple of miles down the beach that could've been a better choice.

<Content>Horrible Hotel After reserving by phone  telling the clerk it was for my birthday  that we'd be arriving about 1pm, I asked if we could check in early... no problem  glad to have you for your birthdayWe arrived at 1pm  were told that our room wasn't available; we asked when it was expected to be available, the EXTREMELY rude woman responded well, check in is at THREE. We asked them to try to get a room ready  let us know when they had our room available by phone  left  came back at 2:15  were again told no room was available, we asked again when it would be available  were told by another employee possibly at 3. Not a smile, kind word or Happy Birthday from anyone.Room was noisy, some items (like the phone) were broken, maid didn't show up one day, continental breakfast was included - consisted of 2 small gas station like pastries, 6 1/8  slices of old fruit  1/4 of a strawberry  were given a check for $0 (I presume for tip, even though we got it to go  went down ourselves to get it).When I complained we had been charged for all 6 nights even though one night was supposed to be free, the Manager told me we had used too much stationary, soaps  toilet paper  that the room smelled like smoke (we don't smoke). I've stayed at many fine Hotels as well as many W's, I would rate this Hotel as the absolute worst - don't waste your money!

<Content>A Hawaiian secret you want to know On a recomendation of a friend, my wife and I booked into the W Diamondhead for our Honeymoon, eight years ago. We have returned for our anniversary every year since. The Hotel is small, 12 stories and about 50 rooms sandwiched inbetween the ocean and Kapolan'i Park. The hotel used to be part of the Colony Surf [next door] and was split off and converted to a W Hotel.This is a quiet part of the coast but only a short walk to the center of Waikiki. BTW, you can jog or walk [about 2.25 miles] around the park perimeter.The staff is young and local. Most of them have been there for at least the 8 years we have been visiting. They are bright and cheerful and do a lot towards making your stay a happy one.There is a popular Night Club and Restaurant [ Friday and Saturday are Club nights] called the Diamond Head Grill. Food is good, the Bar is enormous, the decibels are high on Club nights.W Hotels are part of the Starwood family, so the popular programs are pretty much available at this property.General Manager Lyle and Front Desk Manager Richie have made our stays memorable. The risk about bragging about a travel find is that too many travelers may decide to try your recomendation and interfere with your next stay... However, if you like Oahu but don't want to stay in a tourist location, this is definately your best bet.......

<Content>Don't reccomend this hotel For what I thought W hotel quality was supposed to be--this hotel was far from nice. Our sheets had brown stains on them and they had no service to change them--we checked in after 9PM and apparently they do not have maid service that late. The bathroom was also dirty. They finally did change the sheets but it was the person working the front desk and he had no idea how to make a bed. It is also a far walk to Waikikki so I would reccomend staying somewhere there.

<Content>Terrible...and I'll tell you why! The room is nice, but I've had nice rooms, nice rooms are not what, to me, vacation is all about. First of all, you wake EVERY morning at dawn to the insistent beep, beep, beep of the garbage trucks picking up the condo (that surround the hotel) trash. THEN I fall back asleep only to wake the fumes and noise of a leaf blower ... and the area he is blowing is so small, easily do-able with a rake and broom. THEN ... you are blasted with loud music in the lobby 24/7.Don't these people know people come to Hawaii to get away from urban noise...AND that the W is listed as a Green Lodging alternative. What is green about gas-guzzling leaf blowers?OH...and there is no pool, no beach, surrounded by condos and parking lot.

<Content>Great place to stay... I do not agree at all with the negative reviews... This hotel is located away from busy Waikiki which is a huge plus. Who goes to Hawaii to see a busy city full of prostitutes? You go to Hawaii to enjoy the nature and peaceful surroundings. And if you want to party, Friday and Saturday nights at the W is the place to party. It is the perfect mix of peaceful enjoyment and a great party scene. You are sure to have a great time. STAY HERE!!!

<Content>goofy lobby and overpriced The first cool corner room was surrounded by claustrophobic condos. We changed to one that had a very nice Diamond Head view and partial ocean view, The lobby is small with a wierd assortment of furniture.There was continuous rock n roll music in the lobby, the one elevator and the dining room. It seemed they were trying to be a hip nightclub catering to the 20-30 year olds. I found $400-500/night really overpriced. The dinner at THe Diamond Grill was delicious and definitely the highlight. Complements to the chef. I would return for dinner ONLY.

<Content>Great hotel, highly underrated in this forum Really great stay here. Rooms: We had a fabulous room on the 11th floor, we thought the higher price of around $370 per night was worth it for the view of Diamond Head, the ocean and the city. The rate came with a package that they sold on the W website, worth looking out for these as you get extra freebees. Decor was not at the forefront of hip but all nice, clean and spacious. Staff are extremely friendly and want to make your stay as nice as possible. One night, the fire alarm went off briefly; a mention to Michael at the front desk the next day (to find out what had happened) got us some bubbly delivered to our room the following evening. Very nice gesture. Location: On quiet end of Waikiki beach. No pool but that didn't bother us at all, there are two small, semi-private beaches adjacent to the hotel. Other parts of Waikiki beach are a short walk away.They give you beach chairs, towels and water to take out. Restaurant is good, we turned the complimentary continental breakfast into brunch by ordering an extra omelet, quite inexpensive. We would stay here again mostly because of the superb, friendly staff and the quiet, yet excellent location.

<Content>Great staff, Great location, Great room. We enjoy our stay here. Why? 1. Situated at the end of Waikiki where we can get some peace  quiet from the insane foot  car traffics2. Only 50 rooms-5 rooms per floor. All rooms face East. We stayed at the 9th floor with a close-up view of Diamond Head on the left and the ocean on the right.3. Generous room size, a balcony  lounge chairsIn addition, the staff is aimed to please. 2p late check-out was not a problem. Concierge carried our luggage up and offered sightseeing suggestions. Generous amount of toiletries. Valets are great for directions. There are juices and coffee in the lobby. They even threw in bottles of water when you need to drive out. The hotel is only a 5-min walk from the Hawaii Aquarium. A Travel Channel award recipient and it surely deserves one. At $280/night, it's worth the splurge rather than spending something close to it at the Vegas-size place on Waikiki strip where you are treated as a number

<Content>Not a REAL W -- a big disappointment What a disappointment! This is not a real W hotel. Other than some of the usual W signage, this hotel did not resemble any of the other W hotels that we've stayed at throughout the country. While we were told that this property was converted from another hotel or condo, we expected so much more....it IS the W afterall. However, based on what we saw, the W invested very little in making sure this property was up to par with the others that bear the W name. The rooms were a decent size, but had so-so furniture which consisted of mismatching and nicked up tiki-type desks and side tables. The decor lacked the style and sophistication that one would expect from a W hotel. Note also that this W does not have wireless internet, which is a staple at all other W hotels. In fact, the Ethernet connection cord that was offered was all of about 2 feet long, so in order to be connected to the internet, the computer had to be on the desk in an awkward position backed up again the wall. Very poorly designed. When I call the Whatever, Whenever line that the W hotels are so famous for, Stevie answered and informed me that the hotel does not have any Ethernet cords. Period. End of story. There was no suggestion made about what the hotel might be able to do to fix the problem - nothing. Not surprisingly, Stevie was the same person who was utterly useless when we checked in and asked for suggestions of where to go for lunch. She simply told us to walk down the beach and we'd come across something. Gee, thanks! I got the same response (from another employee) when I asked about a gym and spa (Note, this W hotel has neither, nor does it have a pool, or any real outdoor area). I would never stay here again. The Moana Surfrider or Royal Hawaiian look to be the places to go in Honolulu. The W is outdated and from the looks of it, was never truly converted to a real W hotel. Stay somewhere else!!!

<Content>Not a typical W..and that's good I enjoyed my stay at this W. It felt very Hawai'i to me and the rooms rocked (albeit a bit on the medium size, they're not shoeboxes).The valet guys were cool as heck and I even had them go and run for some stuff for me, which they had no issues with. Check in was easy. The only thing that's odd is that this is clearly an older hotel from Hawaii's heyday and aside from the upgrades, it still has an old-school feel. This isn't bad, actually. It's not a mega resort and doesn't even have a beach (it's off the beach by 100 yards). What it does have it peace. It's far enough from the crazies on Waikiki yet close enough to where you feel part of the action. The food is KILLER. Just yummy.If you're looking for a typical W, this isn't for you. If you want some peace and quiet and to feel like you're in old-school Hawaii with modern touches, this is the place.Someone told me about 7 years agho this place was some type of cool 60's styled surfer (sort of) hotel. I don't know the history of it but I sure did have fun at the place.

<Content>Comfortable and Relaxing. We stayed at the W more by default as we found ourselves stranded at the Airport after the Earthquake for they where the only hotel in Honolulu that could take a manual booking ( no electricity for 48 hours).The two day stay was in a corner room which had partial ocean views and two balconies. The staff where amicable without being overly friendly, and given the circumstances coped very well.We loved the location away from the hustle and bustle with it being a 10 minute walk along a well paved path and plenty of shade.I dont feel the hotel is worth the Rack Rate and would probably opt for a suite in a larger hotel but if there is a deal to be had I would definately stay again.

<Content>Avoid it Like the Plague on the Weekend I wish I could write two reviews for this hotel. It is an attractive property with really nice staff. The location is great if you want something away from Waikiki and although it does not have a pool, it has very close beach access. For the most part it was a quiet and pleasant place to stay. However, on Friday and Saturday nights, the second floor restaurant is converted into the hottest disco on the island and even though my room was on the fifth floor, I could hear and feel the music in my room as though it was just down the hall. There was also a loud group of smokers who congregated outside the hotel for smoke breaks. Calls to the manager did not help and I finally resigned myself to sleepless nights until 2:00 (actually a little later) on both nights. So unless your idea of paradise is a late night disco experience in your room, you should avoid this hotel at all costs on the weekend.

<Content>W Honolulu not what it should be Most notable at this hotel is that it is aging. The rooms have a 'lived-in' look with an assortment of scratches, scuffs, stains and spots. The electronics are worn-out. In our room, the phones had speed-dial buttons for hotel services that didn't work and a low-quality wireless phone with a loud hum. The TV is older-generation and the picture was filled with interference. The staff are rather friendly, but amiability didn't always equate with competence and some staff did have attitude issues. Sometimes, it seemed that our requests were an inconvenience. Most annoying for us was the fact that often when we dialed their whatever, whenever customer service line, it just rang 10, 20 times before someone answered. Then there was the sewage smell coming through our bathroom vent...

<Content>Great Small Hotel This is a great small hotel. The beds are very comfortable and it located with a park on one side of the hotel and the beach a few steps from the other side. I would recommend this if you done want to stay a one of the big hotels and if you want great customer service. I found it to be a very relaxing hotel.

<Content>A W in Waikiki? The W Honolulu has all the usuals you'd expect from a W--good service, high-end (but smallish) designer rooms, and a sense of stylish cool, but somehow it's all strange because you're in Waikiki. The W is a bit away from all the action Waikiki offers. You've got a better view of Diamond Head and some more peace and quiet, but there's nothing else around there (residential area with apartments and a park) and it's a 15 minute walk to all the restaurants and shops. We didn't take advantage of the hotel's restaurant, though it got pretty good ratings. We did eat breakfast at the restaurant in the New Otani Hotel next door. They've got some great poi pancakes and you can get nice tables right by the beach.Overall, we thought the hotel and staff were good, but probably would've been more happy with a traditional Hawaiian resort and all the amenities that come along with it.Bottom line, I can't really endorse the W but can't knock it either. if you're looking for a different experience in Honolulu, the W may be worth checking out.

<Author>Hawaii_Is_Awesome
<Content>Very nice! Very attentative staff. We stayed at the W on the 5th floor between Dec 24 and 28th, 2006. I read all the reviews before making my reservation. After reading the reviews, I was surprised/concerned as I have stayed at many W hotels and have always loved them. So after staying I thought I should write this review to try to make sense of others comments. 1. The location is at the end of Waikiki beach. So you're gonna have to walk to get to the places on Waikiki . It is a quiet street and there is little traffic noise..there is a park across the street. 2. This place has like 50 or 60 rooms. Don't expect a resort. 3. As everyone's said it's not on the beach and they don't have a pool. You'll have to walk about a couple hundred feet if you want sand and water. 4. The room was very nice and had a balcony with a nice very of Diamond Head. It had very small slice view of water..but I knew that before I went..but the Diamond Head view was very nice..5. The lobby was typical W.. Funky music and decorations.. very typical W. There is no grand entrance.6. I called and asked for some more shampoo and soap..and the stuff was there in about 1 minute. Really. One minute. It was amazing.. this kind of service over Christmas? I couldn't believe it! I did it for 3 nights just to see if this was really true. The longest time was like 2 minutes! I don't know what was up with the others saying the service was so-so..this isn't so-so service! 7. The room was big..had a flat screen TV... Great bed..great bathroom... it was very clean! 8. Like someone else said no swimming pools, no tennis, no kids, to me W's don't cater to families...just my opinion..so don't expect resort facilities. If that's what you want stay at the other two starwood places...up the street. 9. I didn't go the the restaurant/nightclub. There are too many others on Waikiki that I'd rather go to. 10. Staff very quick to get my car.Bottom line the service is beyond amazing and the place is a great place if you like funky W.. and want a nice place to sleep and relax located near Waikiki beach. Don't expect the hotel to entertain you. ..you gotta go up the street ...

<Content>Not what you expect from a W We have stayed at two other W hotels and they were excellent. So we had high expectations for this one. The location is good because it's at the end of Waikiki beach opposite a park, but it's not on the beach; there are buildings between it and the beach.The room was very nice although the lobby wasn't anything special. It's an old hotel that's been renovated.When we first arrived, we wanted to make coffee in our room and called the whatever/whenever number and asked for cream. It never arrived. That night we were kept awake by our toilet constantly running. We complained, but it never got fixed.All in all, we would not stay there again.

<Content>AWESOME HOTEL!!!! I visited this hotel Jan 31st through Feb 5th, had a Fabulous room (1124). The room was very comfortable, the bed was the best, it was the best sleep I had all year!! (smile) Having no pool was not that bad, who wants to swim in the pool with the beach right there. The Diamond Head grill is good, but very expensive. I enjoyed my experience 100%. The front desk was extremely nice and helpful. They knew exactly where to tell us to get to places and always had taxi's waiting.

<Content>W as WOW!!! We were finalizing our Hawaiian trip in Waikiki. We spent 2 nights at the W Honolulu. The people are friendly, the rooms are great within this small hotel (approx 47 rooms) that is remotely located from the croud (10 min walk). There are no swimming pools, no tennis, no kids, but we don't care! The ambiance is great. If we ever go back to Waikiki, we will stay there again and again.

<Content>Checked out after 1 night Booked here despite the bad reviews, mainly on the good reviews in Trip Advisor. We were on the 8th floor, so we could see above the parking lot, my collegue was on the 3rd and was looking at bumpers. The rooms are a good size, but sparse, no flat screen TV (isn't that a W must?), bathroom wasn't great, hallways outside motel style is odd, and NO Ocean View. I guess the only view rooms are at the end, the majority face Diamond Head side and you see a peek between the other towers between you and the Ocean. Cons:- bar opens at 5 PM? (please...)- food isn't served until 6 PM (not even aps at the bar?, c'mon)- rude bartender- no view- did I mention you can't get a drink until 5?- expensive for an OK room, lobby is nice, but tiny, like a living room- NO POOL- No real beach- Carpet stains (couldn't believe it, every review says it, and yes, my room had stains!)Pros:- across from a great park for running in the AM- staff was really nice to us, valet was quick, guys were helpful, front desk was greatWe moved after one night into Wikiki, Hilton Village, opposite end of the spectrum (only thing open), wanted the Shereton Surfrider)- Hilton is cheesy, but great view of the Ocean, many pools, can get a drink and people watch at any time and walk to dozens of restaurants and the beach is great (and there's a park down at that end to run at too!)

<Content>W stands for Worst--Beware!! If you want to stay at a hotel w/ rude staff, a lousy breakfast, no pool and terrible beach access this is your place. I had to re-read the positive reviews for this hotel to make sure that it was the same place. How in the world this hotel is under the W brand name is a complete mystery, but do not expect to have anything (e.g. room, service, and ammenities) remotely similar to any other W hotels. The signs may have been there: SPG transfers you to a completely different number for only this hotel. Apparently, the rumor is that the restaurant/lounge is a happening spot, but there were no signs of it when we stayed there, especially when they turned the lights on before midnight. We only stayed one night, but definitely long enough of a stay to thank our stars that we were moving on to another hotel on the Big Island. I could give examples of the staff lying to us, crummy service, walking through a parking lot to the 鈥渂each鈥?(a minuscule strip of sand which can, on a good day, maybe accommodate 12 people), but suffice it to say that if we stayed there any longer it would have ruined our vacation.

<Content>The Best Hotel. Period. This is the best hotel in Honolulu. True, its small and doesn't have some things the bigger hotels have, but its a lovely, charming hotel with the best service. The rooms are big, crisp and clean. They even clean the room TWICE a day. The bedsheets and towels are like heaven. The views are stunning, especially of Diamond Head. The staff at the hotel is SO GREAT. They know everthing, from food to fun. The restaurant is so-so. This hotel is truly worth the money, I have been back twice. Its tucked away from all the action, but yet 10 minutes walk from all the action! They treat you like a rock star at this W, I have been to 5 others in the US and this one is clearly the best, above and beyond. Highly, highly recommended.

<Content>Easy access to Kapiolani Park  After I booked my reservations learned that a sale of the hotel was to shortly close and it would no longer be managed as a Starwood or under the W brand. Was also worried about the noise, carpet stains etc. that others wrote about. However the sale fell through and it was reported that the hotel would be undergoing improvements and continue as a W Hotel.I was at the hotel for 10 nights -- had a corner room with two lanais (views of Diamond Head and slivers of ocean view past two other tall hotels that front the beach); although there were carpet stains, the floors were kept very clean, linens and bedding were extremely comfortable and the Bliss bathroom products were excellent. Room was on the 6th floor and never heard a sound from the club downstairs. Valet, desk and other service personnel were very courteous and accommodating. However dinner at their restaurant was so-so (although service was excellent). The location of the hotel is superb, particularly if you are a runner or walker because Kapiolani Park is just out the door, and Diamond Head Road around the corner --- the views are fantastic, not just of Diamond Head, but of the lighthouse, early morning surfers and there are two City beach parks that bring you right out to the ocean ... it is a two minute walk to the Hau Tree Lanai at the Kaimana Beach Hotel next door for a beachside breakfast. The W Hotel is at the edge of Waikiki, so you can avoid all the congestion or easily walk to it . . .Overall, was pleasantly surprised and would stay there again because of its location even though it has a very different feel from other W's.

<Content>Lovely but Loud! PROS: Great location, close enough to Waikiki (5-10 min walk) - but far enough to feel like a resort.Surprisngly nice room with great view.CONS:Awful nightclub that totally ruins the vibe, and draws rowdy crowd. Club noise kept me up for two nights straight. Secuirty dosen't care - and does nothing to calm the noise... Manager made it worse by telling me nobody above the 4th floor has ever complained. Yeah right.

<Content>Not what I have come to expect from the W The W website has indicated that after May 31, the W Diamond Head will no longer be a Starwood property. I guess that they realized what those of us unfortunate enough to have stayed there came to realize....that this property is simply not up to the W standard!My stays in other W's have been seamless - the service, facilities and properties themselves have all been top notch. Likwise, the service at the W Honolulu was remarkable, and fully met my expectations. Staff were seen and not heard, but always available and fully lived up to the whatever, whenever mantra. However, the facilities and property fell well short of the mark.Based on the information on the website and the rate charged in comparison to other Honolulu hotels, I were surprised upon arrival to find a 鈥渇ixer-upper鈥?located street-side, with limited beach access. The 鈥渆xclusive location鈥?is in fact in an aging building, sandwiched in a parking lot between three other hotels. The beach was accessible only by a narrow walkway through the parking lot, and was a tiny piece of sand with no facilities (washrooms, food service, umbrellas, etc). The room itself was clean with a fairly decent view of Diamond Head to the east, but there were stains on the carpeting and for the most part the room overlooked a parking lot. However, my biggest disappointment was learning that on Saturday evenings the restaurant becomes a makeshift 鈥渘ightclub鈥? So rather than enjoying a quiet evening, we were treated to loud club music that started at 10pm and continued until 2pm. The bass was so loud that the fixtures in the room were vibrating. We had spent the duration of the week on the North Shore of Oahu, and chose the W Honolulu because we thought it would be a classy, upscale retreat for our last night on the Island. Instead, we had a terrible evening because of the noise from downstairs and the street traffic attracted by it. While I realize that the W markets to certain demographics, it does not ultimately have complete control over the crowd it attracts on any given evening. The crowd, though, was a rough-looking, noisy, twenty-ish bar crowd 鈥?trashy is the word that comes to mind. I sincerely doubt that any of the hotel鈥檚 paying customers were patrons that evening. Service aside, there are simply better properties in Honolulu for the dollar that W charges.

<Content>Count me as a fan of this hotel I really like the W. I'm a recent re-transplant from Honolulu back to the mainland, and the W is my favorite place to stay when I to back to visit. The Gold Coast across Kapiolani Park is a fab location, much better than Waikiki; the views are awesome (facing up the coast, with water on one side and Diamond Head on the other); great balconies; good-sized rooms; pleasant furnishings and amenities; the hotel is quiet (other than a bit of nightclub noise for a few hours Friday and Saturday nights); and the staff is really nice. Though they don't publicize it very well (it took me two mornings to find it), their morning coffee setup in the restaurant now is actually a free little continental breakfast buffet - or you can order something off the menu.It's an especially great deal using SPG points - at a more than $300/night rate many times for the lowest tier room, 10,000 points for a stay gives a value of more than $.03 a point. And all rooms (other than the suites) are essentially the same, with the same views, other than height. Even the lowest 4th floor rooms, which are directly over the restaurant with balconies on the restaurant roof, have a nice view of Diamond Head - the only drawback being a bit louder nightclub noise on weekends.That said, it's not a traditional resort. No pool or other resort facilities, and it's not directly ocean-front. But Sans Souci beach is only a couple of buildings down, or you can jump in the water and get wet at a smaller patch of sand through the parking lot behind the Colony Surf apartment building. The W will provide you with free umbrellas and beach chairs for your stay.

<Content>Why, Starwood????? This place is a joke as far as Satrwood and the other W properties are concerned. The rooms are fine but compared to other places on the island it's a rip. You enter from the outer terrace walkways just like old 60's motels. To me, whatever real estate GENIUS bought this place for Starwood should be fired immediately. With no pool - it just DOES NOT make sense in Hawaii. The bars/restaurants are designed soooo cheesy.Problem is, this would be an awesome city for a wonderfully designed boutique hotel. Too bad W missed the boat...completely.You'll be disappointed and very upset if you stay here.

<Content>Not for me, but maybe for you I live in Honolulu so am very familiar with the areas, restaurants, beaches, etc. I stayed here with my husband for my birthday because we wanted a get-away but couldn't take the time to go farther afield. We got a good rate of just less than $200/night for an ocean view room on a high floor, corner with two lanais. We were disappointed. I was expecting a stylish room but the furnishings were sparse, the bedding was rough, and there were large stains on the carpet. The ocean view was largely obstructed by two other high-rise buildings (and we were on a high floor corner, keep in mind). If you seriously want an ocean view, stay somewhere else, otherwise ask for a high floor Diamond Head view because ultimately it is a better view.However, I can see how someone visiting Oahu would love the location because it is close enough to Waikiki to walk or take a short cab ride, but far enough away to feel more secluded.Other reviewers have noted that the beach there is not private, but everyone should know that there is no such thing as a private beach in Hawaii. ALL beaches in Hawaii are public, regardless of how expensive the hotel fronting them is. If you want to stay in this area, I would suggest looking into the New Otani hotel, which is right beside W but the ocean view rooms really do have an ocean view. Their prices are often cheaper too and facilities are comparable.

<Content>New definition of "ocean view" The property/room descriptions and pictures are misleading. While the staff was friendly, the room clean and spacious and the location convenient but away from the noise of Waikiki, the ocean views are over parking structures and through a maze of buildings located on the beach in front of the hotel. In other words, the W is not located on the beach. So, the phrase that I'll now look for is beach view. Furthermore, the W doesn't have a 'private' beach. Your choices are a smallish shared space with the Outrigger Canoe Club (private) in front of the Colony Surf, or, down the block at a public beach. Shade is hard to come by at both locations. The W supplies beach chairs and towels but not umbrellas. There is no beach service, so plan ahead for drinks and food. As mentioned by several other reviewers, we also had problems with delayed luggage delivery even though we tipped the bell boy when we dropped it off in the morning. I was underwhelmed by the property location and value but did find the staff helpful especially for local food recommendations.

<Content>We love the central location, however, this puppy is in need of some updating. We live in Florida, so we come for the mountains, and fabulous food. The location of the hotel is excellent (although the views are not!)The hotel overlooks Diamond Head and Kapiolani Park. It's just off the Strip in Waikiki, so you are close to the mayhem without having to deal with the traffic and noise.However, the hotel is sadly in need of a good scrubbing. The carpets are stained, and the walls are dirty. The maid service is spotty at bestIf you can use your Starwood points, then go for it.Otherwise, the Mandarin is a far better choice.

<Content>Hip  We stayed at the W over New Years this year and overall had a great experience. I chose the W because I prefer hip/trendy hotels to older more established hotels. I knew the W would be clean, so it was easy. As usual the whatever/whenever concierge service was great. Staying at a small hotel has so many advantages, especially in a tourist trap like Waikiki. Instant service when you need a taxi and they spend a lot of time helping you pick tours, etc. I knew there was not going to be a pool but realized that a pool is key when staying in hawaii. We had a very nice view from our terrace on the 7th floor. A full view of Diamondhead and we could see the ocean. Unfortunately we directly faced a parking lot but if you can get over that, you will enjoy spending time on the terrace. Definitely go to Russell's convenience store about 20 yds away if you want to stock your room with wine/water/food.The only negative was on New Years Eve. The hotel was having a party where tix cost $195 for dinner. That price was beyond outrageous. It didn't matter though b/c when we checkeed in they never told us about it so by the time we decided to figure out our dinner plans they were completely sold out,even for hotel guests. We decided to order room service (they confirmed 3x there would be a full menu) and sit on our terrace. BIG MISTAKE! When we called at 8pm they informed us there was only the late night menu (sausage, pizza, burgers). NOT the right menu for a romantic dinner. They gave us a menu for an Italian place, so we ate out of styrofoam. Not a great experience that night.

<Content>from a surfer My wife made all the arrangements for our vacation to Oahu. We stayed at the W and the location was so awesome (away from all the wall to wall sun worshipers at Waikiki). Our room had a beautiful view of Diamond Head. The service was five star and it was off the main drag, very quiet. We arrived without a guidebook and I wanted to find places to surf our bellman suggested we buy the new Oahu Trailblazer at the Booksellers shop downtown. It directed us to the north shore where we visited Haleiwa and I rented my board. If we had known about this place we would have stayed at the Turtle Bay Hotel which had the best location. We didn't go into the rooms but it looked as all had ocean views. For golfers, it looked like they had a scenic course and my wife hung out at the beach on the bay while I surfed. For shoppers and denizens of the night, Honolulu is the place to be. I guess you could say this island strikes a nice balance for tourists.

<Content>No view, lots of noise... -I've been in all rooms at this hotel, from the second floor thru the top floor and none have an ocean view, unless you are on the lanai, looking hard right thru the other truely ocean view buildings.-If you pay a discount rate such as Military, or Kama'aina as I do you will get a room on the second floor and will get no sleep as the restaurant/night club noise is unbearable.For what they charge for this old motel trying to be a 5 star hotel, just stay at the Halekulani or Kahala Mandarin.

<Content>Horrific Nightmare: Worst Management Ever If I could rate it zero or negative circles, I would.My friend and I reserved a room with 2 beds. Upon our arrival around 10 pm (2 am in the time zone we had just come from), we were tired and looking forward to getting rest and starting our holiday fresh. The front desk didn't have our room -- they only had rooms with one bed, which was unacceptable. I stay at W hotels regularly in New York, and had never had such a horrible experience. I called Starwood's Gold Preferred customer service as a member, hoping they could help. The only thing they could promise was that the hotel manager would contact us within 24 hours. The front desk offered to find us another hotel on the island for the night, but it was late and we just wanted to get settled and sleep--not have to come back the next day. After over 90 minutes of waiting, they miraculously found 2 rooms for us, each with one bed, with the objective of moving us the next day to an entirely new room.We had to unpack, repack, and unpack again, with each leg having to pay another gratuity to another bellhop. My friend and I agreed to deal with the hotel mistake after our holiday rather than let them ruin it, but the hotel manager never did contact us while we were there. The desk clerk who had been on duty to welcome us sent us a plate of fruit for making us wait 2 hours in the wee hours of the morning for beds.A week later I came home to an email from the hotel manager, which was sent a week ago on the second day of my stay. She intentionally failed to contact me while I was in her hotel, despite Starwood corporate headquarters' promise that the manager would contact us the next day. I responded to the email with my disappointment, only to have her lob the issue back to me with excuses about not confronting me.The worst part is that several more emails have been exchanged over the last few months, becoming increasingly hostile as the hotel manager failed to understand my concerns and I grew frustrated. I ended up with nothing but 10,000 Starwood points (enough for just one night) and a bad taste in my mouth altogether, having started from a very positive attitude about Starwood. I finally received a curt email stating that my file is closed, to which I responded again, copying the CEO of Starwood, to which I have not yet received a response on. As for aesthetics, this is not your normal city W. It's converted from a 70's looking midrise motel/apartment building, has open air hallways all the way up, and is decorated in a minimalist Balinese style that ends up looking cheap. The restaurant inside is Art Deco-ish and the food is pretty good but overpriced. On weekends it turns into a nightclub for an unappealing 18+ crowd. Waikiki is the Times Square of Hawaii -- touristy and nothing else, so only go there if you have to. If you want that crowded tourist trap, stay on the strip. If you must go to Honolulu but want to get away from that scene, stay at the Mandarin.

<Content>-W-onderful Like all Tripadvisor reviews, there's always good and bad. Since my review is wordy, here's the summary: Great service, nice rooms, easy location, super friendly staff. Our experience at the W has been spectacular, and that's not just Hawaii fever talking. In fact, we're staying right now while Tropical Depression Kenneth sweeps through, so we're spending more time than expected at the hotel. While I'll agree this W does not have the same sleek feel as the rest, the room is very nice (12th floor Ocean double) with very comfortable beds, clean white Colonial feel with simple clean furniture and a protected lanai. The ocean view is great, sweeping including Diamond Head. We were auto upgraded to this room from a Diamond Head view. The real star of this hotel is the service. Every single time, with no exception, we have been treated to big genuine smiles, chatty advice for food, travel, weather, etc, attentive front desk, special requests like an extra fan met immediately with a smile. I can't say enough nice things about this hotel. The removed location is a bonus, it's very quiet at night and feels special. Hop in the rental car and you're in the midst of everything in 2 minutes, or walk it in an easy strolling 10. Another bonus, the large park across from the hotel is a popular jogging spot, we have been making use of it (and enjoying all the bodies on display at the same time!). There is a tiny private beach behind the hotel for sunning, or walk less than 3 minutes to the public beach with your W chairs and towels. For friends of Dorothy, Queen's Beach is about a 5-7 minute walk, and there's plenty of family here at the W. Come here with an open attitude to enjoy and you won't be disappointed. Another tip...they are having a special right now for American Airlines elite members for Buy 1 day/Get 1 day free which makes it MUCH more affordable!

<Content>Starwood Perferred Guest Beware..... My husband an I had a wonderful opportunity to attend a wedding in Hawaii. We decided that we wanted to spend two nights prior to the wedding in Waikiki. I saw the W on the Travel Channel and My husband has stayed (and raved) about W hotels in NY San Fran and San Diego before. We also both travel extensively due to work and are Platnuim members of Starwood Perferred Guest Program. (which guareentees us best room at time of booking) We arrived early and were told our room would not be ready until check in time...Not a problem. We took a driving tour of the island ...We arrived back at five to find out luggage sitting in the middle of the lobby Where we left it 6 hours ago!!! Then the took us to the room. 4th floor with a view of the AC unit. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I was told when making the reservation that I would have both Diamond HEad and Ocean Views. The staff rudely told me that since I was using my points that I was to be givin the lowest quality room. And they did not follow the same guidelines as other starood properties. I called Starwood Perferred Concierge that is given to Platnium members such as myself explaining the situtation....The ocncierage tried to move us to a sister property but they were all booked. After much discussion betweem Starwood and the Property manager they were able to move us to the 6th floor, again no view, but no AC uinit either. And told us they could move us the next day.... Next day---told concierage we would be out of the hotel at 8 am and return around 1:30....we returned at 3 to discover room was not ready!!! They told us we have been prebooked for a specific rrom and they have not cleaned it yet. AFter the problems that happened the night before and the notification we gave them one would expect that they bend over backwordss to fix the problem...NO... Finally we again called starwood they switched rooms and gave us one to our satisfaction.Room was nice with small balcony. All views are obstructed by high rise buildings. Beds are very comforatble (to me --I like stiff matresses) Last bad note..After returning to the hotel from a very wonderful evening. We were deined entrance to the hotel unless we paid a cover charge. The lobby and bar turn into a club at 10pm. We had to find a hotel manager to tell the bouncer that we were hotel guests and not interested in clubbing. When I resecieved my bill there were two charges for $4 for Candy which we did eat They removed them right away. Some of the valets were excellent very helpful in recommending places to go.If I ever have the chance to stay in Waikiki I will stay either at the Manderin or another Starwood Property. Never Here again.

<Content>W is Great but not Wonderfull After reading the reviews prior to our arrival, we had low expectations. However there are lots of positives with this hotel. Location is great, if you are looking for a slightly off the normal path, with a quiet beach and peacefull area then this is for you. The hotel is small, only 45 rooms so little noise. The Bed and shower are awesome, as all W's. Room service is overpriced however Dinner at 10PM on the balcony is a memorable experience. This hotel is worth up to $220.00 per night, unless every other hotel is full, then take it for whatever price they are asking.

<Content>Whatever, whenever indeed! This is not a typical W. It lacks distinctive style, rooms are spacious but a little threadbare (wine stains on carpet), staff has a sulky, indifferent attitude. They answer the phone with Whatever, whenever and once we actually laughed because a woman who talked just like Carlton the Doorman answered, saying Whatever, whenever. How can I make your stay more incredible. This just felt typical of the desk staff -- they got our bill wrong and then seemed put out when we asked them to fix it for a second time. They don't have a business center and seemed put out when they let us use their (lousy) backoffice computer, which is the only option they gave us in the first place. They have a pet policy that includes $25 a night plus $100 up front for cleaning but they couldn't tell us what special cleaning they did and they put us in a room with a wine-stained carpet, filthy lanai, and broken ice-bucket. The price is high, even by Waikiki standards but you are away from the main beach, which I think is a positive. The restaurant is okay (6 dollars for espresso is a little much) and the bar is quite good (best Mai Tai in Honolulu). In Seattle, stay at the W. In Honolulu, try another hotel.

<Content>Great location and Friendly Staff! I read through the reviews before arriving at this hotel and was concerned but during my stay there were no problems at all. I have stayed at other W's and this hotel was different but is still a great place to stay. The staff was very friendly and made an effort to remember our names. The room was spacious and clean. The hotel has only one elevator so you have to be patient. Check in was fast and we were greeted with juice and cold towels. Continental breakfast (fruit, miso soup, juice, cereal, yogurt) was included but we also tried items off the regular menu and they were excellent. We also had dinner at the diamond head grill one night, it is actually quite well known and recommended. The hotel is working on building a fitness center but in the meantime they offer passes to use the facility at another hotel and the staff gave us water bottles and towels. The hotel is a 10-15 min. walk from the main area of waikiki so if you really want to stay in the heart of everything then this is not the hotel for you. This hotel is located in a quite residential area away from the crowds. There are 2 small beach areas behind the hotel and the staff was so helpful with giving us chairs and towels. Our room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was newly renovated and had a rain shower head. The bed was the standard W heavenly bed and was very comfortable. But, the best thing about this hotel is the staff, they are very friendly and willing to go the extra mile for you. For example, the bell hop negotiated a better taxi fare to Diamond Head for us even though we didn't ask him to because he thought the driver was charging too much! I highly recommend this place.

<Content>A good hotel for some This is a great hotel for people seeking the quieter end of Waikiki, and also for walkers. Kapiolani Park and the beach park are easy walks; there's also the hike up DH road to the lighthouse -- spectacular at dawn. For something more strenuous, the staff can direct you to the start of the trek up Diamond Head itself. I live in Honolulu, and often go to the W for a splurge, because it's small, and not a full-service, crowded resort. It's best to get a room on an upper floor; the corner units (25s) are the best for both a Diamond Head and ocean view, a constant parade of kayaks, outrigger canoes, sailboats. On a recent stay, room service was prompt and friendly, and I had excellently prepared local fish in the restaurant. I also appreciated the extensive wine list, including wines by the glass. Food prices are normal for a fine restaurant here; wines are less expensive. I could live without the cheesy disco music in the lobby, but once I get to my room, I'm fine.

<Content>not quite what we expected my fiance and i visited oahu in may 2004 with another couple and we had an amazing time overall! hawaii is wonderful and we would definitely go back. but the w hotel in diamond head, where we stayed, was not quite what we expected, especially for the money. the hotel is small (boutique), only 60 rooms or so. but aside from the mediocre restaurant which turns into a nightclub after 9pm, there was nothing else the hotel had to offer. no pool, no fitness room, no spa, no beach, nothing else but the rooms and the restaurant....and it is NOT directly on the beach as indicated by their website! in fact, the hotel shares property with a bunch of timeshare/apartment complexes that ARE on the beach and essentially, block any view you might get of the ocean at this hotel. when we asked about the beach, we were directed through a parking lot to a small private beach that was clearly shared with other buildings and was only big enough to host about 6 people...yuk!TIP: if you really want nice beaches, take a trip up to the north shore of the island. we found some beach spots that only had a dozen or so people on them...and it was mostly locals. it's a little windy up there but lovely none-the-less. waikiki beach is very touristy and crowded anyway...our room itself was fine. the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and modern, and the air conditioner worked just fine. those are 3 basic requirements for me for any resort destination. but, much to my disappointment, we had a view of the parking lot from our room, and if you looked closely enough, you could see a snippet of the ocean through the palm trees beyond. perhaps it is because we were on a lower floor? maybe from the top floor you could see better but i'm doubtful. you also had to lean way over and crain your neck from the balcony to see diamond head....but perhaps that was just the side of the hotel we stayed on. the w has an anything, anytime policy whereas if you name it, they can make it happen for you. we ask for and received free beach chairs and towels that we took to other beaches on the island. my fiance and i didn't take advantage of this policy as much as our friends did (they ordered room service and champagne) and they were satisfied...not blown away. depending on what you're looking for, the hotel is further down the beach from all the other hotels and hubbub. so if you don't mind it being out of the way a bit and being in a quieter part of the beach, then you're fine. my fiance and i didn't mind making the 30 minute walk to and from waikiki (a little exercise never hurt anyone), and walking back at night was delightful, especially along the edge of the water where we just listened to the waves and looked up at the moon. tres romantique!all in all, it was ok at the w. if i were to go back to oahu, i might choose to stay at one of the other hotels that had everything there. or perhaps we will visit another island all together!three great places to eat on oahu: CHEF MAVRO (downtown), SAM CHOY'S, and some little hamburger joint up on the north shore but i can't remember the name! all were outstanding and we're still talking about our dining experience to this day! also, my friend dave swears by a bakery called LEONARD'S where they make these things called malasatas. check it out!

<Content>Not what you'd expect of a W Yucky hotel.. looks like it was converted from a motel. rooms open to the outside, the bed was hard as a rock, and if you're used to the usual luxury accomodations of most W's, don't stay here!

<Content>MICE PROBLEMS The W Hotel has really gone downhill since its change of owners. Used to be an okay hotel with balinese style decor. Now the decor looks old and is in need of updates, they have scimped on wait help so the service is extremely bad and THEY HAVE MICE PROBLEMS! A bit scary as we were coming home from dinner one night, a small little creature went scurrying across the floor to our horror! Do not stay here.

<Content>Stay somewhere else!! We were evacuated at 1:30 AM because of a threat to the hotel. They never told us what that threat was. Were promised an amentity and a room upgrade when we checked in b/c we were on our honeymoon. Never received anything. We should have researched more before going. Definitely will never go back.

<Content>Under Staffed Employees Inexperienced and Inefficient My office manager booked a corporate retreat with this hotel. The concierge desk as well as the enire hotel is staffed with inexperienced employees. I had to follow up on some issues - in room massages scheduled for 2pm when check-in is at 3pm (for starters). Concierge refused to grant 1 hour early check in. This mistake was due to both my Office Manager and the Concierge not noticing the conflict in times. When I caught it however the concierge and the MOD would not accommodate us. The concierge made the mistake of assuming that my Office Manager was my boss (wrong) and dealt with me on a VERY informal level - told me they only have 3 maids for the entire hotel, etc. I had to tell him to print out a list of people checking out, checking for their Starwood numbers (to see if they might ask for late check out). The true deal breaker is that this hotel's reservation's system is not linked with corporate - claimed the link was down (?). In any case I had to have someone PHYSICALLLY go to the hotel to clean up the reservations. The front desk person would not help me and the MOD just said that they were 鈥淥K鈥?she would not givenme written confirmation. The attendees were all arriving at different times and since there were roommates the rooms HAD to be right (not to mention in room massages). When I finally got the MOD to accommodate 3 rooms 1 hour early for the massages she got snippy with me saying that I cannot have 4 rooms. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. I NEVER asked for 4 rooms early! I kept asking her if she had my fax in front of her and she kept saying yes. Then she haughtily walked me through the list - when she realized I only asked for 3 rooms she brushed it off. These are just one or 2 of the myriad problems I encountered (eg: cancelled one room and the room was never cancelled). How many times do I have to say, 鈥渢his is all on one bill?鈥?When the individual I sent down to clear things up was leaving he said the front desk person chased him down in the parking lot and asked is this all on one bill? - he HAD JUST TOLD HER THAT 3 MINUTES BEFORE. He even asked if he should sign a separate slip for each room, etc. I travel a great deal and I expect some inefficiency on the hotel staff's part - especially in a large hotel. This however was out of control. NOTHING went right. And they only have 47 rooms! The absolute low point is when the concierge made fun of the way I said 鈥渃ash.鈥?This was after he argued with me on how to bill those dang massages 鈥?I said just put them on the rooms (all rooms were being paid for by the company). He got snippy and said 鈥渟o you are making your people pay for their own massages?鈥?I said no, we are paying for everything so just put it on the room. Around and around we went until he finally said he was going to put ALL the massages on the room of the credit card holder. Whatever. Then he starts referring to my 鈥渂oss鈥?the Office Manager. By this time I have had it with his attitude 鈥?for goodness sake he and the Office Manager started all the drama with the massage booking time snafu. Then he makes fun of the way I say cash. Buh-bye W Honolulu. And good riddance.

<Content>Excellent service, great comfort We experienced very high quality of service. Since it's a small hotel, concierge will remember your name, which made us feel so at home and well taken care of. The view of the diamond head and partial ocean was beautiful. What I liked the most about the room is the sliding door which opens very wide. Continental breakfast was very tasty unlike other hotels' continental breakfast which is usually not fresh. The only disadvantage is the location. Since we wanted to go eat in the center of Waikiki, we had to take a cab every time. And since the location is little far, a cab might not come right away (one time it took 20 minutes or more). We had a rental car, but we didn't wanna pay for high rate of parking in Waikiki. But at the same time, it would be a nice walk through the beach park if you have enough energy (I was few months pregnant then). And the location is the key element in giving W the serenity. I recommend this property to those who are not traveling with kids and who's seen most of Waikiki area before and looking for something little different.

<Content>Comfortable - but not the quality paid for While the W Diamond Head is certainly a comfortable Hotel, it is a Hilton with neat decorations. They are pricing this on par with the Halekalani and the Mandarin Oriental and it is way short of being in that league. This would be a fair value at about half the price.

<Content>Amazing time at the W Honolulu We just got back from the W Honolulu. This was truly on of the BEST hotels that we have ever stayed at. The staff was incredible! One afternoon I asked the concierge to book a hair appointment for me. I unfortunately lost track of time while I was at the beach. When I arrived back the 3 valet guys went out of their way to book me a new appointment within walking distance of the hotel. Within five minutes they had each called 3 salons and found one that could take me immediately. Now THAT is service. The concierge was amazingly courteous and helpful. She booked numerous events for us. Also, because this is a small hotel everyone addresses you by name. It's a really nice touch. By the end of our stay we would get off the elevator and the front desk crew would already have fresh towels, sand mats, chairs and cold water bottles ready for us to take out to the beach.The lobby is beautiful. Burning candles, fresh apples, a huge asian influenced round table with cushions on the floor, a comfy red velvet bed with stacks of books next to it, the list goes on..........Our room was beautiful. It was on the third floor and we had a view of Diamond Head. The bed was deliciously comfy. Six, huge fluffy pillows, crisp white sheets, and a mattress that you melted in to.We always had our balcony doors opened. It was so relaxing to watch the palm trees swaying and to hear the tropical birds right outside our windows. Perfect for that afternoon nap. I was also impressed with the great quality bath towels and the Aveda bath products. It truly is the little things that make this a hotel a 10!! I've read the other reviews that warned about the loud night club. My husband and I LOVED the night club. It was nice to bypass the line as we arrived back from dinner. You just flash your room key and your warmly welcomed back. The club has a great vibe. We returned to our room by about one, and yes we could hear some music, but it wasn't overly annoying. Maybe a higher floor would have been quieter. We were able to fall asleep without a problem. This is definately a hotel that we will revisit!!

<Content>Did not like the W at all I feel the property was misrepresented. They claimed they had a stunning view of the ocean when in fact it is very obstructed and the property is NOT ocean front. The rooms are nice but nothing that special. No pool, no gym, no business center. Friendly employees but not much else to offer. I would definitely recommend looking somewhere else.

<Content>The W Honolulu is a great W The W Honolulu is a great W Hotel property. We stayed there the last two nights of our honeymoon before returning to the mainland, it was a great way to finish up our trip.All the W Hotels are a bit funky and stylish, don't come to the W Honolulu expecting your typical Hawaiian resort vacation. We have previously stayed at W Hotels in San Fran and New Orleans, the general ambience is the same at all 3 with a bit of tropical flavor permeating the Honolulu property.Our room was on the 8th floor, we had a great view of Diamondhead. The ocean view wasn't great (obstructed by other near-by hotels and appartments), but if you want the beach you can walk 30 seconds and be on Waikiki Beach.If you're looking for a more cosmopolitan experience to complement your laid-back Hawaiian beach vacation, definitely check out the W.

<Content>Beware of the disco/restaurant The other reviews are correct when they describe views of the parking lots. Also the diamond head view is only if you come out all the way on your balcony and look far to the left. But the rooms were nice enough and private enough that I could overlook that. The thing I want to warn about is the restaurant that turns into a nightclub from 10 to 2am. If you are looking to go to bed between this time because of .... jet lag, forget it. It is horribly loud. The management handled my complaints very well, and I appreciate that. But in my opinion they should NEVER book rooms on the bottom 2 floors (I dont know what it is like above that) during the weekend. No one should have to pay to endure that, its not a cheap stay.
