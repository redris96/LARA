<Content>Hotel Adagio is Horrible My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Adagio and the night manager made rude and offensive comments to both of us about being Americans and told us to get out of the hotel after we had asked him to stop it. Although the location is very good, we checked out immediately and went to a nearby hostel with wonderful management where we felt safe.

<Content>Too noisy The location is excellent for getting around the central city on foot. The desk staff was friendly. Rooms were small but adequate. The rooms and lobby were clean. Noise was a huge issue. This is a very young area, with hostels, bars and restaurants, and night-owls. Street noise kept us from sleeping soundly until about 3 am, and it seemed that as soon as the partying stopped, the city sanitation (garbage) crews were out. Closed windows barely muffled the noise, and even earplugs didn't work.We also got a lot of noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms. The cleaning staff's station was right outside our door, so starting at about 8 am and lasting until we left for the day, we heard the banging of brooms and mops and the rustling of plastic laundry bags.All in all, it was almost impossible to get more than 4 - 5 hours of sleep each night. I'd say that while the biggest advantage of the hotel is its location, that is also its biggest disadvantage because of the constant noise.

<Content>great location This hotel was is a great location to all things touristy. Very easy to find, right btw the KFC and McDonalds. Hotel staff was helpful and spoke English. I loved the FREE internet access (9am 鈥?midnight). Very clean rooms and a nice bathroom. Noise is an issue but just bring some earplugs and you will be fine. BFK is rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, coffee/OJ. The one thing that I did not like was cigarette smoke from the other room filtered into my room and there was no air conditioning.

<Content>very basic We stayed at the Adagio Easter 2008. This is a very basic hotel. The rooms are not sound proofed and the hotel is very noisy. We requested near rooms as we had 2 children (14,16) but rooms 3 floors apart. Staff not helpful at changing rooms, but always very polite. The rooms were chalk and cheese. One had air conditioning, heating, large window opening onto large tiled area and was spacious. The other was small, no light, window couldn't be opened because smell from small enclosed passage outside was so bad. It had no air conditioning. Both bathrooms were brand new with new hairdryers, but you were not allowed plugs for sinks or bath.The breakfast was very nice and lady serving helpful and pleasant. The hotel is very well situated for Las Ramblas and port. It is a good location for tourist buses as well.There was free internet access via a laptop in reception at all times.

<Content>good location, surly staff this hotel was in an excellent location but the rooms were VERY basic and the staff were quite unhelpful to be honest. I would stay on the same street again but not this hotel.They had a bizarre policy of making you leave your keys there at night which i was not happy about. Also although we booked a double they gave us a twin room. The location of our room was also not great as the doors werent soundproof at all and we were right by the top of the stairs to our floor and the lift entrance.It was ok but not really anything to write home about. Fab location though. If you want cheap and not cheerful then stay here.

<Content>Good location and budget price The Hotel Adagio has a good central location near Placa Jaume and walking distance to Placa Catalunya. A Metro stop is one block away. Plenty of restaurants nearby, though most cater to tourists. 15 minute walk to coast. I stayed in a single room that was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and modern. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only complaint is that it can be noisy at night from the streets below. I would stay here again.

<Content>Beautiful Barcelona Barcelona is a beautiful city, full of character, verve, vibrancy, culture, history and for me, most importantly, the home of what is one of the wonders of this age and probably the most awesome building I have visited despite the fact it probably won't be finished in my lifetime, the Sagrada Familia - an anochronism if ever there was one but one an anochronism! If God were writing a trip advisor review of the Familia Sagrada he would extol its virtues and give it an excellent rating.But I am not God and I stayed in a far more down to earth establishment - the Hotel Adagio just off La Rambla. I was on a lone visit and the room was small despite having a good size double bed which at first seemed rather hardish but afforded good rest qualities. The room was simply decorated and the furniture was in keeping with the ambience - perfectly adequate for my short stay with a large wardrobe with plenty of shelf space. It would be unjust to judge the adequacy for a couple staying at the hotel because I booked a single room but the room I stayed in would have been rather too cramped for more than one - even if the couple were on exceptionally good terms! Other rooms might well have been bigger. The room had a veranda which looked out onto an extremely narrow street - one hopes that the person living opposite would not peer down from the balcony at the same time otherwise heads might bump - no not that bad but certainly 'intimate'! By the way, no sign of druggies or ladies of the night as mentioned in another review( not that I was looking for either!).The bathroom was small but very clean. The shower was fine - powerful and with temperature control easily achieved. Interestingly, the shower appeared to double as a bath which was adequate for a child until they understood the meaning of the term NSPCC. But then a family would not have been staying in this room.Bed linen, towels, room cleanliness were all of an exceptionally hight level and I really must commned the lovely ladies who kept the room spotless and were very civil and happy to smile. Well done Adagio!The reception staff were excellent - and I use the term advisedly. They were friendly, courteous, smart, helpful and all I encountered spoke excellent English. Very commendable indeed. They were happy to print out my priority Ryanair boarding pass for my return flight - free!!There was a continuous humming from the heating/ac system which took a while to get used to but I mention this only in passing. Walls seemed rather thin and conversation could be heard from adjoining rooms. Television had CNN and plenty of indigenous channels.Breakfast was typically continental - croissants, buns, cereal, jams, meats, cheese and a good selection of hot and cold drinks. It was rather more limited in variety than other hotels I have stayed in but a perfectly adequate start to the day and for the price paidI got this hotel at a bargain price and quite frankly, I'd be happy to stay again. It is central and immaculately clean with a friendly staff. f you sleep lightly then you might want to look elsewhere - the noise is not the fault of the hotel, just the result of its location.It's a 2 star tourist hotel so don't expect the Ritz but for someone like me on a tight budget I can recommend this hotel as an ideal base for Barcelona. It is certainly better than the previous hotel I stayed in in Barca which was 3 star.

<Content>Great location, simple hotel If one word can characterize this hotel, it must be location. The hotel is located right next to the busy Rambla boulevard in Barcelona. My father and I were going for a cruise starting from Barcelona, so I chose this hotel for its location, hoping that we will have some time for a concentrated city tour before we board the boat. And I was right. This hotel is conveniently located close to all major attractions on my visiting list. Before I arrived I was a bit worried after having read somewhere that this hotel is located in the red-light district. But what a wonderful lively area it was, full with activities, people, bars, restaurants. So my worry disappeared right away. The only problem was the street Ferran is mostly pedestrian and not open for traffic, that was what my taxi driver told me, who left me at the city hall square from where I have to drag my luggage to the hotel, about 3-5 minutes. But it was really not a problem.I booked a single room, clean, quiet, basic. The TV did not work. But I didn't come here to watch BBC anyway. The bathroom was perfect, no problem with leaking water or drainage. My father's room has a window facing a horrible looking well so he had the curtain down all the time. My room window is facing a small side street, very quiet. The breakfast was basic, toast, juice from the machine, and coffee. I read that there was free wifi internet available, and it turned out only the laptop computer in the lobby was connected. And there was only one so you have to queue. The staff at the lobby was efficient and spoke good English.I wouldn't mind to stay in the same hotel if ever I come back to Barcelona. It's basic, but I pay for what I get.

<Content>budget hotel A budget hotel is true.Found the staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Rooms were basic furniture and the colour scheme let it down the dark finish of the furniture and the curtains made the room look dreary. On the other hand the bathroom was much better clean and nicely finished.Agree with other reviews very noisy with balcony door open as could be heard very early hours in morning.Overall okay but would pay more to stay at better hotel next time.

<Content>Best 2 star hotel in Europe The hotel is located on the BEST street, in the BEST location in Barcelona. The reception people are always at 100% sold out and they told me that no less the 50 times a day they turn people away who just try and walk in, or book the day before. The rooms were clean, large for Europe, and have a little balcony that when you close the doors, it is sound proof. The beds are SUPER small, no joke folks, but for the price, you can鈥檛 beat it. I have stayed in all sorts of hotels, bb鈥檚 and so forth, and even if I had a huge budget, I would stay at this hotel again. 2 stars is given only because there is no mini bar, or satellite TV鈥?so what right? Location, location, location, clean fun rooms, a staff with humor and wit. A great place for the young at heart and ready to go woop it up in the Gothic quarter. This place was 10+. PS 鈥?Ramblas is for those who like Las Vegas. The gothic quarter is more for those like love New York.

<Content>Great stay at Adagio My friend and I booked a weeks holiday in Barcelona, Spain for our mid- year holiday.We arrived from Girona airport and took a shuttle bus to the bus station.After obtaining a map we were able to orient oursleves to the Las Ramblas.The hotel was very easy to find. It is situated near a McDonalds on the Lamblas. Unfortunately due to our travel agent ( GOING PLACES ) forgetting to book the hotel for us ( as we got a package) The hotel had no record of our stay. Even though we had receipts and confirmation of our OWN booking. The receptionist was very good to us........ Despite not being able to speak Spanish he gave us a single room with a single bed and I got the stretcher- Which i must add was comfortable anyway. -- What happened was a bit of a nuisance but I wasn't going to let it get to me on my first european trip.The hotel was very clean and facilites very good. I did not find it noisey. The room had a extra curtain cover to prevent the strong rays of the sun from coming in. In the morning we had a nice breakfast consisting of Cerals, breads, hot chocolate and juices. The staff were very friendly and helpful--- though one of the night receptionists did scare me as he looked like a relative of the mafia.The hotel has an excellent location and I would recommend it for any friends who are travelling as its a cost effective place.I would stay here again.Barcelona is my favourite european city and I would return any day

<Content>Noisy But Nice My wife and I arrived at the Adagio after being dropped off by the taxi driver at the end of C Ferran as no vehicles are allowed at certain times. We then found we had to spend a night at a nearby Hoteldue to a problem with our room. However, the remaining six days of our stay were OK. The room and its facilities were kept clean and although it was a little faded/battered it was comfortable enough. The soundproofing if it existed was ineffective but the only disturbance we experienced was from young English tourist's lack of consideration for others. Not something I can blame on theHotel. The breakfasts were continental and more than adequate supervised by pleasant staff. The front desk staff were also helpfuland generally cheerful. Overall, a pleasant experience I would recommend it for younger visitors who want to be in the centre of things. Given the excellence of the Barcelona transport systemolder visitors could perhaps find quieter accommodation further from the Barcelona centre.

<Content>Basic but cosy! I stayed at Hotel Adagio last April and it was a pleasant experience. The location near Las Ramblas is perfect and the staff was very friendly, especially the breakfast lady. The breakfast itself was quite basic with bread, coffee, juice, and cereals but always fresh. Our room was tidy and comfortable. The price was also relatively modest. Perfect for those who want to see the beautiful city instead of spending time at the hotel.

<Content>A very good simple hotel My wife and I stayed here for October half term week.Very well positioned. Our room was mostly quiet enough. Comfortable, clean. The breakfast was very good, expecially for a modest sized hotel. An excellent budget hotal.2 possible odditiesa) the Thompson brochure suggested satallite TV. Unfortunately, no English speaking channels!b) No plugs in the basin or bath. which does not seem to be a good way of saving waterWe are happy to recommend.

<Content>Great Position For Travelers On A Budget I have given this hotel a mark of above average but this is pretty much for the location and cost.I have no complaints about the hotel, it was clean and was reasonably well decorated which is all you can ask for at a price of 拢80 for a twin room, and that is the massive plus point of this hotel.For 拢80 we got a clean hotel and room which is in perfect position a minutes walk from the Ramblas and a minutes walk from the heart of the Gothic Quarter.If you're in Barcelona and looking for a luxury hotel to pamper yourself in then this isn't for you, but if you are looking for a place on a budget which is a place to get a night's sleep and be in a great position then it's perfect.

<Content>Good value hotel We have just returned from a week's stay at the Adagio hotel and just wanted to say this was a great find in a great location. No, it wasn't luxurious or anything but provided good value accomodation in the heart of this busy area.All the staff (reception, cleaning staff, breakfast staff) were friendly and helpful. Rooms were basic but adequate, the double glazing helped tremdously on cutting down the noise. The area is noisy so don't expect a great night's sleep, but lets remember it is a city and the area is popular for bars and eating places.Ask about the safe (not in room) at reception, the secure boxes are in a secure room and can be used for 3 euro per day.The breakfast was a buffet which offered meats, cheese, bread rolls and cereal, a machine provided the coffee (which was a little disappointing) and also water and juice. All fine with us and kept us fed and watered easily up till lunch and sometimes till evening.The rooms have a balcony (ours looked out over a side street, I notice some reviews say this is a problem, we didnt find this at all and in fact it meant it was a slightly quieter room than being on the main street)In terms of area you are right by a metro line (great to hop on and off, especially with a ten trip pass), you are near to La Rambla (great for wandering, keep tight hold of your bag though), but for me the best thing was how close we were to the Gothic quarter and all the sights that bringsAll in all we had a great week in a busy bustling city (that got very hot while we were there). This hotel for me was a great find, cheap(ish), great location and provided a useful base for all our jaunts around this great city.

<Content>Worst hotel ever stayed in! The worst hotel we have ever stayed in. We booked a triple room through a UK-based hotel company, but were given a single-size room with 3 beds in that you could not walk around and, in order to open the window or watch TV you had to move one of them each time. To negotiate the toilet in the bathroom you had to squeeze past the wash basin. There was 'air conditioning' that came out of only part of the battered unit and was totally useless, and the bedding was dirty, plus, there were fire hazard ceiling tiles which would not be allowed in the UK. It was dark and unkempt and totoally unwelcoming. When we asked for another room, the reception guy just shrugged his shoulders and said to get another hotel which, with the help of our booking company, we did, but we had to sleep in this awful hotel overnight first, which was very hot and smelly. The breakfast consisted of a few tasteless and dry pastries, nothing hot at all, and was presided over by an equally unfriendly old woman, who didn't acknowledge us or smile once. Knowing that we were moving out, the hotel would not let us stay until we could check in later that afternoon- even though we had paid for 6 nights - as they said they had already given our room to someone else. No wonder then, that we were so pleased to see the back of the place and move to a 4-star hotel further up, in the much nicer Modernista area.We had chosen La Rambla as our base, due to having our son with us, and my current mobility problem, so it was an inconvenience to us to move hotels but, given the cirumstances, we had no choice, and we were able to see a lot of Gaudi's buildings close by.We have stayed in a lot of hotels and understand that this is only a 2-star, but the state of the hotel and unfriendliness makes it the worst. Our booking company said they were going to remove the Adagio from their list, which is very wise. It might be OK for single, young packpackers, but for a family it is hopelessly inadequate.On a general point about Barcelona: In high summer, it is very busy, noisy and stinks, due to the poor drainage. Plus, the service is generally very slow. However, we did not experience any of the pickpockets we had read about, thankfully.Tip: Don't waste your money on the boat trips, the scenery isn't exactly stunning and the glass bottom aspect only works when it's tied up in the harbour beforehand.DO go on a city tour on a bus turistic and get a feel for what Barca has to offer, then you can return. And, finally, make an early start, because every attraction gets packed by midday, especially the tram and funicular railway up to the Tibidabo mountian (which has a great theme park at the top, next to a magnificent church with giant statue of Christ).

<Content>Nearly Perfect Stayed in Adagio in Mid JUN 2006. Location and the hotel qualify is great. Staff is very friendly and everything is within walking distance. Breakfast is good. The drawback is the wireless internet is not working that well. But overall, i will be delighted to stay in this hotel when return to BCN.

<Content>Great Budget Hotel You get what you see! On the Plus + :1. Its Very Clean2. Excellent location - your slap bang in the centre of everything and this is what your paying for.3. Nice bathroom with good warm shower4. Free Internet5. Excellent Staff, friendly, helpful, you feel safe - they don't let anybody in the hotel and the doorway is always manned by the receptionist.6. Don't have to checkout till midday.And the bad1. Your in a box room about 8 meters by 8 meters (and the bathroom 6m by 6m)but your never going to be in it much, its good enough for sleeping.2. The breakfast is rubbish i wouldn't bother if u have the chance to opt out. There are plenty of bars serving full english breakfasts or whatever u want for 3 euros.The hotel breakfast consists of cornflakes, bread, coissant and bun, jams and butter and tea coffee or hot chocolate...and thats it!3. Your room can either have No view or be Noisy...if u have a room at the back u look directly onto another set of rooms in a square 1m by 1meter, if u have a room on the front its damn noisy! I'd recommend going for the back room and not bothering with a view.Also the rooms don't have much natural light.4. The walls are thin and u can hear people walking round. Recommendation , take some ear plugs they do the job perfectly.I'd recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to go and see Barcelona we spent 6nights at this hotel,we just slept in it and that was it.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location I stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend from 17 November until 21 November 2005 and I consider it a simple but nice hotel.It corresponded exactly to our expectations.We wanted a nice and clean hotel but not to expensive.The most important to us was the location, and we were very happy with that. For a 2 star hotel it wasn't cheap (we payed 鈧?90,00 for a double room each night) but we payed for the location, wich was great. In a very busy street near the Ramblas (3 minutes walking from Liceu subway station) it was great for going out at night to have a drink at Barri Gotic (going out at night was also one of our goals). For the cultural visits it was also very good because we can visit the Barri Gotic, El Born and Barceloneta by foot and for the other important visits (Sagrada Familia, Casa Battl贸, Casa Mil谩 La Pedrera...) we have the metro near to do that kind of visits.Final note: Good hotel for a 2 star hotel, clean, professional and helpful staff, but the most important it's definitely the great location.DIOGO COSTA - Lisbon, Portugal

<Content>It's all good Well i was a bit nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews! Well i need not have been.Clean  Basic i would say sums up this hotel. Breakfast very good. Hotel staff very friendly - Most did not speak much English but they went out of there way to help you. The only thing i would say is the beds are a little hard. However you are in Barcelona so a few glasses of Vino and the problem solved!As for it backing onto an alley of Drug Dealers and Hobo's. That is UNTRUE and unfounded! It is not AT ALL. It is off a main road of the La Ramblas (Ferran) Which is a busy lively street, Full of Locals  tourists alike. I felt safe and welcome in this hotel throughout my stay.

<Content>Second Visit I have visited this hotel twice and have had a great time each time. The views are not great but who wants to stay in their hotel when you are only away for a few days? Always clean and staff are friendly and very ready to help. The hotel has a great location and is very easy to find especially if you have had a few too many sangrias!

<Content>Great location/hot water and clean bathroom First impressions thought it was a youth hostel, after a good walk round found the location was great if you want some authentic city life and culture you have to see both sides of life in the city not just the touristy bits yes there were drug dealers but hey they are all over the world. Breakfasts were superb staff sometimes helpful, rooms small and tried to be too modern in an old building too much teak effect furniture but after a few days enjoying Barcelona we only slept there and as I said the bathroom was clean and plenty of hot water. This is more of a two star than a three but good value for price.

<Content>Not bad, besides the view! Staff were very friendly, and the hotel is in an okay area - though we did find ourselves wandering into what appeared to be a red light area! Local cafes and restaurants nearby are nice, and very reasonably priced. Only problem I would have with the hotel is that it was very dark (all hallway lights are generally turned off - and there are no windows in the hallway) and that the view isn't exactly great. Ours was into a small enclosed space surrounded by the windows of other rooms.Besides that though, it was nice enough!Would definitely use again

<Content>Cool Breakfast! This hotel is quite basic for the price, but it is in such a good location that it is worth it. The rooms are tiny but everything is really clean, and there are so many great bars within a stone's throw that we spent very little time in the hotel! The breakfast is excellent, and is served until 10.30, my only complaint is that the air conditioning was too cold on a night and it cannot be turned off [as well as the man in the apartment opposite who insisted on painting naked, but that's another story!]

<Content>excellent location we stayed at the addagio over the valentines weekend this year. it is a very basic 2 star bed and breakfast hotel, but is exceptionally clean and comfortable. its location is superb, just off las ramblas in the gothic quarter. i would reccommend it to anyone, and hopefully if we return to barcelona we will stay there again.

<Content>Livin' rough This hotel was the pits. Our balcony overlooked a smelly alleyway where drunks and drug dealers slept in doorways. The room was no bigger than a boxroom and there were holes in the wall and electricity wires hanging down from the holes. From what I could see many of the hotels in this area of Barcelona were hovels.My advice would be to pay a little more and keep away from dingy little places like this.
