<Content>Great find in a beautiful city Stayed at this gem of a place over the christmas weekend and really enjoyed it. The location was very good, in the Southern Canal Belt which was close enough to all the major attractions without feeling too touristy, and the tram links were frequent and convenient. After reading the previous reviews was actually prepared for a small closet room but the bedroom was pleasantly spacious and definitely one of the bigger ones I've seen in Europe. The complimentary minibar was a nice finishing touch, and the Living Room reception area, with a cheery fire and free flow of drinks and snacks, was a lifesaver for those cold Amsterdam afternoons..All in all, a great place and would not hesitate in recommending to anyone

<Content>Fantastic hotel - a real find in Amsterdam I stayed here on two occasions, each for one night, on business. This is a top quality hotel in a great location in Amsterdam (right on one of Amsterdam's lovely canals). The staff were helpful, friendly and polite from the minute I walked in the door and till the minute I left. Not speaking Dutch is no problem as all the staff I spoke to have excellent English skills.The room was tastefully and stylishly decorated. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom facilities were well presented and very clean. The room was typical size for European hotels, but I didn't actually feel cramped or cluttered, and the furnishings and decor were really attractive and created a pleasant atmosphere.It is the little things that really make this place stand out. For example, there is a small minibar in the room - and it's completely included. There are spirits, beer, wine - all included in the price. Downstairs in the lounge, near reception, there is also a drinks/nibbles bar, from mid-afternoon onwards, where you can get free drinks and nibbles. No charge for anything - that includes more expensive drinks like Baileys, Tia Maria, etc as well as a range of wines, beers, and other spirits. There is also a nice selection of nibblies (cheese, crackers, nuts, olives).The hotel provides two internet browsing stations in the lounge - and they're free to use, as well. And breakfast is also included in the room rate. Breakfast is great - a very good selection of cereals, fruits, cold meats, and some hot food (bacon, sausages) and they will make you your eggs however you like them (scrambled, fried, omelette etc). It really conveys a much more personal feel than most hotels in most big cities.It's also quite conveniently located - about a 10 minute walk to Anne Frank's house (and the Prinsengracht area in general, which borders on the lovely Jordaan region, with lots of interesting shops, small streets, cafes), very close to the flower market, and the canal bus has a stop not too far away (fantastic option when you're too tired to do any more walking!) Overall, this was a real find. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Nothing ever seemed too much trouble for the staff, and the quality and service were excellent.

<Content>Wonderful Staff  The Banks Mansion was exactly as advertised. A truly comfortable stay in the heart of Amsterdam. The staff were clea rly very well trained as well as being excellent linguists. They looked after our every need without being in the least servile. They clearly understood the meaning of hospitality and professionalism.One word of warning, we booked our one night through Expedia, two days before we travelled, they charged us 拢50 extra so book direct! Expedia refused to make a refund.

<Content>My Favourite Hotel I've stayed in quite a few hotels around Europe over the last few years, and at Bank Mansion I had my best ever hotel experience. In a world full of soulless chains and dives, this character laden gem is really one of a kind.We visited the hotel (couple, mid twenties) Nov '08 on a short weekend trip to Amsterdam. The staff were very kind, courteous and as everything in the hotel was complementary, I feel that they treated all customers the same.Free Bar! Seriously. Couldn't believe it. Beer in the fridges, wine on ice, bottles of spirits, mixers, coffee machine and always a selection of nibbles (cheese, nuts, olives, etc). Free drinks in the room as well!!!Other reviewers complained about the size of the room, room service options etc. But they obviously chose the wrong hotel for their needs. I hate being ripped off, so I never order room service or use minibars, or watch pay per view films. Here there were no hidden charges. No charge for Breakfast, minibar, bar, internet etc. It drives me up the wall when you book a posh hotel for a hefty sum and are forced to pay extra to use the internet or watch a film or whatever. So I suppose it's all relative. Some won't like this hotel. But I stand by what I said earlier, you are treated better at Banks Mansion because nobody is paying extra. The staff don't look down at you because you haven't racked up a massive drinks/food bill or aren't booking in for hourly herbal massage treatments. With all the conventions, hidden charges etc, I've found it hard to be truly comfortable in highly rated 5 star hotels that I've visited.Others: Room was nice, stylish. Bathroom gorgeous. No view, but didn't request one (2 day stay in November....)Lobby and Living room area were also very stylish and comfortable. Nice realistic gas fire. Some lovely furniture throughout the hotel too.Breakfast is as good as you will get on the continent. Omelettes/Pancakes/Eggs all made fresh for you (no extra charge)Very nice area. If you, like us want a comfortable base from where to explore the city where you can unwind with a free drink or more and are not overly concerned about over rated 5 star luxuries, then book this hotel.

<Content>Tiny rooms, good location, one bad front desk attendant We arrived at Banks Mansion to find ourselves in a 200-300 square foot room, with a canal view, but that was just about the only nice thing about this hotel. Sure, there are three glass carafes of alcohol in the room, a mini-bar which gets restocked daily by the maids, and a coffee machine in the lobby, but for me, the open glass containers of liquor seemed particularly unsafe - as a previous guest could easily put whatever they want inside them and the next guest would never know (they are merely refilled, not new for each guest). The window/doors overlooking the canal were openable, sort of, as the side of the bed was within 2 feet of that wall, and the room was only 3 feet wider than the length of the bed anyway. It made for a lot of zig zagging around to get past the furniture to look out the window. We wanted to change rooms, but there weren't any better/larger ones, other than the honeymoon suite, which already had occupants. We told the front desk person, Pamela, that we would let her know by the next morning if we were going to move to a new hotel, but as we were only staying for 3 days, we decided to just deal with the cramped quarters and try to have a good time outside the room. The next morning Pamela called and asked whether we were leaving. We confirmed that we were going to stay, as we would have told her otherwise by 10am. When we left the hotel to sight-see around 11am, Pamela accosted us and basically demanded that we check out. She had told another person that they could have our room, even though we never said we were actually leaving. She was extremely rude, and was trying to salvage herself due to her own poor decision to try to book the room without confirmation from us that we were leaving. She argued with my boyfriend for about 30 minutes as we were leaving, and made me feel very uncomfortable in that I wasn't sure if she was crazy enough to actually move our things from the room and kick us out. I hoped it wouldn't come to that, but this was my first trip to Europe, so I wasn't sure! Once my boyfriend got tired of arguing with her he told her to sort it out with American Express, and I guess that must have convinced her to give up on trying to kick us out. I spent the entire day somewhat worried about it though until we got back that evening to find our room still accessible by keycard. I wish we had never even gone into that hotel. The hotel is located just around the corner from Rembrandtplein, which is a reasonably safe area with coffee shops, restaurants, and vendors. I definitely do NOT recommend Banks Mansion! Stay elsewhere and you will be much happier!

<Content>Great option for exploring Amsterdam Lovely hotel in great location in Amsterdam. We spent most days out and about and would drop in to the hotel for 'lunch/afternoon' tea from the complimentary all day open bar (drinks and snacks plus internet access) and head back out again all afternoon until pre-dinner drinks at the hotel bar again! So we probably saved a bit of money on lunches and cocktails and it was very nice to have a sense of feeling 'at home' in the hotel without having to put our hands into our pockets for everything. Rooms are a little squeezy but clean and tasteful. If you are going to Amsterdam, hiring a bicycle for the duration is a great idea as you can cover lots of ground and even head on out to their lovely countryside in no time. This is a very nice hotel if you want a very comfortable and convenient stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Sort of Ridiculous but with some upside. I will start by saying I found it hard in general to find a nice room in Amsterdam from the information you can find on the internet; just didn鈥檛 seem like allot of options out there for how I like to roll. Ok here鈥檚 the beef nobody seems to be talking about on this Thread; the rooms are VERY SMALL, maybe one of the smallest rooms for the $ I have ever stayed in. This next grievance might not matter for everybody, but I really like to use the Internet in my room on my computer, and they have this bogus scratch off card racket to use the Internet wirelessly; otherwise you can use the free computers downstairs. Ok. Ok. The final negative thing I will say is if you are the type of person who might want to sleep in one day and dial up some room service; not happening, instead they have three options. Noodles, Ice Cream and Champagne. Really weird combo but did make me laugh hysterically for about a hour when I saw it. The upsides are great location, free minibar and open bar in the lobby , as well as a good free breakfast. the staff was helpful and nice . Overall we had a great time in Amsterdam and really enjoyed this location if nothing else.

<Content>Another tripadvisor triumph! Tripadvisor strikes again! We booked this hotel because of the reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. Its in a great location in a nice part of Amsterdam close to all the major sights. We had a canal view room which was nice, but maybe not worth the extra money - depends on how highly you value these things I suppose. The rooms are also not that big, as other reviewers have said, although I don't think this is uncommon for Amsterdam. It was clean and the staff were always really friendly. The hotel has a free bar downstairs in the lobby where you can help yourself to free drinks - tea, coffee, alcohol, soft drinks - all day. There are also small snacks available depending on the time of day. It was a really nice touch and gave the place some life - sometimes hotel bars can be a bit desolate but this one always had a good atmosphere. There are no extra charges for most things - including minibar and breakfast. The breakfast was really good - lots of choice and nice quality food. Overall we were really happy with our stay and felt we had excellent value for money given everything that was included. We'd stay here again if we were back in Amsterdam.

<Content>Central, cosy and friendly Very central, so easy to nip back and change clothes, when weather changes, oh have a free cuppa or beer - yes all drinks and free and can be consumed in very comfy surroundings, swamped with newspapers. Should you need to use the Internet, thats free too, perfect for pre-booking the Rijksmuseum visit (a useful tip recommended by the extremely curteous reception staff).We were upgraded to a double with canal view on the 3rd floor but rejected it because on the tiny English double sized bed - at these prices!!!We were offered a king size but with no view, just a ventilation shaft. This bed was excellent and we took advantage of the pillow menu; now thats luxury.Will stay there again, the reception staff are a delight! The breakfasts excellent. Car parking 6 euros a day at the Olympic stadium, with free tram ride back, number 16, must get your ticket stamped or pay full prices!!! see other parking options:http://www.amsterdam.info/parking/park-ride/

<Content>A nice Euro Hotel Yes, it was indeed a nice hotel. Drinks and snacks in the room and lobby were entirely complementary.As the reviews said, it was a very pleasant hotel, with friendly staff always looking to help.Room was clean, and well looked after. bed was comfortable, and I had a view of the canal, and veranda doors that opened to them. Very nice. Very close to the city centre, a 5-10 minute walk. A small LCD TV attached to the wall was nice, and the shower and toilet was good too. Good pressure, and large sink. Really no complaints at all, as it was very good, and nothing bad can really be said about this place. Perhaps the price could have been too much, but it was booked by our clients so I can't comment on that.Lobby was very nice and 2 computers were down there for internet connection. Dont know if there was wireless in the rooms. But was very nice in the lobby just to relaz and read the paper.

<Content>Awesome hotel We stayed for one night at the Banks Mansion and what a treat!! It was very clean and close enough to all the major attractions. The room was small but what room isn't in Europe. The bathroom and room was clean and comfortable and that was all that mattered. Also, the free mini bar and breakfast in the morning was awesome. I would definitely stay at the Banks Mansion again.

<Content>A Good Choice Stayed 4 night at end of aug 08Did a lot of searching on trip advisor first.a good location I had looked at dam square originally for accomodation and was put of by the likely noise and was right to stay a little further away from the square. we walked from central station to the hotel took 30 mins however taxi is less than 10 euro. trams stop very close to hotel also.good accomodation. excellent breakfast. bar in lounge a nice concept .staff friendly . we were upgraded when we arrived to a canal view so very happy with that.found it was cheaper to book through hotel website direct. my tip ref the anne frank house book online much easier no queuing. when we arrived at our alloted time straight in. the other queue was round the corner of the building so glad we pre booked the tickets.

<Content>What a great experience! Having booked a 3 night stay at the Banks Mansion following reviews on Tripadvisor I was very interested to see how it would measure up! What a great experience! The staff could not do enough for us. They booked museum tickets. Stopped to chat with us in the lounge while we enjoyed our drinks in the open bar. Kevin in particular was outstanding and Ali the night porter was so kind.The free bar is a fantastic concept and amazingly according to staff not abused . The hotel decor is both hip  chic and the lounge a lovely place to chill after a day discovering Amsterdam. The rooms were so well equiped with flat screen T.V, DVD, Robes, Slippers, free mini bars (replenished regularly) fresh fruit. It is hard to find fault! Rooms on the street side were considerably larger and not too noisy. The lounge has a lovely canal view so you do not miss out.Breakfasts were great too with a good selection of newspapers and smiling staff.With it's central location it is a pure winner and we would definately stay again.

<Content>Perfect for a weekend away We spent 2 nights here on a weekend away and I would thoroughly recommend it.It 鈥榙oes what is says on the tin鈥?- it鈥檚 not a hip or luxury boutique hotel by any stretch of the imagination but it is comfortable and it is very convenient, hence I gave it a 4.The front-desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick and the receptionist took us up to the room. We stayed in a canal view room (room 206) which was basically at the apex of the building above the front entrance overlooking the corner of Herengracht and Vijzelstraat. It was a triangular shaped room and while not huge, it wasn鈥檛 poky. The interiors are pleasant enough although not my style. The furniture is a cherry-wood colour and the wardrobes and bedside cabinets have art deco style floral stained glass panels. Breakfast was a standard buffet type affair with a small menu that is cooked-to-order and it was all very nice.The 鈥楲iving Room鈥?area in the lobby and is a nice touch 鈥?free drinks (including branded alcohol) and snacks at all times of the day. Oh, and the mini-bar in the room is also free. Unusual for a hotel in this price range. We loved the location of this hotel on Herengracht, which is beautiful, and the hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the Golden Curve. It鈥檚 convenient to walk to most of the major museums within 20 minutes. There are 3 tram lines from outside the hotel which are also very handy. Oh, and there鈥檚 a Canalbus stop on Herengracht about 5 minutes walk from the hotel.The only downside we experienced was that the housekeeping staff knocked on our door at 9.45am on Sunday morning to ask when they would be able to clean our room. Given that we were checking out that day, and check-out is at 12pm, we thought that was a bit unnecessary. On the whole though, we enjoyed our stay - it was fuss, and hassle free and we will stay there again next time we go back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Somewhere special My partner and I booked a last minute stay at the Banks Mansion and from the moment the reservation was made, the staff proved how important it is to make the customer feel special. We had a problem with the credit card when booking and the following day the hotel made contact, by telephone as well as email, and ensured that the reservation was made without worrying about taking a deposit. We arrived pretty early on our first day and intended to drop our bags and run, but the lovely Nena told us the room was nearly ready and showed us down to the breakfast room and offered us complimentary breakfast while we waited. How often does that happen....??! The room was a large room on the ground floor, facing the road, when we enquired about moving Nena was only too happy to look at the other rooms and quickly moved us up to the 2nd floor, overlooking the canal. The room was small and the art deco style might not be to everyones taste but it was very clean, comfortable and with the lovely bathroom and huge shower with rainfall head it was perfect. A well stocked, complimentary(!!), minibar with additional decanters of spirits, robes and flipflop slippers were the icing on the cake.The 'living room' area in reception offers complimentary wines, beers, spirirts and hot drinks along with snacks and newspapers so you can chill out after a long day exploring this fantastic city.The staff were excellent throughout our 2 night stay and nothing was too much trouble for them. As we had an early morning flight home, Nena organised cereals, milk and fruit to be left in our room the night before. Again, nothing proved to be too much trouble and the staff were genuinely happy to help. We will definitely stay here again when we next visit Amsterdam, which might not be too far away.....

<Content>Terrific small hotel We spent 6 nights in July at the Banks Mansion. Staff could not have been more helpful. Nice, relaxing ambiance. Very friendly. The location is central but still removed enough from the frenzy of the city center. Rooms are clean, very comfortable and canal side rooms have great views. The hotel has been decorated with care. Really one of the nicer hotel experiences we have had in a long time. Staff seemed completely dedicated to service and were exceptionaly helpful.

<Content>One of the few hotels worth repeated visits in Amsterdam I've stayed in this hotel on three occasions and it has never disappointed. It's comfortable, classy without being pretentious, and each time the staff have been very helpful. But the best thing of all is that drinks and snacks are absolutely free. At first we couldn't quite grasp the idea that a hotel would give you free drinks in your room (yes, including alcoholic ones) and a wide range of free drinks in the 'Living' area downstairs, including wines, beers, soft drinks and coffee, supplemented by a range of nibbles that changes over the course of the day. I've noticed that other Carlton hotels don't do this - it seems that only in Amsterdam do they trust guests not to abuse the privilege. It makes for a very relaxing experience. The hotel really is everything it says on its website.

<Content>Thank you Tripadvisor I read all the relavant reviews on tripadvisor and decided Banks Mansion would suit us. It was a lovely experience. From check-in the staff are lovely - its like staying with friends. The lounge is like a comfortable airline business class lounge with coffee, tea, wine, snacks, spirits, chocolates and sweets. Free mini bar in the room. Room was perfect, taps in the bathroom I agree with others are funny but not serious Breakfast was a great selection of proteins and carbs. Nice situation will stay again. They have scooter hire for those interested. Very clean. Loved it.

<Content>Perfect stay We just returned from a long weekend at the Banks Mansion and once again, the reviewers on Tripadvisor had it spot on. The location of the hotel is perfect and all the main spots within easy reach.We were received very well by very professional receptionists, in fact the service throughout our stay was exceptionally well, especially in a city not renowned for the friendliness of the service in general. We had a room on the first floor with canal view. The room was not particularly large and for our taste a little too crowded with furniture, but I guess for Amsterdam it was acceptable. We were however told that the street view rooms, though cheaper, were larger but decided not to bother. I think if I went back to the Banks Mansion, I would go for a larger and less expensive street view room. The bed was ok, aircondition was appreciated in the heat of the summer.I agree with comments on the bathroom, nice but on the small side as well, the tabs were not user friendly.The principle of including all side costs in the hotel price is attractive, the minibar was well equipped with drinks, the lobby bar came with an excellent coffee machine and snacks.Breakfast selection was not enormous, but what was on offer was of excellent quality.

<Content>Congratulations ! Outside Banks Mansion is a very classical building but well situated to visit Amsterdam. All main attractions can be reach even by foot even if i advice to rent a bike to get better fun. That was perfect .Inside the reception is friendly with a desk, a open bar all long day, a saloon to met your friends or to take some rest, a corner with a fire and an other place with 2 PC for a free access to Internet. i appreciated to be able to look at my mails very easily.My room (207) was nice too, enough large for 2 two people, well decorated, good bed, flat screen, open mini bar (all included), nice bathroom. All is clean and the stuff dont disturb your stay.The breakfast was in the same way, well appreciated, you can be fat very quicky !!All the stuff is young with good skills and like to help you if needed. A special thank to Nancy for her smile !Just 2 remarks for me :- TV device was a bit old (4/3 flat screen) and doesn t work very well, some issues to switch on and change the channel.- there are 2 separeted taps in the bathroom for hot and cold water..good quality but it was uneasy to fine ajust the temperature especially because the tap for hot tap was in the wrong direction (turn left to stop water). it was made for purpose but not a good idea in fact because unusual.As a conclusion Banks Mansion is a very good hotel as we should like to find everywhere in the world. Excellent in its category

<Content>Will be back! We loved it! As stated in the other reviews cocktails and snacks were included. The only thing I did not care for was that we had no coffee maker in the room, but they had a great coffee machine in the lobby. We had a quiet room overlooking the canal.The rooms were small by American standards but comfy. I loved the slippers, Japanese in style, darling. We stayed at the Marriott the last trip to Amsterdam and were disappointed, but the Banks mansion was great! We would stay again in a heartbeat. Staff was attentive and breakfast was very good , consistent with much more expensive hotels. The little restaurant across the street had great indonesian food and was good after a long flight from California.We stayed for two nights before a cruise and will most likely stay there again on our next trip over.

<Content>Welcome respite in busy Amsterdam We were given a recommendation to the Banks Mansion by our hotel clerk in the Hague. The big plus was that every service within the hotel is free. There was a lovely breakfast, in the dedicated room downstairs, with station for omelets, pancakes, etc., delicious breads, cold meats, salmon. In the late afternoon, the cocktail hour offerings included wine, beer, soda and little snacks (nuts, olives, chips). There were also copies of manyinternational newspapers, which along with the food, insured that there was a friendly busy quality to the confortably appointed hotel lobby in the late afternoon. The internet was also free access, including two computer stations. The entire hotel, which is small, a boutique hotel, four floors,is decorated in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright's decorative stained glass, and geometric patterns. Many design details have been thoughtfully incorporated (an under sink night light in the bathroom, for example; lighted cabinets). The room rate was slightly higher than our normal budget (229 Euros per/night), but we found the extra offerings plus the desk hospitality and advice about the city well worth the higher rate. We were given a corner room which overlooked the street, with an oblique view toward the famous Herengracht canal. Great peaceful location! Given the many warnings about the difficulties of finding a good hotel in Amsterdam, this one was a quiet and comforting place to land at the end of much walking and museum visits in Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice rooms ; unconvenient location ; unfriendly staff First of all the hotel interieur is great: Very nice rooms, nice furniture, a free all you can drink minibar and also the hotel bar is free of charge (and they even have Beck's beer), very nice bathroom - could be perfect BUT:1) The location is very dark and unsecure2) They have nothing were you can park you car. I parked beside the street and my car get broken up by some creakhead.3) Staff is untrained, unfriendly and unhelpful. They watch you carry your bag without asking if they may help you.4) It is very expensive

<Content>A safe bet I stayed at the hotel with my family - the location is excellent, very good breakfast, the rooms quite small but ok - the open bar in the lobby is a very nice idea - you meet people and it is nice to relax there after a long day in the city.

<Content>Great Service and Good Location I have just returned from a two night stay at the banks mansion hotel. The staff at this hotel are probably the best I have encoutered. They are extremely friendly and helpful. I arrived early at the hotel and they were able to check me in at 10am (check-in time is 3pm). The free bar is great in the lobby. Breakfast was great I had pancakes whick were delicious! The rooms are quiet small but the bathroom is a good size. Just a note to anyone who needs a hairdryer...bring your own! The ones in the room are very weak-this is ok if you dont have too much hair but it was a problem for me!! The location is great 3mins walk to main shopping street. All in all, good value for money.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel We stayed here on our first trip to Amsterdam.The hotel is in a great location within easy access to most of the main tourist attractions.The staff were extremely helpful and were happy to help whenever we needed them.The room was lovely and clean but a little cramped.The free mini bar in the bedroom and choice of alcoholic drinks in the lounge area was a lovely touch.A wide choice of breakfast is also available which gets you off to a great start.You definatly wont be let down staying here.We would certainly stay again!!!

<Content>Great Hotel - Fabulous Position Just want to reiterate what other have said here.Loved the hotel. Spent 2 nights in May and though I did not have a canal view room my room was only one room back from the corner so still had the view!The staff were helpful and accommodating and provided restaurant recommendations. One night I was particularly tired and just wanted some take away indian or thai food. The receptionist rang a few restaurants for me when I asked for a recommendation and sent me in the right direction - good food too! When I arrived back with my thai they even offered to get me a plate and cutlery!The free mini bar is a great idea - though unfortunately I don't drink whisky, cognac or gin but that's okay - they had everything else you could imagine in the free bar downstairs!My room was pre-paid but my cc was accidently debited twice for the city tax (computer glitch at time of check out). No problems - within 3 days of my contacting the hotel by email the charge was reversed.Only one minor complaint - no coffee making facilities in the room. I think that would be a good idea.

<Content>stayed here a couple of times in last 3 years What is not to love about this hotel? The accommodation is lovely, the breakfast is very good, lots of nibbles in the living/reception area throughout the day/evening, and free booze for your minibar. (And if you ask nicely, they'll swap the provided spirits for something you prefer - like we swapped the whisky for vodka every time). The location is great and the staff are friendly. I tell everyone who is thinking of staying in Amsterdam to consider this hotel as their base.

<Content>Loved this hotel ! We stayed here for 3 nights in May. Really can't fault the hotel. Staff are very attentive and welcoming. Our room was clean and comfortable, but the bathroon was even better with a really big bath plus a separate rain shower. Breakfast is lovely and there is a chef to cook omelettes and pancakes etc if you want. One of the best bits though is the free mini bar in your room and the free drinks and snacks in the lounge in the lobby. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Everything it says it is! We spent a long weekend in Amsterdam and selected this Hotel mostly based on reviews I read here. It was everything the website says it was. I really can't fault this hotel at all.We arrived around 8am and couldnt check-in til after lunch, which was expected and we were fine with that. Simply left luggage there and went exploring Amsterdam. When we returned at 2pm to check-in the room was ready and we headed up. We stayed on the 3rd floor in a corner room with canal views. It was awesome! It felt more like a suite than a standard room. The bathroom with rain shower and separate bath was impeccably clean. The bed was comfy and we had 4 massive double windows/doors and a mini balcony looking out over the canal.And the best bit, *everything* is included in the room rate. So i nailed at least a dozen Hoegaardens and a few glasses of wine in the lobby over the 3 days, all complimentary. Even when you return at 1am from a night out you can chill by the fire with a drink in the lobby unhassled. Love this place.

<Content>Be Careful! This place is really different - and a mixed bag. No stupid rip-offs with the mini-bar, lots of terrific extras - all 'free' and a really great location. BUT, the breakfast was about as poor a standard as could be imagined, eg scrambled eggs made by reheating already-made stuff resembling yellow rubber, poor selection etc. This is not what hotel dining rooms should offer. The safe was broken, the phone didn't work, and they would only move us to a different room at OUR expense. The free WiFii turned out to last 50 minutes and in one room didn't work at all. Hmmm.The worst part was that our foursome booked for 2 days and were forced to leave after one due to genuine and serious circumstances beyond our control. We asked (at breakfast time) if they would let us off the second night's charge. The (young) guy at the desk was very tough and said he would 'ask his manager', later saying he did so and was told 'no'. I said I expected a more lenient attitude under the circumstances and wanted to speak to the manager myself and he immediately said 'OK, we will let you off one room but not both. We can't lose money because of your problems.' I later discovered that they managed to fill the entire hotel that night but still pocketed the room charge they demanded from us.I know we had booked for 2 nights and technically, they may be said to be in the right, but I doubt the manager was even consulted and whereas the small things are what could make this hotel so attractive, knowing they employ transparently poor actors like him and are happy to 'fine' us a (not inexpensive) room rate they ANYWAY sold to somebody else, makes me reluctant to set foot there again or recommend them. You need to feel comfortable in a hotel, but they run it so poorly it spoiled the whole experience.

<Author>My_Aunt
<Content>Lived up to its promise My husband and I stayed at the Banks Hotel for seven nights (April 30 - May 8), and we were very satisfied with the hotel. I booked directly with the hotel, and I was contacted by the desk staff to welcome us and enquire about any requests. And we did have a couple of requests: 1) we were arriving in the morning and asked to check earlier than the usual time 2) we asked for a room that had a bath tub (most rooms have showers). The staff replied promptly, saying that they will try to accommodate our requests - and they did. We were checked in by Nina, who is very efficient, knowledgeable, and friendly, and so are the rest of the desk staff - Pamela, Laura, Kevin and Ali. Our corner room commanded a view of the canal (Herengracht) and the street (Vijzelstraat). The room and the bathroom were spacious and comfortable. We travel in Europe once a year, so we are used to smaller (than North American) rooms. Breakfast in the kitchen was also very good; omelettes, pancakes and French toast can be ordered in addition to the buffet-style standards (cheese, cold cuts, smoked salmon, etc.); however, the selection wasn't changed when we were there. The 24-hour lounge snacks and drinks were also good, keeping in mind that these are snacks and not mini-meals, along the lines of nuts, olives, Dutch waffles (cookies), and the occasional dips and cheese.I would have rated the hotel excellent, but the housekeeping service leaves much to be desired. In our 7-day stay, we had to ask 4 times for bathroom items that were lacking: soap, shower gels, bath salts. In addition, the cleaning was cursory: empty gel bottles and soiled face cloths were left uncollected. But again, the desk staff was very quick in sending whatever we needed. As a matter of fact, one of them came to our room with the items that were missing, and she saw the condition of the bathroom.The location was also ideal for us. It was central enough, but not too busy like the Dam, Rembrandtplein or Leidseplein. We like walking, so we walked to many of the the attractions, occasionally taking the tram to the Central Station or the Museum area.Aside from the problem with housekeeping, we were happy with the level of service, specifically of the desk staff ,and would recommend Banks Mansion Hotel.

<Content>Best In Town Banks Mansion was the first hotel my wife and I stayed at when we started to go to Amsterdam for a city break about three years ago. We thought that it was lovely then; the free snacks, drinks and tv were all excellent, as was the location and all this made our stay wonderful.We have been back to Amsterdam several times since but stayed in different hotels and this last time, we returned to Banks Mansion again. Having now had the experience of staying in other amsterdam hotels, I can honestly say that the best is definitely Banks. The quality of the decor, size of the room, location and the hospitality cannot be faulted. The breakfast was great, meaning we only had to have a snack for lunch and the air con was effective and not too noisy in the room.Only slight minor side is that the lift is very slow and if you are on the top floor, it's often quicker to walk! Other than that, lovely hotel, sure its a bit pricey but I certainly didn't feel ripped off with what we paid. Definitely recommended.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Stayed at the Bank's Mansion for four nights in April and couldn't have been more pleased. Everything important has already been said in other posts but I felt I needed to confirm that the hotel is just as nice as people claim. Staff was very accommodating and friendly. The room was a perfect size (corner room) as was the bathroom, which had a very long soaking tub and a large shower. In room complementary mini-bar had a good assortment of drinks in addition to the flasks of liquor and bowl of apples. Breakfast was great and the cook will make anything you ask for. Lounge was very relaxing and it was nice to have a cup of cappuccino, wine and bar snacks while reading newspapers or checking email on the free computers. Location was great and in walking distance to a lot of attractions. Small restaurant across the street, Peking, had very good sandwiches, soup, Dutch pancakes and after 4 pm they have Chinese food. Have only great things to say about this hotel and we will be back.

<Content>Excellent hotel A great hotel situated in central Amsterdam, within easy walking distance of most sights in the city. The hotel is immaculate and the staff most helpful and pleasant. The unusual feature of the Banks is that you are provided with decanters of whisky, brandy and gin in the room with mixers and soft drinks, all included in the price. The room was large and comfortable. In the lobby there is a comfortable seating area with sofas and armchairs, coffee, tea etc and a bar with wines,spirits, even champagne, and snacks available all day,again all included in the price. The breakfast was excellent and could fill you up for the day if you wanted. They don't serve dinner but there are so many restaurants in Amsterdam that you wouldn't really want to eat at the hotel. You can find cheaper hotels but for my wife and I we would stay at the Banks Mansion again when we return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Fantastic Customer Service We chose the Banks Mansion because we wanted a more comfortable hotel located close to our friends in Amsterdam. It definitely met this criteria and went way beyond!The fantastic customer service made the stay. They never hassled or even commented about our early check-in time. Our room was clean and fitted nicely with modern furnishings and extras like free mini bar and spirits in glass decanters. The bathroom was very nice with a shower and a really long bathtub! Overall we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Great character, excellent location I really enjoyed staying at this hotel and will gladly stay here again next time I am in Amsterdam.The location by a canal is excellent and very easy to reach on the tram.There is a free minibar and also a free bar which is unique in my experience. It would be wrong to assume this is the only plus for this hotel.The main point for this hotel however is the excellent design and its character. When you stay here you know you are staying in Amsterdam rather than a souless hotel room that could be anywhere in the world.

<Content>Great experience This was our first stay at this hotel and we loved it and will return.Highlights were: the corner room...this is a must. There is more room and more light in these units facing the front of the hotel. Ask ahead of time. Even with the windows opened, you couldn't really step out on to balcony because there was not much room. There are better views around town but other things in this hotel make up for the lack of a balcony. Rooms are small but extremely functional and charming.The complementary beverage and food in lobby was great. We invited a friend over after a long day and enjoyed just sitting in front of the fire place drinking and snacking and enjoying it all. We liked getting extra water and coffee from this area to bring to room. NIce chocolates and rotating snacks all day long if you happened to be there. Bar in room and frig for other things.Free WI Fi in lobby at two big desks. You could check in on any info without using your room computer. They also gave you 50 minutes free WI FI in room.Bathrooms were great...not huge but perfectly set. Great big tub and fantastic rain shower. Very clean. Ice and shoe shine right at the end of the hallway.Bed was nice and hard but I did not like the seam down the middle. This would be so easy to correct with a proper pad over the seam! Pillows were rather lumpy.Breakfast down stairs in the basement was fabulous. We missed the first morning because we slept in but the second day we enjoyed all the goodies. Great selection of papers and magazines at breakfast and in lobby each day.The front desk was outstanding! Great help and extremely friendly.The only thing I thought odd was the lack of vacuuming of the carpet in all of the hall ways. This made its seem dirty but I could just tell that it really had not been vacuumed well...or in a long time. Odd... when every thing else was very clean.GREAT LOCATION.The tram was just outside hotel a block up. Very easy to get to train station, 10 minute ride. Not on a super busy street but close to every thing. Flower mart was 2 blocks away. Great cafes near by.Fabulous hotel... we will be back.

<Content>Complimentary greatness Spent an easter here. Nice, tidy rooms, comfy bed. Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was good too with all the usual eggsybacon stuff, healthier things and the made-for-order omelettes/pancakes. Connections were good since the tram line is right next to the hotel. Complimentary bar and snacks is the greatest, when you are feeling lazy you can just slob it in the lounge by the fireplace and sip cava ... :)If you look for something to wish for, some kind of sauna/spa/gym like thing would be great .. also they could lose the 50 minute complimentary wireless internet limit ..

The location is also great as all the major sights are in walking distance. Looking forward to stay again at the Banks Mansion.

<Content>Fantastic hotel We booked this hotel because of the positive reviews on this website, and we were certainly not disappointed. The hotel was superb in every aspect from the complimentary snacks in the lounge to the cosy rooms with view over the canal (if you pay a little extra for canal-view). The breakfast buffet was delicious and had all things that you could possibly want.Location of the hotel is great too. In walking distance of everything in the city center and easy access to the tram if you don't want to walk.We will definitely stay at Banks Mansion when we visit Amsterdam again.

<Content>Great service, well-presented in good location Staff were all very helpful, particularly Kevin at reception. Room clean and in good condition. Free minibar and drinks at the lounge area a nice touch - even if just for fruit juice and mineral water. Good range of breakfast options. Comfortable bed and even a pillow menu. Well located on one of the nicer canals, close enough to walk to Central Station and most other points of interest. Not a cheap place to stay, but still good value.

<Content>One of the best We have just spent four nights in this hotel, which is definitely one of the very best we've stayed in (and we've stayed in many!). The combination of style, informality, efficiency, friendliness and cleanliness, not forgetting the complimentary drinks, made for a relaxing and thorougly enjoyable stay. Returning here after a busy day was almost like returning home (where someone else had done the cleaning and tidying up!). Absolutely loved it!

<Content>Cozy comfort and class This was my fifth trip to Amsterdam and I've stayed at a variety of hotels around town. The Banks Mansion is the best by far - the location, the comfort and service were absolutely top-notch. The 'living-room' will make the traveler feel like they are back at home - but better. Fabulous and fresh breakfast, in-room movies and a well stocked mini-bar are just a few of the perks. This is more for the business or older couple traveler - you could not be more central to trams and shopping districts as well as museums. Ask for a canal view room! Not recommended for anyone coming to experience the 'alternative' parts of Amsterdam.

<Content>Lovely Hotel With Very Friendly Staff My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in mid feb and found the hotel to be lovely. The room was great with a great shower and a very comfy bed. The included drinks and minibar are a nice touch.We wanted to see as much of the city as possible and found the location to be very central for getting about.The only negitive I could find that that there is no resturant in the hotel. This would normally not be an issue when visiting a city as we would rarely eat in the hotel as there is so much choice in a city. However, in Amsterdam there was a very limited range of resturants. If you like steak houses or pizza houses then you can't go wrong, they are on every street. But we wanted something different from that but couldn't find anywhere. As it was really cold when we were there and with no great selection of eateries about we would have been happy to enjoy some drinks in the lounge and eat dinner in the hotel. This is the only negitive we found and we did enjoy the hotel. The staff were very friendly with brilliant English and great local knowledge.

<Content>"The Bomb" This was my first time to Europe and I used the reviews on tripadvisor.com to choose a hotel in Amsterdam. The previous reviews prompted me to choose Banks Mansion. Phenomenal decision on my part. The hotel is easily accessible to public transportation and a short walking distance to everything. The hotel itself is warm and cozy. The staff are fantastic and friendly. The amenities are impressive and I can't imagine staying anywhere else. Being an African-American coming from the U.S., I was unsure of the level of racism and somewhat apprehensive about going to a foreign country with limited language skills but the helpfulness and attitude provided by the staff at Banks Mansion put me completely to ease and I enjoyed my visit to Amsterdam immensely. I would highly recommend this hotel. I think it is more middle-age friendly than younger crowds.

<Content>Fantastic stay in Amsterdam We booked this hotel as part of a package deal and were not disappointed.We paid a bit more for a canal view room and it was definitely worth it, the view from our room was amazing.The staff were friendly, rooms impeccable, breakfasts were great and we really enjoyed the complimentary drinks, an unusual but very welcome addition.I would definitely stay here on any future trips to Amsterdam.

<Content>Lovely relaxing atmosphere, great location We stayed at the Banks Mansion for a long anniversary weekend last summer, and it was perfect. The hotel's living room for guests is a fantastic concept, a great place to come back to and relax with whatever you'd like to drink and little snacks, comfy chairs and magazines to read - I'd pop down from our room with a book and curl up by the fire if hubby wanted a pre-dinner nap. I really enjoyed the living room and made the most of it, spending the early evenings chatting with other guests as we all came down for an early evening drink before parting ways for the night.The staff were friendly and helped with directions or recommendations for evening walks or canal trips. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location on one of Amsterdam's most beautiful canals, and is also a brief walk to Rembrandt Square where there's plenty of late night cafe and bar culture for an evening out - we'd sit and people watch every evening for hours. The hotel's also conveniently located for frequent trams, so you can take a leisurely stroll through the tulip market and along canals/shops up to the train station then hop on a tram back if the weather turns (the hotel has umbrellas for guests if it does turn wet).The rooms aren't big by anyone's standards but they're beautifully put together in a modern deco/Charles Rennie Mackintosh style, and our bathroom was beautifully finished with an enormous rainfall shower. The little touches are nice - our room had a few cut glass decanters with different (and tasty!) spirits for a night cap. The room and hotel both were nicer than 5* resorts/hotels I've stayed in, the bed linen good quality and the mattress comfortable. The room was spotless, as was the entire hotel. I'd completely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a comfortable break in a convenient location, and would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>A very good hotel - welcoming and warm staff Stayed here for a long weekend end of Jan 2008. Could not fault it (and I have stayed in many hotels in AMS). The staff were excellent - very friendly and efficient. The room was large, very comfortable and nice touches, like a free mini-bar. Also - no fooling around looking for adapators to plug in my laptop - it was all there. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Quality Establishment This is a quality establishment. The staff are extremely professional and all seem to speak impecable English, service is of a very high standard. There is no bar as such but the very pleasant lounge area has a self service bar with a choice of different bottled beers, wines, spirits and soft drinks all included at no extra charge within the room rate. The all inclusive drinks extends to the mini bar in the room. Our mini bar was very well stoked with beer, soft drinks and chocolate bars and there were also 3 decanters of spirits. The room was not particularly spacious but was well presented. The bathroom was of a good standard and the bed was very comfortable. We had to pay extra for a canal view but it was worth it. The hotel has a breakfast room but no dining room which necesitates going out for dinner but as the hotel is very centrally located there are plenty of very good places to eat within a short walking distance. This is a nice place to stay if you are visiting Amsterdam

<Content>Fantastic, Fantastic,Fantastic I booked this hotel , direct, as part of a 3 night / 4day trip to Amsterdam.I was told about this by a good friend of mine.The hotel is just around the corner from Rembrant Square, and 200 mtrs from the no.4 tram stop.the outside of the hotel is nothing special, but when you climb the steps (only 4 or 5) and enter the lounge/reception area, you get a feeling of something special.The staff are friendly, professional and very helpful. one lady Nina, is a credit to the hotel !!!The 'Lounge' area is relaxed with comfy chairs and sofas, a fire in one corner, and NO Television !!!There is a bar that comes as complementary as part of your rate.The rooms are a decent size not massive, just right. We had the choice of a room with a canal view , which has a massive walk in shower, or a bigger room with a bath for 2 and a good size shower , but no view. we took the room with the bath and shower.All movies and in room drins are included.the bed was a good size king , and was really comfortable.We ordered breakfast in bed on the first morning , and it was delivered on time and hot !!!There is not many things wrong with this hotel, it does what it says, and with a certain style, that is not over the top.I could go on, but what i will say , is that we will be going back !!!

<Content>Great place to stay  We could not have been happier with our stay. Great place all around. We had booked a canal-view room and found the view lovely, the room as comfortable as any we've ever had, and the staff just outstanding. This is,as far as we are concerned, the only place to stay in Amsterdam. More like a good club than a hotel. Worth following the front desk's advice on restaurants too. In a city not known for food, they do know where to find the good places to eat!

<Content>Lovely experience We have just returned from a weekend break in Amsterdam - we had gone over especially to see 'Night at the Proms' in Rotterdam. As usual, I checked out Trip Advisor and selected this hotel based on other peoples' recommendations.The directions to the hotel are clearly shown on its website - number 16 or 24 tram from Central Station, 4th stop. It is then just a 50m walk to the hotel from the stop.The location was great. Despite being by a fairly busy road the rooms was very quiet (I am a light sleeper) - and also very warm considering the cold outside!There is a great atmosphere in the lobby area as residents meet up for their complimentary snacks, hot drinks or something stronger! There is a living flame fire which is especially cosy for this time of the year.We paid for a delux room and had a fab view over the Kaisersgracht canal (not sure that's spelt correctly). The decor was beautiful and I loved the big shower.The staff were very helpful. The breakfast was great - I loved the pancakes whereas my husband went straight for the 'full English' option. The only thing I could fault was there being no bath - which I was aware of before I booked, but, with all the walking around a good soak would've been beneficial!

<Content>Just okay. Not more than 3 stars. My boyfriend and I have just returned from a two night stay at the Banks Mansion. We booked because of the great reviews on TA but had such a bad experience I felt I needed to write my own review.Although it is undeniably in a great location - no more than 10mins walk to everywhere it seemed, and just around the corner from the picturesque '9 streets' - the hotel is just not worth the money.Our room (212) was incredibly dark - we felt like we were in the basement despite being on the 2nd floor, and was really way too small to justify the 279Euros it costs a night. We could hardly walk around the bed - and had no-where to put our luggage. On the plus side the bed was very comfy however the pillows were lumpy and really need to be replaced. FYI - Banks Mansion claims to have a 'pillow menu' - but they didn't have any pillows available when we asked so the claim seemed a bit of a let down! We also only had one pair of slippers and one dressing gown. The drinks in the 'free minibar' were never replenished, and after the room was cleaned on Saturday morning the maid left old half full cans of coke and beer.Finally, the room was not clean (by my standards) - hair in the bath and in the sink, soap marks on the mirror, grit on the carpet in the bedroom, and dark marks all over the wallpaper. FYI - our room was non-smoking but everything including the bathroom towels smelt smoky and dusty. The communal areas - lounge etc are also smoking so it cannot be avoided in this hotel. The free nibbles (always the same..nuts and crisps, nougat and small waffles) and drinks were great but again they did not make up for the room. The very last bone of contention about this hotel is the breakfast. It's really quite horrible. The pancakes (made to order) come out of a packet and are literally warmed up on the griddle in front of you. The eggs are worse - they have a tub of orange eggy liquid which they pour into a frying pan...) There were no pastries or croissants, etc. Not much choice at all to be honest. All in all, based on our experience we would not recommend this hotel. There were simply too many problems to justify the price, and even if we had loved our room it is still too expensive.Hope you find this review useful.

<Content>Amazing hotel in a great city Believe all of the reviews here, this is a brilliant hotel. We booked from reading the reviews here. It can look a bit more expensive than a lot of the hotels in Amsterdam but the accomodation and use of facilities is worth every penny. The free bar was well stocked with loads of chocolate, biscuits, etc. The beer and wine was all good quality and at various times during the day extra food was put out. It was a great area to go to unwind after a busy day in amsterdam.Breakfast was also included in the rate (we found the best deal via opodo.co.uk) which was a very good range of food and anything you needed made up to order.In the room the free mini-bar was well stocked with chocolate and drinks, the in house movies were also included in the price. I don't think any hotel rooms in Amsterdam are particularly large but the rooms were modern, clean and very comfortable.The location is also very good, right by the flower market and a short walk to almost all attractions. Probably a 15 minute walk from the central station or accessable on the tram routes.If your off to Amsterdam you have to try this hotel - it is as good as every review here.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at BM this past August and I must say this was one of the best if not best hotel I have stayed at in terms of everything working right.Everything in the rooms are in the right place and working properly.The front desk staff is great and goes out of their way to make your stay a great one.The free drinks in the lobby and in the room along with free snacks and chef prepared breakfast was amazing. I would stay here again any time in the area.

<Content>Banks Manison Hotel was Brillant Four of us stayed at the Banks Mansion Hotel for 3 nights. It is a clean, friendly and convenient hotel. The breakfast was included together with the drinks (that includes alcoholic drinks). The breakfast was fresh and there was a good choice to choose from. The rooms were small but big enough for a 3 night stay. The only problem in the rooms was the fact that the lighting was not very good. Although this hotel is not cheap it is worth it because of the little extras that they offer and the friendly staff. We would definitely recommend staying at this hotel. We would also recommend asking the staff where to eat as they give excellent recommendations. We only did this on our last night and they recommended Brasserie Harkema which is well worth trying as the food was excellent.

<Content>My favourite place to stay in Amsterdam Stayed here several times now and always been delighted with the service - great staff! Good breakfast, comfortable rooms - small but on a par with much more expensive places in the Dam. The drinks and snacks in the Living and in the guestrooms are a nice touch and the location is just perfect.Great value for money.

<Content>Best hotel EVER! Excellent! We stayed at the Banks Mansion for 2 nights in early July and loved it. Of our 5 week trip it was definitely our favourite of many beautiful hotels. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The hotel itself was situated right on the canal (we had a canal view - very worthwhile) and was in a great location, only 5-10 minutes walk from all the nice shopping and eating areas. We were very impressed with the 'pillow menu' plus the complimentary open bar, not only in our room and in the foyer for all hotel guests, which we found was one in a million and definitely a huge bonus for us. We have already recommended the Banks Mansion to many friends and for these reasons wouldn't stay anywhere else when we return.

<Content>Excellent in every way - Great location The Banks Mansion more than met our expectations, with a wonderfull staff, excellent made-to order breakfast. free cocktails...(albeit limited selection), free internet, quiet air-conditioned room, canal view, and perfect location. We walked everywhere, from the Ann Frank House, red light district to the art museums, etc, and frequently took a quick break at our conveniently located hotel for a beer or glass of wine, and a little rest from all the walking. Our room was a model of effeciency...perfect size for two, and everything one would need. Excellent shower, comfortable bed, nice view, and great security.We went on a cruise for 2 weeks following our stay at the Banks Mansion, and found ourselves comparing the cruise experience with that in Amsterdam. We found the breakfast at the hotel, especially the coffee, expresso,  lattes at the Banks to be far superior. And you really appreciate those free drinks  free interent after paying cruise ship prices. We really loved it there!

<Content>Great stay at Banks Mansion I recently spent four days at Banks Mansion during a long weekend. We both loved it and would recommend it to friends. The location is great as it is equidistant between the centre of town and the museum area- we walked pretty much everywhere all weekend but the tram was outside the door if you wanted it. Also it is on one of the main canals, but it is far enough away from the neon lights and really touristy squares to feel really relaxed (although there is a sqaure with all this only a block away if you want it). Room was nicely done with massive walk-in shower and art deco styling. We didnt have a canal view as all were booked but it was fine and heavy curtains and double glazing kept out all noise from the street. Really nice touch is free mini bar in room and free serve yourself area downstairs- soft drinks, wine, beers, coffee, tea, cava and even spirits. Also free internet. Dont get me wrong, you dont go to Amsterdam to drink all day in the room, but it was really nice to go back to freshen up and have a beer before heading out, or a night cap when returning home. We normally dont use hotel facilities as it always feels a rip-off, but it made it feel really relaxing to be able to do this.

<Content>Fabulous trip We stayed here for 3 days in August with some of our family. The way the hotel operates is innovative. A small boutique style place with only 50 rooms and an attentive staff. The hotel is just off the Leidseplein so impossible to get lost as there are signs to it from all areas, and brilliant for walking about.The Living is an area in the foyer stocked with a coffee machine, cold drinks, beer, wine and spirits and allows you to read international papers, use the internet for free, and relax without any need for stress. The service is unobtrusive and there are small snacks available. There is also a minibar and a selection of drinks in the room which makes for a much cheaper stay.Breakfast in bed only costs 5Euros and is wonderful!Some of the rooms have steam rooms within the showers - I'd advise asking for one when you book. None of the rooms have a bath.The Selecta directly opposite the hotel does a great Indonesian ristafel banquet, and there are great Argentinian Steak Houses off the Rembrantsplein.We will definitely stay again - I've stayed in the Pulitzer and Bildeberg Garden hotels and this is far superior.

<Content>Worth the trip Very friendly staff with excellent perks. It is located on one of the main canals (as is everything else, it seems, in Amsterdam!) Room was well kept and the 鈥渓iving room鈥?(hotel lobby) with its free bar, snacks and, in the afternoon, appetizers made the visit even more comfortable. A full breakfast is provided. It is not that close to the main museums but, on a pleasant day, the walk is fine. The problem is not the distance just that the city has numerous canals that get in the way. It is close to a number of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and coffee houses. The hotel is centrally located. Watch out for the bicycle paths. They have the right of way and the bicyclists yield to no one!

<Content>Banks Mansion: My kind of place I would just like to add that the reviews on this hotel within this site are accurate with respect to the Banks Mansion Hotel. This is my kind of place. We arrived and it was raining but the staff collected our bags and while we waited for a room we were able to check our email, have a snack and a drink immediately.Our room was made ready in a jiff and it was SUNNY for the next 3 days. The lobby setup and the free additionals are GREAT especially at nite when you want an informal nitecap or a place to sit and collect your thoughts. Location is central and easy to find. Loved this place.

<Content>fabulous stay I would just like to echo all the things everyone else has to say about the Banks Mansion Hotel. I chose the hotel based on the reviews posted on Trip Advisor and would like to thank everyone for their contributions - it was spot on! We had a lovely stay and will definately go back. This is a city that does not sleep! Loads to do, very cosmopolitan, fantastic break.

<Content>A Wonderful Time We've been to Amsterdam a dozen times and stayed at medium to very high end places, but this was the most pleasant by far. Friendly helpful staff, and the living room concept worked very well for us, as we had several occasions on which friends came to visit with us there. Having just arrived from a Paris hotel, with all its many gouging charges, we were stunned at the bowls of fruit, snacks, coffee, wine, etc., and the fast internet readily available. There was even a small table with cut glass decanters of brandy and whisky in our room for a private nightcap. Our room was angled at the corner, and we liked the immediacy of the canal and street view, and the modern/retro decorating. Breakfast included eggs and pancakes made to order. We will definitely do this again.

<Content>Wonderful home-from-home I chose the Banks Mansion for a surprise birthday trip because of TripAdvisor reviews, so had high expectations. But it was even better than I'd hoped. I booked canal view rooms well in advance (room 106 is large  dual aspect) and while my partner  I thought it wonderfully romantic, our 2 teenaged sons loved the free drinks, snacks, and internet... It's in a great location, offers huge, delicious breakfasts, is spotlessly clean, stylish, friendly, and utterly relaxing. As soon as we can think of another excuse, we'll be back!

<Content>Great in every way My son and I stayed at Banks Mansion in May while we were in Europe for two weeks celebrating his 21st birthday. The hotel was perfect in every way. It was probably the best boutique hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was beautiful, luxuriously appointed, spotless and a great view over the bustling city street and serene canal. The area is great, it is across the canal from the Amsterdam mayor's house.Sonja at the front desk was terrific. She was helpful with restaurant and touring suggestions and she, along with all of the other front desk employees, was friendly and just a lot of fun whenever we would see her.All in all an amazing hotel and a place I would always stay at if I return to Amsterdam.We liked this hotel so much that we changed out hotel in Glasgow, Scotland, our next stop, to the sister property of Banks Mansion. We found the Glasgow property to be nothing like the Amsterdam property and were very dissapointed with our decision to stay there. So, as noted above, Banks Mansion is superb but that doesn't seem to mean that the whole small chain they have is superb.

<Content>Would not stay anywhere else Just returned from 3 nights at the Banks Mansion. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, the location central and the at home concept worked very well. I would not consider staying anywhere else in Amsterdam. We visited friends in a 5 star hotel near the station and would not have swapped for anything.

<Content>Great choice for couples to be in the middle of things Good service and helpful staff. Comfortable, quiet room (if a bit small) and bed. Our room had a great rain style shower. We especially liked the lobby and general decor. It was ideal for being in the centre of things, only a short walk in any direction to see something special. Make sure you ask for a canal view - it is worth it. We did a deal to include breakfast and it was well worth it - plenty of choice.

<Content>Wonderful! I loved this hotel - a great base for a really relaxing short break in Amsterdam. The whole vibe was very laid back and calm, staff were attentive, with tip-top restaurant recs, and the serve-yourself approach in the lounge was so much nicer than having waiters buzzing around.The room was much bigger and more comfortable than other Amsterdam hotels I've stayed in, although not huge by international standards, but and lets face it, hotels are expensive in this city. The bathroom was large and well-appointed, with an enourmous bath (I could float in it!) and a great walk in shower - but oddly, only one bar of soap was supplied and the bath salts weren't replaced the second day.Breakfast was delicious. There was service at the cooked bar, where eggs, omelettes and pancakes were prepared, and everything else was serve-yourself -so equally as relaxed as the lounge.Overall, I thought the 'all inclusive' concept was worth it for the relaxing vibe - you know if advance what you're paying and don't have to keep a tab on where the minibar bill is heading. And considering the price of Amsterdam hotels, I don't think the room rate is over the top.

<Content>GREAT!!!!!! Stayed at Banks Mansion in May.... We think it is the best hotel in Amsterdam. We have been before in Amsterdam and stayed in other hotels, but Banks is the best. The staff is amazing, and the whole concept is amazing. I could not imagine that people would write negative things about Banks Mansion!!!!!We will be back!!

<Content>Extremely Overpriced! Not Worth the Money! I booked this hotel after reading the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Apparently, most people don't mind paying through the nose for a less-than-mediocre hotel. I stayed for 3 nights in May. I booked a double deluxe room with canal view for over $350/night and I thought I'd be getting my money's worth. What a disappointment! This hotel is nothing more than a Holiday-Inn type chain. The room was really tiny and had cheap stucco-type walls and ceilings. The hotel says it's different because it includes drinks and snacks--this is their gimmick to justify charging such high rates. Your mini-bar is stocked with cans of soda, a couple of waters and some mini bottles of really bad wine. In the lobby you can get more soda and coffee, and... mini Mars bars and other assorted candies. In the afternoons they put out small amounts of bread and butter w/ a very limited amount of cold cuts, which are not replenished when finished. My point is: if their free drinks and snacks feature is supposed to justify their high rates---it's absurd.About the view: I had to stand on my toes to peer out the window and see the canal. Service was standard, and the staff is trained to repeatedly ask you how you are and how your day went EVERYTIME you exit and enter the building.They also ask for a tip when your bill is printed out--there's a blank tip amount line when you sign your bill upon check-out.Overall--no charm, cheaply decorated, tiny rooms, intrusive service--NOT WORTH over $300/night. You'd do better to book a bed  breakfast on the canal and get your money's worth.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed for 7 nights in January - booked room via hotel website. First time in Amsterdam (which is a wonderful city to visit) so cannot compare this accommodation with others in the city. Overall had a great stay (but would not classify it as 5 star).Highlights of the stay:- Rooms (well appointed but small) 3.5*- Bathrooms (large with bathtub but skimpy on toiletries) 4*- Location (great) 5*- Internet access (easy and free) 5*- Lounge (casual with fireplace) 4*- Lounge food / drinks (whilst free which is 5*, quality is a mediocre 3*; expect cheap wines and limited food spread 3*)- Breakfast (adequate but not a huge spread 4*)- Service (wonderful staff 5*; staff forgot to service room 1 day (despite reminder) but was apologetic and compensated us with Bulgary toileteries).Overall would definitely recommend this hotel to friends but still curious to try others in this city.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! The excellent reviews for Banks Mansion prompted us to book a stay there (3 nights) at the beginning of May. We were not disappointed.Great location (near the flower market), with easy access to all the main sites of Amsterdam.The staff was one of the most friendly and helpful staff I've ever encountered at a hotel and that includes stays at hotels with superior star ratings. From the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble and everything was done efficiently and with a smile, from getting our room ready early, recommending and booking a restaurant, booking a taxi.Breakfasts were good and there was plenty of choice: cold meats, cheese, various breads, jams etc., together with a hot buffet. As if that wasn't enough, there was also a cook who would prepare omelettes, pancakes etc. to order.Our room was excellent, with a very comfortable bed and pillows. Well equipped bathroom and a wonderful shower! TV with free movie channels and a DVD player. The complimentary mini bar (including decanters containing whisky, cognac and gin, beer and soft drinks) was very welcome. In addition, the Living bar in the reception was well stocked with wines, liqueurs, spirits, soft drinks and tea and coffee.Free internet access was very popular with the guests, but you didn't have to wait long if it was being used.All in all this hotel is highly recommended!

<Content>The best part of my holiday was staying at the Banks Mansion Staying at the Banks Mansion was fabulous. When we arrived we were taken to our room, 406, by Pamela, who was so nice throughout our stay. When she opened the door we were overwhelmed by how beautiful the room was. The main room was huge with a large sofa and two armchairs with footstools. There was a widescreen tv and dvd player. The bathroom was divine with a jacuzzi bath and walk-in shower and two sinks. The bedroom, yes seperate bedroom had the biggest bed I have ever seen. When we lay on the bed together and stretched out we did not touch each other. There were 4 windows which overlooked everywhere. The room was so nice we did not even want to go out.It is true the drinks are all complimentary. There is only a small sample of drinks in your room, but downstairs there is a larger variety. Just go and help yourself. There is also snacks and sweets to pig out on all day.Unfortunately, breakfast was not so great. It was just okay. There was not a lot of variety and it was not very tasty. Maybe I am just being fussy.This hotel was in the middle of everything. We did not really need the tram or train tickets because we walked almost everywhere, even late at night. Even though most of the days were sunny, it was always cold, particularly in the shade, and freezing at night. Forget sandals and shorts. Bring comfortable shoes. Forget the party clothes, most people dress casual and comfortable and warm.When you get to the airport, do take the connexions bus return fare for 19.50 euros.The bus will stop about 50m away from the front door. The hotel staff will confirm your return for you, this time the bus will stop right outside. You do not need to buy any maps because everywhere you go someone will give you a map.The best piece of advice I took prior to arriving in Amsterdam was to buy my tickets for Van Gogh museum online, the queue was enormous and we felt quite smug when we just walked straight to the front.If you are going to Amsterdam you will not regret staying at the Banks Mansion.

<Content>Amazing experience The hotel was brilliant - great rooms, perfect location and very attentive staff. The free bar facilities in the living room area were ideal for when you want to relax but not just sit in your room. Walking distance to all of the main attractions and metro station. Excellent breakfasts that set you up for the day - made to order pancakes, omelettes or french toast as well as continental breakfast. Overall a very good experience, looking forward to going back!!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We recently returned from a 3 night stay at Banks Mansion. I couldn'tfault a thing.We arrived a bit early, and our room wasn't quite ready. The staff atthe front desk were friendly, helpful and capable. We were invited tosit in the lobby and enjoy a snack and drink while waiting. Within 10minutes we were invited upstairs.Our third floor room overlooked the canal. The room was immaculate, and the amenities were wonderful (bathrobes, slippers, room safe, fresh fruit, free mini-bar, decanters of gin  whiskey  congnac). The bed was great, and the hotel is remarkably quiet. The bathroom was fine (shower but no bathtub). All in all, an exceptionally comfortable room.The breakfast room is on the lower level of the hotel. The breakfastbuffet was comprehensive, and could be supplemented by made-to-order eggs, pancakes, omelets, or French toast. I had a wonderful omelet one morning. Again, the service was great.Free drinks of all sorts were always available in the lobby. This included wines, beers, sodas, and even liquers. The hotel is very well located to allow walking to all the major sites in Amsterdam. We never felt the need to take a tram. It was wonderful to be able to stop in the midst of sightseeing for a cold drink and a snack. The staff at the desk provided a very good street map, and were unfailingly polite when we needed replacements, having twice lost ours.The lobby has 2 internet workstations, which I had no trouble accessing whenver I needed. It's a great help to check in and print boarding passes before going to the airport. The hotel will arrange a shuttle to the airport for 24 euros, which worked out well for us--we turned out to be the only 2 passengers, so it was like having our own taxi but cheaper.Do yourself a favor and have an Indonesian dinner at Tempo Doeloe, Utrechtestraat 75. Try a rice platter which includes portions of 18 different dishes. It was among the best meals I have ever had. We've been back in CT for a week and I wish I was in Amsterdam!

<Content>Awesome Hotel! I stayed for two nights at the Banks Mansion in late April 2007. I made my reservation directly with the hotel; first good sign - the staff promptly (within a few hours) responded to my e-mail reservation inquiry. From the moment I walked in the door, until the moment I checked out, it was a terrific experience. The staff, ESPECIALLY the front desk staff, were super friendly, helpful, and patient with all my tourist questions. The included breakfast buffet provided tasty, ample selections (sandwich meats, cheeses, omelets, cereals, breads, etc.) from which to energize ones' self at least through lunchtime. My canal-view room was clean, modern, and quiet. The bed was a deliciously comfortable respite from a long day of sightseeing, stocked with 4 plush pillows; goes without saying that I slept VERY WELL!!! Bonuses ranged from an in-room refrigerator stocked with various beverages (included), to individually regulated and responsive air conditioning in the room, to free internet access and daytime snacks/drinks in the lobby. The hotel is centrally located to tourist attractions (many can be reached within 20 minutes' walking time), and a tram line runs right past the hotel which takes you to points north and south in the city. If and when I ever go back to Amsterdam, I already know where I will stay. Great place. Now I know why Banks Mansion is so highly rated by other travelers. I couldn't agree more. Thank you, Banks Mansion, for contributing to my overall delightful and successful visit to Amsterdam!

<Content>Very disappointing - overpriced! Went to the Banks Mansion for two nights in April. Went with my brother so we booked two rooms. Hotel looks great from the outside but extremely disappointing inside. It looks as though it has been designed with the cheapest of everything possible. It is certainly not a boutique hotel and infact nothing more than a rather poor bed and breakfast. My room was at the back of the hotel. Woodchip celings and two very small windows that I hd to stand on my tip toes to see out. The furniture in the rooms is of chipboard quality and the complimentary mini bar - well laughable. They advertise that all your drinks are free, yes they are if you want to drink cheap Cava, cheap white wine and cheap red wine. You cannot get spirits in the downstairs bar! The staff are very abrupt and the breakfast room is in the basement of the hotel and is reminiscent of a school lunch room. There is no restaurant facilities in the hotel at other times. I would not recommend it to couples for a romantic weekend - it isn't romantic. I think they have some clever marketing but surely they cannot continue to kid everyone all the time.It may be good value if you can drink 48 bottles of beer a day - I sadly couldn't!

<Content>Loved Banks Mansion! My husband and I just returned from 3 days in Amsterdam, staying at the Banks Mansion. What a lovely hotel in a very convenient Amsterdam location! The Banks Mansion is a high quality, smaller hotel (48 rooms) that offers exceptional service and accomodations and is in a great, central location. We paid extra for a 'canal view' room and were not disappointed. The room was very nicely appointed with flat screen TV, large comfortable bed (two twins together), fully stocked bar and beverages (complimentary in our room - not sure if this is available in all rooms). The hotel offers only breakfast service, which is an excellent hot/cold buffet with made to order eggs/omelettes, pancakes, and french toast. The hotel lobby stocks beverages and snacks available to all hotel guests 24 hours a day. The hotel staff is very helpful, suggesting and making restaurant reservations, airport shuttle, etc. The hotel is located within one block of Rembrandt Plein, Munt Plein, and Singel Flower Market. The Museum District and Waterloo Plein are 10 to 15 minutes walk. The hotel is approximately a 25 minute walk from Central Station (depending upon 'crowd' level). I would definately recommend this hotel -- we certainly plan on staying there again on our next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Worth Every Penny My wife and I booked this hotel to celebrate our anniversary primarily because of the reviews we had seen here. From the moment we arrived, we were not disappointed. After a grueling overnight flight we arrived well before the published check-in time and within 5 minutes we were shown to our room. Because I had mentioned that we would be celebrating my wife's birthday as well as our anniversary during our first trip to Amsterdam, the hotel had placed several welcome gifts as well as a personal note in our room. The location was great! The beds were extremely comfortable, and the staff was perhaps the best that we have encountered. We will definately be returning!

<Content>Excellent Hotel I loved the Banks Mansion Hotel. I use hotels a lot around the world but this is a true gem. I had a corner room (206) it had 3 double windows that opened up onto the canal, complimentary gin, scotch and cognac in the room and complimentary bar in the lobby.Good breakfast was served and the staff were excellent. The position was great being very close to the flower market. My only gripe would be the bed which should have been a double but it was 2 singles pushed together, not the same however i had a walk in shower and huge bath. I will be staying at the Banks Mansion again ;-)Tip ; ask for a corner room they seem to be the largest.

<Content>What a Wonderful Hotel We had never been to Amsterdam before, but what a wonderful trip we had, thanks in great part to this superb hotel, with such high standards reached in all areas.My fiance particularly liked the complimentary drink arrangements, and promptly texted lots of our friends to tell them the good news! ( Free advertising or what!?) It was the Easter break, I do not drink, but adore chocolate...and the free mini easter eggs scattered all over the hotel for guests to partake of was a lovely touch.The staff were helpful but not patronising, the room was lovely with the opportunity for a steam whenever we wanted, as our shower turned into a steam cabin.The breakfasts were superb, we met lots of great people, and really enjoyed ourselves, we will be back, with our friends, very very soon, and would not dream of staying anywhere else.....

<Content>Just brilliant Just fabulous!!Clean lovely rooms, polite, cheerful and helpful staff.Worth every penny this hotel and will definately be returning later in the year. Such a relaxed hotel, no rowdy stag or hen do's here!I booked it via hotel club for great price and without specifying was given a lovely room overlooking the canal. Inclusive drinks a big bonus and the breakfast kitchen was wonderful.I will recommend it to anyone who is visiting Amsterdam. It is so central to just about everything, in walking distance of it all. You so wont be disappointed. We went to the supperclub and boom chicago too. A totally brilliant weekend!!!

<Content>A great stay! I stayed at the Banks last week while on a 3 day business trip and enjoyed it so much that I felt compelled to write a review. It is a great hotel -super location, very friendly staff and a real homey atmosphere with free in-room drinks and a cozy lounge with fireplace and self-serve bar. My room was of a good size, with modern amenities -you can even request a special molded pillow. Breakfast is also included and there is a safe luggage room (bags get ticketed) should you need to check out before needing to leave the city. Highly recommended

<Content>We booked through Finnair's TopClub We booked this hotel through Finnair's Topclub package. It was worth every penny - the room was great, the compleimentary drinks in the room and in the reception area meant that there was a friendly business-like feeling between the guests. The staff were really friendly and the location caould not be better. Near to the center, right on the tram lines and yet quiet during the night.We ate in the Cafe Amsterdam which is at the end of the number 10 tram line. Strong recommendation along with their other restauarant called the Cafe Restaurant Dauphine. Great places...

<Content>Simply Fantastic I booked this hotel on line after reviewing some reviews - I wasn't disapointed. Its a great hotel in a great location. The staff were fantastic and very helpful and I felt very welcome. The location of the hotel is about 100 meters away from the flower market which leads onto the main shopping streets up to Dam Square - a great location. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone and will use this hotel everytime I return to Amsterdam.

<Content>A Very Pleasant Experience My fiance and I were recently in Amsterdam for 5 days celebrating our engagement. This was a surprise trip for her, so I picked Banks Mansion for our acommodation. We were both very happy with the choice. I asked them to provide flowers for my fiance in the room, which they did, a very beautiful boquet at that. They also put us in a great room, with a beautiful, expansive view of Heren canal.The rain shower was nice, the bath was OK, a little small (fine for 1 person). The luxury touches, like free drinks and snacks, and a pillow menu, were nice, although we only took minimal advantage of them. To me those things weren't really a big deal, but at least they weren't distracting. We only had breakfast there one day, but it was fine, no complaints.I was also impressed with the management's response to an issue that came up. I had booked well in advance, but noticed their prices had dropped, and they were running a special, for the time we would be there. After emailing, they told me to modify my reservation online and I would get the better price. I did that, but I either messed up the process, or somehow the modification wasn't transmitted to them (although I did email them immediately after I had modified it, telling them the same). While I was unable to get the better price before checking out (they told me since they didn't get the info, there was nothing they could do), once I got back state-side, I emailed management about the issue and promptly recieved a return phone call. After explaining the situation, they offered me a credit on a future room or a refund for the amount in the difference in pricing. I chose the later and, indeed, the money was refunded on my credit card. So I appreciated their understanding and acomodation.Finally, the location is great - its right on the edge between what we felt like was the touristy part of Amsterdam (i.e. in between Central Staation and the first of the 3 big canals, Heren Canal), and the more real, residential part of Amsterdam, like the Jordaan area. We enjoyed having access to both, and spent a lot of time walking around some new areas neither of us had yet explored (we've both been to Amsterdam several times). Because its right on Herengraght, too, it makes it easy to walk anywhere East or West. Definitely great location.We would definitely stay here again (and will next time we're in Amsterdam).

<Content>What a great hotel I can't add much more to other reviews, I had a great stay Feb25 - 27.The room was brilliant with a canal view and as I had to work in it all day Monday, it was very comfortable. Internet access was $22 for 24 hours and the connection was very fast at 12mb.Everything else was just as reported and I loved it.

<Content>Excellent hotel, deserves the 5 star reviews Have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Banks Mansion and we were not disappointed. Our room was fairly small (if staying in a canal view room avoid 101/201 etc) but beautifully furnished as were all the other areas of the hotel (with the exception of the garish carpets outside the rooms mentioned in other reviews! ) The free drink and snacks is a wonderful idea and there was plenty available - and good stuff too. Lovely to come back to after a day sightseeing or to sit in the lounge for a cognac before going out. The staff couldn't have been more obliging or friendly and the breakfast was delicious. The hotel is really well placed for sightseeing - accessible by trams 16, 24 or 25 from central but also within walking distance if you miss the last one at midnight.One slight negative is the shower which doesn't seal very well and leads to a very wet floor if you are not careful - but that's a minor moan from an otherwise perfect stay.We thoroughly recommend this hotel and would stay here if ever visiting Amsterdam in the future.

<Content>SUPERB Hotel I stayed in this hotel in January, there were 7 of us on the trip. The location was super and so was the hotel, I had a room overlooking the canal which was good, one had a room with windows very high so no view BUT they had a sauna in their bathroom,. The reception staff were very helpful to us and the FREE snacks and drinks were great, especially when you had been out walking all day. The rooms are small, the beds are comfy and the bathrooms great, The choice of pillows was great as I have a bad back and need good support. The only downside was the air con, a bit noisy, but switch it off and open a window instead. We ALL had a great time and the Hotel was GREAT. Would DEFINITELY stay THERE AGAIN

<Content>good hotel, bank on it Stayed for a long weekend, the front desk staff were excellent , rooms were very well appointed including a flat panel tv and free munchies in the room.the hotel only has 51 rooms so in season you must book early, try and avoid the basement rooms as they have no view and street noise can disrupt a good nights sleep. food was always available 24/7 at no extra cost.the hotel is very clean and centrally located no matter what your in town for.excellent value if priced right( best price by far) Yes I'd stay here again

<Content>Wonderful hotel! Our stay here was absolutely wonderful. I will not repeat the detail posted by other users but to say the slightly higher price is more than worth it for the inclusive drinks, excellent staff and great breakfast (french toast to die for!)The staff could not do enough for us and were genuinely friendly, the room was very comfortable and the location excellent. We will be back.

<Content>Fantastic hotel but wished I had a different room This hotel is amazing. Everything about it was wonderful and pretty much how I imagined it would be. We stayed for 3 nights in Feb. I could go on and on about how fabulous the room was and how helpful the staff were and how great all the extras were as other reviewers have done, but I can't really add to what's already been said. Stay here, you will not regret it. It will become your favorite hotel.That being said, I had two very minor disappointments. One being the room given to us (room 101). We had booked a deluxe canal view room months in advance. Upon arrival we were given probably the smallest room in the hotel. The bathroom didn't have a bath, only a shower (a fantastic shower it should be said). But even with a small room minus a bath, it was still fine, we still had a great time. I could've asked to be moved but decided it really wasn't worth the bother. The next time I go, I will ask to see different rooms/configurations and will probably not choose a canal view room (we were hardly there). The second disappointment was the fee charged for wireless connection in the room (10 euros for 60 minutes). Since everything about this hotel is all-inclusive, I didn't understand why wireless wasn't included. There were 2 computers with free internet in the lobby, but for someone like me, working on the go from my laptop, lobby computers were not an option. Banks should either offer free wireless, or find a different internet access provider to offer better rates for their guests.The time we spent in the lobby by the fireplace after a full day of sightseeing was something we will always remember. Thank you Banks, we will be back.

<Content>Fantastic hotel if you can afford the rate We booked directly over the internet a room with canal view which cost extra and is definitely not a budget price hotel, however, if it fits your budget We can thoroughly recommend it. our room was No 106 on the 1st floor and was decorated stunningly with 3 opening double tall windows looking out onto the canal and main street. Lovely decor, very comfy bed (2 very wide singles pushed together) air con, tv with 2 free porn channels 69 +70 (spice up your weekend - the dutch are definitely not prudes) a superb double size Rain shower and a bath, haidryer etc, plus FREE whisky, conyac and vodka in cut glass decanters and a mini bar stocked with smoothies, coca Cola, beer and fruit juices. That was just the beginning, the staff are so helpful and will recommend eating out etc based upon their experiences. Once you get your bearings you will soon find that you are located in an excellent location whether walking(as we did) or getting buses, taxis or trams. Some of the best places we went were The Ice bar (expensive but worth it) Ranchos Argentinian steak house, Red light district - you will be amazed (just window shopping) Anyway back to the hotel, the breakfasts were great, choice of cooked scambled eggs, bacon and sausage plus fruit, cooked meats, various breads for toast, or your own personally cooked omelette. And in the Living a lovely fire to chill out to when you returned to your hotel each evening with a FREE bar where you just help yourself to beer, wine, spirits and snacks (if there is a bottle that is empty just ask the staff and they will replace it with a full bottle) Then there is the free internet also in the living, by the time you add all the free booze and internet time you soon realise that although it seems a bit expensive when you first book when you check out and your bill is just the same as when you first booked that this hotel is a real find and is actually a bargain.I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know and will definitely stay here next time we visit Amsterdam.I hope the other rooms in the hotel live up to room 106.Personally we will ask for 106 when we go again.Enjoy!!!!

<Content>2nd time around Having stayed at the hotel in October 2005 with my wife when I knew I was returning on business with two colleagues of course I booked us into Banks Mansion.I know by far the greater majority of reviews about the hotel on this site laud the welcome, the ambiance, The Living etc etc. The rare negative entry is only to be expected.Having returned today from 2 nights there I am delighted to report that the standards I experienced in 2005 have in no way declined. The welcome on our arrival from the reception staff including Sarah Trainee was genuine. The recommendation for a restaurant that night was spot on. (We went to Gauchos just round the corner on the Amstel Straat.) The hotel rooms were excellent, spotlessly clean, breakfast delightful with a more than adequate choice and freshly cooked. My two colleagues were equally impressed and each said they would return as of course would I, either with work or pleasure.Just as an aside here is a restaurant recommendation. It's called Sherpa and as can be guessed by the name it is a Nepalese and Tibetan orientatedn restaurant. Located on Leidsedwarsstraat off Leidesplein if you want to try something different I would urge you to give it a go. Very reasonably priced the food is excellent.To conclude ...well done Banks Mansion - your rating here is more than justified and if I return to Amsterdam I know where I shall be staying.

<Content>Absolutely First Rate Hotel We booked via the hotel website based on trip advisor reviews and stayed 3 nights. We cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. Staff bend over backwards to make sure you have everything you desire (we were offered a choice of 3 seperate rooms with different views/layouts). We also arrived about 4 hours prior to check in time and were provided with a room immediately by the super friendly reception staff. The rooms had terrific canal views and noise was blocked out by double glazing. Rooms had a lovely art deco them and were a great size! The free movies and mini bar/snacks were an excellent touch and I highly recommend the breakfasts - dutch pancakes and the likes made to order. All the attractions are within an easy walking distance ie Heineken museum, Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh, Dam Square, Red Light District etc. (although if going to central you might prefer to take a tram - which leave from the front door). The incredibly friendly staff made the stay even more pleasant. If you are going to Amsterdam you absolutely MUST stay here.

<Content>The perfect place for family, friends and colleauges This is the only city hotel I know that offers all drinks included in the price. It really is a nice touch and I had friends staying in another hotel who was allowed to sit and have a couple of drinks while I got ready for dinner. No chage they told me. Very nice staff.Room was excellent. Canal view right on the corner. Fantastic bathroom, Walk in rain shower and masive bath. A great romantic getaway. Free internet, Printer and free bar nibbles with the drinks.Breakfast was very good too. There was a choice of 4 types of pillows and to top it all flatscreen TV with good selection of channels and DVDs.It's not a real 4 star hotel in the true sense, but it makes up for this with the freebies. OK they are included in the price, but in that case this is amazing value for money.Almost forgot to mention the flame effect fire and leather sofas.It you can get one of there special rates book it as soon as you can. You won;t regret it.

<Content>A very good stay Very good location and very good service. Staff is ready to help and support the guest's needs.The complimentary room frigo bar and the complimentary snacks and beverages in the hall have been highly appreciated.The rooms are very comfortable and quite (mine was on the back).Breakfast is included in the room price and 2 computers with free access to internet are available in the hall. Other hotel consider these services as extra. Negative comment: only the ugly moquette outside the rooms

<Content>Excellent service and good value! The friendly staff couldn't do enough for us. They made our stay very special. The bathroom was amazing and the room was clean and spacious. The breakfast was good and all the drinks and snacks were free of charge. We would stay there again. Have stayed in other hotels in Amsterdam that were more expensive but not as nice!

<Content>Fantastic City Centre Hotel Banks Mansion is not your usual European City Centre hotel. It is much more in keeping with the 'Inns' found in New York City. It is all the better for this.Our stay over new year was excellent - from the friendly, efficient check-in; stylish, modern, clean bedrooms; bathrooms you actually want to use (though many rooms simply have walk-in showers rather than a bath so worth checking if that is important to you); 'The Living' where drinks and snacks are available 24/7 - all complimentary - and internet access is free; to the more than sufficient breakfasts served in the kitchen. If you are looking for pomp and ceremony (you know the sort of thing - your poached eggs brought to you covered in a silver dome at breakfast), then Banks isn't for you. If, however, you are content to request freshly cooked pancakes, french toast and feast of high quality fresh bread, jam, cheese and meat at breakfast and prefer a more relaxed hotel stay, this place is perfect.Re comments below regarding the policy of not taking drinks to your room. This is nonsense. Yes, the drinks are for sharing so it is bad form to take a bottle of champagne up to your room, but we (and other guests) were never stopped from taking glasses of wine  champagne, bottles of beer, cups of coffee etc. to our room. As we stayed over new year, a half bottle of champagne was left on our bed - a nice guesture. There is also a well stocked mini bar in each room along with decanters of gin, congac and whisky.For a City Centre base in Amsterdam, Banks Mansion is faultless. I wish every city had an equivalent hotel to save us from the overpriced misery of bland, outdated, business hotels that charge 鈧?0+ for a substandard breakfast.If I had to critique it would be twofold: 1) our loo roll supplies weren't topped up (thoug remedied by a phonecall) and 2) local taxes payable on checkout were unexpected. That said, as everything else was included in the room rate, the bill on checkout was considerably smaller than is usually the case!

<Content>Great Hotel There is a reason that Banks Mansion is rated number 2 among hotels in Amsterdam on the tripadvisor website--it's simply a great hotel. As other reviewers have stated, the hotel staff is friendly and helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations, the rooms and beds are comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast, snacks and drinks only add to make your stay more enjoyable.My husband and I stayed at Banks Mansion in early December 2006 with two friends. Our friends are rather picky about where they stay, so I spent a lot of time researching various hotels in Amsterdam based on the location, cost and amenities. We booked the Christmas Shopping arrangement package on the Banks Mansion webiste at a good rate considering everything that was included with it. We were fortunate to be visiting during Sinterklaasavod (December 5th), when Sinter Klaas, along with his helper, Zwarte Piet, arrive to launch the Christmas season. As a part of this celebration, the hotel left cookies at our door as a gift. I have visited Amsterdam in the summer, spring and winter, and I've found December to be one of the best times there because of Sinterklassavod and the Christmas markets. Moreover, of all of the hotels I've stayed in during those visits, none compares with the comfort of Banks Mansion.

<Content>Not that great. Stayed here for one night for my boyfriends birthday and we were disappointed. When we got there our room was not ready, then when we were given a room it was non-smoking when I specifically asked for a smoking room. So I had to traipse back down to reception to ask for the smoking room I had booked. When I got down to reception the extremely surly male receptionist said (with much sighing and eye rolling) that he would see what he could do, which I thought was a bit of a nerve since I booked the smoking room months earlier! While I was waiting some people came in to try and book a room. The receptionist took one look at them and listened to their indian accents and decided they were not suitable, so he told them very rudely to leave and shouted at them when they protested. I was shocked and appalled by his attitude.The 'living' space in reception is a waste of time as you aren't aloud to take drinks out of reception. We wanted to take our drinks upstairs to our room and were told we couldn't. It was my boyfriend鈥檚 birthday and we wanted to celebrate with some champagne in privacy. Apparently, that was too much to ask.The breakfast the next day was a bit poor as well. Hardly any choice and felt more like a school canteen than a 4-star hotel.On the whole - i wouldn't go back.

<Content>Fantastic Just returned froma hectic two day break in Amsterdam with hubby celebrating his birthday. It was our first time and let me say a big thankyou to all previous reviews about this wonderful vibrant city that helped us make choices about where to stay.We finally decided on the Banks Mansion and it certainly lived up to all your helpful info.We got a great deal on Opodo-much cheaper than the recommended prices, and the free bar was worth the while. It is the only hotel in Amsterdam that offers this service and it saved us a fortune.The hotel is nicely decorated, with tasteful art deco furniture and furnishings (cept the upstairs carpet which was a bit whacky). The beds are really comfy which is very important to us,and the rooms spotlessly clean. Staff were very helpful and friendly but unobtrusive.The hotel enjoys a great location, and very easy to get to and from, tram stops just outside. Also, our concerns about transport were unfounded as Amsterdam has a very good, efficient, fast, cheap and regular system which makes life very easy.everywhere was easy to walk to from this hotel and although we could have got the tram everywhere we enjoyed the canal walks-even in the rain. The shops are lovely, really unusual and it makes a pleasure to see something different, and quality is good. I took a DK mini guide and the recommendations ofr restaurants ect were spot on, namely BOJO's , an inexpensive Indonesian near Leidisplein (think thats how u spell it ) huge portions so share and save. Jordaan area was funky and interesting too.Well its getting longer by the minute so will sign off now, but abs advise you to go and have fun-we did.

<Content>Nice We stayed here for 3 nights over new year's and couldn't really fault it. The concept, the design and the comfort levels are all worthy of praise, as are the staff, one of whom on seeing us getting out of a taxi in a downpour, met us at the door with a couple of towels. Nice touch. Thanks Sonja.

<Content>New Year My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights over the New Year period. The things that need mentioning have already been said i.e. the staff were excellent, the shower to die for, the living area was very relaxing, although hotel was full we never felt it. The special touches, the personal service make this an excellent hotel for a relaxing stay in Amsterdam - it deserves it's ranking on Trip Advisor.

<Content>Fantastic! Stayed here in early November having read the other reviews here on tripadviser. We loved it and only wished we could have stayed longer (only stayed one night). The staff were very friendly and even rang our room just after we arrived to make sure we were satisfied. The room was great with a really comfortable bed. The free drinks and snacks downstairs was what really made the hotel. After a long day's sightseeing we were able to come back and chill out with wine, beer and even some champagne. The atmosphere was really relaxed and having come back from dinner we sat down for more drinks. We would definitely recomend this hotel and would love to make a return visit someday!

<Content>Fantastic getaway!!! We stayed here for 3 nights in November - the hotel was great  decor was amazing. Our room was on the 3rd floor  had a terrific canal view. The shower in the room was to die for. Location is terrific for exploring the city.We didn't find the hotel staff as friendly as other reviewers had mentioned but they were fine. The free bar in the lounge is great but the novelty wears out after the first night. Internet access in the lobby was very handy. It was really nice to explore the city and then come back and sit by the fire  sip Champaigne Or have a nice relaxing drink before heading back out to explore the nightlife!!!If we go back to Amsterdam, we would have to stay at this hotel - otherwise the holiday just would not be the same.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is everything we expected it to be. The staff are courteous, it is situated in a great area, round the corner from some good restaurants (we highly recommend Teppanyaki Nippon Japanese Grill on Reguliersdwarsstraat, just round the corner) and within easy walking distance of most places to see.The decor is excellent,, everywhere is spotlessly clean and particularly the lounge area is comfortable and has a very relaxing ambience. You can help yourself to drinks and snacks at any time of the day, which adds to the overall atmosphere of luxury.Breakfast is fabulous with a chef on call to do fresh omelettes, porridge etc at your desire.We can't recommend this place enough. Its price totally justifies the whole experience of a stay here.

<Content>Fabulous Having stayed in various other hotels over the years we booked the Banks Mansion on the strength of Trip Advisor reviews. We really weren't disappointed. We arrived early expecting to have to leave our luggage until later, but were shown to our room straight away. The room was a good size, very clean and attractive, and most importantly the bed was VERY comfortable.The staff were all lovely, breakfast was great, the free bar is a lovely idea and the shower was fantastic. Next time I will make sure I book a bath, but that is my only gripe. We had booked a canal view room, but whilst that sounds nice we were out and about, walking around the canals. Maybe its a good idea to ensure that the room is quieter. The location was excellent, within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. The walking also helped stave off the inevitable weight gain that follows too many pancakes.We love this city and visit every year. Next year we'll definately stay here again.

<Content>loved it!! I've only stayed in one other hotel in Amsterdam, a soulless Marriott type...but whilst walking round the city i couldn't see any hotel as nice as the Banks Mansion.Its got something....not especially from the outside...and not especially the area, which whilst central didnt have the best view from the side windows (take aways and graffiti) but the inside is just wonderful!Cosy, warm, beautifully decorated, light, modern but with a twenties style about it. Just lovely!The staff are fantastic. Friendly, helpful and without being forced!We got chatting to some guys who were staying in the hotel who told us that the night before they had asked for a cab to be ordered as it was pouring down outside. The taxi still hadnt turned up ten minutes later so the receptionist actually stood outside and flagged one down for them!! Does that not say it all?The free drinks/food thing is great. Not really free of course as Banks Mansion is pretty expensive...but the concept works...it feels good to have drinks and snacks on tap without the irksome task of totting up your bar bill at the end of the night.....Rooms lovely, breakfast great and again helpful staff here too.The outside areas by the way, i may have been a bit harsh. It is in the nicer parts of Amsterdam, along a canal, and not far from the flower marketAnyway, we wouldnt stay anywhere else in Amsterdam, it was pretty near perfect.

<Content>Banks Mansion -- sometimes two stars, sometimes four After a long flight across the Atlantic and a six hour layover in London, we were pathetically grateful to finally reach the Banks Mansion. Our canal view room, booked weeks before our trip, wasn't available. Instead, we were shown to a dark room facing, well, nothing.Not an auspicious start! Two stars or less.Room 312, however, had its good side. The bed was very comfortable and the Banks Mansion offers a menu of five different types of pillows, for any kind of firmness or softness you desire. The four pillows already in the room suited us just fine, and I'm a pillow snob. Four stars.The bathroom was also another definite plus. It was very big. The separate shower was large with a huge shower head and loads of water pressure. The tub was great for a deep soak and you faced away from the toilet. I love my bubble baths but I hate staring at a toilet for the duration of my bath. Four stars. However, the towels were tiny and the soap/shampoo situation was pretty miserly. Also, a face towel that went astray sat at the back of the cabinet floor for four days. The cleaner never spotted it though the rest of the bathroom was sparkling. Two stars.Everybody raves about the free booze and snacks. Yes, there are decanters of cognac, gin and whiskey on the bedside table. If that's your thing then I guess it's pretty exciting. I'm a bit of a cynic and always wonder what other guests may have added to the mixture. But, hey, that's just me. There is a mini bar with water, juice, pop and two Heinekens. I must admit that was a nice touch. Also, the bar downstairs had lashings of red and white wine, beers, pops, sparkling and flat waters, coffee, tea, liqueurs, you name it. Help yourself. Four stars.Breakfast (included) was great. No quibbles there. It was open from 7-10:30 during the week and until 11 on the weekend. Very civilized. The usual ham, cheese, muesli, yogurt mix but also the added bonus of omelets, pancakes and porridge made fresh to order. Four stars.The staff were WONDERFUL. Especially Michel. He deftly saved every two star situation and made it into a four. He knew we were disappointed about our room change and made sure a chilled bottle of champagne was waiting for us the next evening as well as an offer to change rooms as soon as a canal view was available (we elected to stay where we were because it was too much of a hassle to re-pack). Noticing our interest in dining, he gave us a fabulous book on Amsterdam restaurants and insisted we keep it. He also gave us great recommendations. A charming man and a real asset to the hotel. As were the rest of the staff. Five stars!Would we go back? We debated this and decided, yeah, we would. By the way, enjoy Amsterdam. It is a FABULOUS city!

<Content>The Best My best friend and I stayed here for 3 nights and we definitely could have stayed longer. The Staff :Very friendly and attentive. Henry, who was on duty when we arrived, saw us exiting our taxi and struggling with our luggage came outside to assist us. After insisting on taking our luggage to the room, he stayed and explained everything the hotel had to offer in detail. At dinner time we asked the clerk at the front desk about a good restaurant in the area and he directed us to a very good Italian restaurant on the corner, Point Arcata. They were also very helpful in assisting us when we had to ship some of our purchases home going so far as to packing them for us.Rooms:Typical small European room but decorated very nicely. The bathroom was very large with a huge tub for relaxing in. Plush terrycloth robes and slippers are provided for you so all you need are your pajamas.Amenities:An extensive breakfast was included in our room price and it was worth every cent. No simple rolls and coffee here! The food and service was excellent! If you stay here, make sure you take advantage of the coffee and drinks that are free and the good snacks that are put out 3 times a day. Internet access is free and lobby is a beautiful place to sit and enjoy the scenery outside (the hotel is near a canal), or to read a book.

<Content>Disappointing I booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews I read on Trip Adviser, as I wanted something really special for my wife鈥檚 50th birthday.I emailed the hotel before our stay to ask them to provide some flowers for my wife, to be in the room when we arrived. (I have now seen on a previous review that someone else did this successfully). I was told that this would be no problem. I also asked them to recommend a restaurant and book a table for the Friday night of our stay.When we arrived there were no flowers in the room so I went down to reception to find out why. The receptionist, who had replied to my email, said that he had forgotten to order the flowers. However he said he would get onto it straight away. Having forgotten the flowers I checked with him that he had booked the table at the restaurant. He assured me that this had been done. The flowers soon turned up and I was not charged for them.The room was great but during the first night my wife and I were kept awake by a rather noisy fan, which was directly over our bed. The next day we reported this and asked if it could be switched off. We were told that it could not be switched off but that it would be seen to. Later that day we were told that the filter had been changed. This did not make it any quieter and we had to live with the noise for the duration of our stay. There was also a stain on the floor of the room. Beware of room 411鈥檚 noisy fan!On the Friday evening we turned up at Het Tuynhuys restaurant on Reguliersdwarsstraat and we were told that they had no record of our booking and that they were full for the evening. They rang our hotel and the receptionist said that he could not remember if he had actually booked the meal. The staff at the restaurant felt sorry for us and worked hard to find us a table and in half an hour we were sat down ready to order. The food is fabulous and the service first rate. We highly recommend it and a special thank you to the manager and Nichole.We would agree with other reviews that this hotel is in an excellent location close to many of the attractions and that the free drinks and snacks are a bonus.We would also agree that the front office desk is friendly but not skilled at handling requests. They did not seem to know very much when asked general enquires about Amsterdam. When we tried to check out some information about buying tickets for some of the attractions they could not help us. We were often kept waiting and then when we were being dealt with; the staff broke away and talked to someone else. On one occasion the receptionist had to ask a senior member of staff three times about a simple enquiry. Not once did the senior member of staff come out and deal with the issue. More training is clearly needed in customer care and the art of concentration.Amsterdam has so much to offer and we would recommend hiring a bike (Mac Bike) to explore and the Sauna Deco at Herengracht 115 Grachtengordel. With all the cycling and walking you will do it is worth spending some time relaxing and Sauna Deco is a great place to do it. They provide good refreshments.Banks Mansion clearly has many good features and facilities, however for us it was let down by the carelessness of the staff.Where was Nina? (Mentioned in previous reviews). Come back all is forgiven!

<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Banks Mansion from Sept. 21-26 on vacation. It truly is a great place. The staff is friendly and helpful. The free internet is a great perk as well as all inclusive drinks in the main lobby and in your room. Breakfast was great as well. The rooms were clean, but very small. There is a nice bureau for hanging clothes and some shelves, but we had no place to store our luggage. The canal view was nice to have, but I wouldn't have been comfortable there for an entire weeks stay due to the small quarters. My only other complaint is that the stand-up shower we had leaked horribly. It would flood the ENTIRE bathroom floor, and when I say entire I mean it! We notified the front desk, but all that was provided to us was extra towels. So, I must admit having 3-4 soaking wet towels on the small bathroom floor after your shower was pretty much a pain. The location is great; within walking distance to most everything and to some great restaurants recommended by the front desk staff. We never used the public transit because we were able to walk everywhere. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Yes, it is that good It is classed as the best hotel by users of this site and I have to agree. Excellent location close to the Flower Market and Rembrandtplein, Banks Mansion has an understated cool feel. Whilst my room was small, it had a canal view and was perfectly fine for the duration of my stay. Great breakfast and friendly staff and amazingly free in room drinks (inc. alcohol) as well as free bar in the lounge. No charge for internet use either.Personally, wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in the city.

<Content>great hotel for tourists, ok for business After staying at the Mariott for the last several years, I decided to give this hotel a try based on the TA reviews..The rooms were very comfortable, very clean(excpet for a few hairs I found in the tub), and the included mini bar was pretty darn cool. The breakfast was wonderful(get the pancakes - typical dutch). This is not a great business hotel although..The font office desk is VERY friendly but not skilled at handling business requests..We tried to get them to FEDEX a box of samples and they were mystified at the process. Also, the front office person recommended the dry cleaner next to the hotel...BEWARE...the dry cleaner temporarily misplaced my colleagues clothes and when they were found, we had already moved onto London. The owner would not forward them as she stated we had not paid for them..Another colleague had to go and pick them up. The hotel is great, but I would give it a strong recommendation for the vacationer versus the business traveler.

<Content>Superb Hotel This is a superb hotel that I actually booked before reading the reviews.My wife and I spent two excellent nights there on 22 and 23rd September 2006.All the previous reviews were spot on. From the moment we arrived the staff were so helpful and friendly.The room was perfect and the flowers I had ordered were in the room waiting (I have never seen such a fantastic bouquet).The location is fine and the complimentary drinks in both the room and the lounge area were an excellent idea.Would highly recommend and will be staying there again for definite.

<Content>Mixed feelings about Bank Mansion I have mixed feelings regarding this Hotel. Pros: great position nice friendly area with drinks and food included in the rate and good breakfast. Cons: rooms are really small and I think that if you promote your rooms as deluxe ( or at lest these I booked ) you deserve something larger. First room was on the ground floor ( # 8 ) and was so small that I still think it was a single room, with a ridiculous small bathroom, beside this was right on the sidewalk. After a little discussion the receptionist mouved us to # 109 was just a little better with a small bathroom and but at least was on the first floor.Front desk people were really kind but a luxury hotel like this really need a good concierge that can give you the right advice.So if you go there plan ahed your trip for restaurants and nightlife and don't pay in advance or you can have a very small room on the ground floor.

<Content>Banks Mansion-Great! We stayed at the Banks Mansion after a 9 day Baltic cruise. We were spoiled from the service on the ship and Banks Mansion did not disappoint.Check in was easy. We arrived at the hotel around 10AM. Our rooms were not ready but they happily stored our many pieces of luggage while we toured Amsterdam. Arrived back around 2PM and not only were our rooms ready but our luggage was already in them!Rooms were modern with fabulous sound systems and flat screen TV's. Air conditioning was working well and our room was actually cold.Service at the front desk, bar area and breakfast was wonderful. The bar has many different options (alcoholic and non) and food choices too. Keep in mind that this hotel is truly all inclusive. Even the internet access was complimentary.Great location and within walking distance to most everything.I would definitely recommend this hotel to any traveler looking for a 3-4 star experience. The only thing missing is room service. Not a problem here. Coffee and light bites are always available. Great restaurants are less than 5 minute walk away.

<Content>Great place to stay I booked this hotel on the strength of the reviews on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. My friend and I stayed at the hotel for a week in the middle of August. The staff were consistently helpful and friendly and were happy to recommend restaurants and make reservations whenever needed. The whole at home concept is great and the selection of snacks and drinks available could not be faulted. Breakfast was also varied and plentiful. My only slight criticism is that there do not seem to be any true twin rooms in the hotel - the best we could do was to inch our two single beds apart every night which was not easy since they were held together by a top cover; however, I would still have no hesitation in booking into this hotel again if I were spending time in Amsterdam.

<Content>Don't stay anywhere else What can Isay that has not already been said. My husband and I stayed at the Banks Mansion over August Bank Holiday. We upgraded to canal view room which was well worth it. As soon as we arrived we were impressed by the building, the cleanliness of the hotel, how smart and how helpful the staff are. A special thanks to Nina who made us feel so welcome, and always had a smile for everyone. All staff lovely but Nina stood out from the rest. Our room was large by european standards, spotless and as mentioned by others had very well stocked mini bar. The breakfast room was lovely with a good selection of foods, my husband enjoyed his freshly made omelettes very much. Once again everything was spotless. Amsterdam is a lovely place to visit with very friendly helpful people. So easy to get around and we always felt safe. If you are making your way from the station to the hotel by tram make a note to get tram number 24, 25 and I think 16 also goes there. the hotel is a couple of minutes walk from the tram stop. Ask for Herengracht Canal. Thank you Banks Mansion for making our stay a wonderful one. Lorraine and David.

<Content>Fantastic Banks Mansion! Stayed at Banks Mansion for 3 nights on 25th August 06, for mine  husband's 10th wedding anniversary (without our kids hurray!! - thanks mum and dad for looking after them!). Was very excited about staying at the hotel, especially after reading so many positive reviews on trip advisor. Arrived after a short delay on our flight at around 7 pm, we were greeted by 'Nina' on Reception, who was very friendly. We were given room 201 which had a view overlooking the Herengracht canal, and our window was directly opposite the Mayor of Amsterdam's house!! Lovely room, large bed with a chair/footstool at the side. Nice shower-room in art-deco style with a lovely big shower cubicle. The shower leaked onto the floor each time so we had to make good use of the bath mat, but it wasnt worth complaining about! Loved the plasma tv on the wall, and the dvd player. Also enjoyed the free decanters of drink - gin, brandy and whiskey. We made it to breakfast 2 of our 3 mornings, very nice but found the girl who made the omelettes/french toast etc a bit stroppy. I think she was just a bit stressed as she had been left alone by her colleagues, but even so she was a bit rude! (I only asked if there was another loaf of bread as when we arrived in the breakfast room there was none!). (on Sundays the breakfast room is open until 11, we had arrived at approx. 10:20 - so obviously we expected to have bread available)! However, dont let this put you off, the hotel is great in general!We made good use of the 'living area' where they provide free coffee and pastries in the mornings, alcoholic drinks (more or less everything you can think of) and nuts/doritos/dips etc in the afternoon/evening. Oh, and free use of the internet if you need it. The hotel was in an excellent location, everything we were interested in seeing was within a 10 minute walk. We had a lovely meal (probably the nicest meal we've ever had - and we've eaten in a fair few restaurants!), at Casa di David which is located on the Singel, a 7 minute walk from Banks Mansion. To start we shared bruschetta with mozzarella and pesto - delicious. My husband then had a plain old spaghetti bolognaise - but said it was the best he'd ever eaten! I had kebabs of king prawn  poached salmon, on a bed of green beans with parmesan dressing - gorrrrgeous! This was served with saute potatoes. The food was lovely, the setting lovely, waiters very friendly, lovely atmosphere. (by the way we got Nina at Banks Mansion to reserve us a table as we'd tried to get in on the Friday night but couldnt).We also ate lunch at Cafe de Kroon in Rembrandtplein, just a snack, but it was a lovely sunny day and nice to people-watch for an hour or so!We also tried a 'coffee shop'. We stayed away from the tourist-y ones, and went to a more 'locals' type coffee shop. Had a great atmosphere, with funky dance music playing. Had a wander through the Red Light District - what an eye-opener!!! Also did a canal boat tour, during the day, this was really enjoyable too.We spent one morning shopping in Kalverstraat - a few nice clothes shops (some designer, some high street), everything a bit cheaper than the UK. All in all, will definitely go back to Amsterdam one day, and will stay at Banks Mansion!

<Content>Very good, but not four star great. Stayed here for five days starting August 19th. Loved the friendly staff, great breakfast and location. The free mini bar is ok but doesn't really offset the musty room that stank of cigarette smoke, the dirty chairs in the lobby, and the not quite sparkling clean bathroom.Although the Banks claims four star status, this is a three star hotel at best.

<Content>You don't get much better. The reviews on this site are excellent and almost put you in a mind to be hyper critical. We couldn't be. All hotels should be like this: generous, welcoming and professional. We enoyed our stay here and we are determined to return to the hotel and to Amsterdam.

<Content>Can't wait to go back This was a truly brilliant hotel. We were stunned to find that not only did we have a FREE mini bar in our room, but you could also help yourself to all the drinks in the hotel foyer too!!!! Plus, the staff brought out snacks throughout the day. The staff were all so helpful and were always polite. Our room was lovely too and I thought great value for money - hooray for Steam-free mirrors in the bathroom, bath robes, ice crushing machines in the hallways, free drink in the room decanters etcTwo pieces of advice for people visiting though.... 1) Try not to miss breakfast - we managed it once and they were so scrummy. We were so sad that we had missed it the other days2) I wouldn't bother with the breakfast in bed - it wasn't great! We had no spoons on our tray, we didn't get what we ordered and it was not included in the price (if you go down to the breakfast hall, breakfast is included)We can't wait to visit this hotel again.... it was fantastic, brilliantly located (only a short distance from everything, but far enough away to be quiet and relaxing) and very, very comfortable

<Content>Loved Banks Mansion Our experience at the hotel was outstanding. All of the employees were helpful and kind. This was a wonderful vacation!My husband and I spend 7 nights at the Banks Mansion and loved the location. There are excellent restaurants nearby and we were able to walk to anything we wanted to see or do.We think this hotel was worth every penny we paid. Our room was very comfortable, fashionable, and clean. The other hotels in the area of similar class didn't offer all of the ammenities the Banks offers. The breakfast was wonderful, the snacks and drinks were thoroughly appreciated. The living area was hospitable and the free internet was fantastic.If we return to Amsterdam, we will return to the Banks Mansion!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel and Great Staff. Ideas For Your Holiday Well, thank you Trip Advisor Holiday People. I chose the Banks Mansion on the remarks on this site. My wife and I have just come back from 5 nights at the hotel and cannot praise the hotel enough.But first let me explain one thing, we work hard to be able to stay in top quality hotels, with great locations, great rooms etc, and have been lucky to stay in many beautiful hotels around the world.So what was so unique about a hotel that is graded as a three star, but here on trip advisor as a five star, and it deserves it.For the first time I went by reviews here, and made notes of everthying my wife and I did to help you all, and make your stay as good as ours.This hotel does not go for massive luxury, but has massive amounts of friendliness, comfort, service, drinks, coffee's etc.Unique is the word for the all exclusive service, pillows yes lovely, bed yes very comfortable, televisions great, shower well did not want to leave the shower!Our stay was even made better by all the reception staff, especially Frederique and Sonja (hope I have spelt them right) who went out of their way to help my wife find some craft shops.The lounge area was also very nice for the internet, coffee, Baileys, Brandy, Beers, waters, fruit juice, snacks. With also drinks in your fridge in your rooms, and Gin, Whiskey and more.All this and we hardly drink, but I have to admit to enjoying a baileys and coffee at the end of the evening.The area also is perfect, 10 minutes away from shops, rembrandt square (loads of cafes), 20 minutes walk at the most from Grand Central Station, 10 minutes from DamSquare.Highly recommended to you from someone who studies what to do on holidays.1 Anne Frank House2 The Red Light Tour3 Sauna Deco (more in next paragraph)(has it's own web site)4 Privare hire of driver and his car (with drinks and snacks)(Dennis Van Leerdam phone 0655785832)5 Canal Bus (14 stops, get on and off canal bus)6 Candlelight Canal Tour (lindbergh)I really hope this help you, and is not too much reading.Sauna Deco, Wow !!Twenty Minute walk from the hotel, on the same canal, where you can have sports massage, and any massage. But if your not modest it is a unisex sauna, steam , relax , showers, plunge pool , with no clothes, another eye opener and very relaxing.The private car with Dennis Van Leerdam was great to travel to the windmills, Boerk, and the Waterland area.I hope you enjoy your stay , please feel free to mention my wife and my name (Mr Sean Peters and Mrs Tracey Peters), let me know.May post photos later, don't forget to ask for a canal view.I really enjoyed Amsterdam, the old bikes, the great people, and the great coffee shops, beautiful properties.

<Content>Absolutely loved this hotel! In no uncertain terms, Banks Mansion was an absolutely stellar experience! We were a family of 3 (mom, 18 yr. old  20 yr. old) in two rooms (one deluxe dbl w/ partial canal view) and (one deluxe single with canal view) for 6 nights. Rooms were spacious enough (given European standards), bathrooms w/ rain showers  hand showers(no bathtubs), hairdryers  toiletries provided, great air-conditioning and unlimited free mini bar (including alcoholic drinks). The breakfasts are generous, smoked salmon, cheese, meats, cereals, breads  pastries, fruit, yogurt, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage with the addition of being able to order eggs  omelets, pancakes and french toast. The Living Area has free bar for alcoholic  non-alcoholic drinks and 2 computers for free internet access 24/7. Papers and magazines are provided and it's very comfortable to just be able to sit and relax before or after heading out for sightseeing. In addtion, they provide snacks (ranging from bread, olive spreads  nuts to sushi to pastries) every afternoon.It is perfectly located, easy to walk to just about everywhere! But most importantly was how friendly, warm and helpful the staff was at Banks Mansion! Every restaurant they recommended was great, directions provided to everything. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, whether traveling as a family (kids 10  up) or as a couple, it was a most welcome respite to many European hotels.

<Content>Excellent What a fab place. It is as described. Its in a good location to be away from too much hustle and bustle but near enough to walk to anything. Lovely air conditioned room. Free drinks, snacks and internet. Great breakfasts. The staff can't do enough for you. Not cheap but well worth splashing out on for the perfect stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Amazing Location, Nice Hotel This hotel is very nice, especially in regards to its location. Being located on the southern part of Herengracht, it is close to everything. So, this is defenitely a strong point for this hotel. As far as cleanliness and styling, this hotel gets good marks. The rooms have a modern business feel that isn't formulated like many large hotels. The lobby has a nice bar with complimentary cokes, water, juices, snacks, etc. Breakfast was especially enjoyable with a full menu and a chef to make omellets, pancakes, and the like. The customer service is very good for a 3* hotel although, one of the night clerks was somewhat overbearing when it came to getting a water from the mini bar. Definetly has more of a 5* feel than 3*. We got a nightly rate of 199 euros which I thought was very reasonable considering the location and amenities. A lot of people have knocked this hotel on the price but I don't think their complaints have much merit. All things considered such as location, service, and amenities, I highly recommend this hotel to small families, couples, and business traverlers alike.

<Content>perfect This is my first review on-line and if you keep on reading you'll find out why. After booking the hotel through a travel website, we contacted the hotel directly and asked if we could be upgraded because we were celebrating our anniversary. When we arrived we were greeted as if we were old friends. We were told that we had the option of picking from 3 different rooms. When we entered the first room, on the bed was a porcelain figurine of a dutch boy and girl puckering up to kiss and a note stating  Welcome to the Banks Mansion. We are so pleased that you chose us to celebrate your anniversary. The room was beautiful, facing the front of the hotel on the corner with views of the canal in either direction. The room was large even by american standards. The room had double beds pushed together, a large armchair wth footstool, a desk with a mirror, a tall closet and plenty of space to walk around. The bathroom had a shower stall with a refreshing rain showerhead, a bathtub which could also be used for showering and the sink was higher than ordinary making for easier use. The room had AC which we could control which we found to be unusual in european hotels and which we were very grateful for because we hit a hot spell in Europe. Needless to say, we never viewed the other two rooms.  The  living and the mini in roombar along with the three decanters of gin, whiskey and cognac were as advertised and included in the room price, plentiful and useable 24 hours. I shouldn't forget to mention free internet use. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. There was an egg, etc. station where you could order what you wanted. The cook remembered and asked us if we wanted the same order as we ordered the day before. The only drawback is that the kitchen has no AC which on some days, because of the hot spell, made it uncomfortable.  If that were not enough, the staff was extra-ordinary. They were always pleasant, smiling and very helpful. Nothing that is asked is too much for them. Don't miss this place. It is an unique experience.

<Content>It's Ok We were disappointed in this hotel for the price of the rooms. If the rooms were half the price this would be a great deal or if you are a real drinker it might be great. You can have all the liquior you wish free. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff helpful. The breakfast is ok but is served in a room that is called the kitchen and is too hot to sit and relax for breakfast. The safe in our room was broken as was the ice machine in the hall.

<Content>Excellent Hotel! My husband and I together with two friends stayed at this cozy Hotel for 4 nights/5 days and we loved it! we stayed in a deluxe room overlooking the canals; our room was spacious with modern fixtures, clean marble bathroom, tub for two and separate shower. The hotels concierge and front desk personnel were extremely helpful, courteous which spoke well about Dutch hospitality! they had great restaurant recommendations and knew what we wanted to a T. Another great addition they had was the free mini-bar, coffee/cocktails and afternoon snacks in the lobby! This hotel comes highly recommended!!!

<Content>Excellent small hotel My wife and i recently spent 9 nights at Banks Mansion. It was a great choice for a long stay, because everyone at the hotel goes out of their way to make you feel like you're in a home away from home.Upon our early morning arrival, the room we'd reserved was still occupied. The desk clerk asked if we'd like to try a different room. We agreed, but soon after that decided we'd like something else (all of the rooms are different). Even so, they let us sleep in the room we weren't keeping for 3 hours before moving us to our actual room. I've never encountered hospitality like that.Our room (210) was spacious, quiet and pleasant, if a bit dark. The bed was comfortable and the A/C kept the desired temperature. The bathroom was lovely. There is a complimentary minibar that they will stock with almost anything you ask for, and in the lobby there's complimentary beverages and snacks 24 hours a day. The breakfast room was very hot, but the food was good. The location is on a canal near Rembrandtplein, and it was no more than a 10 minute walk to all of the major tourist sites, and the tram runs right by the hotel.Everything about our stay was excellent, but what made it special was the caring, attentive staff that bent over backwards to help us at every turn.

<Content>Perfect location and perfectly charming We stayed at the Banks Mansion July 6-9th. It was wonderful! Our room was a very nice size with a HUGE bathroom with both a rain shower and a large tub. We loved the free drinks and internet access. We didn't eat any of the snacks since we spent a good part of our days in Amsterdam eating. The breakfast was very pleasant and the staff were sweet and helpful. We ate a FABULOUS Indonesian meal at a restaurant suggested by the staff, Indrapura on Rembrandplein. Things not to miss in AMsteram:Van Gogh Museum. Rijksmuseum, Anne Frank House, The Jewish Museum, Maoz Falafel, Indonesian Food, Austailian Ice Cream, Amnesia and Mellow Yellow Coffee Houses, Casis soda, walking along the canals, pancakes, etc. I really loved the city (even more than I did when I was there 20 years ago as a 21 year old). The people are so nice and you can walk the city from top to bottom in a day and the Banks Mansion is located right in the middle without being too congested.

<Content>Hurrah for Tripadvisor Just stayed for 3 nights at the Banks Mansion after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. Once again the feedback has come up trumps - what a great little hotel. Loved the friendly surroundings, staff, free lounge bar, free mini bar, decor, rooms (rain shower and steam). What more can you say that hasn't already been said, only that if you want a great stay in Amsterdam book now!

<Content>Seams were showing a tad... My husband and I stayed here July 5 - July 12. It's a nice property to be sure and well located. And the concept of the upscale freebies in the lobby and in-room mini bar are great in theory. These services appeared however to break down over the weekend and things were not all replaced in the room or lobby bar. Items were left unrefilled for extended periods of time. The decanters of vodka, whiskey, gin etc for instance were left emptyfor a full day. The Bar aspect of this area is really pretty marginal. The lobby area was also littered with bottles, cups, wrappers for extended periods. Staff is pleasant, very young and perhaps a little lacking in supervision. Room nice but tiny. Dusting is not a priority with the maids nor is cleaning mirrors. There also was a mysterious loud booming noise (doors slamming?) we had to hear through the day and night. Not enough to keep you awake but there.The AC was an absolute must during this period -- and the room was nice and chilled. The common areas on the other hand were very very warm at all times.I think we would try another hotel if we go back. Those complimentary items and great but only if they are really delivered on; otherwise, just stay elsewhere and pay for them.

<Content>Just a Hotel Arrived at Banks Mansion they had no record of our booking, which i booked 4 wks prior, the gentleman on reception was very helpful and located us on the fourth floor overlooking the canal. The room was very small and cramped, but who cares its Amsterdam. The location of the hotel is great and in easy walk of most attractions. When we returned to the hotel in the early hours the front doors were broken and we were left waiting outside until we were allowed enter througt the goods delivery door in the basement. Breakfast was the best of our trip. Overall this hotel would only get a 3 star in the UK or Ireland and is overpriced Euro 230. 00 for 1 night.

<Content>Fantastic ! Stayed here with my wife for 3 nights at the beginning of July. The hotel is ideally situated and in walking distance to all the main areas. The reviews that I read before we travelled are spot on; this is a great hotel and I would highly recommend it.We used the Connexions shuttle service located at A7 at the airport. Took around 20mins to get to the hotel at a cost of 12 euros each which I didn't think was bad when you consider it drops you right outside the hotel. Will use the tram and train to return just for a different experience. Apparantly the train to the airport runs every 15 minutes and the tram can be picked up about 50m from the hotel.The staff are extremely helpful with plenty of knowledge about the area and things to do and see. The room which features the complimantary minibar was great, a good size and extremely clean and well presented. It was very hot when we stayed and the air-con was a welcome relief from the heat of the streets.The addition of the complimantry bar in the lounge together with snacks and sweets was also a real plus together with the free internet access on which i'm writing the review right now!We were recommended the Dynasty chinese restaurant by the staff who based their advice not only on having visited their themselves but also with the aid of the trusty restaurant guide book they have behind the counter with ratings based on customer experiences. We paid 90 euros for the 2 of us; not cheap but the food and service was exceptional. If the weather is good ask for a table in the rear courtyard garden which is very pretty and away from the hustle and bustle with a great atmosphere.We did what I imagine are the usual museum visits including the Anne Frank house which is about a 25min walk from the hotel. Don't be fooled by what appears to be a queue that stretches round the corner. It moves pretty quick and once inside there is plenty of space to walk around freely. Pretty poignant stuff. Keep your wits about you in the Red Light District and ignore the the drug dealers and you'll be fine.Overall, we had a great time and would highly recommended the Banks Mansion !

<Content>the best well, the wife and i have just got back from banks mansion, we spent 4 nights there, from the 3rd july, till 7th july, this was our 5th trip over to the dam, and this hotel is, without doubt, the best hotel we`ve had the pleasure to stay at in amsterdam,the room was stunning, the staff are the the friendliest hotel staff we`ve ever enncoutered, one of the girls on reception, even phoned and booked a lovely meal at INDRAPURA, {a excellent indonesian restaurant},one of the things we really liked,was how, when youve just got back from sight-seeing/shopping, you could pop into the free lobby bar, have yourself a couple of drinks to wind down, and the bar wasnt abused by anyone, then there was the constant supply of snacks,to sum up, a AWESOME HOTEL, and we will use this hotel for future trips to amsterdam

<Content>Really courteous staff! We visited Amsterdam at the end of June and loved the Banks Mansion. We enjoyed the canal-side location and were easily able to walk to the museums, center of town etc. Rooms were nicely decorated in Art Deco style, and they were comfortable, if not huge. Complimentary mini bar was definitely a plus. Above all, we were extremely pleased with the staff. They helped with special requests, accepted a special delivery for us, and were generally very attentive to our needs, and this made all the difference for us. We would definitely recommend staying there.

<Content>Excellent Value This hotel is super value for money. Without exception the staff are polite, friendly, and very helpful, giving the impression that no request is too much trouble. The rooms are comfortable and have good amenities, the location is busy but very central, and the free bar/snacks/internet are very swell perks. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and recommend it without reservation (no pun intended). A personal note to the Australian woman there on business who shared our cab to the airport and didn't even offer to share the cost, shame on you. You know who you are.

<Content>Superb hotel Stayed at Banks Mansion for 4 nights June 9th to 13th, every thing about this hotel was perfect, the location is excellent, the staff are super friendly and helpful, the rooms though on the small side are very well laid out and tastefully decorated, the free mini bar and lounge bar are a really nice touch and never abused, the inclusive breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of food served in a very homely atmosphere. We loved Amsredam and will definitely stay at Banks Mansion on our next visit.

<Content>Strongly recommend this hotel! The location of this hotel is great; and the staff are extremely helpful - very professional and friendly. The free facilities were a unique feature for us, though we do usually stay in 4 star hotels - everything you consume is provided at no extra charge, and this includes a wide range of drinks (hot and cold) and also snacks/nibbles/pastries etc. The room was comfortable with a lovely view of the canal. A bath would have been nice, in addition to the lovely shower, but we didn't actually request this (would do so if staying again). Only thing that disappointed was the Amsterdam weather - but the hotel can't do anything about that! Great museums, and we also recommend the cheese/wine canal cruise if you are visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Friendly Staff Great Location Free Wine We stayed at Banks Mansion for 4 nights  had a 1st floor room overlooking the Canal. Although it was close to the main road, the windows blocked out all noise. The room was fairly standard, bathroom has shower only, but was a massive walk-in monsoon shower. Bed was ultra comfy, slept really well.Drinks  snacks included was a bonus, but did tend too encourage hanging round hotel rather than sampling bars of Amsterdam.Breakfast was ok, nothing too thrilling - could do with fresh brewed coffee rather than coffee machine. Plenty of choice though.Location was excellent, easy access to canals  main shopping district, also on main tram rout for easy access to cental station etc.It was my birthday while we were there  the hotel left a nicely wrapped gift for me in the room which was a lovely touch.Overall a good choice for Amsterdam.

<Content>Wonderful Stayed there 3 nights with my wife.Great location between the busy city and more relaxed quarters with antique shops, galleries and good restaurants. We didn't need any transportation during our stay due to the location (visited e.g. Rijksmuseum, Anne Frank Huis and Oude Kerk).Very friendly staff.The room was small on US standards, but big enough for a few nights stay.For dinner experience visit Pasta e Basta with singing waiters / waitresses. We learned to visit the museums early in the morning, i.e. before 10 am. The queues were really long in the afternoon.Banks Mansion is one of the best hotels I've stayed at (I'm staying 40 - 60 nights a year in hotels mainly in Scandinavia, US and Asia). If you fancy large 5 star hotels, this is not your place. If you would like to stay in a smaller place with cozy home feeling, this definitely is your place.

<Content>A wonderful hotel with exceptional staff We've just returned form three nights in this hotel and I just had to write to agree with the vast majority of reviews it already has on this site.This isn't the cheapest hotel in Amsterdam but the decor, staff and extras make it exceptional value for money.It was great to come back to the hotel late afternoon and relax in the Living area with a tea and some nibbles. And even better was to return in the evening and enjoy a Grand Marnier before retiring upstairs.The staff are incredibly helpful, all speak English and go that exrtra mile to help you enjoy your stay. For example, we asked about booking tickets for the Van Gogh exhibition and the girl did it all for me.We only had a few minor quibbles, for example the thermostat on our shower needed a service and the hairs between our matresses could have been removed before we checked in but overall I'd recommend this hotel without question.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Great Location Stayed at the Banks Mansion in May with hubby for our wedding anniversary. Great location only four stops on the tram from Central Station and in the middle of all main attractions. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The living area is very pleasant and nice to be able to sit and have a drink after all the walking you do during the day (take comfy shoes!!!), the Baileys also went down well in the evening for your nightcap. Found the Argentina Steakhouse only 5 minutes away food was brillant and so much of it so would definitely recommend a visit.Very enjoyable stay and would definitely go back again.

<Content>You can't please all the people all the time! It's clear staff at Banks Mansion enjoy their job. The service during my stay was excellent. Eventhough I continually asked them questions, they allways took time for me. Too bad not everyone can be satisfied. I was present in the lobby when there were some problems with the airconditioning and overheard some people complaining. Staff tried their best too make the sour lemon sweet by offering fans but some people couldn't be satisfied. I was there for a week and saw they resolved the problem within the same weekend. So NOT 'The worst hotel' but one of the better onces I've ever visited.My compliments to all the staff, I will certainly be back soon.

<Content>Perfect Hotel I just want to add to the praise for the Banks Mansion Hotel. The perfect place to stay in Amsterdam for either business or pleasure. My husband and I had 3 wonderful nights in May 2006 at this hotel. Our room was a little small and not in the best location, but I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. One reviewer complained about the noise level from the street, but I did not hear a thing and our room was on the street level. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the bathroom was up-to-date with a very pleasant rain shower. The breakfast was very nice with many choices and the snacks in the lobby where a real treat after a day of touring. I would definitely stay here again if I have the pleasure of returning to Amsterdam. Also the location is perfect.

<Content>What a gem! Have just returned from a 2 night stay which was a birthday treat for my mum. And we had a fantastic time. We go away every year together for a short break and the Banks Mansion is definitely the best hotel we have stayed at! It wasn't cheap, however it was well worth the money for all the 'extras'. Free drinks both in room and 'living' area, free internet, great breakfast, dvds etc.. I have just read the review of the american couple who complained and said it was the worse service they've ever experienced. Well, I find this seriously hard to believe. Were they really staying in the same hotel???? We found the staff extremely attentive and helpful and obliging to every request. And everything with a smile! And everything really has been well thought out in the rooms... right down to the 'pillow menu' to ensure that you get a good nights sleep! The location is also great and having now stayed at the Banks Mansion I can't imagine wanting to stay at another hotel in Amsterdam when I go back next! Incidentally, we also went to a lovely restaurant called Zuid Zeeland - just about 100m along the herengacht canal. It wasn't cheap, but service and food were both excellent. We also tried Gaucho on Dam Trak and although neither of us are big meat eaters and were initially a bit put off about eating in an Argentinian restaurant, they don't just serve steak! And the food was very good and reasonable value, especially considering the location.

<Content>Very Nice We had a very nice three day stay in this Hotel, We dicided to walk from the Station and it took us around 25 mins dragging a suitcase, so you might want to take a Taxi or jump on a Tram. Upon Checking in (and the rest of our stay) we found the Staff very polite and friendly. We where shown around the lobby and Breakfast room, and told about the free drinks and snacks bar. The room on the 2nd floor over looked the Canal was a little small but thats normal for European Hotels in General, it was clean and the bed very comfortable you even get several choices of pillow, we had no bath just a Shower, but that had a very nice Rainshower head which was very refreshing after a long days siteseeing, The Mini bar which is free was quite depleted by day two and to our surprize wasnt restocked by the evening, but a quick call to the Front Desk and 5 mins later room service arrived to fill it.We found the Hotel to be the perfect location and walked to all the main attractions, I was very surprized to read the ONE bad review on this Hotel all I can say is we didnt find anything to complain about and would recommend it to anyone and look forward to returning.

<Content>The Worst Service in the Hotel Industry My husband and I had booked a room for four nights on our first trip to Amsterdam. We booked a room months in advance at the rate of 235 Euros per night. Upon arrival, there is no one to assist with your bags (with multiple employees at the front desk watching us struggle with our luggage) and only stairs to gain access to the lobby. Upon check-in we were assigned a room one level about the street facing the street. We asked if there was a room on a higher floor, we were given the option of a smoking room in the back of the hotel. We chose the non-smoking room. Needless to say, the street facing room was extremely noisy and I did not sleep the entire first night . You feel as if you are sleeping on the sidewalk. When I politely asked to switch rooms the following morning while offering to pay for an upgrade to a canal facing room towards the back of the hotel, I was offered a room on the corner of the street and canal one floor higher, that was a smoking room. The front desk employees were rude and appeared bothered by my request and explained that had very few rooms to offer. However, during this short period of time, several couples walked into the hotel and inquired about rooms and were told they had several rooms available. I happily moved my items to a smoking room with non-functioning air conditioning. I once again contacted the front desk and they assured me it could be fixed. After calling twice, an employee came to fix the air conditioning and to our dismay, five hours later still had no air conditioning. The rude and incompetent woman at the front desk assured me there was nothing they could do and it would be cooler in Amsterdam in two more days. They had no other rooms for us and what was the big deal. At this point, we packed our bags and moved hotels. When our friends arrived a half hour later, they were offered the suite during their stay but had booked a room at the same rate we had paid the night before.The staff is rude, inexperienced and on several occasions, I witnessed them barking at other hotel guests. They have no interest in answering questions, assisting with sightseeing inquiries and do not help with luggage or obtaining taxis. Overall, this was the worst service I have ever experienced. I would highly recommend the Hotel Pulitzer.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect Stayed there at the end of April and we absolutly loved this hotel. All the reviews below document the details and are spot on. I would add that EVERYTHING in this hotel is very well thought out. All the details are planned and considered for your pleasure. We also stayed at the NH Krasnopolsky which is a fine hotel closer to the red light district. We did enjoy our stay there, but I would return to Banks Mansion due to: Lobby Open Bar, free in-room bar with soda, beer, etc..., DVD player with free movies, absolutly perfect rooms and service and the abundant breakfast. Oh, I did forget the free internet in the looby! I could not recomment this hotel more - if you can - stay there. We paid a little over $200 per night and it was worth every penny if not more.

<Content>Highly Recommended We stayed here for 5 nights from April 28 - May 2. It was such a treat! There are two internet computers free to use in the lobby near the free bar. Along with drinks (wine, alcohol, sodas, water, coffee...) they also had candies and other snacks throughout the day.The staff was very friendly and courteous. We were never up early enough for the free breakfast that goes until 11 am but I am sure it is good.The room was large enough to feel like a comfortable place to be for 5 days with a desk tv, dvd, sitting chair, couch and wardrobe. The bathroom was very nice with a relaxing rain shower.The location is PERFECT for walking anywhere you want to go. And as the previous reviewer said, the bar and the lobby make it a treat to come home from a night out; you can relax and have a nightcap before returning to bed without spending any more money. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. I did a lot of research before choosing the banks mansion and I'm glad I found this place. You wont be disappointed.

<Content>Brilliant hotel Just to confirm everything the previous reviews have stated. The hotel is well situated for walking round Amsterdam and also has a tram stop virtually outside the door for easy access to anywhere in the city. Staff, although mainly young, are very pleasant and helpful. The rooms are a delight with comfortable beds, flat screen T.V., free mini-bar, decanters of spirits, etc. Our particular room had a wonderfully refreshing rainshower. The concept of free drinks and snacks in The Living made returning after sightseeing a pleasure. The hotel was not cheap but in our view was great value for money. We would stay here again without any hesitation whatsoever and will be recommending it to all our friends.

<Content>First Class Hotel and Quality location My wife and I stayed at this hotel last week.It was absolutely top quality.The staff were extremely helpful and courteous.The bedroom was very comfortable and the free mini bar and decanters of spirits were a novelty.The lounge area with complimentary refreshments and snacks was just fantastic.Having stayed at other hotels in Amsterdam previously, we will definitely return to Banks Mansion, it is so good that I can't think why anyone would wish to stay elsewhere.In addition, I don't think that the location could be bettered. First class all round!

<Content>Brilliant hotel and location I have just spent the Easter weekend at this hotel and totally agree with the reviews on this site. The room was lovely we had one with walk-in rain shower and although our room didn't have a canal view, it didn't matter as how long do you actually spend in a room? The lounge area is good with the hospitality area excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely visit again in the future.

<Content>Just Fantastic This hotel is just great. I go to Amsterdam every year at the same time and have been staying in another hotel, but on our last visit is was just not up to standard. I decided to try this one after reading the reviews and this is where I am going back too. The staff are very friendly and very helpful, the room was very clean and very comfortable. The free mini bar in the room and the free bar downstairs were great. The breakfast was great, fresh fruit, cereals, bacon and eggs was all available. If you stay here I would recommend two restaurants near by, Weinders which is on Prisengracht and Pygma-Lion which is on Nieusw Spiegelstraat. I just want to go back!

<Content>Can't go wrong with this one! If you are thinking of which hotel to choose - this is a dead cert. Lovely place, terrific room (with great bathroom), and best of all, loads of complimentary drinks and snacks any time of the day. This is great after a hard days exploring, or when you come in at night and want to help yourself to a coffee or wine,etc. Really lovely place with very helpful staff -couldnt fault it. Location is great, close to everywhere without being in the middle of too much noise.  Try the Chinese restaurant directly opposite - also the indonesian across the street pretty good.

<Content>A hotel of the future Stayed at the Banks Mansion 17 % 18 March. Scaffolding up outside as they paint the building but didn't spoil our stay - spring visitors will benefit. Everything was excellent. Staff young, trendy, friendly and couldn't be more helpful, atmosphere - cosy  relaxed. Drinks and nibbles are an excellent idea. Room modern-TV, video, CD player - fantastic rainwater shower. Comfy bed. Breakfast good. Drinks bar and whisky, gin  brandy decanters. Just couldn't ask for more.Prices not particularly cheap (420 Euros 2 nights double)  I would be tempted to phone to get their quote to compare with online rates, BUT you will reap the benefits of a great, fairly small (50 rooms) hotel with personal service. good location too - short walk to most things.Recommend the red light walking tour - you learn so much more, Anne Frank museum, the trams and the Bangkok thai restaurant - just round the corner.

<Content>gorgeous hotel.....so cosy! My boyfriend and I stayed here in December last year as a last minute break. We booked directly through the hotels website as this was the best price....contrary to what we had read on various travel company sites! We arrived at the hotel at around 10.30pm but had let the hotel know that our flight didn't arrive till late...they were very friendly and helpful and didn't seem hassled by our late arrival. We ended up getting the train to the centre of amsterdam as the shuttle bus was very expensive and told us it did not pass our hotel....even though the sign said it did! The hotel room was really clean and well decorated though was not the hugest room it was fine for the two of us. The beds are comfortable and you have a choice of pillows. The tv is plasma screen- wall mounted and the movies/ all channels are free.  The mini bar in the room is well stocked with lager,coke,diet coke,fruit juices,water and you have large decanters of brandy,whisky and gin too. We drank much of this on the first night (oops!) but returned to our room the next day-after shopping!- to find that these had all been restocked. The bar area in the hotel recpetion was lovely...cosy fireplace and christmas tree! There are also lots of free drinks availible here...as well as snacks such as nuts/olives/cheeses etc.  Overall we had a great time and found the hotel very welcoming and a lovely place to hang around in both during the day and at night. It is a little expensive though worth it for a treat! The only thing we thought it could improve on was food...maybe restaurant or room service could be offered?

<Content>Worth going over budget for this central hotel Banks Mansion is in a great location and really does have a 24hr free bar in the lounge and free drinks in the rooms. The lounge is a great spot to hang out after a hard day's sightseeing and again after an evening out.We were upgraded from a ground floor room to a deluxe room (smaller but with a canal view). Nice decor, comfy bed and brilliant walk-in shower.The staff are very friendly and make you feel at home, and the breakfasts are great - we didn't need any lunch!There's a hotel shuttle to and from the airport (12 Euros each way) but we got the train and the tram which was fine.

<Content>Art Deco Heaven We have just returned from a weekend at Banks Mansion,very impressive !! Staff could not do enough for us and we extremely warm and friendly, no problem providing any information required.Rooms were very good, complimentary decanters of gin, brandy and whisky and the fridge was also stocked with beers and mixers. Although there was a free bar downstairs in the lounge with cakes and snacks and a coffee machine. (My 1 bugbear was that there were no facilities to make tea and coffee in the rooms)The bathrooms are wonderful, a bath big enough to swim in and a'rain shower' to wake you up in the morning.The food was plentiful, we ordered room service on the sat morning for 2 of us and there was enough food to feed at least 4 people.Location wise it was ideal, less than 10 mins away from Dam Square so all attractions easy to find.All in all, a wonderful hotel with excellent facilities and great staff.

<Content>Great base in Amsterdam Just returned from a 2 night stay here. I had stayed there previously when it was called the Canal Crown, and things have improved a lot since then. Great location close to some main attractions. Free bar  minibar is a good idea and works well. For the price, I found the room could have done with a little fixing up as some fixtures were showing wear  tear, but overall a nice room. Large rainshower in particular a great feature. Staff very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Fantastic Location:great location, we could see a canal from our window and we never used public transport once apart from to get there from the train station. Its in walking distance of everything else.Hotel:Stunning. The reception is set in a lounge type area with free hot and cold drinks and an array of snacks all completely free-fanastic!Staff: upon arriving our room had not been cleaned-the staff immediatly moved us to another and put a huge vase of lilies in our room to apologise. They are always friendly and helpful-including sending someone to help when I couldnt open my suitcase! One night we asked directions to a resturant which we gave in detail and they even asked how our meal was when we got back that night.Food: breakfast is set in a sweet little dining room, mainly cold stuff but they will cook you gorgeous pancakes and ommelettes.Room: The most gorgeous hotel room I've ever stayed in. The decor and furniture are stunning, huge comfy beds, stocked fridge, flatscreen tv, gorgeous bath room with tv speakers.

<Content>a big thankyou I just wanted to say a big thankyou to all at the Banks Mansion, all the staff were excellent which I have not always found in other higher rated hotels.My wife and I have just returned after a perfect and very enjoyable stay at the hotel and all the drinks were FREE! If I could make one comment, having spoken to some other guests during our stay, the details that the hotel website and other booking websites give as to the concept of Banks Mansion is not very clear and does not explain how good the facilities/drinks/snacks etc are, take no note of the odd bad review, they do not do the hotel justice.

<Content>Fantastic hotel to stay, with personal attention to detail Banks Mansion is a fantastic hotel to stay in. The staff are exceptionally helpful and speak great English. The free mini bar in the bedrooms and bar in the reception area with an array of snacks is an excellent feature of the hotel and was not abused by the hotel guests at all during our stay. The breakfast is wonderful, all freshly prepared and cooked as desired.The staff aim to please and are delighted to book and recommend local restaurants and tours to enjoy on your stay. Het Tuynhuys is a restuarant offering a taster menu of all their dishes and this was one of the most memornable dinners we have ever experienced and was booked and recommended by the Banks Mansion staff.Definately a place to come back to. The hotel is central and within walking distance to most attractions. My husband was delighted with his late Valentine present I had booked for him to enjoy and looks forward to returning to the Banks Mansion later in the year.

<Content>Excellent central Boutique Hotel with ' at home' experience Quick version - this is THE hotel to stay at in Amsterdam, book it if you like quality finishes and easy access. The quality and extra features (breakfast, all drinks, snacks) easily make up for the slight increase in cost over other hotels. Longer version - My wife and I spent my 30th Birthday at the Banks Mansion hotel and had a fantastic time. We used Trip Advisor for reviews and advice of where to stay so thanks to all for taking the time to comment. Although we have been to Amsterdam twice before, both stays right next to Dam Square, we wanted a quality hotel with attention to detail whilst being central enough to get around to the sites easily.We booked direct through the hotel鈥檚 website (cheaper than Expedia etc) received confirmation promptly and any requests were confirmed upon providing a credit card number.Looking at the map it appears that Banks Mansion is a little far from the attractions 鈥?but once you get there and take a look at the map you realise you could not be in a better location. You are simply right in the middle of the most popular areas - the Dam Square area to the north where you will find the tourist spots of Red Light District, souvenir shops, Madame Tussauds, coffee shops etc; East to the Artis zoo, the Leidesplein to the South West (restaurants etc) and then South to the Reiks Museum, Van Gogh museum and Heineken Experience. Oh and you are 50 yards from the flower market and the Rembrandtplein.Banks really is in the right spot - central AND quiet - it is in the old finance and lawyers district which means beautiful old historic bank buildings in traditional Dutch fashion, and is right on the canal.It took us 15 minutes to amble down the Damrak and Rokin taking in the sites and to arrive at the corner plot of the Banks Mansion with a decadent entrance warming you to the fact that you have chosen wisely ;o)Check in was easy and an upgrade to a small suite was offered to celebrate my birthday. Note in no way has the upgrade swung my vote on this hotel as it is so much more than that. The suite was on the ground floor and was a great size. More importantly the decor was just right, comfy and plush with clever lighting. Massive 7 foot square bed, 2 arm chairs, widescreen TV and DVD, large desk/dresser, Private Bar, lots of storage space in pretty art deco wardrobe, separate toilet and a big bathroom with deep bath and a separate, powerful rain fall shower. The BIG benefit of this hotel is the 'At Home' experience. So rather than spending a nice day seeing the attractions of Amsterdam and then coming back to your hotel and crashing out in your room and watching TV, waiting to go out not wanting to spend money on the mini-bar and not wanting to go to a bar just yet, here at Banks you can come back, dump your coat and chill out in the large lounge area with free self serve drinks and snacks. Every drink you could ask for is here including branded spirits in decanters, bottle beers, coffee machine and soft drinks. Snacks consisted of sushi, expensive nuts, pesto and bread. Just enough to get your appetite going for a nice meal out and plenty of magazines and papers to recommend the best nights (and days) out. In case you were wondering 鈥?does a free bar mean everyone gets wrecked 鈥?Not whilst we were there, it seems the hotel attracts the right type of guest who has better things to do than abuse a great feature of the hotel.So we ate at the Indonesian across the road (very tasty), Ocho's a Brazilian Grill near Leidesplein (great steaks) and Bangkok, a Thai recommended by the hotel again round the corner (which was very good and very popular with the locals - worth booking).Breakfast in the hotel is very good, full continental selection plus fruit, pancakes and the staple eggs, bacon and sausages (cooked well for a change) 鈥?plenty to get you through and avoid the need for lunch.If you are not a great lover of walking then a cab (hotel ordered us a very nice Mercedes MPV with chauffer) to the train station is less than 10 Euros perhaps a normal cab is even cheaper, and there is a Tram stop 50 metres from the hotel. But as the city is flat and there is so much to look at and take in I would strongly recommend an amble around this interesting city.For a third trip to Amsterdam this hotel served us incredibly well. We wanted something different (stayed in the Swissotel before which although pleasant is not even in the same league as Banks Mansion), something with a bit more attention and thought whilst still being affordable and within easy reach of the sites.We found it all in the Banks Mansion and would not hesitate recommending it for couples, business trips or small groups of friends. There is no point staying anywhere else in Amsterdam, perhaps it will be harder to get availability next time!

<Content>Excellent My partner and I have just returned from a 3 night break at Banks Mansion and totally recommend it. We booked it direct and spoke to henry who was so helpful and friendly as were all the staff. We paid 184 euros per night. The hotel is ideally situated and immaculate. The living room is a lovely setting and the free drinks and snacks a great idea. Rooms are great, big beds and nice bathroom. Breakfast was so so. We didnt go down till 10 so hot food was a little cold. Would definately encourage people to visit.

<Content>A very lovely little place in Amsterdam It's the staff that makes this place just that little bit special. They go out of their way to make you happy. From checkin to checkout, their attitude and performance were great. The room I had was lovely, with a nice view over the canal. The little touches like the free drinks in your room and four choices of pillow type are very welcome. There are some flaws though... the housekeeper forgot to to leave fresh towels and more worryingly... didn't close the door of the room properly behind them!! Luckily nothing was missing from the room but this really shouldn't happen. I'm willing to forgive this though as the rest of the experience was top notch.

<Content>Overbooked, no room when I arrived I made a reservation with Hotels.com at the Banks Mansion in Amsterdam, and paid in advance with my credit card. When I arrived they told me they were overbooked and didn't have any rooms at all, even though I had prepaid. They put me in a cheaper hotel but I didn't get any refund of the price difference. The Swissotel where I had to stay instead was okay, but I saw they only charged the Banks Mansion 100 Euro, whereas I paid 150 to Hotels.com. I think it is inexcusable to overbook. It was a hassle and I did not get what I paid for.

<Content>Upmarket boys weekend.......... I cannot rate the Banks Mansion highly enough...I was a tad suspicious of the inclusive drinks and particularly as the trip, organised by me, was an upmarket stagweekend/batchelor party for 6 guys, I tried to play this down. However to their delight it was true!! Don't think we over-indulged but great after a night out to chill with some conversation over a beer or glass of wine. Hotel was great, rooms excellent for the money and shower was great! However, what made the difference was that the hotel were so helpful, we arrived early at 9am and although I had warned them asking if they could store our luggage...they went one better and actually had the rooms ready!!! Very impressive. Fantastic weekend!! Also for those who want a dining experience with a difference....visit The Supperclub! (---)

<Content>What a weekend What a hotel. Free bar - with cold bottles of Becks, wine, Baileys + Gin, Whisky, Brandy in the room, again all included in the price.Great breakfast - included in the price. Great staff - Henry was very helpful (sorry about the goat - we had been in the coffee shops. Great rooms - great for sleeping in - what else do you need the room for, superb bathroom. Really don't see how anyone can complain about this hotel. Close to some great restuarants, bars, coffee shops and with a canal bus stop just outside the hotel.Thoroughly recommend - cant wait to return

<Content>Excellent, couldnt want better This hotel offers everything you could wish for. A relaxed, peaceful and stylish environment. Lovely spacious rooms with excellent bathrooms. The showers are the rain shower type (and we were offered a free upgrade) so we got a big bath too!!! There's plasma tele's in the room with all channels(pretty much) complimentary. This is where it gets good, all the snacks and drinks in the lobby and in ur room are FREE and internet access is available. I would definately recommend a stay here. Really helpful staff and great location. Sharon is pretty fit too!!!!

<Content>Superb Botique Hotel Well...after everything else that has been written about Banks Mansion, I think all we can do is agree say you should stay here if in Amsterdam!Banks Mansion lies in an extremely convenient location, just outside of the main shopping area and a minutes walk from the Flower Market. We walked from Central Station to the hotel when we arrived and it only took us 20 minutes (not walking particularly fast either) to get there. The hotel is virtually in a straight line from the station and could not have been easier to find. It was very easy to get back to the hotel from any direction in order to freshen up and grab a quick coffee during the day.From arrival to departure, all members of staff were extremely courteous and wanting to make your stay as pleasant as possible. On our day of departure we had left our luggage at the hotel whilst we enjoyed our last few hours in the city. When we returned to collect them at the end of the day, we were welcomed to enjoy one last drink from the house bar and to relax before departing for the airport.The rooms were of a first class quality and suprisingly big for European standards. As other reviewers have mentioned, everything is included in the price of the room, even the minibar in the room. What gave it that extra touch is that there were decanters in the room containing three different spirits to choose from and mixers in the fridge, rather than spirits in little plastic bottles!! Our room looked out onto the Herengracht canal and had windows that opened right up. Gave a lovely feel to the room.The only thing about our room was the cold tap on the shower...it had a tendancy to turn itself off slowly, making the water extremely hot! We would, without a doubt, stay at this hotel again. In fact, we are hoping to go back later this year and will be sure to contact the hotel for their availablilty and price.If you want an all inclusive hotel room, in a great location, with attentive staff, attractive art deco features and a friendly atmosphere, then definately choose Banks Mansion.

<Content>Just Like Home I am still staying in the Banks Mansion as I write this using the free Internet access and having a drink from the Free Bar too! These are just two of the things that make staying here a great experience.The Banks is an old converted merchants house by the Herengracht. The hotel is all done in an Art Deco style which only adds to the experience.My friends are staying here too and we all agree that we really like this hotel.Some of the rooms have a bath and some like mine have a shower. I am more of a shower person so this suits me but you can always specify which you prefer when you book. I was also allocated a non-smoking room which is great.One great thing about my shower is that it has a steamer built in with a eucalyptus oil option. I was out last night and found the smoke bothered me a bit so I was bunged up in my nose today. I just put on the steam room amd then sat in it for ten minutes and found this to be a great help.The buffet breakfast is very extensive too with both hot and cold items available.The staff are all very courteous and helpful.Overall I would have to say this hotel wins out because of the location, staff and overall standard of service offered. The rooms are all a decent size too which is a plus in Amsterdam as old buildings tend to have small rooms

<Content>An excellent choice and an excellent value!! I agree with the reviewers who liked Banks Mansion. It is an excellent value - we got a relatively low rate directly though the hotel, and were very happy with a canal view room that was quiet if the windows were closed. We found the staff very helpful and nice, the room was narrow but decent in size and very nice in decor and furnishings (art deco look, with a big bathroom), particularly for Europe where narrow and eclectic rooms are typical even in more expensive hotels. The room was charming, if you like contemporary and spare European sensibilities.There were a lot of amenities included with the room (free in-room mini-bar, free alcohol in room and in lobby, inlcuding bottled beer and soft drinks, free snacks, complimentary breakfast which did include custom egg and waffle making, etc.) -- all of which was quite excellent and unique in our experience for any contemporary hotel in the US or Europe -- they are simply not out to strip you of every dime you bring in this place. With the decent nightly rate (180E for the two of us), for a canal view room and all of the amenities, we thought it was an excellent value.The hotel is extremely well located, in the central part of the canal belt near the Amstel River, the Rembrandtpelin and the flower market, yet its not too inner city (where it can get a little sleazy). It was a 5 minute or less walk to the Joordan, the Spui, Dam Square, Leidseplein and the Museum area. It's very close to Tempo Doloe and other excellent Indonesian restuarants, several of our favorite coffee shops (Damkring, Rokerij and Tweede Kamer), 2 or 3 trolley lines within a block of the front door, so it is ultra-convenient. This is a relaxed hotel with a relaxed attitude in an excellent location. We have stayed in hotels in Amsrterdam where we felt ever so slightly unwelcome, but not here. I guess I can understand how some people might find it underwhelming, but we really liked the combination of location, value and amenities. We will definitely stay here again when we come to Amsterdam.

<Content>Fab weekend in Amsterdam at Banks Mansion ! I'm just back from a fab weekend in Amsterdam at a newish 4* hotel called Banks Mansion - it was very much to be recommended (with amazing free bar in the lounge and free booze in the room). We booked through lastminute and the rate was about GBP330 including breakfast, tax and service for 2 nights.Amsterdam was especially pretty decked out in Xmas decorations. Went to the Rijksmuseum (very good although part of collection was in storage due to building renovations), Van Gogh museum (excellent and you can buy your tickets at the hotel desk), Anne Frank house (interesting in a macabre way), and walked through the flower market (pretty) and red light district (strange!).We found several good restaurants, mainly informal places in the neighborhood where we were staying (Grachtengordel south) such as the Piet de Leeuw steakhouse which is a couple of blocks from the hotel, and one on Egelentiersstraat in Jordaan that was great because it had live music - called Claes Claesz. I also recommend the newly published (July 2005) Rough Guide to Amsterdam.I'll definitely be going back to Banks Mansion.Have a great trip!

<Content>Excellent Choice My husband and I stayed here Dec 2nd  3rd 2005. This was a really great choice of hotel - literally 5 mins walk from great shopping in Kalver-straat and Flower Market, 10 mins from Dam Square, with the option of heading down to the Jordann in the evening for bars/food etc., if you don't fancy the centre of town. We had a deluxe double, which although slightly dark at back of hotel, was immaculately appointed, huge bathroom, fab shower, minibar well stocked, and any drink you didn't have in your room was readily available in the free drinks area in the lobby. The self-service lounge/lobby area is a fab idea, and you can even get a cappucino and danish in the morning if you miss breakfast! If you've never been to Amsterdam before make a canal cruise and a trip to La Place Mangerie for food [5 mins from hotel; but closes @8pm], must-do's as part of your stay. There's also a good chinese directly across the road. We have already been raving about this hotel to our friends as the place in Amsterdam to stay and worth the cost.

<Content>fulfills the recommendations Needing a place to stay, in the tad-expensive Amsterdam, the previous reviews of this hotel convinced us to reserve our room. Lucky we did! Very central, very clean, very comfortable, and very inclusive. I can only confirm what has been told before: Bed with pillow choices, free minibar, GRREAT rain-shower, delicious and plenty breakfast, and the very welcoming lobby drinks  snacks. Also, the luxury of an elevator, against the steep staircases of Amsterdam, is the killing blow! Highly recommended.

<Content>Make Banks Mansion a Priority ! My wife  i stayed here for three nights at the beginning of November.We booked our flights through Easyjet and hotel booking through Amsterdam travel service(Bridge travel) who were doing a great deal with the third night free. We had a wonderful warm recption at Banks Mansion and were given a room overlooking the Herengracht canal, beautiful. The all inclusive features of this hotel allow you to really relax and enjoy the hotel ambience. The drinks Buffet and munchies in the lounge are truly a delightful touch. The room itself was very comfortable with a free mini bar and movies included. The bathroom was spacious with wonderful walk in rain shower. The only negative point was that the hotel failed to fix the room air conditioning fault as it was very warm early November. However, the hotel is fabulous with a wonderful buffet breakfast, great hospitality and superb location to enjoy all Amsterdam has to offer. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.Well done Banks Mansion !

<Content>Great Location I am a regular in Amsterdam, and I recently spent a week on business there and stayed at the Banks Mansion. As mentioned elsewhere, the location is superb - convenient for the museums and Leidesplein in particluar. The shower is absolutely spot on, and the free bar/snacks are a great idea. The only minor flaw is that the hotel is on quite a busy street so you can hear traffic. Overall excellent, would recommend to any visitor. PS Take some CDs and take advantage of listening to music in the shower!

<Content>Best choice when in Amsterdam My wife and I have just had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful hotel over the week-end. It's location, only a 1 minute walk to the Singel floating flower market, is ideal for walking to all the main tourist sights in Amsterdam. From the moment we checked in until we left, the staff could not have been more helpful. The breakfast choice was vast and the complimentary bar service was suberb. I have never stayed in a hotel that offers it's guests such an offer - being Scottish, I enjoyed it fully!! ;-) The room was excellent, standard hotel size I'd say, with everything one could wish for. The shower was especially good. That was our 3rd visit to Amsterdam and we will visit again. When we do, we'll be staying at Banks Mansion!!

<Content>Banks Mansion an amazing hotel My partner and I stayed at the Banks Mansion in July - this was our second stay at this amazing hotel. We had stayed there in March 2005 for a few days and liked Amsterdam so much we decided to go back in the summer and we immediately booked our room. We love the rooms - this time we had a deluxe room with view on the canal - the bed was very confortable and the shower with steam function is particularely nice after a full day of walking. I had read previous reviews about the fact that the lobby bar was not re-stocked in the evening but this was not our experience. There was always wine, beer and snacks available in the evening but what we particularely enjoyed was the espresso/capuccino maker we could use anytime. We also loved the complimentary internet access (2 stations in the lobby). The breakfast was excellent and most of all, all the staff we encountered was extremely helpful and would go out of their way to make our stay perfect. We will definitely be back in Amsterdam and certainly will stay at the Banks Mansion.

<Content>What's not to like? Got a good deal via an Internet site for my first trip to Amsterdam, and was very satisfied indeed with the Banks Mansion. Very conveniently located in the attractive Grachtengordel area on one of Amsterdam's finest canals (Herrengracht), and only a short walk from the Vondelpark, Rijksmuseum, old town centre, flower market and Rembrandtsplein. Tram stop very close by for those who wish to go further afield.The hotel is Art Deco and nicely furnished; contemporary design style room was absolutely fine with comfortable bed, good bathroom, flat-screen TV, free minibar; the public area including the lounge also featured free food and drinks; the breakfast room (and breakfast) also perfectly acceptable. Staff were friendly and service was good.Really can't understand why anyone would be unhappy with the place; enjoyed a great stay and would recommend to anyone. It may not be 5 star but it's certainly a very good 4 star. Would definitely stay there again when I next visit Amsterdam.

<Content>Fantastic time at Banks We stumbled across this hotel by chance on the internet and are very glad we did! It is located centrally within easy walking distance of all the main sights/museums and shopping/eating areas, as well as easy to get to from the airport by public transport. The building itself is beautiful from the outside, and the bedrooms, whilst not enormous, were certainly big enough for the two of us. The art deco/macintosh style interiors were very stylish.Breakfast was included and was of an excellent standard - but my favourite part was the complimentary mini bar in the bedrooms and the complimentary hotel bar in the lobby. During the day the fully stocked bar also offered cakes and chocolates, which gave way to nuts, nachos etc in the late afternoon/evening! Very welcoming after a long day sightseeing to fall into a big armchair with a complimetary glass of wine or beer and nibbles!The staff were helpful even calling up to the room to check we were happy following check in.

<Content>A Splendid Hotel I am sorry for the previous reviewer who ended up with an unsatisfactory room, but I have to agree with the majority and say that my perception last weekend was of a friendly and welcoming place. I have a weakness for Art Nouveau and Art Deco and so I very much liked the decor of this splendid hotel-others might find it a bit over the top. The desk and waiting staff were helpful and efficient and everything was spotlessly clean. The bedroom and bathroom were both of a good size (my room had a pleasant outlook onto the Herengracht) and the power-shower was much appreciated. I made little use of the flat screen TV, DVD/CD player or free computer access but it was nice to know that they were there.The free bar (and free mini-bar in each room) is an excellent idea-the extortionate mini-bar prices in most hotels are a regular source of irritation-and I did not see anyone the worse for these facilities, though obviously someone with a weakness in that direction would do better to stay elsewhere. The breakfast was ample and served in an agreeable room with a relaxing atmosphere.The hotel's location is convenient for most parts of the city centre. I think that it offers good value for money in its price range and I look forward to staying there again.

<Content>Perfect Spot! Stayed Aug 10-13. The hotel exceeded my expectations. The room overlooked the canal. The staff very friendly and helpful. The free room bar and drinks in the lounge are not found elsewhere. The location was perfect, within walking distance of all major sights. I have stayed in many 5 stars and while this is not a 5 star it is certainly a 4 star.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon and all I can say is this is a great Hotel The free mini bar and the service of the staff is very good .We only got put on to this hotel by mistake when out travel agent booked the wrong dates for us . We could only stay 2 nights here and they found us another hotel close by and arranged our baggage to be taken over there .A very very very nice and new and flash hotel . The bathroom is exceptional and the Plasma screen that swings round to you can watch it in he Toilet just toped it off for me Location easy walking to everywear or there are tram stops outside the door .Beds so comfy and the Menu of pillows you can choose from depending on how you want to sleep is a great idea .Breakfast they will cook you pretty much whatever you feel like.

<Content>Would not stay here again This is a small hotel with unhelpful staff. Dont let the expensive prices dupe you into thinking you will be staying at a deluxe hotel it is  re assuringly expensive The staff are few and far between. Better value for money can be had at a larger 5 star hotel

<Content>Excellent hotel This was our first time at this hotel. My wife and I found the hotel to be excellent. This was our 6th trip to Amsterdam. We felt that this was the best value for the money. The room was air conditioned. The included breakfast was as good as any you could find in town. And we made several trips to the lobby bar for drinks, coffee and snacks. Overall, all of the added extras for this hotel make it an excellent value.

<Content>Just Wonderful The Banks Mansion was just great. We will definitely stay there the next time we are in Amsterdam. The rooms were very nice, large and clean, the staff was great, the complimentary extras first rate, the location everything we wanted. There is nothing I could say that would detract from either a business or pleasure traveler from staying there.

<Content>Best service ever received !! I have stayed already a few times in Banks Mansion and every time the service was excellent. The concept that you can take your own drink in the lobby and in your room makes you feel very welcoming. Rooms are designed beautifully and the rain shower is fabulous. The people how work in Banks Mansion are young but very passionate about their jobs that is very exceptional now a day鈥檚. I cannot think about anything negative about this property. If you are looking for a classical, boring hotel I will suggest do NOT book Banks Mansion because they are definitely the hottest place in town.

<Content>Excellent hotel My boyfriend and I were quite dubious when booking our stay at the Banks Mansion after reading some very negative reviews on tripadvisor. However, our stay was excellent. We had a lovely room - slightly on the small side but the bathroom was lovely and the decor was nice. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the free bar was well stocked until 2:30am! I would definitely recommend this hotel to those who want a good quality hotel in an excellent location.

<Content>Style over Substance This was undoubtably the most disappointing, but not the worst, hotel I have ever visited. It touts its style and free bar but falls down on the basics. The rooms on the ground floor, we were lucky enough to catch two of them, are literally 2 metres from the pavement and three from the trams. Despite the double glazing there was far too much noise from both outside the hotel and inside from the reception area.The rooms themselves were constantly gloomy and the hotel doesn't seem to be able to afford lighting above 25 watts. One room, 008, is so small the wardrobe door only opens 45 degrees and the bathroom is so small you have to sit on the toilet sideways! The water is constantly boiling and with cold water taps in the shower that slowly turn themselves off, it makes for interesting bath times.The breakfast is merely adequate, not what you expect at 210 euros per person per night. There is a free bar and 2 computer terminals that are free to use but that in no way makes up in the deficencies of this hotel. Most of the small team of staff are pleasant, the leas helpful being the Genaral Manager who showed no interest in offering an alternative room. If you haven't booked, don't, there are far better hotels in this price category, if we hadn't paid in full before arrival we would have walked out, something I have only done once before in neraly 30 years of travelling on business and pleasure.

<Content>Fun hotel for a night. We had a hard time finding a hotel room for a Saturday night stay but found one at Banks Mansion. It was a bit more than we would have liked to have spent, but we figured the location was good and free bar would help make up for it. While it isn't a grand old hotel, we had a great time and would look into going back. The mini bar, movie channels and breakfast made just hanging out in the hotel fun and it was certainly better than some of the more basic hotel options.

<Content>Expected more After reading the reviews on this hotel, I really expected a lot more than we got. We stayed 4nights Friday to Tuesday. Ok so we had free drink in the room and in the living room, which was great. The food was really disappointing though, no hot food on demand like we were told, we had to do with cold boiled eggs and toast for breakfast at the weekend. We asked for fried eggs and were told no. On Tues morning they were available but were served nearly raw so it was back to the cold boiled! We asked to change rooms as the first room allocated was next to reception on ground floor. no way! We were moved up two flights and had to bargain on price as it was condsidered an upgrade! It was a downgrade as it happened, as we went from our booked double to a twin, and were then told no other doubles available, after we booked a month in advance. The hotel itself was well located and quiet inside, but the tram runs right outside and it starts at 5am! very noisy. Staff were friendly enough. Overall I would stay again, but I'd ask for a room at the back for more peace and quiet from the traffic.

<Content>Great weekend - Feb 05 Good hotel, good location.A bit worried about our room on 1st impression (smallish, ground floor, on street) but v comfortable and no problem from street noise.The concept here from the operators is clearly to spend cash on the decor, fittings etc and chuck in things like free room drinks and bar but save on the staffing; usually there was one receptionsist who doubled up making sure the bar was stocked with drinks and nibbles, and a guy who came round clearing up empty glasses etc and that's all the 'front of house' staff there were. Plus no restaurant apart from breakfast. I think on the whole it works, although it is dependent on the quality of what staff there are. One receptionist was very pleasant and helpful, the other less so, although both very knowledgeable, and you should definitely go to the Dutch restaurant they recommend round the corner. Mustard soup - fantastic!I would definitely go again.

<Content>Thanks to the Banks I had the pleasure of spending 2 nights at the Banks Mansion a couple of months ago. The first room I was given was a bit on the dark side but upon requesting I was immediately shown another without any fuss. I booked a double delux room and was definitely impressed. The room was decorated to a high standard and the bed extremely comfortable. The complementary mini bar and movie channels were a nice touch and the breakfast just fine.I am stopping off in Amsterdam for three nights in two weeks time and have booked to stay at the Banks again. My girlfriend will be joining me and I am looking forward to showing her the overall quality of this hotel,she knows all too well how fussy I can sometimes be when wanting value for money but the Banks certainly offers that. I'm paying EUR 185/night for the double delux which I think is a fair price, contact the hotel directly for the best deals.I've read a few reviews where people have been dissatisfied for whatever reasons, I guess that there just isn't no pleasing some folks.Stay at this hotel and you will not be disappointed. Jon, 34.

<Content>Average It all looks very chic , but then it is quite new with some good design ideas . We had 2 rooms . The hairdrier in both was broken . There were big shower rooms but if you put the soap in the grill tray it falls through on the floor every time ! Difficult to get a good nights sleep because the radiators make popping noises every 30 seconds . The walls are thin someone wearing high heels was trotting around on a tiled floor above or at 6.30 am every day which was a nuisance .They are happy to let you struggle with your luggage . 2 main receptionists , 1 very helpfull and friendly the other had a  I cant be bothered  look about her .

<Content>Completely Fantastic! Went to Banks Mansion at the end of January 2005, and it was the perfect choice. The friendly and capable staff knew all the best places to go in the area. The breakfast was wonderful and free! You could order your pancakes or omelette to go with your toast, cereal, sausages, eggs and bacon- the works! The free bar in the room, and the open bar in the lounge meant that you could have a few drinks before going out (or coming back in!), and there was always something to nibble on. Not only were the beds super comfortable, which made it a real effort to wake up in the mornings, but they even had a pillow menu so you could choose your pillow. The shower/steam room with eucalyptus was very soothing and relaxing after a hard day's shopping. The location was excellent - the Dam square is only a 10 minute walk away. I would definitely go back!!

<Content>Average - rooms not that clean We picked this hotel because we'd read good reviews. It's not cheap and we didn't go for the basic room. The first thing we noticed was that the room was not that clean, the bathroom bin was not emptied ( and was full of horrible things) and we only had a tiny bit of toilet roll!!!!We didn't get the slippers that the website says you get and whilst the fridge in the room was restocked they didn't replace the things we drank most of - diet coke!. The toilet roll ration continued for the whole 4 nights - we ended up stealing some from the toilets in the bar. The free bar sounds good but .... we both drink red wine and would go out for an evening meal and a walk and arrived back about 10.30 to find no red wine left! They don't fill up the free bar quickly and if you happen to have people staying in the hotel who drink wine by the goldfish bowl - you've no chance! The walls of the rooms were also very thin, we were kept awake by the people next door who came in late and started on the mini bar. We also had a non smoking room that smelt of stale ciggies for the whole 4 nights, even our clothes smelt of it! The hotel is only ok -we didn't get back the extra price in the so called freebies! The breakfast was ok but by day 4 became boring! I'm not planning to stay here again - better bargains to be had. It's very close to he floating flower market (2 mins) if you are looking on the map - so the location is good (bur it's close to many cheaper hotels). I didn't find the staff that friendly either - although I did hear one of the receptionists sharing his drug experiences with another Brit - not my scene I'm afraid.

<Content>Simply the best Just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam. After reading the reviews from this site about the Banks Mansion we expected it to be good but it far surpassed our expectations. The rooms were of a very high standard with lots of added extras which made it a pleasure to return to after a hard days shopping!!!!. The staff could not have been more helpful, they were always on hand from the moment you book in to the moment you left and nothing was to much trouble. With everything being complimentary from the breakfast to the drinks we can not recommend this hotel highly enough.Stay here and see for yourself.

<Content>This is Amsterdam's best! This is a superb hotel with excellent staff.I have never felt so at home anywhere in my travels as I did at the Banks Mansion. The location, room, and people make this the absolute best hotel in Amsterdam!

<Content>Would Stay There Again! I stayed at the Banks Mansion for 4 nights in November. I booked a deluxe room with Canal View but on my first night was given a nice room but with an alley view. I spoke to the staff at the front desk the next day and they moved me to a nicer room with a great canal view. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good and made it so I was able to skip lunch since I was so full. I made good use of the mini bar in the lobby and met quite a few people there. The night clerk did close the mini bar very late (after 2 am) but I did not find this to be an issue. It was close enough to walk to everything and the neighborhood was very quiet late in the evening. The hotel website did state that internet was free. If you use your own laptop there is only 1/2 hour free during your stay and then the rest of the time you had to pay for access. There were two internet kiosks in the lobby that were always easily accessible and free. I booked this hotel based on the reviews here and I was very happy with my experience.

<Content>Dont believe the hype! This hotel is not what you might expect from reviews and promos. The outside looks grey and worn and in need of a coat of paint. The bars on the outside windows give an institutional feel to the place and when you walk through the small revolving doors you can immediately notice the difference between a 4 and 5 star hotel no one to greet you or help with your baggage getting a large case through those small revolving doors must be an art form. The six hotel staff are pleasant yet inexperienced and unwilling to help with genuine problems. There are only 51 rooms in the hotel, if you are there its likely it will be fully booked so there is little play with your room. You get what youre given like it or lump. We reserved a deluxe room and were given a standard they then tried to pass this off as a deluxe but when checking friends that were staying at the hotel who had ordered the same room this clearly a standard/superior room, Do they think people are stupid? There is also a wide difference in the amount every one paid some people were unlucky enough to pay 250 euro per night some paid 98 euro no doubt for similar rooms. Food was also poor. When checking in they say the bar is open 24 hrs a day, this isnt true the night man closes it at 0200hrs. All in all Very expensive for what u get its not luxury I am a hotelier of 20 years and look back and laugh about this small hotel. We tried to check out within twenty minutes of arrival they charged 197 Euro......Money well spent

<Content>I felt like I was in a fabulously designed palace! I had an amazing time at Banks Mansion. The room was so comfortable with free drinks and a cozy bed. The bathroom was gorgeous and so comfortable after a long 6 hour flight. The internet is free and people don't abuse their time. The living room of the hotel was cozy enough to be left alone or inviting enough to meet travel-goers. The living room bar was always open with free goodies. It was close to everything. Remember to try the pancakes in Amsterdam. We kept getting up late for the free breakfast, but the last day we made it and it was spectacular. Well worth every penny!!
