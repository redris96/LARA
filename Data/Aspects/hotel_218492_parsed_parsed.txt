<Content>Tried to enjoy ourselves - but didnt Booked our trip with Air Transat- Nolitours.Our plan was delayed 4hrs at YVR so we did not arrive untill 3:30am.Staff were somewhat friendly and spoke moderate english, got our mickey flask of rum and were escourted to our room- (by an eager porter looking for a tip) First impression good- we were in room 11109 (swim out room in building 11)... room was spacious, bright, seemed clean..... over the next 6 days we had some not great experiences with room such as: the stinky/musty/tropical/cigar/urine smell, bed was hard, had 1 gecko in room, were told we were not allowed to flush toilet paper, maids forgot to clean rooms one day, air conditioning work but had only one setting - mega cold-, barely any hot water,  We found over all, the restaurants to have really bad serviceAqua- Exclusive (Cameleon etc)- OK, very bad service, tables not cleaned, pre-used silverware sitting at place settings, food most often cold with flies around.WINDOWS- usually something edible, bad service in most sections- but good waiter in the back middle section finally took care of bringing us drinks, water, cutlery etc. Often flies around desserts (because all have sugery glazes on them) and fruits. Food recycled from meal to meal and not really refrigerated.De Mario- Good Food, ok service-- GONG SHOW to get reservations at any alacarte restaurant- what they do is let the rest. fill up at 6pm and then start taking a waiting list after that time- so if you send one member from your famliy up from the pool to book a table they had to wait sometime 30-40 mins to get a time to come back...poorly managed (often tables sat empty for long periods of time after first dinners left)Beach Garden- ok if starving- got shooed out of sitting inside at 3pm because they were trying to get tables ready for the dinner sitting but didn't close untill 4pm- fries were always cold (ON THAT NOTE- SAW HOTEL STAFF WITH A CHIQUTA BANANA BOX CARRYING COOKED FRENCH FRIES FROM BEHIND WINDOWS REST. DOWN THE PATH TO THE BG REST- not covered)DIdn't go to Seafood restaurantAmerican Grill-Tex Mex-- Great food (veal tenderloin was hubbys fav) again same type of mis-management as de mario- one night we waited outside untill 630 cuz they were seting tables, but were told the 'cooker hadn't shown up yet'*note- they say you can only go to the alacarte restarants 1 time, but we actually went to the Italian 2 times and tex mex 3 times nobody asked for our coupon *bars were ok, drinks sometime rancid/strong- all alchohol was fake? (baileys in similar bottle but called sallys, no premium labels- all Brugal?) Beach- lots, walked past the 3 resorts to public not crowded beaches that was nice tooPools- nice, favorite was the new one out back by building 15? great bar there often quite- NO HOT TUB- what looks like a hot tub on the map is actually colder then pool its near by. Pools were kept clean/with out much debris, and i actually saw somebody scrubbing the 'scumline' 2 times while thereGrounds- really nice, pathways a little rough for wearing high heels but pretty flowers, flamingos and turtles to look atBorrowed Kayaks- paddled that was fun-Did Zip Line with Bavaro Runners (AWESOME) cost $220 cdn-Was supposed to go the Marinariam tour but company FORGOT to pick us up- we waited at designated location but no one every showed up and we got to watch the boat drive away from pier with out us (was told we were getting refund- will check credit card again to see if processed)- took free shuttle to nicoles which is a store of a french canadian lady that sells jewlery, vanilla $3, santo domingo coffe $5, hand rolled cigars god prices. Wanted to get to hard rock cafe at the end (to get some stable food) however couldn't peice together enough information from the 6 people we asked about the 'free shuttle' to the 'plaza del mar??? shopping centre' which may or may not pick up a couple times a day We tried to enjoy oursevles but in the end the minor details got to us--- especially the extra 16hr delay for the way back.... at the resort we found if you spoke spanish you got better service, howevereven then you might never get your drinks at dinner, and don't even try to ask for a modifcation to a meal at the a la carte restaurants.  Our resort was set about 30mins away from others like Bahai PRincipe etc- there were 3 of us out there, you can see the marinarium and reef explorer locations from the hotel beach- they are right out front. There is a very agressive market across the street from the hotel- 'my friend, my family come have a look', we would walk past to the mini market to get snacks much cheaper then resort mini-bar and store... (price on resort for pringles $5usd mini can, $3 chocolate bar) In all like a said we went there with an open mind, we tried to like it but in the end were defeated by the continual rude/inattentive service.  I would never go back to the Dominical Republic not just based on this experience- but flying from Vancouver is 6hrs 30mins there and 8hrs 30mins back--- to enjoy nice beaches, tropical destination etc- I could do that in mexico within 4-5hrs....

<Content>Trapped At the last minute, my friend and I decided to go somewhere warm and all inclusive for New Years. I returned last night (January 5, 2009). My flight and hotel were very reasonable and I was looking forward to 6 days in the sun with fresh fish, fruit and the wonderful caribbean spirit... What we got instead was dismal service, food that was inedible and all red wine stored in large fruit juice plastic bottles. While the staff was always all smiles and calm, nothing was ever delivered or handled. The restaurants that were advertised as part of the all inclusive were mysteriously closed on the days you wanted to book them and when they weren't, they had run out of food. I would NOT wish this place on anyone... the lack of customer service, quality assurance and training for the staff will catch up to them...

<Content>Terribly Over Rated We just returned from a 2 week stay Dec 19-Jan 2. We had stayed here in Feb 06 (was Punta Cana Grand then) and thought it was great. I can't believe a resort could go so far downhill in that short a time!Checkin took forever. Very slow, inefficient and unorganized. The little drink they give you while waiting doesn't help when it is midnight and you have been in line for an hour!Had to change rooms 4 times to get satisfactory room. One neither door would lock.The hall door had been kicked in and night lock hanging by screws, patio door wouldn't lock.Toilet wouldn't flush, phone didn't work, etc....Other room had not been cleaned (and by now it is 1 am) The food is terrible. At the buffet the only way to get hot food was the pasta bar or cooking station. Only overhead light bulbs keeping other food warm. Last day there saw ants all over the fruit, and a yellow coloured fly came out of a sweet roll I was eating. Friends saw a cockroach going across the floor. Service in buffet excellent but does not make up for quality of food. DiMarios was so bad we walked out and left food on table.Ceasar salad tasted like it had been cooked in fish.Tex Mex restaurant really good but you can only eat at each a la carte once a week.Christmas and New Years were done very well, but food quality a real issue.Adult pool is not maintained that way. One day there was 6 little kids in the jacuzzi that we asked to leave. their parents were very upset. Two other times we told kids they had to leave. The staff does nothing about it. This is also supposed to be the only area where topless is allowed, but not the case. Around the main pool, and on the beach, once again not supervised by the staff.Booked a trip to Higuey that was supposed to be shopping at a market, visit a cathederal, tobacco place and a Dominican lunch. Our driver spoke no English, took us to the church and said there you go, took us to one shop where he was angry we didn't buy anything (it was too expensive) then took us to a supermarket. (we didn't really need any groceries)Then he took us back to the hotel. That trip was $60US a person.We booked a trip to go on speedboats ($75 US a person) but they never came to get us as the Sunwing rep wrote down the wrong time. He wrote 12:25 am not pm. Logic would think that no one is going out in speedboats at midnight! Rep was MIA for 2 days. We got oyr refund as we were getting on the bus to airport (after many calls)Pool is clean and good temp.Beach is nice except for the seaweed. They clean it up once a day but needs done more often as there is a lot of it.This was one of our worst vacations ever. It also rained for 5 days (that's the chance you take!) which didn't help!We were so dissapointed as we had such a good time when here before.Would never go back. This is rated 4 star and 5 star (depending on the company) but is barely a 3.

<Content>Nothing Grand About the Grand Oasis First, let me say that if you have already booked your trip and are locked in, do not worry. It is possible to have a perfectly nice week at this resort. HOWEVER, if you have not booked yet, I would sincerely advise you to look elsewhere.The resort is truly beautiful...great beach, lovely pool. However, my wife and I agree that this is a case of missed opportunites. Poor management has rendered this resort quite meidocre.You will read other reviews that say that the food is atrocious. Perspective is everything and so are expectations. No great meals were had at any of the restaurants, but we did not go hungry. Some around us felt the food was quite good but MOST felt it left alot to be desired.You will read other reviews that state that the staff is unfriendly. Not true. The waiters, bar staff, and housekeepers were all helpful and engaging. The front office staff was not helpful at all. My wife's beach bag was stolen from the pool area and they refused to activate the safe in our room gratis after such a traumatic event. Finally, one manager, Karen,,,,(apparently the keeper of the administrative brain) realized that to deny us this meager request could be a public relations nightmare and acquiesced.Our room was okay, but a persistant leak from the airconditioner condenser was a nuisance and was not fixed properly when we requested this.Towel shortages have been written about in other reviews. What can I say? This is true. For a resort of this size, they should have an adequate number of beach and bath towels which they do not.The grounds can be noisy at night...a problem if you have small children that might want to sleep. A private party at one of the bars blasting loud music at 3 am was very irritating. I complained to the staff member running it but he was DRUNK and refused to turn down the music. I finally unplugged the stereo speakers myself. (Fortunately, I was not physically attacked by the partygoers). I filled out a complaint form at the front desk which was never followed up upon by management.The animation staff was quite entertaining and our fellow guests, overwhelmingly Canadian, could not have been nicer.Again, if you've already booked, don't despair: keep an eye on your belongings, pack an extra towel, and dont expect 5 star cuisine. If you still have a choice to go elsewhere, exercise that option!

<Content>Great Vacation !! I was there from dec. 18 to dec. 25 with my sister and we had a great time!!we traveled with sunwing and loved the service and the food. At the airport, everything went well and the bus took us to the hotel in less than 20 minutes. The room was ready and we didn't had to wait.The service at the reception, restaurants and bars was most of the time perfect !!!! A lot of smiles and the tips are appreciated but we didn't feel that we had to give any to have good service.I want to say thank you to Nicholas (adult pool) and to denny (window's buffet) for the excellent service !! The food at window is great (and i'm a peaky eater) .... i always manage to find something i liked, we always had a big variety of choices. The white wine is o.k. For the a la carte restaurant, we went to mare, very good and the fact that you can hear the ocean is great ! we also went to da mario (italian) good service but we didn't like the food but i spoke with others and they just loved it. so it depends on your tastes and what you take. we went to amerian grill tex mex and this was our favorite..... great mexican food .... we went twice... perfect nachos and fajitas !! Perfect service and great ambiance !!you don't need any reservation for the a la carte restaurants , only for the japanese one but we didn't go there.The beach is fantastic ..... white sand, a lot of palapas and available chairs. It was a bit windy while we were there but it was still good to be on the beach !! a little of seeweed but the workers was taking them out in the morning.we went to only 1 show and it was o.k. The maid service was great, we had the fresh towels in our room before 4 pm. the fridge was restock every day. we had a room in the block 6 (room 6304) and it was a standard room that was renovated .... we didn't really had hot water and the pressure was low ... but it was o.k. It was really clean, the bed and the pillow was firm enought. we had 2 double beds. We had a balcony very private. We never had any problems with the beach towels. We return them at 4h00 pm and took fresh ones in the morning at the beach. The resort is very weel kept .... you can always see the workers cleaning and fixing things. It's a small resort... everything is close and we liked it !!! The 24th, we had a special chistmas diner at the buffet... live music and the food was incredible ... better than usual ... even the wine was better ... a lot of see food !We only got out of the resort once and it was to go to Don Lucas ... they came and pick us up for free and to us to their store. You will see people working in the cigar factory and you will shop in the store (cigars, alcool, souvenirs, paintings ...) a lot of nice things .... we really enjoyed going there !!No problem and no waiting for check out.My vacation was perfect and i would definatly go back again !!

<Content>Good 4 star hotel, if you get a good price My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Oasis Bavaro from Dec 11- Dec 18, 2008. We booked through Selloffvacations.com, we got a very good price, so we decided to give it a try. The Grand Oasis Bavaro part is connected with Grand Oasis Punta Cana, however the lobby and hotel rooms are a lot nicer in the Bavaro part. In addition, the use of the aqua restaurant makes it better. Our stay was nice, for the price that we paid, however we ran into some issues that made it very disappointing. Here is a review from an open-minded Canadian couple:What went WRONG: 1.) we paid to have use of the safe during our stay, we paid at the lobby and they told us to call the lobby when we get to our room and they will send someone to activate it. We called for 2 days, and waited in our room forever. No one came, we asked for our money back, and they would NOT return it. We fought with the staff working at the lobby for an hour, and finally they gave us our money back.2.) A little bit shocked at the variety of food. I know it is the Dominican, however I have been to 5 star hotels in the Dominican and this hotel has a 3 star level buffet. Very disappointed with how little fruit and desserts they had. Also, everything was fried.3.) Our flight was late at night, therefore our last day we had the entire day to still spend at the hotel. Check-out time was at 12pm. This was incredibly slow. They had one person working, checking out about 30 of us in the group. We waited 1 hr 1/2 to check-out, missed breakfast, and fought with the guy to get our money back because no one came to activate our safe.4.) We were required to reserve a hospitality room to shower and change after the beach our last day. We booked the hospitality room for 5:20pm, they did not give us a key until 6:00pm. We went to the hospitality room to find that the toilet was plugged, there were no clean towels, and there was no water, plus the shower head was broken. They did not want to give us another room instead they sent a guy from maintenance to repair it while we waited in the room, then we waited forever for someone to bring us clean towels!!! We missed dinner, and just made our bus to the airport. OVERALL REVIEW:Check-In: We were excited to be in the warm Dominican Republic, getting away from the snow, therefore the slow check-in did not really get to us. There were 2 couples ahead of us, and it took about 20 min to check-in. We were greeted with a small bottle of rum, and they explained that we could have 2 beers and 2 soda's each day from the mini-bar, however everything else we had to pay for. We had to carry our own luggage to our rooms, no one helped us, and we were not given any welcome drinks. Perhaps, this is because we arrived late, 1 am.Hotel Room: The hotel room was very nice. We had a nice view of the pool. The bed was extremely comfortable, as well as the pillows which was important to us. There was a plasma tv which was also very nice. The bathroom was nice, the tub had jet's which was relaxing, and the shower had good pressure. Overall, we did not see any mold in our room and it was clean. However, some other rooms definitely have mold in them because you can see it on some of the doors of other rooms on the floor below us.Beach: The beach was horrible the first 3 days that we were there, there was a lot of black seaweed both on the beach and in the ocean. They tried their best to clean it twice a day, however it just kept coming. The last 4 days however, were the total opposite. The beach was completely clean and the water was clear. Perhaps, some bad water came along. The beach is soft white sand, the waves are calm. There were always enough lounge chairs, and shade could always be found.Activities: There was always something fun going on around the resort. We did not participate much in activities, however you could always hear music, and something fun happening. *** If you want to go out one night outside of the resort, I recommend CLUB IMAGINE this was amazing. We paid $20 US a bus took us from the hotel to a hugeeeeee cave, called imagine. In the cave we could have 2 drinks part of our price, and each part of the cave had a different D.J. It was one of the coolest night clubs I have seen. It is worth going!!! Ask the entertainment guys at the hotel about the club.FOOD: Here is where my boyfriend and I have different opinions. He says that he liked the food and that it was good. My opinion differs. The breakfast buffet is ok, you have eggs, beacon, toast, cereal. However there is minimal fruit and variety. Because we were in the Bavaro part, we had access to a restaurant called aqua, we could go there for breakfast and dinner, it is not buffet style, it is a la carte, for breakfast they had 3 choices, which got boring, after 3 days. Dinner, was the good part because you had access to 5 a la carte restaurants that you didn't have to make reservations for. You could just go. You had the American grill, which was great, Mare, which is on the beach, seafood, this was very romantic. You have the Japanese restaurant, we didn't go to that one, not a big fan. And there is aqua, which was nice. The buffet restaurant windows was horrible. Very minimal choice, we would walk around twice, have empty plates and have to go to one of the a la carte restaurants. For lunch you had the windows buffet and the beach buffet. I was so annoyed because all they have is fried chicken, french fries, pasta, burgers. All junk food. There was very minimal choice for lunch, and it was always the same. Overall, you were never hungry, however I expected more from the buffet restaurants.Overall: The grounds are nice, they have nice big clean pools, the bars had a large variety, it wasn't over crowded. it is a small romantic resort, the staff are nice, considering they are over-worked. Some guys we saw working breakfast, lunch, and dinner all week we were there, they treated you nice regardless if you tipped or not. We experienced some problems that made it disappointing, like I mentioned above, however it was a nice 4 star hotel for the price we got. In Addition, when we were there, there were a lot of europeans, therefore a lot of the women were top-less on the beach, even around the pool area. Kind of inappropriate, considering kids were around the pool area, and people were eating at the restaurant on the beach.Hopefully I covered everything, if not, please send me a message.

<Content>Great if you get it at a good price Four friends and I decided to travel here for our Christmas university break. We booked online and chose this resort because it had a 4 star rating on Orbitz and was very cheap. We paid $162 (USD) a day for a 7-day vacation, including flights from Seattle, WA. After we booked it, I found all of the negative reviews here on TripAdvisor. Needless to say, I was very worried. We arrived on December 14th and stayed until the 22nd. First off, some reviewers had a problem getting to the hotel. It's really easy, just hire a taxi. It cost $30 USD for a trip to the resort and they all know where it is. Doesn't matter how many people you cram in the taxi, and its quick and direct.Upon arrival in the morning, we checked in. There was no line in front of us, though I noticed that the check-in counter is ridiculously busy in the late afternoons. The person helping us was friendly enough, though it was hard to always understand him and he kept making fun of us. I think he was trying to be friendly, but it wasn't professional. We also got a free drink at the check-in counter.We were placed in Block 3. I'd originally requested a suite in blocks 9, 10 or 11, but they were all filled. Block 3 is a renovated portion of the resort that overlooks the ocean and pool. After walking around, I much preferred Block 3 from anywhere else.We had the third floor. Very high ceilings, two queen-sized beds. The room was large and clean, though the bathroom shower water was rarely very hot (but not cold, either...just that medium hot that's irritating when you're cold from the pool). The grounds are nice. The pool is big, though we spent most of the time at the beach. The beach isn't the nicest, and its on the atlantic side of the Dominican Republic so its windier. Lots of seaweed, though there are men who clean it up as it gets washed ashore. Lots of chairs and huts for shade; that was never a problem. You can also walk down the coast and find nicer beaches. I'd STRONGLY suggest getting a tour to Saona Island...best daytrip ever and that's where you'll find pristine white beaches and that clear, green-blue water that you think of when you think of the Caribbean.The food was good. All the restaurants are free except for the Japanese restaurant, so we never ate there. We ate at the Tex-Mex restaurant three times, the seafood restaurant one, and the Italian restaurant twice. For lunch, we ate at the snack bar (fries, burgers, fried chicken, and random main dishes). Breakfast, we'd eat at Windows. We only ate at Windows once for dinner. The restaurants are clean and the food is good. We liked the Italian restaurant the most. The hotel gives you reservation tickets and tells you you can only eat at one restaurant once. We went several times. Sometimes they asked for a ticket, sometimes they didn't. But they just leave the used tickets out on a desk and we grabbed extras.There are something like six bars. The drinks are ok, most of the time they don't know how to mix stuff so you have to know exactly what you want. Don't expect anything too fancy. If you want to get drunk, it's easy. Just do a lot of tequila shots.The people can be very rude and pushy, or very nice. The sales people that come on the grounds to sell you tourist trinkets are annoying and you just have to be firm and tell them you're not interested.I'd strongly suggest going off the resort for excursions. We did a Saona Island trip (all day) and an ATV ride (4 hours). Both were totally worth it.This resort is EXCELLENT if you are getting a good price.

<Content>Only if bargain rate Our 2nd room was WONDERFUL; the first one was stinky-smeling and took us 36h to get them to switch us. FOOD: they tried, but hey, this is DR; can't expect American taste in food preparation Don't expect INTERNET, even if paid for in a shop.STAFF very sweet, friendly, and helpful.BIGGEST PROBLEM--nighttime noise. Security guards everywhere did nothing to stop loud, sometimes drunk guests gathered around pool between buildings, room patios, or sidewalks--groups of 4-10, lasted 30-45 minutes until finally my very loud SHHHH!. This at 2, 3, or 4am every night. (Paradise shouldn't require a sleeping pill!) Sometimes guards were the ones playing outside radios at 4am!! Loud music and partying 'til last die-hards go off to sleep is typical Latin culture most places; NOT expected in a more expensive resort2nd complaint--smoking all through the lobby. Though open air, impossible to avoid the smoke.Oh, WATCH YOUR KIDS!! Could fall easily down a 3-story shaft in building 9. Hotel aghast, but never put a lock on the main hallway closet the 5d we were there.Oh, you'll rarely get Internet, even if you pay for it.

<Content>nice basic hotel w/ some issues The hotel was nice. But there are some issues that travelers should be aware of when visiting. The property is being renovated. The bathroom was very basic and in need of renovation. The property lost power several times and at one point the bathrooms were not working. The time periods seem to be for one hour or less.The best things about the visit were the staff and the food. The staff is very nice and worked very hard to meet all of our needs. The food was very good and plentiful.If you want a basic vacation and are not too concerned about the property, this would be a good spot. If you want something nicer this may not be for you.Also, there are more vendors, timeshare and people selling things than I am used to for visiting other properties in the DR. I would rate this property 2.75

<Content>tourist trap The good reviews must be from people who have never seen anything other than their back yard before. I have seen better service in 3 star resorts in Cuba. This was the first place ever where tipping was totally useless. Nicely polished on the outside, totally rotten inside. Don't go there with babies and don't travel with Air Transat/Nolitours: 5 hours delay getting there from Toronto. 1 more hour waiting in the bus at the Punta Cana airport so that they could cram more people inside from other pending flights. 1 more hour waiting to be checked in (around 2 am with a 9 months old baby). Total time: about 11 hours. I've reached destinations in Europe faster than this.... Travelling back: 2 hours to be checked out (try that with your baby crying in your arms). Getting overcharged for minibar water that was supposedly included in the price (had to take it since they missed leaving us the regular 2 bottles one day). The most pathetic checkout process ever. 1.5 hours flight delay due to a supposed snow storm in Toronto that never happened. 1.5 hours waiting for the baby stroller at the baggage claim (came in after all of the other people picked up their baggage). Total travel time approx. 8 hours. I've never seen an airline more pathetic than Air Transat.The italian and japanese restaurants were ok. We tried the Seafood restaurant and had to leave after not being even served the appetizer after 1 hour. Never tried any other after that. Had dinner at the Aqua the rest of the time. The Aqua (for the Cameleon club residents) was all right but had a very limited menu. Not much to eat in the morning either except for eggs. Wouldn't have touched the cold cuts if my life were threatened...Windows restaurant food was ok but service (such as getting a glass of wine) was almost non-existent even though there were a lot of servers running around aimlessly.Constantly bombarded by people trying to sell you something.Water always had some algae and debris of all sorts and was agitated and unclear. None of the resorts fault; I think there are some currents that bring all the stuff onto this part of the shore.Boats idling their engines on the right side of the beach (there's a boating club over there) caused the air to smell worse than the 401 highway in the middle of the day.For the bright side, the resort seems well mantained on the outside and the beach is nice.Water around 26 celsius. Pool water very cold.Would I go there again ? No way. I've been to 6 countries in the Caribbean / Central America area and this was my worst experience. I decided not to go to the Dominican Republic again either due to the poor service and the large number of people there who seemed mentally retarded at best while regarding tourists like walking stupid money bags.....

<Content>DONT GET MARRIED HERE!!!!! I had 18 friends and family accompany me to the Grand Oasis Punt Cana Dec 4-11th. I was supposed to get married there (my fiance and I broke up before the trip , so we turned it into a family vacation) THANK GOD I did not get married there as I would have been VERY upset. Our problems started at check in. As an anniversary gift, my friends were going to upgrade to a suite. They didnt have that available. They put us in building 10. This is the new area. So new in fact that after a long night of drinking we woke up to hammering, drilling at 0800!! I then asked them to move us, as that was unacceptable. If they are not done that section, they should not have people stay there. We then all moved rooms to buildings 3 and 7. Those were o.k. Through out our week the power went off atleast 3 times, the maids went on strike, there were no face cloths, no beach towels, they charged me $22 for a local call, the list goes on and on. They were so unorganized, I cant imagine how a wedding would turn out. They told us we could get married on the beach, but there wasnt really any good place where they could have set it up. I dont know why they would say that they have wedding packages. All in all, we made the best of our trip. When we initally booked it a year ago, reviews were good, and it was listed as 35th most popular hotel. I would NEVER tell friends to stay here. Half of our group was there for 2 weeks, and they stayed in a great hotel the first week. They all said the Grand Oasis was terrible, the beach wasnt as nice, the staff was rude. We even met some flight attendants the night before, on our flight home, they stated they will not be staying there anymore as the flight company needed to have certain standards. For the price we paid, we totally got ripped off!! If you get a cheap deal, it would probably be o.k, but dont even consider getting married there!!!!

<Content>Mixed Feelings I just got back today from a week long vacation at Grand Oasis Punta Cana and read the first couple reviews - something I should have done BEFORE going on the trip. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous (if you overlook the fact that to get to the hotel you must pass by the broken down city and riding in a bus/taxi by a driver that drives like a maniac). However, the problem indeed was the fact that the people cannot speak a word of English. Our check out this morning was at 9 am and yet when we arrived last week, our room wasn't ready till 3 pm. As soon as you step into the hotel be prepared to be BOMBARDED with salesmen calling you amigo and trying to sell you something. Also be prepared that they WILL try and rip you off. I suggest having a travel agent arrange all your activities to save money. Their gift shops sell beautiful things, but to my dismay - expensive things. What got me the most was the fact that ALL the staff was hitting on me (young adult female) and my mom. The men have no problem staring you up and down whether you like it or not. In fact, nevermind the younger men, a 40 something or older man wanted to show me a good time thinking that I had my own hotel room and we wouldn't need to tell anybody because of the age difference. It wasn't until my dad was around everywhere my mom and I went that men behaved in such inappropriate manner. Our room was average. Nothing special but not bad. However when it came to servicing rooms that's when the problems started. If you want to wake up at 6 am on your vacation then you're fine, but if you want to sleep to say 9 am, you won't be able to because the maids there act as foreign roosters shouting to one another in Spanish while standing on two opposite sides of the hallway. Also, they never have enough towels to give you (they bring towels around 5 pm) and we actually had our luggage lost and needed toilettries. However, all we got were 2 half empty tubes of shower gel. We asked if they had shampoo they said they didn't but ended up giving it to us 4 days later when we didn't need it anymore. The pool is beautiful, the whole scenery with palm trees and flamingoes is gorgeous. They have a bar on every corner so if you're a drinker - you'll be okay. But if you're looking for some peace and quiet, you need to go a little further into the beach, as near the pool there is always music playing and little contests. the beach is beautiful but the ocean and the shoreline is covered in seaweed so usually people stay near the pool. The contests that are organized by the staff are very sexual but fun. And you practically get forced to get involved. The food was great. Not much variety - the main meal involves rice or pasta and occasional potatoes but I ate like a pig and have no complaints. For breakfast you get REAL 100% fruit shakes that are AMAZING but for lunch and dinner you get juice out of the bottle that you can by in any grocery store. At night there is always disco club going on that you can hear in your room while trying to fall asleep and sometimes electricity dies out EVERYWHERE and you need to wait 1 - 2 hours while they fix it. Now light isn't the only problem. Their electricity is connected with hydro so if your lights aren't working, neither will your sink/toilet/bath. Good luck flushing! Overall, it was my first vacation so I have nothing to compare it to but if you're coming down here you must: bring a man, and get involved as much as possible otherwise there's nothing to do but lie out and tan. Also there's a bazaar that sells everything the gift shops sell but you can get it 3 times cheaper if you bargain. But when you do get there - since you do not have Canadian or American staff serving you - do not give expect them to serve you like you get served in Canada or U.S. One family ended up in jail because of a salad situation. Also, they have a safe that you NEED to purchase for $21 otherwise your stuff WILL go missing. One man's cell phone was stolen while charging on his first day there. And not even that, don't depend on them taking care of YOU. YOU need to go and ask questions. Also, always have american $$ on you for transportation purposes. I think other hotels won't make you pay for it. Anyways, very beautiful with setbacks like sexually addicted men and serice. Good luck! and Enjoy.

<Content>very disappointing My husband and I stayed one week at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana with eight family members. We are seasoned travelers to the Caribbean and all-inclusive hotels. The exdperience here was, by far, the least enjoyable. It began the first day of our arrival.We all waited hours after the check-in time for our rooms. Two couples in our group arrived at their rooms only to find water all over their bathroom floor from a plumbing problem and one rooms bathroom door was leaning on a wall not installed! The rooms of the others were not supplied with bath towels, so we had to wait to shower even longer. When we complained to the staff for other rooms, we were told there were none to switch to. We called Expedia to change hotels, but got us hours of frustration on the phone with them and got no where. We were stuck! The rest of the week was fair. We still had to wait for dry towels everyday. The one couple still had problems with plumbing. We were not allowed to leave our wet bathing suits out on the balcony to dry, therefore, even though we had more than one suit, they were never fully dry. We've always looked forward to the wonderful variety of good food but, again, this was not the case here. Windows, the one place open for breakfast, was always in good supply of flies and always short staffed when it came to coffee refills or cleaning tables. Despite air conditioning, everything remained damp in our room. Our rooms were all in one hallway in building 3 which was all newly renovated. I hate to think what it was like before. The grounds were very pretty and the pool was always inviting, but that didn't make up for the all the disappointments we encountered. We definitely blew it with this hotel!

<Content>Horrible - Not a 5 Star I would not recommend this place to anyone.The hotel itself and staff over all was good, but it's definitely not a 4.5 or 5 star resort.They alway ran out of towel and sometimes didn't have any at all. The room we stayed on had a leak in the bathroom after it rained. We called 6 times to get it fixed and 6 times they told us someone would fix... it was never fixed. They didn't even offer to switch.I would never go back.

<Content>Worst Place in the Carribean Not sure where to begin but we stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana, scheduled for 6 nights. We were searching for flights back to the US after 2 days. We decided to give it anther chance but finally left 2 days early. This place is a dump and not as advertised on their website nor on Travelocity's site. There was trash on the beach (dirty diapers, cups, mild crates, old shoes we even saw a SYRINGE). HOW DISGUSTING!!!!! It's pretty bad they have one person cleaning up the natural sea grass that washed ashore but they leave the actual trash on the beach.We stayed in Room 1108 for 3 nights. That is Block 1. Behind Block 1 is the theater. In front is the pool bar, courtyard and disco. It was loud all day and well into the night. We were finally able to get sleep starting around 3-4am. We asked 3 days in a row to be moved but they kept telling us there were no rooms available. Funny when we finally paid for Internet service we checked and saw there were rooms available. That鈥檚 right, PAID FOR INTERNET. Wow an all inclusive resort where you pay for more things than you realize. Even the basic Hampton Inn's in the US have a free breakfast, free alcohol and evening snacks and free Internet. The cleaning service also woke up around 7:30 am each morning even though the Do Not Disturb sign was on the door.The food was all fried and no color at all. French fries, rice, fried fish, fried potatoes, hamburgers, hotdogs, bland pasta, hard bread, horrible deserts, melted ice cream. There was no really good fresh fruit. Only over ripe papaya, tasteless watermelon, star fruit that was not ripe but the pineapple was great. There were no strawberries, no bananas, no coconut, no citrus, no mango, no kiwi, no grapes, no apples or pears or cantaloupe.The drinks were all low shelf liquor. There were no American brands of liquor on the property at all. The majority of the bartenders only knew how to make basic drinks. Rum and cola, bad vodka and cranberry, too sweet pina coladas and rum and cola. Any basic drink I ordered, amaretto sour, whiskey sour and margarita they had to go ask how to make them. The beer was good!Lastly, we were the few American/English speaking people on the property. Most were from Europe and were extremely rude. They loved to cut in line while waiting for tables at the buffet or bar. They used their hands and unclean plates to get more food at the buffet. Hello...that鈥檚 what they make the tongs for!!! They were all very rude.We were really disappointed in the food, the people, the staff, the drinks, lack of activities and the property in general. There are way too many places in the Caribbean that are better than here! Also beware of 鈥淎ll Inclusive鈥?here. We were told we could eat at Windows buffet and the beach Garden as much as we wanted. The Italian, Seafood and Tex-Mex restaurants can only be eaten at only once during your stay. You can eat here twice if you stay 14 days or longer. Now is that really all inclusive?I would not recommend this property to anyone!!!!!!!!!

<Content>We will not be going back I stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana (GOPC) with my girlfriend on Nov. 17th through Nov. 21st of 2008. This was our first vacation together so we spent some time researching the various resorts in the DR and when we came across the GOPC, it fit our budget the best. We read many reviews and saw a trend -- either people loved this place or they hated it. So we figured overall the place is probably average so why not try it out. It's relatively cheap afterall. Also, we figured that for the people who hated it, they were probably really picky and were expecting too much of a cheap all-inclusive place. Well, after spending four nights at the GOPC, I sadly have to agree with those reviewers who were very critical of the resort. Here's our observations of the resort (both problematic and positive)...you can make up your own mind.(1) Check in -- I was surprised by how quickly we were able to check in. It may have had to do with the fact that we flew in around 5 pm.(2) Our room -- we stayed in 1303 (building 1, room 303). Room was pleasantly large. First problem was that the fan wouldn't run without the attached light being on. When we tried to call the front desk, our phone didn't work (it wasn't fixed for another two days -- despite repeated requests). The maid was really cool and attentive -- we left her about $2-3 per day. ONE THING -- make sure you put the bolt/chain on the door whenever you're in the room. The first night we were fast asleep and someone tried to get into our room they were able to use a key card and enter the room but were stooped by the bold/chain across the door (I think the hotel rebooked our room to another guest -- my impression is that the front desk is really disorganized and does not keep track of which rooms are checked out etc. -- btw, random people trying to enter our room at night because the rooms were probably rebooked happened two different time on two different nights -- just be aware of this. It could be a really alarming experience if you're by yourself). Also, avoid building 1 -- it's right next to the theater where they hold the nightly events and right next to the early morning construction. A better bet would be building 5 or 7.(3) Pool - was the big plus. The main pool was big. I loved the swim up bar. There are multiple pools but not many people used the subsidiary pools. I spent a lot of time at the pool.(4) Beach - Terrible. Do not be fooled by the pictures. The ocean is nothing like in the pictures. I don't know if it was the time we were there but the beach and the water by the GOPC was completely saturated by seaweed. Plus, if you don't get up at 8 in the am and reserve the huts etc., you'll never get a space. Frankly I was very disappointed by the beach as it was nothing like they lead you to believe. That water is not the crystal blue you think it'll be. I basically walked on the beach twice and never went in the water.(5) Food  Drinks - Food was terrible. Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't expect 5 star food etc. But the main cafeteria (Windows) didn't (IMHO) have a variety of foods and if you're a vegetarian, don't expect many good choices (or many choices at all). I found the selection lacking. As for the restaurants on the resort. We tried the TexMex place and were so disappointed that we didn't do any of the other restaurants. The Japanese place is supposed to be the best but I wasn't up for paying the extra $15/person after the TexMex fiasco (it took them 50 minutes to get me my sub-par steak burrito or whatever). No complaints about the drinks, we were flowing and always strong. Also, did not have to wait long at the bars to get my drinks.(6) Service - Overall, the service was crap. Very few staff at the hotel said hello, many were more interested in talking amongst themselves than serving you, and if you don't speak Spanish, in general, don't expect good service. When we were there, a majority of the guest were from Spain and many of the servers weren't interested in serving those guests that didn't speak Spanish. Curiously, I found that tipping didn't get you better service. Call me a glutton for punishment but I still tipped every time. BTW, some of the staff are real jerks -- I speak a bit of Spanish and was somewhat shocked at how the servers would address some of the non Spanish speaking guests -- many times some of the bartenders addressed the guests using curse words. Another time at the disco, a bartender offered my me and my girlfriend weed. And, while he may have tought it funny, when I checked in, another frond desk guy told me that he'd offer me a better room if I tossed him some cash -- while he laughed as he said this, I thought it was poor form. Also, when in the disco or the piano bar, you'll notice that the staff would rather enjoy themselves by hanging out amongst themselves than actually cater to the guests requests.(7) Guests - Just wanted to comment on this because I've never been surrounded by a group of people more rude and just plain unpleasant as I was during our stay. Now, I'm 31 yrs. old, was in a fraternity, and can throw down with the best of them, but the crowd at the GOPC was ridiculous. The guest at the resort were about 85% European (mostly Spain. And a smattering from France, Portuguese, Dutch). There were also some Canadians and very few Americans. Now, I'm an American and I've been taught to be polite to people, wait my turn in line and hold doors for people. Now this is not a condemnation of non-Americans etc -- just a commentary on my experience. But, I found the European guests the most rude people I have ever met. Not only did they not wait in line and would cut you at the drop of a hat, most never said hello, or than you for say holding a door for them. And frankly, in the pool area, it was frankly embarrassing to watch some of them act like children. Please realized that I am in no way a prude etc. But watching 30 somethings yell and scream at 2 pm in a pool is uncalled for in a non-springbreak setting IMHO.(8) Entertainment -- Hmmm, the nightly shows, how can I put this, when I was watching it all I could think of was a bad B movie/ those 70s blacksploitation movies. Don't expect a Vegas show here. The disco had potential but the music is ear-splitingly loud. And while we were there, only played one type of music - salsa. I don't mind salsa, but if you have an international crowd, shouldn't you cater to it? (i.e., have Spanish and English music?). The piano bar had a lot of potential but it fell short due to the poor service and the fact that the staff would rather close up the bar early so that they can go dance at the disco (this is not an exaggeration, this actually happened when we were there). (9) Miscellaneous - make sure you use of the transportation services from the airport to the resort. We used Prieto tours and the total rountrip cost was $40. Not bad considering it would cost you about $60 roundtrip if you took a cab. Also, once you book the transportation, make sure you print out the voucher or they will not take you from the airport. Also, keep copies of all your paperwork. When we got in the van at the airport the guy told me that I had to pay him $30/one way (even though I had already paid). I told him to call his boss and lo and behold, he relented. Don't be pushed around by some of these people. The airport is a total fiasco. Make sure you get there 3 hrs before your flight takes off. Frankly 3 hrs is necessary because the check in process (we flew US Airways) is farcical. Many of the reps. there (1) have not clue what they are doing, (2) don't care, or (3) are completely imcompetent. We got there 3 hrs in advance and stood (not in line) but at the counter for 1.5 hrs. because they couldn't find our connection boarding passes. Total fiasco. Also, when they tag your bags when you check them MAKE SURE you check those tags before they put in on the conveyor belt -- they put the wrong tags on our bags and if we hand't noticed it, our bags would have been in Orlando, when we were flying to Pittsburgh. Finally, if you have to pay a fee for your luggage being over the permitted weight (50 lbs), make sure you have pesos, because the DO NOT accept dollas.Alright, I apologize for the rant and please ignore the poor spelling and improper grammar (I wrote this stream of consciousness). But there you have it, our experience in the DR. Now, here's the thing, I knew not to have too high expectations -- after all, I paid $1500 for two roundtrip tix and 4 nights -- but still, despite the cheap price, I think it's not too much to ask for simple professional service etc. I think this place has a lot of potential, however, until it is managed in a more efficient manner, it'll always get negative reviews, IMHO.Hope this was helpful. Happy Travels.

<Content>Overall a good vacation stay These reviews were helpful.I found the hotel room to not be up to a 4.5 star level. However the rest of the hotel was nice... there is a large selection of places to eat and the food itself was good. My children had no issues with the food either. The beach is great and the pool is also well kept.I only found the hotel lacked informing the guests of entertainment through out the week. The staff that works at the hotel were great and helpful. Tipping is not required but it goes a long way.The animation crew at the hotel lacked content. They were silly and only stayed with a few guests. They did not advise everyone of the events for the day.The maid serve was great, just ask and you will receive. Spanish is their language so for those that are traveling to this country I suggest you brush up or learn basic spanish.The employees are very accommodating and will try to serve you to the best of their ability.

<Content>Could be better We booked through Thomas Cook, This was to be a special holiday for 9 of us as it was my 50th Birthday. Sadly we were disappointed. The hotel is average but nearly everyone we spoke to had some probelm with their room, whether it be the air con not working, leaking toilet, TV not working etc. Each had something wrong.The hotel either has insufficient staff or bad management as every evening when we sat at a table by a bar we had to clear it up ourselves first. I have never stayed in a hotel where they dont clear tables. Guest were also using the plastic glasses to put their cigarette end out, which then meant you could be drinking from that same plastic glass at any time.They have a piano bar which only opened once the whole 2 weeks were were there dispute this being the only bar inside and we were there when the hurricane was passing by so we had several evenings of VERY heavy rain and wind with no where to go but your room.There is a large stage outside where there was supposed to be evening entertainment. This was very poor and was repeated weekly so you saw everything badly twice. There is nowhere to go outside the hotel, just one small shop about 5 mins away if you dared to walk there which sell snacks/drinks etc.Over all we were all very disappointed with Thomas Cook for giving the rating they gave this hotel. The Rep took no interest what so ever in our comments. So our advice would be to stay away.

<Content>Good Stay at Grand Oasis I had a good stay and Grand Oasis Punta Cana. It exceeded my expectations since it is very solidly rated by TripAdvisor travelers as a 3.5 star hotels, giving a 5 star to a Ritz or Four Seasons hotel.I went with a group of 5 friends. I previously contacted Ines and Karen in the reservations department requesting our rooms in block 3, which has renovated standard rooms. We were honored with our request. Beds are big and comfortable, rooms are VERY clean, big and well appointed. Good selection of channels. The one-bed rooms have an enormous king size bed, perfect for couples. One person in our group had a room in block 2 because a smelly odor in her block 3 room, and her room in block 2 was nice, not renovated, but still with all the basics a room could have, and also very clean. The best of those rooms in block 2 is having the pool that faces the Suites in front of her balcony, and just 5 steps of going into that pool. It is a very quiet pool, clean and resembles a river... I loved it....The only problem i found in the room was the A/C, which its temperature didn麓t go below 21c, but they have ceiling fans and it was not bad at all. The room in block 2 was a little bit hotter, but it was ok. The other thing i must say about rooms in block 3 is that many of them face the main pool and bar, and sometimes during the night, if the bar is crowded and the music is loud, then you might experience some noise during your early sleep. Try and request rooms facing the garden instead if you like to sleep early and want to avoid noise. However, those with the garden view don麓t have a view!The beach is good but not the best in Punta Cana, there is some seaweed but there is always personnel cleaning it, so it is fine. A terrific secret about the beach: walk left for 15 minutes past the Sunscape and Natura Park hotels, and you will find a pristine water beach! It was amazing. Many tourists walk by too and there are miles of virgin beach. Lovely! Water is crystal clear and aqua blue. Very clean and waves are not hard at all. That was a very good insider麓s tip. Recommend it.The food is good. I went to Windows and the food is plentiful and you will always find something good to eat. I found shrimps, fish, other good selection of seafood, veal, beef, pork, pasta and bread station, fruit, dessert, vegetables, etc... Food is very above average and the items are VERY good in this buffet. Breakfast is very plentiful too, with made to order ommelets, ham, cheese, bread, sausages, bacon, pancakes, fruit, fresh juices, cereal, etc..... I went to AQUA and MARE restaurants and the food was good too. I had the steak at Aqua and it was very good! Mare is by far the best restaurant we had. Loved it. We didn麓t try the Japanese, American/Tex-mex nor the italian, however, i read the menus and the food and selections seemed very good. The italian had so many good treats.... You should give them a try. Aqua is the only one which needs reservations, all others are open to everyone as you walk by. The Michael Jackson show was good, there is a casino on site but it did not seem crowded. The disco is not too big but it serves the purpose. The front desk staff was very helpful, acommodating all of our requests. Sosie was great. The servers and other staff was very corteous and always smiling too. Bring lot of singles to tip maids, bartenders and food servers. It is much appreciated and will work a long way....Furnituring and landscaping of the hotel is very nice, clean grounds and ample spaces. There are plenty of chaise lounges and cabanas in the beach. Before breakfast take your beach towels to your favorite spot and have a great day.I definetely recommend the Grand Oasis Punta Cana and will be coming soon again. I am a very well traveled person, being in Europe, USA, South and Central America and stayed in many 3-4.5 star hotels. The Grand Oasis is solidly a 3.5 star, which is very good for the price i paid. If i had stayed in a suite, i would have rated it a 4 star.If you need more information about the hotel or my experience, you can email me at raymondrios@hotmail.com

<Content>Not a 5 star, but not an awful place to go either. When 29Sep 鈥?15OctPaid 拢714 eachRoom StandardVERY IMPORTANT 鈥?This is NOT a 5 start hotel. Probably a 3 star.HOWEVER, if you get a good price it is still worth going to.ROOM 鈥?Not bad, clean, spacious, we had a great view. Bit tatty around the edge, although they are currently updating and refurbishing the rooms. Was happy to spend two weeks there.FOOD 鈥?Windows was poor, food was not warm, lots of flies, no A/c, good variety though. The other restaurants were decent, not all were open at the same time (you can鈥檛 eat in 5 restaurants in one night anyway) but you have to remember it was off-peak for them.SPORTS FACILITIES 鈥?Pretty good, Volleyball etc, free canoes for the sea etc.SHOPS 鈥?Ok, not a great variety, some were expensive. Be aware of the corner shop not having any change!STAFF 鈥?Most were fairly miserable, but did do a good job. Our maid was good (but we did tip $3 a day) we had heard others were not so good.POOLS 鈥?Very good, clean, spread out, not to busy (again off-peak though)DRINKS 鈥?Very good selection.BEACH 鈥?Very good, clean, lots of sun loungers, lots of palm trees.SEA 鈥?As you would expect, clear, warm.RESORT AS A WHOLE 鈥?Ok, needs some work (which they were doing), location good as only 15mins from airport.BAD Stuff:Some foodSellers on stalls on Tue  Fri, VERY VERY VERY PUSHY.Staff in general, need to smile more.Some areas of the resort need a good tidy up.Currently there is construction work on both sides of the resort.Not a great deal to do (but then you do go for the sun!)GOOD Stuff:Price we paid.Generally clean.Aqua restaurant.Jewellery shop in reception.View from room 2317.Our Maid.Beach.Sea.OVERALLWould I go back, NO. Would I recommend it to others, yes if they have paid a decent price. The main thing is to remember it is not a 5 star, if that鈥檚 what you are expecting, you WILL be disappointed, hence other people complaining. It does have faults, but overall it鈥檚 a nice resort. The staff do need to cheer up, and the food needs a massive improvement. The main reason we would not go back, is we would like to be able to walk for longer, as the beach ends pretty quickly, takes about 10mins from one end to the other, and we would like better food.TIPSWalk down and into the Natura resort near the end of the beach, as it was off-peak they said we could use there pool (you have to wear wrist bands of your own resort, so they knew we were not from there) they also have nice grounds with ducks and fish etc! The shop is also cheaper and of better quality.Take mosquito repellent with 50% DEET. Spray the vents and door frames in your room. Also use a plug in bug killer. Buy repellent patches for sunbathing etc during the day (can be worn under your clothes) Me and my partner got bit less than 12 times each, others we met got bit up to 50 times!Take Anti-Histamine bug bite cream, as you will get bit, and it will itch!

<Author>N0thingbutthetruth
<Content>Please do not waste your money and valuable holidays/vacation going to this hote If you like your cold food warm and your hot food cold, poor service, accomodation in desparate need of repair(unless you pay extra) and extremely limited facilities then this is the Hotel for you.Please do not listen to the reviews that make this hotel sound wonderful because it is far from being so, the only reason I can see for giving a good report about this place is that they've wasted their hard earned money going there and don't see why others shoud'nt do the same.The hotel is situated at the moment between two building sites, and depending upon which rooms you are allocated you will notice the noise during the day.On arrival you will notice that the hotel has 5 stars below its name on the gate, believe me this should read no more than 2.Check in was ok but they tried to charge for the safe in the room which was in the all inclusive package.Which room you get is a lottery, some have new furniture some have very old and tatty furniture but if you want a nice room block 7 is the one for you,however you will be charged an extra $350 per week to upgrade and be aware that this block is next to one of the building sites I mentioned.Not all of the hotel facilities were available during my stay, noticably the five restaurants advertised were never open at the same time, at most three were available for use each day and this included the main windows restaurant.The food in the restaurants was in the main awful, warm salads and cooked meats, cold hot dishes, food not protected from flies which are in abundance. These standards applied to all restaurants we tried during our stay and I'm sorry to say to most meals, even the ones on the sizzling platters, how they managed that I am at a loss to know but believe me they did.The service in the restaurants and bars is somewhat hit and miss depending on which members of staff are working that day, but in the main the service was poor, some of the staff appeared to have all the enthusiasm of someone reluctantly doing community service. Mind you a few dollars or a tight fitting short skirt and low cut top will go a long way towards getting served a bit sooner if you get my drift.Drinks at the bar are ok but don't expect anything exotic or in a glass or with fresh ingredients eg fruit or mint as in a Mojito they simply just don't have them. The beer is not to good either but it will get you drunk it thats what you want.If you like being pestered by hotel staff every morning as you come out of the windows restaurant after breakfast trying to sell you timeshare or apartments then this is the place for you, believe me they are unrelenting trying day after day with the promise of a baseball cap and teashirt to get you into their sales office.Also twice a week Tues. and Fri. evening the main bar and entrances to the restaurants are surrounded by stalls eagerly manned by local stall holders trying to sell you their wares, on these days you will be mobbed by them as you make your way from your rooms to the restaurants for your evening meal, escape is not possible as they have all entrances and exits covered with military precision.The only good things about the hotel is the location ie right on the beach and some of the shows are ok.All in all I would not recommend this hotel, not even to my worst enemy and I would never go back there for a holiday again. There are better hotels on the island, please use them instead.

<Content>loved the grand oasis stayed at the grand from oct. 14-28/08. read other reviews about could'nt get rest. reserv. when wanted, etc. we travel alot and this trip was during low season, so possibly they were correct but we found the daily buffet to be great(very fussy, wife is excel. cook)with lots for everybody, didn't get tired even after 2 wks, much better then anything in cuba. very clean resort,friendly and helpful staff(just keep tipping)time share sales people not to pushy. we went on the excur's. and found you could get the same ones as the hotel sells for much less from the pirates at the beach.

<Content>Don't go to the Grand Oasis Punta cana Hello, just wanted to warn others about this hotel, the Grand Oasis Punta Cana , my wife and I tried to stayed there in April 2008 and were very disappointed. I have been to the Dominican several times before and have enjoyed the island and it's people. We are both very relaxed travellers and usually do not let the little things get to us, after all we are on holidays. So here's my rant, check in was a nightmare, slow and disorganized, and also found out that the hotel had been overbooked so we were put at a Sister Hotel, which was not up to the same standards as the Hotel we paid for. We did not actually get to stay at the hotel, my complaints are with the treatment from hotel staff, particularily reservations . We were given a complimentry 1 week gift certificate as a good will gesture from the Hotel for all the problems we had ( we did not request this or complain ), the problem is trying to use it. The certificate says just call and book 1 month in advance, I tried to do this ( well in advance ) and was given the run around from the start. I spoke to reservations and was told there was lots of room in the resort at the time we wanted to go, once they found out that I was wanting to use the complimentry certificate things got complicated. They requested a faxed copy of the certificate so they could verify it's authenticity, from there on in it was frustrating trying to get ahold of anyone as they would not return my many calls or e-mails for over a week. When they finally did get back to me they said that there was no room at the resort for the time we requested ( even though they already told us that there was lots of room ). It is apparent to me that they issued this certificate with the intention of never honoring it. I will certainly never stay there again, nor will I book at another Oasis Hotel.

<Content>not a 4 star! we just returned on saturday, oct.4-08.this is definitely not a 4 star hotel (this is our 5th stay in D.R.-three times in Puerto Plata, twice now in Punta Cana).had problems checking in, told our rooms would be another3 and a half hrs...we were too early!.check in was only at 3pm..all 3 couples of us..(not alot of rooms to get ready here)and we could use a public washroom to change, and thencarry our carry-on luggage around with us! after complaining tomanagement, we got a room in an hour or so..but it was nota great welcome. Our room was in building 4...mould in theceiling the size of your hand...the stairs to the rooms weremissing chunks of stone -dangerous- and the doors to therooms had very little, if any paint left on them...the place looksvery tired and in need of a facelift. even at the buffet, cosmeticrepairs are needed badly.the hotel was very empty..2/3 of buffet was closed, and eventhen, approx. 50 people at a time..food was ok..not thebest selection, but enough.on the plus side,...the beach is beautiful, all staff friendly andcourteous. The maid was exceptional...lots of towels, barrefills, and cleaned to perfection.would we go back? no.

<Content>This is the review to read! If you have not stayed in a 5 star resort before.......Then you will love this place!. If you have stayed in a 5 star resort then it may see disappointing at first but It is a beautiful location and the beach really is second to none. You must remember that this is not a rich country so expect some differences. TIP - you will be given a room in the lower blocks upon arrival (stay there one night the beds are actually quite comfy) then the next day during your orientation complain that your room isn't up to your standards and they will give you a much nicer room in the higher blocks. However if you do like your room and a comfy bed and being close to everything is important than just stay put because while blocks 8-11 are nicer rooms the beds are hard are there is construction next door. The rooms will always have a damp feel it is not the hotel it is simply the climate so just try to keep sliding door open while you are in the room and it should help. Bring washcloths** they dont see to have any and it is definatley something you will want. Tip people who do nice things for you ie: maid, bartenders and waiters who give extraordinary service they will remember and it will insure prompt service the whole trip.The vendor selling things will ask a much higher price off the bat so barter with the you can usually get it for 1/3 the asking price. They are persistent at ties especially on the vendor night but by being polite and simply saying no and keep walking you wont have too much trouble ( they are poor ppl and this is how they make a living) .The drinks are great again dont expect to have name brand alcohol but the generic brands are good and there are so many drinks to choose from ( again your in there country dont expect them to have everything your accustom to, enjoy yourself) Overall the food is alright and does seem to get better as the week progresses. WINDOWS BUFFET is mediocre but you can find some tasty food there. This isn't 5 star so dont expect 5 star food . As for people complaining of no air in the restaurants they have huge fans and you are going to a hot country its going to be hot deal with it. Sitting inside the restaurant helps with any insects that might come along they seem to like the patio more.BOTTOM LINE: If you expect too much or think too highly of yourself yes you will feel somewhat disappointed. If you just want a relaxing fun week in the sun then its a good choice.

<Content>made the best of it.... CT I recently vacationed in punta cana sept. 2-6... this was during the time when Hurricane Hanna decided to grace us with her presence l0l.. I was very pleased with the resort and the front desk crew (hola luis) for making our stay as comfortable as possible during this time.. We stayed in building 26 (this building has renovated rooms and is close to the beach) The only problems that we had was during one of Hanna's rainy nights it started leaking in our bathroomwhich made it hard to use the toliet. It was hard to communicate with the night shift because they spoke little english.. so we waited until the morning and politely spoke to the front desk and explained our situation.. we were allowed to move to another room.. Also the hotel provided each room an umbrella and a ride to your room on a golf cart.. Restuarant: the buffet is the same everyday.. make reservations at the other restuarants.. I personally loved Le Reces (Brazilian) the late night pizzeria always came in handy.. Entertainment:: was great.. you must have fun and participate.. I won a bottle of dominican rum (yea)Beach: was breathtaking.... after hanna decided exit stage left... we were able to enjoy the white sand and the water... you must take a stroll along the beach.. Spa: you must get a 60 min full body massage.. it was wondering. I will return to Punta Cana but next time I would like to see what another resort can offer..

<Content>5 stars?? I鈥檝e been in 4 stars much better then Gran Oasis Loved my second time in Punta Cana, but I wouldn鈥檛 go back again to Grand Oasis Punta Cana.When my boyfriend and I made our check-in at the hotel we were told that we were getting a deluxe room, but if we had any problems with the room we could upgrade to a junior suite for an extra $50 a night!! That sounded strange鈥?what problems could a deluxe room have!? Well鈥?when we got to the room it had a very strong smell of moister, the bathtub seemed that it hadn鈥檛 been cleaned in a long time and the windows didn鈥檛 closed.We complaint to the reception and they immediately showed us another room. This second room had the same smell (I couldn鈥檛 stay there because of my allergies) and same problem with the windows. The third room we visited looked (and smelled) much better, although it was clearly older them the previous 2, but we decided for that one.When we took our first bath, we discovered that the bathtub had some kind of leak to the bathroom floor and we always had to use 1 towel to stop the leak; luckily there was always an extra bath towel, although we only had one 1 hand towel.The room鈥檚 balcony columns and walls were full of cracks and the handrail seemed to be falling (we didn鈥檛 spend much time there enjoying the wonderful view to the beach). The maids in our floor started to clean the rooms very early in the morning (around 6:30 or 7:00am) and never knocked before they enter.We met another Portuguese couple in the hotel that was staying in block 9 鈥渢he honeymooner鈥檚 block鈥?(our first room was in block 6, we saw another in block 2 and the last one in 4) and their room was a completely different story. They tolds they had a new and very clean room and their only problem was the moister smell in the first day and the lack of the tv remote for 2 days.Another big problem was the food鈥?in the main restaurant (鈥淲indows鈥? there was a large variety but everything tasted the same; the salads and desserts were out of the cold (even the ice cream); and there were flies all over the food and tables.One night we tried to go to the Tex-Mex restaurant but it was closed because the hotel was having a low season and they started closing the restaurants. The alternative was the main one or the Japanese that was not included (had to pay $15 a person). One day I got sick after eating at 鈥淢are鈥?(seafood restaurant). We talked to the other Portuguese couple, which went to 鈥淢are鈥?the same night and the girl ordered the same food I did鈥?she got sick too. We couldn鈥檛 handle anything in our stomachs for a couple of days. The hotel staff was always helpful and very friendly, but just the staff doesn鈥檛 make a 5 star hotel!! I've just been to 3 different all inclusive hotels (2 of them 4 stars) but this one was by far the worst.

<Content>worst vacation of my life this hotel was a nightmare. i went with friends and family and most of us got sick. the first day we got there we went to eat at Windows and there was no air conditioner they had the windows open and a big cockroach flew onto our table. then a couple of night later we were going to eat at the same restaurant and we saw a mouse by the entrance and the server asked us if we were not going in and when we said no she replied just because of that. there were also lots of flies all over he food. The best meal that i had all week was a taco salad form wendys at the airport. The service was horrible. we never had any clean towels (we always had to call for them to bring them up) and the maid would start cleaning the room at like 6 in the afternoon so we had to leave our room just to let her clean. and once we gave her a $10 tip and we told her to please make sure that we had at least 3 towels in the room and when we got back we didnt even have a hand towel. we called the front desk and it took them like 30 mins to bring them to us. there was also never any towels by the pool. our room was never clean. i have a baby who got sick witha fever and threw up all over the bed and the sheets had a red stain on them and i told the lady to please change the sheets and i went back to the room and i checked and it was the same sheet. also, one night my friend sat at the end of the bed it broke and it took maintenance like 2 hours to come up. so when we finally went to sleep the bed (that they had just fixed) broke again and my husband and i had to sleep in the bed like that. we never had any toilet paper. my friend called the fornt desk for toilet paper and it took them 30 min to come up while her daughter was sitting in the toilet waiting for it. also we booked our hotel through apple vacations and our room service was included but when we got there they told us they charged $6 for froom service and we did it many times and then we found out we were not supposed to pay for it. so when we told the manager they said there was nothing they could do about it because they didnt know which server it was. also there was never any umbrellas by the pool becuase people would put their towels on the chairs and never come back and when we told management they said they didnt have any rules for that. I've read some reviews that say not to forget that it's the south and people dont loive the same way and while that might be true, myself, being dominican (born and raised), i never had service like that anywhere else i went. I been to hotels in Puerto Plata and they're absolutely beautiful and the service is great. I had nevr been to punta cana before and going to the oasis made me not wanna go there again. Dominican Republic is beautiful but if you go make sure you dont stay at the Grand Oasis. Pay the extra money and stay at the RIU. believe me its worth it.

<Content>Surprisingly - very good ! We were a little scared booking as we read the reviews ! but once we arrived we realized that the people writing bad reviews must have had a bad attitude themselves ! Hotel - excellent shape, very good rooms. everything works and if it doesn't all you have to do is mention it and it gets done momentarily. they really try hard to maintain the resort in good shape. staff - great people ! we had a blast with them singing and being so positive to all the people.beach - awesome ! very clean ... we went to visit other resorts in the area and ours was by far the best and the cleanest from the rest. Snorkling is great ! Catamarans were fun . Bar was working 24 hours and no one bugs you from running around doing crazy things. Excellent night entertainment and Disco.Food - great variety ! amazing breakfast choices, lunch was special especially when they were making seafood on a grill right in front of you ... we ate like 4 plates ! Dinner was really special in a la carte restaurants. the only thing is if you go in a large group reserving space in a restaurant was a pain in the [--].Everyone tried hard to make our stay great and comfortable, lots of entertainment available during day and night ! great for young people and couples but defenitely NOT a good resort to bring small kids.Make sure to appreciate peoples hard work and leave a tip. even a $1 works great. We tipped $2 to our cleaning maid and had extra water and extra towels every day. Overall we were very happy ! the people, the beach, the food, the alcohol it was worth the money we spent !

<Content>wouldn't go there again Maid service was horrible, she didn't come to clean the room until about 6pm everyday and never left clean towels, we had to complain and wait 1/2 hr to 1hr or more for some clean towels. My sister in law waited a 1/2 hr in the hallway oneday for some toilet paper while my niece sat on the toilet. Maid never changed the sheets on the beds the whole time we were there. Everytime we went to get our beach towels they were always out of them. No policy on beach chair reserving, for example I was traveling with small children and everytime we went to the pool there was never no lounge chairs available under the umbrellas, people had reserved them with their towels and left for hours, so a few days into the trip we started to montior how long it took people to come back to their chairs, one couple reserved the chairs first thing in the morning and came back at 5:30pm stayed for 10 min and left to go eat and NEVER came back, another couple I saw reserved chairs by the pool and by the beach, stayed on the beach all day then came back to their lounge chairs by the pool for about 30 min, then left again to the beach never to return to the pool, mind you their towel was on the pool lounge chair all day, so we began complaining to the managers about the situation explaining to them that we are traveling with small children and we need an umbrella, and that people reserve the chairs and never use them, they basically told me oh well, theres nothing they can do. so my sister in law woke up at 5am every morning from then on, grabbed towels and went to reserve chairs for our family and then went back to bed. My 4 yr old had to use the bathroom when we were by the pool one day, so i rushed her to the nearest poolside restroom, there was only two stalls both toilets were clogged one with bo and the other with multiple tampons and urine, the bathroom stunk and was filthy, i ran out carrying the baby yelling for my husband to take her in the mens room, he came running out saying that one was filthy too, so he had to run her back to the hotel room. one day we were eating in the buffet and my sister in law spotted a huge bug on the wall behind the bar, she told the waiter and he just laughed, everyone was skeeved, all of the sudden the bug flew from the wall across the bar and on to our table, we screamed it was a huge flying cockaroach, the wait staff tried to calm us down saying that they had the windows open today and it probably came in then. BULL CRAP a few days later I woke up in the middle of the night half asleep to use the bathroom, as i am using the bathroom something moving catches my eye, another huge flying cockaroach, I ran screaming almost giving my husband a heart attack. Again complaining to the managers and no one gave a crap! The food wasn't all that, the best place to eat was the beach patio resturaunt (can't remember the name) and that food was alright, all the liquor is watered down BIG TIME! Overall it really wasn't worth the money, I regret booking it, we go to a different country every year and this one was by FAR the worst trip! Before i booked this trip i checked book it.com and they gave it 4 1/2 stars, i checked a few other places I can't remember and they all had given the hotel 4 stars, i dont know where they get their info from, I wouldn't even give it 2 stars!

<Content>Do not worry!!!! We only got back this morning and stayed here for 2 weeks. After reading the reviews on here my fiance and I are very worried about this hotel. If you are picky and like to complain about trivial things then dont stay here. We had a room in block 5 overlooking the adult pool. The building does need updating but the hotel is being refurbished so it will get there eventually. (im glad we didnt stay up the posh end as there was some building work going on). The room was big and the bed huge, the television worked fine and in the second week there were loads of good chanels, the room is basic but unless you are going to spend the whole time in the room, who cares? The air conditoning worked well and the maid cleaned really well and topped the mini fridge up with beer, soft drinks and water. There were a few days when we didnt get clean towels until the early afternoon and there were a few ants in the room a couple of days. The buffet restaurant was a bit hit and miss, really nice food one night then not so good the next, the water and ice in there is fine it is all bottled! Breakfast is definately the best meal and they do try to cater for everyone. Some of the plates have chips in them and when we were late eating they did run out of plates a few times but they would be replaced after about a two minute wait. The grounds are kept really nice and the pools are really clean, the entertainment is good and the staff speak english but they do like it if you have a go at speaking spanish. The beach is lovely. We had friends staying in a 5 star hotel and we walked there a few times, took nearly 2 hours along the beach which was a really nice walk. We had a great time even in the tropical storms, we saw lots of people complaining about little things which they made into a big deal. If you go here expecting luxury and perfection you will be disapointed, go with an open mind and chill out you will have a great time, we loved it!

<Content>will never go again!!! The resort is big, but old. everything is cracking, and falling apart. needs a lot of maintenance. the place is infested with flies. specialy the main buffett restaurant. it was terrible the flies were all over the food and on the tables. Most of the waiters and bartenders has attitudes. is like they could care less. The tv in my room went out , and it was not fixed. they said it was a general problem. but friends next to my room had service. I had no tv for the last 3 days there. the save deposit box in the room is $18. Come on. it should be free!! I've been to about 7 different all inclusive hotels. and by far this is the worst one. IT was cheap, I got what I paid for. spend a few more hundred $ and go to Barcelo BABARO BEACH. or RIU Palace punta cana.

<Content>Recommend other Hotel. Loved Punta Cana I enjoyed myself here; however, there were quite a number of things that would have improved my stay. First issue has to do with towels. We did not have any towels in our room upon checking in and did not get a towel for the pool or beach for three days. The rooms are very nice; however, there were little things that were irritating. There was no TV remote, the TV had poor reception, there was no clock radio in the room, and the mini-bar was not cold. Also, the sliding doors to the balcony made a tremendous amount of noise when opening or closing. The main issue was the food. It could have been a lot better. First, the main eating area had absolutely no A/C and you sweat like a pig during lunch and dinner. The refrigeration there was horrible too and most of the foods that need to remain cold were always suspect. That takes a lot of available food right off the menu. The hard ice cream was ridiculously left in an open freezer area so that it was like scooping soft butter rather than ice cream. Food in the other restaurants were tremendously better, however, a meal will cost you two hours due to the poor service. Getting a cocktail was also a hassle. For example, you couldn鈥檛 get any type of a mixed drink in the main eating area, not even a Bloody Mary. Also, forget about getting a Mojito. It is non-existent here. The pool and beach areas were fantastic. Skip the gym as it was small, hot, had little equipment much of which was rusty. The check in and checkout process was a joke. I couldn鈥檛 extend my check out from 12 to 2 PM and the front desk clerk was pretty rude. I spoke to the manager who was supposed to have someone slip a note under my door to let me know I could check out later. I saw him at 12:30 and he asked if I got the message, which I never did. Great freaking service! In meeting people from other resorts, I would definitely recommend another place in Punta Cana. I would go back to DR, however, Grand Oasis is not for me.

<Content>don't read the negative...you are in the SOUTH don't forget... We were in this hotel the week of august 16... When we first arrive we got a room in block 5 wich is the lowest class room... it's ok but I always like to have the higher class room and this is very personnel... but the room was very ok.. I'm just picky... the next days we asked for a room in block 9-10 or 11 but there was none we were offered in block 7 wich is the highest...WOW...what a room.. it was a suite delux master. we had a private lounge with a big screen tv and internet free at any time of day and there was never anybody there...always very clean. so that's for the room...RESTAURANT: it's fine.... however be aware for the men to bring on pair of long pants cause you won't be able to get in... and that is the real thing, this is for the Italian restaurant. The sea food resta. wich is outside at night is ordinary,,,, for the American Grill we went 3 times... the margaritas are super good... the food is good also... the buffet is ok but I always try to go less cause I like rest. a la carte... during the days there are many choices of food on the beach: pizza, chicken, hot dogs , hamburger and many other foord... VERY GOOD ,,,fries etc...... We always bring our own glass like a plastic patio glass... it's bigger and our own... a lot of people do it the bartenders are use to it... The beach is not that long so we took a 25 min. walk back and forth 3 times a day. However the water sports with no motor are free and very fun... the guys are very nice and Philipps like people and is very helpful.We had a super nice trip... no it's not a 5 stars but it's a very good 4 - 4 1/2 .... don't forget you are in the south and not at home... people there don't live the same way we do,,, litlle things that might offend you are not important to them... like towels beeing late or other...so if you think those little things will heritate you... take a big 5 stars and again some people are so picky that a 10 stars would still not be good enough for them... so have a great vacation and I strongly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good Time at the Oasis Don't believe all you read . . . was freaking out after reading some of the bad reviews for the Grand Oasis - but everything turned out fine. We booked our trip thru Cheap Carribean and stayed at the Grand Oasis from August 16 - 22 - 2 adults, 3 children (16, 10, 9). Requested adjoining rooms in building 5. Rooms were old, but clean. A/C worked well in our bedroom, just so, so in kids' room so we kept adjoining door open and ceiling fans on. We left a note requesting extra towels and bottles of water and $5 daily for the maid and we received both. Beach was beautiful, but something needs to be done about the people who reserve chairs and don't show up all day. We were still able to pull some chairs together under a plam tree in the shade even in the late morning or afternoon. The lazy river was very nice and not many people used this pool. Our room looked onto the adult pool and many times saw children in it. The grounds were being cleaned up constantly - always someone raking, cleaning or picking up discarded drink glasses. Food was OK. We did not drink any of the water - which was always offered at lunch and dinner - nor did we eat too much fruit or any salad. Still 3 of us experienced a slight stomach disorder the last 2 days - could of been from the ice in drinks??? Overall, a beautiful place to visit and for $1,500 (not including air) for 6 nights all inclusive for 2 rooms and 5 people - a great deal!

<Content>OK The hotel is decent, but some parts looked run down. Most batrooms are clean, although many did not flush properly. The rooms were clean, spacious but not enough towels were provided. The staff are friendly and accomodating but tourists need to have more information about what is offered instead of searching on our own. The beach is spectacular and the pools are lovely, although there are no deeper ends of the pool due to no lifeguards. Plenty of food and drinks. The buffets are satisfactory but not enough variety. The restaurants are ok, portions are small and food was too salty for my taste. Spa services are affordable and pleasant. Entertainment was minimal, not too professional.Would I go to this particular resort again? I don't think so. I rate this experience average.

<Content>I read reviews like this but didn't listen you better!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste your time and hard earned money in this dump.The food stunk the drinks were so horrible that my friend and I went to the local grocery store to buy Grey Goose and Stoly's just so we could feel like we were drinking real alcohol and not alcohol flavored juice. I asked for premiuim brand liquor and nobody had it and don't believe that if you go there and think if you tip good your gonna get it because you will not . I went for about $700.00 in tips in one week just because i felt sorry for those poor fools and didn't get any top shelf .I got good service but I believe only because I gave a tip to everybody and their mother. The food was horrible.The activities were even worse they never tell you when there going to do something,especially for the kids. My wife even told one of the people who was in charge of activities and they did nothing. this place is not very kid friendly.Then they have these nights when they allow these vendors to come in and sell all kinds of junk. To me it was one big BEG-FEST it was very annoying.I'm from New York I know about pan-handling that's fine when your in the ghetto but not when you pay thousands of dollars to stay in a resort .They should not allow those fools in the resort. Luckily I speak spanish, but if you don't your gonna have trouble getting your point across the people that spoke spanish got better service. So if you don't pay attention to this review you deserve what you get.

<Content>Great hotel...nvm bad reviews Great hotel, very clean, huge pools, Beautiful beach, great rooms,great activities. We went with 2 families in the last week of Julyand i felt i should leave a review because the others don't do itjustice. I will start off by saying the very few negatives. On your first few days, the vendors and tour guides etc. see youur colour wristband so they knowyou just got there and are very pushy to try and sell things. There was also construction on one of the hotel blocks but the new rooms look very nice. The food wasn't amazing but it was ok. Everything else was great. The nightly shows were great. I would say about 5/7 we saw were amazing. The staff is very friendly and rooms are decent. The kids are always at the pool and fooseball tables. And lastly the beach is great. I stayed in a bavaro hotel in PC a few years ago and found the beach was a little nicer because it didn't get as deep as fast.

<Content>We hated it ! Having just returned from our most disappointing 2 weeks at the Grand Oasis resort I felt that I should warn other British holiday makers who may be thinking of going there. Avoid this place unless you speak Spanish, otherwise you will be the last to get served at the bar or noticed by the waiting -on staff. You can expect to order your drink two or three times before you actually get any service in Windows buffet style restaurant. The staff were rude and ignorant unless you flashed the cash! Infact I wondered whether the staff in the resort shop were infact mute ?!You will need to be at the beach by 6am if you expect to reserve a parasol by placing your towels on the sun loungers. We obviously relied on the shade of the palm trees, as we were on holiday and did not want to get up at the crack of dawn.This holiday was far from relaxing. My partner and I suffered sickness and diarhoea on more than 6 occasions from the poor food provided at this all-inclusive resort. Observing a rat running around inside Aqua a la carte restaurant really was the final straw as far as eating was concerned. We lived on boiled eggs and bananas after that experience ( the only safe options available) and couldn't wait to return to England.The other place you can expect to see live animals is around the pool and along the beach, where photographers use monkeys,parrots and iguanas as props to attract holiday makers to have their picture taken. We found this disgraceful and were amazed it was deemed acceptable by the hotel.Our room was basic and the decor tired. The towel rail came off the wall with the weight of a small hand towel and there was rust round the bathroom door hinges. The maid service was really lacking. We returned to find our room had not been cleaned eleven times during our fourteen night stay. Surely they had had enough times to service it between 8.30am and 5.30pm ? We will definitely not be returning to this hotel or resort again. Infact ,after this, our first impression of the dominican, we wil not be returning to the Island.The first time I have ever wanted to return home from a holiday. It was terrible to say the least.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay My family 2 adults and 2 teenagers ages 13 and 15 visited Chameleon select section of the Grand Oasis in July. The weather was wonderful-hot, sunny and no rain at all. Our flight and arrival was smooth. Finding the bus to transport us to the resort took a few minutes and getting us dropped off at the right location took a few tries. The Chameleon Select section has it's own lobby so check in went smoothly although we never received a welcome drink and the rum that we were promised in our package outline. Arriving at the front of the resort was a great disappointment-it looks terrible and we wondered what we had gotten ourselves into. Our rooms 10313 and 10314(3rd floor/has elevator but 10313 faces a wall-a better view from 10314) Asked to be changed to a room with a view but of course he said that all the rooms were full. Then we did not push so ended up in the room for the stay. Inside the room was very nice. The maids were wonderful and kept the rooms clean. The beach towels were always damp but this is to be expected with this type of climate.We enjoyed eating at the Oasis. We able to eat there for all meals if we wished. The staff got to know us so our service was great. The food at all the a la carte was good-Mare, Tex Mex/American grill and the seafood one. We easily made reservations at all the a la cartes(except the Japanese which you had to pay extra) and went to Mares 3 or 4 times for dinner. Almost everything that we ordered at the Italian restaurant was great. We ate at Windows a few times and found that it's service and food improved greatly during our stay. We found that we needed to limit the amount of fresh fruit that we ate as it made our stomachs upset but once this was realized everyone felt better.The beach restaurant was good if you are at the beach for the day(right on the ocean and served snack food). The beach was beautiful and we spent most of the time there near the entrance to the adult pool. Nikolas, the bartender at the adult pool was great along with the bartender at the main bar(he amazed me with how quickly that he can serve drinks). We got to know a few of the servers and they made us feel welcome. Some European topless but you get used to it. Some of them look quite silly when almost everyone else is walking around with tops. The shows were acceptable although we saw the less amount of shows on this vacation-nothing there to draw us back . We also hated going near the vendors that they allowed on the resort a couple of nights a week. We would try to find a path away from them as we walked through the resort.Overall we had a good, relaxing and sunny holiday. I don't know if we would go back to this resort(we usually try different places) although I am sure that we would go back to Punta Cana.

<Content>needs improvement We went to this resort knowing that we might not be staying at a 5 star resort. Overall, we liked our stay. The grounds and pools are beautiful. The activities, shows and movies are very family friendly. The food is average and needs some work. I think they could improve on their food. The specialty restaurants were wonderful, but the buffet needs some work. The dishes are chipped and the table linens sometimes need to be changed more than they were. The rooms at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana are average, but we kept asking and were moved to the Grand Oasis Bavaro. This was a very nice room that opened to the pool. The front desk staff was very nice in this respect.We did have a problem with our safe. We paid for the safe and it was broken daily and was a little frustrating. The front desk at the Bavaro did not want to hear of our problems with the safe. So if you can take a lock and lock your stuff somewhere else. The safe was our only problem with the resort.My advice is you get a nice vacation that is relaxing and pretty. Is the place perfect, no. You need to go with an open mind and just relax. Stay at the Bavaro if possible. The rooms are much better. I hope the new owner of the resort keeps the place up. With the lovely surroundings, it would be a shame to let the place slip anymore than it has.

<Content>Not what I expected We stayed on the last week of July 24-31, we are a group of friends in our middle 20's and this was our first trip to the caribbean except for cancun in mexico, so we decide to come because we got a great deal.Our room was spacious with a view to the main pool / garden area, the only problem we had was how prompt will the towels be changed.On the food you have several choices to pick from, but be sure to be early at the reservations desk, unless you are going to be in line for a while.Variety was ok at the buffet restaurant.The service at the bars is fast and you will always have a smile and good music going on the beach bar, unfortunately there are not premium drinks as for a 5 star, but if you ask for some brands you may find them behind the counter.Since we came to have a good time in the sun, we have no complains on the beach, is wide and you may always find a good spot. The beach towels are stinky, so bring your own.There are plenty of activities going on around the day and the activities staff is always friendly, they'll make sure to invite you to every activity around the clock.On the night time there's not much to do around the hotel, we didn't come to sit down for an hour and watch a show, the Disco gets boring after an hour, so we decided to take a tour to the mangoo disco, watch out! this guys will offer you anything there, from prostitutes to drugs, which is not nice when you are traveling with your girlfriend, so avoid going there.Also get away as soon as you can from the vendors from the dominican market which goes to the resort on tuesdays, they are worst than vultures, all these merchandise you can get at reasonable prices, bargaining of course, at local markets in Bavaro Plaza, get a taxi to get there.It was not a bad vacation but we expected more and better.

<Content>You get what you pay for! Our family consisted of 8 people. 2 parents and 6 young adult children ranging in age from 17 - 24. 3 girls and 3 boys. We arrived with no problems. The airport was busy as a Saturday would be and we eventually found our tranporation company. We had planned to bring golf clubs but at the end decided not to and it was a good thing there was no room in the van for them along with our luggage. (I had made arrangements ahead of time for the clubs!)The check -in at the Grand Oasis was good with the exception of a small language issue. Very few employees of the resort speak English. We had a total of 3 rooms. All 3 rooms were located on the same floor an in building 4. They were all old and needed updating but were clean. A/C did not cool very well in 1 of the 3 rooms. and the last day we had issues with the water in our bathroom.LBe advised listen carefully to all of the desk clerks instructions because you will not see them written anywhere to review later. (ie: beach towels, restaurants reservations, safe info, location of activities)Make your reservations for the specialty restaurants on your first day of vacation. You will not be able to get in and eat at those if you don't. You can only eat at each of those restaurants once during your visit. (Not explained anywhere on the web or with the travel companies) You will eat frequently at Windows with the same basic food choices each day. (Our entire group had stomach issues and so did most of the guest we spoke with. Take plenty of immodim for that situation -very expensive in shop so bring it with you) Again food was not great the best we had was in the Japanese Steak house but we had to pay extra to eat there and we were the only ones there at the 6:00 seating.Beach was lovely and pool good. Bar drinks were easy to get but taking your own large cup is helpful so you don't have to walk up from the beach so frequently. (Even for H20)Lots of misinformation on the excursions. Nothing in writing when you book with the details so when you go you are disappointed in what you get. The hotel books excursions but are more expensive than the booking agents on the beach. Same event just different prices. They also make promises that are not kept on what the excursion is really going to include. It is an adventure no matter what you do because of the unorganization!Snorkling is non-existance at the resort so you will have to pay to get to a location where there are fish and coral reef to see. Pretty good once you get there but Jamaica and Mexico are better.Lastly take snack food with you. You will want it. Chips, Candy Bars, breakfast bars, etc. It will help when you don't feel well and it will also get your system back to normal. Overall we had a good time. Language barrier was hard because the shows were in spanish, lessons in spanish, dealers in the casino were not English speaking. The vendors were obnoxious you could not walk through the resort without them truly begging you to buy something.  The rules and the way they had things organized were stressful and not very relaxing for us as guest. We were always trying to find out something because nothing is written out for you to know when / where / how things worked.Side Note: Not the resort's fault but the entire island's transportation shut down (went on strike )from 6 am - 12 pm the day we left. So we had to check out of the hotel at 3 am catch a cab to the airport with all the other Dominican guest that went on vacation from Saturday to Saturday. What an experience.....good for the story though!I truly would not recommend this resort to anyone unless money is an issue and you want a vacation in the tropics. Then go, be prepared and enjoy the sun, beach, pool and drinks otherwise spend a little more and go where you are treated like a guest who is valued.

<Content>African American My sister and I went to Punta Cana July 23 - July 30, 200 from Chicago with Apple Vacations. We chose this time because it better suited her work schedule.Pre-Planning: I read a lot of reviews from this and other sites as well as talked with friends and co-workers about the destination. I was told that Punta Cana was a better location that Puerto Vallarta. After carefully reading all reviews, I decided that this was the better location and the resort appeared to have positives and negatives but overall it had everything that I was looking for --- food, entertainment, spa, pool, premium drinks (as I was told by my travel agent).Departure Flight: The flight was as 6:00 AM and was on time and comfortable. Of course with the economy considerations only beverages were included. There was a crying toddler on board who cried for at least 45 minutes. Sat in Row 10 --- seats would not recline (USA 3000).Check-In/Arrival: Check-in was fast and efficient, or at least I thought so. Fatima was very friendly and I asked for a room in the newer building 7, 8, 9, and 10 as I knew these were the better building from reading prior reviews. We were given a junior suite in building 7. I tipped her $10 --- but later found out that I did not have to since all Apple Vacationers were upgraded.Room: The room was clean with a king size bed, Jacuzzi, balcony, and separate shower. Closet and drawer space was huge. The room did have a smell --- like the beach 鈥?seaweed but I was expecting that from reading the reviews. Three days we had a towel swan with different flowers but I think that鈥檚 because we did not use those towels to mess up the decoration. There was a fan made out of Kleenex and another in toilet issue. We always had clean towels. The sheets were damp at least on two nights. I noticed that I brought paper work with me and left it on the desk and it was damp on day 3 鈥?so it must be the moisture and being near the beach and pool. Tipped the maid service (Esperanza Carpoi) daily (5, 4, 3 dollars) and we had extra water, soda, and beer. Although, she was off a few days and we didn鈥檛 get extra from the other maid until I asked her.Food: We at lunch and dinner at Window on the first day and made our reservations to the other 4 restaurants. Windows buffet, the food was not appetizing, and food was warm unless you got it from the chefs who were grilling. The fruit was bland and tasted spoiled. Breakfast was the most tasteful with omelets. Some of the chairs would be wet because people came from the pool or beach. Beverage staff was attentive and prompt except with the decaffeinated coffee (instant 鈥?they could never find the container). Food also appeared to be recycled. Ate once or twice at the Beach Garden and the food was about the same. The best food was at Mare Restaurant (Beef Tenderloin) was delicious and my sister had the seafood entr茅e 鈥?which was also good. Bad service at Aqua 鈥?had Beef tips and asked for well done 鈥?I had to send it back because it was too red. The second time it was still red. The American Grill was okay the salsa and chips were good and well as the waiters. DeMario restaurant was okay 鈥?I had the chicken fettuccini and my sis had Lasagna. The lasagna was good. Hot dogs at the snack bar didn鈥檛 taste like hot dogs. We ate just enough to sustain. Couldn鈥檛 wait to get back home for real food. I also tipped at several of the restaurants because of their friendliness and good service.Bars: The bar service was good and fast. I was disappointed that no premium drinks were available. We wanted Jack Daniels. The main bar did have Absolute vodka but only after I asked. Of course it was hidden behind the bar unseen to the public eye. The bar in the theatre did appear to have at least 5 premium brands. We mostly had beer 鈥?which was okay. We did pay one of the guys on the beach $30 to purchase us Jack Daniels --- It still did not taste like that in the USA. Of course we over paid because on the return we found that it was $17.00 in the Duty Free Shop.Entertainment: We didn鈥檛 participate in much entertainment when we found out where it was located. We missed the manager鈥檚 party because of the time difference. We went to the disco for 3 minutes 鈥?it was dull and few people. We went to the theatre for the Michael Jackson Show and the production and special effects by the entertainment staff were good but the audio was bad. We left before it was over. We saw one movie 鈥?Spider Man but the 2 entertainment staff members were in the back talking so loud and they had to be asked TWICE to be quiet but they kept talking. If you go to the theatre, then use insect repellent. Also, all of the activities are communicated in Spanish.Spa: We had the combination massage and it was great. That was one of the enjoyable experiences of the trip.Activities/Excursions: We did the glass bottom boat and snorkeling with Fruitti Tutti on the beach. Alex was nice and friendly but the boat glass was dirty. Neither my sister nor I can swim but other people on the boat were helpful and could speak English and Spanish. We have gone snorkel several times on different vacations but always with a friend that could swim --- she didn鈥檛 go with us. My sister enjoyed the snorkeling. Wanted to do the horseback riding but we didn鈥檛. We walked up the beach 3 nights after dinner to Natura Park Resort. We saw the Flamingos and geese and walked back. When looking at the map on the internet if appears as though you can walk up the beach to the various resorts but I don鈥檛 think so. Did take the free bus to Palma Real Shopping mall --- bought a necklace and cigars. We left at4:10 and driver said he would be back at 6:00 for pickup --- He did come back at 6:00 but then said that he was coming back at 7:00 pm to pick us up. Again, the language.Disappointments: Lack of premium drinks was disappointment. The check in staff should have included a listing of all of the daily activities in the check in package. We had to keep going back to the service desk to ask were the activities were and when they were occurring. Domingo at guest service printed me c copy of the activities after I asked. Although, they do have an activity board posting and posting in some of the walk ways. I guess I鈥檓 used to cruises were we get daily iternaries. I did not know about the free bus to go shopping until I heard someone else asking about it. A lot of this information should be distributed to you during check in. The food was bad except Mare restaurant. There were no ice machines in each building ---- had to go to the main bar 鈥?with the sun beating down on our heads to get it. The Lounge in building 7 was nice but I didn鈥檛 know it was available for use ---. Sometimes the door would be locked and the maids didn鈥檛 speak English --- I key has to be activated at the check in desk. They activated my key to the Lounge on one day and the next day it was deactivated. Then I went to get it activated again and they activated the Lounge but deactivate my room. The computer has free internet access but there as a virus on it the last 3 days and no one fixed it. DON鈥橳 GO THE TO MINI MARKET store up the street from the resort. I go Doritos and Chips for $11.00. The shops and huts at the resorts are expensive and they are expensive. The vendors that come on Tuesday and Thursday were very rude. All of them had the same items for sell. We were buying things from them and having a good time. I knew to bargain for a good price from the reviews (thank you all). One Tuesday, one of the vendors called my sister A CHEAP AMERICAN. He wanted to sell my sister 2 piece of DR jewelry for $85. I told him that was too much and that we could buy gold for that! When I later confronted him, he admitted to saying it and wanted to forcefully push me with his body. He then called me the N-WORD. I told him that I was going to complain to the manager, he said the manager wouldn鈥檛 do anything because he鈥檚 Dominican. When I returned 3 minutes later with the manager, the man was gone and his friends at his table were trying to cover for him. They offered my sister a free cheap bracelet to make amends. One Dominican at the cigar table was helpful and stepped up to explain the situation and apologized although he didn鈥檛 do it. But again they were talking in Spanish first and then to me in English --- so who knows!!!!Recommendations for African Americans: It鈥檚 a nice place to visit. The resort was nice considering all of the above comments. If you don鈥檛 like the hot sun and a lot of water sports -- then it鈥檚 not the place to offer other activities to keep you busy. We went to the pool and beach at least 4 days but the heat was getting to us. The activities were around the main pool where it鈥檚 very HOT. I was looking forward to some of the activities but again it took me a while to find them and then it was hot. Not too many people were participating. We tipped graciously although tips were included in our package. But to be called a racial slur was TOO MUCH. It appears as though the resorts are profiting while the residents are suffering. Also, brush up on Spanish or take a couple of classes. I plan too! Most everyone speaks Spanish and it鈥檚 most difficult to communicate. They did have some staff that spoke English and some just spoke it a little. I was getting tired of saying 鈥?NO COMPREHENDE鈥? My sister was a great help because she new some of what they were saying. It鈥檚 a good place to relax, be with family or for couples. Would I go again? Probably not to this resort but maybe with my boyfriend or a group of friends but never in JULY!Return Flight: I was glad to be returning home! I went for 7 days and was ready to leave in 5 days. Flight was on time and uneventful. It was supposed to be non-stop but we were told that we had to stop in Florida to refuel because gas prices in DR were $5.11 a gallon. Immigration and Customs were a nightmare. We had to wait in the line for over an hour. It鈥檚 good to be back home!Thanks to all TripAdvisor reviewers for your comments/reviews!

<Content>Would not recommend to anyone The arrival was smooth, got to our rooms quickly and then the horror began. We were with 6, 3 couples each in seperate rooms. I think after 5 minutes in our rooms we were already back out asking each other if their room was just as bad. In 1 room the airco didn't work, the bed was broken. In the others the door off the dressing closet fell off and in room nr 3 the door jammed so bad you had to force yourself to get inside. Bathrooms were very outdated and rust everywhere. Also in the block on the opposite side off the road they were upgrading the rooms so you could hear construction works going on all day. Complaining at the front desk didn't work so the next day our travel agent had to arrange new rooms which luckely enough were not 20 years old.In the restaurants the personnel hardly speaks english and the service is terrible. Mistakes in drinks ordered, tables not fully decked out so you had to take knives or forks from other tables to make yours complete. Asking for coffee resulted in a 10 minute wait which made you think they forgot. If you arrived a bit late for breakfast a lot off tables were dirty so you had to scrape together clean stuff from different tables to make your own, the staff just didn't know what to do, food on the floor was not picked up, we watched 9 waiters walk by a pizza on the floor before someone finally picked it up.Every 2 days a complete market was setup around the swimming pool with salesmen pulling your arms and really annoying you when you just wanted to get a drink from the bar. Bartenders were unfriendly and they just looked like they hated their job. Toilets beside the pool were horrible, in the men's room from the 6 toilets 5 were just filled with fecies, like they were not cleaned in weeks. We went to our rooms every time we needed to go. It seems since the name changed from Sunscape to Grand Oasis everything started to go wrong.We just got home yesterday 29/07/2008 and I had the worst holiday in more then 10 years, money not wel spent.

<Content>A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE! Wow! Where should I begin? From the moment my husband and I walked into the lobby we knew our trip was going to be a nightmare! First of all, the check in process was terrible, the staff at the front desk hardly spoke English and was unable to answer many of our questions. To top it off, the lobby isnt air conditioned...which makes matters 10 times worse when it's already 100 degrees outside! The rooms are TERRIBLE, we had to switch rooms twice! Cracked, dirty walls surrounded us, and besides our room smelling absolutely HORRIFIC, we were welcomed by spiders and ants which when we called to complain the staff offered to spray the room with pesticide? Being 4 months pregant I dont think that would have been such a smart idea. The second room was slightly better, being that it was on the 3rd floor rather than the 1st, it smelled better and was insect free. However, the ceiling was made out of wood with big cracks, so who knows how insect free it truely is. Showering is another issue. The water comes and goes and to top it off IT STINKS!!!!!! So you get out smelling worse than when you go in. The beds are completely uncomfortable, no box spring, just a mattress on a wooden platform. Oh, and dont bother calling for wake up calls.....you never get them!The outside grounds are pretty and kept very clean. The pools are ok also, only 4ft deep though. The food is completely DISGUSTING! The flies however dont seem to think so! FLIES EVERYWHERE!!!!!! Making reservations for the restaurants was a disaster unless you spoke Spanish, then that's when they had whatever time you rquested. On the whole, our 5 days in Punta Cana were a nightmare. Starting with the disappointing 5-star hotel and ending with each one of us getting horrible stomach viruses because of the food/drinks! This was definitely an experience I will NEVER forget! The list of problems could go on and on, but I think by now you get the hint. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!

<Content>Superb Holiday Having just returned from this hotel I thought I would help settle peoples nerves.After reading bad reviews about this hotel our group were a little worried about what it was going to be like... There is no need to worry.We had very quick transfer to the Hotel there was only our group so no other stops on the way... GREAT!On arrival Staff welcomed us, took our cases and we made our way to check in. We were given our keys and also given a cocktail with RUM in LOVELY!!On our first day we had a storm. So we just sat around and had a few drinks. Our rooms were cleaned every day and we were given fresh towels. We left a tip for the maids in a beer can and we were given a six pack of beer instead of the usual 2 cans, so if you wan more beers you know what to do!The food was gorgreous there was a different theme each night of the week in the main buffet, and the al la carte's were all very VERY tasty. The only fault we could make was that we had to wait a long time at the Tex Mex... Maybe we are just greedy.All the drinks were lovely, you could get pretty much anything you want. The beach bar was great at a night time and it was open 24 hrs if you felt like staying up late.But the best bit was the adult only pool... Apart from a couple of kids now and again (who were always cleared out of the pool) it was heaven. Lots of peace and quite. A jacuzzi. Waiter service from Nikolas... give him some tips as he works hard.All in all I had a brilliant holiday.

<Content>Okay, but two deal breakers for considering revisiting exist The resort was beautiful, the entertainment was great, the food and drinks were a plenty and very good. But there were two things that nearly spoiled the trip for me. 1)The housekeeping was horrible. I had to beg for wash cloths. The towels were dingy with holes and the tub didn't really look very clean either. Also, housekeeping entered my room even with the do not disturb notice on the door.2)The customer service at the front desk sucked!!!! Roberto, the supervisor and Juan Carlos were very dismissive and rude. They are the main reason I won't go back.

<Content>NOT an Oasis....more like mucho aggravation I stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana with three of my friends from 07.05.08 - 07.10.08 and found it to be highly unsatisfactory on many levels. We booked with CheapCaribbean because my friends had used the site last year for a trip to Punta Cana and spoke so highly of the service. We thought that the 3 1/2 star resort we chose would surely provide excellent service if it was backed by CheapCaribbean. Upon arriving to our rooms, my friends and I discovered the couch that belonged in my room was on the balcony. We soon discovered why it had been moved outside. It smelled horrible. No alarm clock was provided, as you were told to pay for a wake up call instead. There was no dresser in the room. I specifically requested a King sized bed, but when we checked in, I was told I would have 2 Queens instead. When I actually got to the room, I saw 2 full-sized beds. My friend got an eye infection the first morning we were there. I called down to reception and spoke to Juan who told me there was no medic available in the resort and I would have to take a taxi to the hospital if my friend needed to be seen. Rather than travel through a dangerous and unknown area, we decided to try warm compresses and see if it would help. That was when we discovered there was no hot water in either mine or my friends' rooms. We had to run water through the mini coffee maker in our room to get warm compresses. The next day I spoke to Lourdes, our Turinter travel guide, and she arranged to have my friend driven (In the resort's golfcart) to the next resort to be seen by their medic. Why hadn't this been arranged for us from the start? I was told I had to get a taxi to the hospital. After my friend was seen by the medic, she was made to wait 40 minutes to be picked back up. We found the bartenders to be rude, and most of the staff unwilling to step up and help without the incentive of money. Was this NOT an all-inclusive? Why do I feel like my money is the only thing that will get me some decent service?! Our room was cleaned, but fresh towels were never left. We called down to reception and they stated they would have someone bring us towels. They never showed up. The next morning I walked down to reception and asked for towels in person, only to be told the same story...someone will bring them to me. My friend finally had to track down a maid's cart and take some towels herself! Attempting to eat was another journey. The food was terrible at Windows, the buffet. It was the only restaurant that did not require reservations. And since Lourdes never informed us that we needed to make reservations 2 days prior, and only between certain times, we had to eat at Windows alot. The ice cream at Windows tasted like chemicals. The eggs were very very runny. The only thing that was consistently good was the pasta. We did manage to get 2 restaurant reservations during our stay, and watched as a family of four walked in stating they had no reservations and were seated immediately. Why was I told I could not make reservations for this very restaurant the day before? Both times we had reservations, the place was almost empty. I don't get it. The other place that had food we liked was Beach Gardens. The only problem was, it was almost never open. On several occasions my friends and I stood staring at the restaurant hours, yet there was no one inside during those hours. We were baffled that this place simply didn't comply with ANY set schedule, no less the one posted on their doors. Just getting a beach towel was a hassle. We had to walk around to find a tiny hut in a corner of the resort I didn't know existed. When we got there we were told there were no clean towels. I walked all the way to reception only to be told to go back to the hut and they now have 4 towels waiting for us. Just tell them Juan Carlo sent you. Do I need to KNOW someone to get a beach towel? Again, I don't get it. Unfortunately for us, it didn't stop there. The guide Turinter provided us with was anything but knowledgable, helpful, or even reachable. We spent an entire morning/afternoon trying to track down Lourdes to book an excursion. The first time in the travel room we were told she was downstairs in a meeting. We came back and were informed that Lourdes came back and was told we were looking for her, but has now gone to lunch. After an hour, we also decided to have a late lunch. We ate quickly and went back only to be told that Lourdes had left for the day. Worst of all, on the day we were leaving, she gave us the wrong time to meet the Turinter bus (also already paid for) that would take us back to the airport. When we arrived, we were told the bus already left and were not offered assistance. We explained that our guide had given us a time of 2:20pm and were told it should have been 2pm and it was our problem. Finally, we were told another bus would take us. Thankfully, we say goodbye and leave the resort. Upon arriving at the airport, the driver asks us for $30. At no point were we told we would have to pay this man. We thought they were providing us with transportation to make up for the fact that the guide got us stuck with no way to the airport. I had booked airport transfers to avoid this very issue. Overall, this trip was more of a hassle than a vacation. I've never gone all-inclusive before and have been told it is wonderful. I may try it again, but never with CheapCaribbean. And NEVER at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana.

<Content>Grand Oasis Disaster We have arrived to what is supposed to be a 5 star hotel but  found it to be more like 2. Here is why:1. The first room we got into smelled like PP all the time no matter how much it was cleaned. Later I found out that the sewer system was about 200 feet away from the room.2. The food is not great and there is no variety.3. The specialty restaurants are not good and if you'd like dinner at the Japanese, you need to pay extra $15 per adult.4. The minibar in the room has some cheap drinks that are included and the rest are to be paid for.5. Once we transfer to a presidential suit, the room was clean and smelled good but there were bed bugs that you couldn't see but left marks on your skin.6. The Italian restaurant was so bad that both of my kids got sick and vomitted all night long.DO NOT STEP IN PUNTA CANA!2 good ponts:NICE GROUNDS AND BEACHGOOD ENTERTAINMENT.

<Content>Poor upkeep Maintanance and upkeep of the hotel is terrible. The property was sold to us as a 5 star hotel by the tour operator, Sunwing Holidays, but the only thing that was 5 star in the hotel was the size of the rooms. All rooms on the main floor were very moldy. The mold most likely lives in the air conditioning. I had to change rooms twice and although the smell in the last room I stayed at was not as bad as in the previous ones, I could not spend any time in my room, only when I had to go to sleep. Returning home I had to wash all my clothes three times, even those ones I did not wear at the hotel. Most of my clothes still smell bad of mold. Mold is very unhealthy and toxic, it can cause bad migraines or serious lung problems mimicking Tuberculosis, etcWe were not allowed to put our wet bathing suites on the balcony to dry them, we had to leave them in our cold air conditioned rooms. Of course they could not get dry inside the room, they just simply soaked in more mold. It was impossible to adjust the cooling of the air conditioner, so it was either very cold or too hot when we turned it offI asked guest services at the hotel to clean the air conditioning in my room, I do not know if they did it or not, the smell of mold was still prevalent when I checked out.I spoke to guests staying on higher floors, They did not have mold but they lacked water pressure in their room, they could not take showers.I found live cockroaches running around in the bathroomFood was mediocre but the selection was good at the buffet. We were allowed to have dinner 4 times in different restaurants within the resort. 2 of these restaurants were bad. I can recommend only the American Grill or the Di Mario restaurants where the food selection was limited but the servings were tastier than in the main restaurant serving buffet food. Do not eat desert at any of these restaurants though. 90 % of the food is imported, the deserts tasted like card board freshly taken out of the freezer. The worst restaurant is the Aqua which was supposed to serve new, innovative food. Instead, they served stale, dry Italian Focaccia bread, untoasted with a thin slice of cheese and a bite of Prischiuto as one of the 3 entrees on the menu. It was obvious that their chef has never been in Italy There is lots of food going to waste at the buffet (Window) restaurant. After each meal all the untouched buffet food is thrown into the garbage even though the country is very poor with many people starving on the island. The beach is nice but for some reason they cut most of the branches of the palm trees, so there is hardly any shade. I had to get up at 6 a.m. on my vacation every morning to secure lawn chairs with umbrellas on the beach. Do not go to this property in July and August. Since the hotel is owned by a Spanish hotel chain, most guest were from Spain as Europeans take family vacations in July and August. While there were very limited number of people from English speaking countries, they had huge Spanish families. The hotel is catering to kids. There is not much adult entertainment and with the exception of the front office, the staff does not speak English. It was surprising that the host of the evening entertainment program did not speak English either. I have been at other resorts, even 3 star ones in the Dominican Republic where they had much better entertainment and many more bilingual staff.Drink selection was good, they even served imported wine and other alcohol. Landscaping was nice, although during the period I stayed at the hotel there was construction going on at the middle of the resort as well as at the next door hotel. It was impossible to enjoy quiet time on the beach due to the construction noise from both directions

<Content>Lovely hotel and a fabulous holiday ! We've just returned from a two week holiday to this resort on Monday and I felt compelled to write a review to say what a brilliant place this is, after reading so many negative reviews before we went. When we first booked I was seriously concerned after reading review after review slagging off this resort and was starting to get nervous about it. My concerns were soon laid to rest and franky we spent the rest of the holiday questioning the sanity of the people who posted the negative comments !!!The rooms were a little dated, but were clean and comfortable with fresh towels and maid service daily and our mini bar stocked regularly. If we wanted more water or beer we just asked and got it no problem. Food and drink was of a high standard and was plentiful ! You can eat and drink 24 hours if you feel like it! The main buffet resturant 'windows' was varied and themed each night. Mexican being a favorite of ours and there was always a station doing fresh pasta to your specification. Lunch was either Windows or the Beach Bar, the beach doing pasta, fish, chicken, salad, fruits and ice cream etc. And a stall on the beach front did burgers, southern fried chicken, hotdogs, fries and some lovely slices of pizza. Breakfast was also good with loads of choice, we especially enjoyed the omlettes made to order.The A la Carte resturants were a really high standard although service in the Tex Mex was slow it was still enjoyable. But Di Marios (italian) and Aqua were both amazing all our meals were so nice we all wish we had ordered what the other had ! We also visited Le Mare which specialised in fish. We didn't visit the Japanese resturant but heard some good reports and wish we had.The bar by the main pool was open until 12.00 and if you sit on the terrace above you get a lovely breeze which was nice on the evenings, the beach bar was open 24 hours and did snacks like ham and cheese toasties and chips until the early hours and was a really peaceful relaxed place to spend the evening.There is a piano bar in the main lobby (which is a karoke bar) was a good laugh, although we only discovered it in our last night after befriending two American couples. The barman held the bar open long after closing and drank shots with us.There is also a 'disco' called sneakers which we never went in after peering through a window and hearing what sounded like german techno and seeing people with their shirts off !!!!The main theatre shows movies for the kids early evening and after is a kids disco, this is were they held the main entertainment however we didn't really bother with it.The beer was good (presidente) and there was plenty of rum and other spirts as well as some good cocktails, the bananamama (made with 151 rum) being a favourite in our group. The wine wasn't the best I have had, but was drinkable.We spent most days by the adult pool which was lovely and quiet and you didn't have to worry about children dive bombing you ! The main pool looked good, and was a good size with a swim up bar but was quite packed and noisy. The adult pool was a little oasis if you wanted to chill in the sun with a book and a beer ! It has its own little bar ran by Nicolas who will tell you he is numero uno bar man in the dominican republic, and he isn't lying. Although he mostly runs it single handed he still finds time to serve at the bar and run around the pool taking orders and bringing your drink to you. Often bringing drinks without orders, just when he see's your empty ! He also make the best bananamamas.We did four trips Saona, Monster Truck, Tropical Sunset and Reef Explorer all of which were brilliant and highly recommended. If you do Monster Truck take some present for the kids, if we go back we plan to fill our hand luggage with childrens shoes and clothes as they have so little.If you do fancy a change from the hotel your only a $20 taxi ride form a very nice shopping centre that has a few bars and resturants. My partner and myself went to the Hard Rock Cafe had a great meal, desert and drinks (including 2 cocktails where we got to keep logo-ed hurricane glasses) and it only cost $110 (about 拢55) and we had a brilliant night.All in all this was a brilliant trip and we couldn't have asked for a better holiday, and we really can not understand how anyone could find this anything other than brilliant. We went as a group of 2 couples aged ranging 21-31 and couldn't fault it, I would go back in a shot. The only change I would make would be to learn some spanish as many of the staff struggle with basic english, and I felt really ignorant that I couldn't converse with them.

<Content>Nothing grand about this place The service at this resort was terrible. Day 1 we had to wait on a 45min line to book reservations for dinner for 4 nights, which is included in the package deal. They can only fit us in for 2 nights which means its buffet meals all the time which was very untasteful. They also stressed we needed a reservation but when we finally went on day 3 with a reservation, a family of 4 had no reservations and they got seated as well. Then we requested towels for our rooms which never showed up even when I called mutiple times. I was forced to then track down a maid's cart and grab them myself. All the eaterys in this place open and close as they please so sometimes we had to wait to eat which was a big inconvience for us. We went to the beach to get our beach towels only to find out they were out of them. I then had to walk all the way back to the lobby to complain only to have him tell me to go back to the beach to get them. How did they all of sudden show up now? There was no medic or doctor on the resort because of renovations so when my friend got sick she had to go to the next resort, they left her there for 45mins waiting for a ride back. To top everything off they told us the wrong time for our pick-up back to the airport. The shuttle which is included in our package and paid form left us. I tell one of the staff members only to be told it's my problem, not theirs. He then sends us to another shuttle for a ride, but when we arrived he charged us $30. Price was never spoken about and at this point all I want is to be home. We paided him and finally left the resort with the worst service ever. Lack of care for their customers was appalling. I used cheapcarribean.com and I'm really surprised at them for representing them. I will be contacting them as well.

<Content>EXCELLENT! Just returned from this hotel a couple hours ago and just wanted to come on here and say all the bad reviews must be for a different hotel as myself and the rest of my party found absolutely nothing to complain about during our two week stay.We stayed in block 5 on the ground floor which had a perfect location - in the centre of everything, but far enough away from Sneakers disco so we couldn't hear it at night. The rooms themselves could do with a lick of paint here and there but overall they do the job for the amount of time you spend in the room. Maid service everyday, fresh towels everyday, bed linen changed every couple days. We had 4 cockroaches in the room over the course of two weeks which is nothing really. Bathroom is simple and could do with updating, but our shower worked and was nice and hot so no complaints. The food in the resort was extremely varied and all very high quality. Windows the main buffet restaurant has a different theme night every night (Spanish, Dominican, Italian, Gala, Beach Party, Mexican and International) and the food within each theme is so varied - how anyone can not find something they like is beyond me. Every night there is a pasta station with various types of pasta and sauces - all delicious and freshly cooked in front of you. Breakfast is again a buffet, containing various breads and cold meats, cereals, hot items such as eggs, bacon, sausage as well as cakes, muffins, doughnuts etc. You can also create your own omlette which is made to your liking - very tasty!Beach restaurant offered more of a snack based service - rice, salads, cold pasta, chips etc. With a snack bar just outside cooking fresh burgers and hot dogs - just be careful to check your burger is cooked thoroughly before you eat it.We visited 4 of the 5 a la carte restaurants and enjoyed them all.Aqua (the main restaurant for the Bavaro Suites) is amazing! I swear that my meal there was the nicest meal I've ever had, not just on the holiday but in my whole life!D'Mario's Italians was really nice too, good range of pastas and pizzas as well as several types of meat. We visited there twice as we enjoyed it so much. On our second visit we found the service quite slow but not slow enough to make a complaint.The Tex-Mex American Grill was also an enjoyable night however the service in there was extremely slow, it took us over two hours to eat our 3 courses. The food however was very enjoyable, with a wide variety of choice.The fish restaurant on the beach side was also enjoyable, they have a great range of fish available but also a non-fish meat for those who don't enjoy seafod. Yes you do have to pay extra for lobster but there is so many other choices to select from that there is no reason to bring this up as an issue.The bars are scattered right through the resort, you're never too far away from the rum and cocktails. We spent most of our nights either at the beach side bar or the backstage bar, where they have quite an extensive cocktail menu that they can customise for you (change Rum for Vodka etc.). Every night there is a different show in the theatre, we only saw one (The Micheal Jackson show) which was really good and entertaining. We used two of the resort's pools - the main one and the adult pool. We found the main pool extremely loud and busy so we found the adult pool a fantasic haven - this is not a negative of the main pool it simply wasn't what we were looking for, but it would be great for fun loving families and children. The adult pool was perfect for us, we were able to lounge by the pool on sunbeds which were always readily available as the area was so quiet. There was often some kids who invaded the pool but staff were quick to remove them. The adult pool bar is where we found our favourite staff member Nicholas - he is amazing and deserves a pay rise! He brought us drinks in and around the pool without even having to be asked, we just kept tipping him a few dollars every day and we seemed to become his favourite customers!As for excursions I highly recommend every trip we went on; Tropical Sunset, Reef Explorer (it's about 30ft away from the hotel, not travel necessary!), Saona Island and the Monster Truck Safari. If you do go on the Monster Trucks take some gifts for the children of the DR and Haiti as they come up to the truck and you visit a school. Many people on our trip simply took the hotel's toiletries and the children loved it - it's a very eye opening trip! A few times a week some vendors come into the resort and set up stalls throughout the site. It is a little annoying but it's also quite fun and interesting. They sell all DR produce - Rum, Cigars, paintings, jewellery, clothes, ornaments etc. and and definitely flexible on their prices so always haggle! Some give you free gifts just for looking. It's good to compare rock bottom prices with the stall vendors and the shops within the resort as there is often a severe price difference.One tip I would give for anyone visiting this hotel would be to take effective insect repellent. I came away from the resort with a very high number of mosquito bites, mostly on my ankles and feet. We were told when we arrived that you can purchase insect repellent patches (similar to a nicotine patch) that I would definitely buy if I returned to the DR.Overall I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, we had an amazing holiday and I'm sure you would to if you went.

<Content>VERY NICE but... A group of 6 of us went to the Grand Oasis between July 5th and July 12th from London Ontario and we had a great time. The beach and grounds were amazing. The food was actually pretty good even though by the end I was getting sick of it. WINDOWS had a big selection but some of it wasnt to good. I guess it depended on the night.One problem we found was the swim up bar servers were miserable and it attached to the kids pool. We wished there was a swim up bar for the adult pool even though our server Nicholas was excellent. Also on occasion there were kids in the adult pool which was annoying abnd awkward because thats where the topless girls go. AQUA and AMERICAN GRILL were both okay but Damario was actually very good. Overall the food didnt make me sick so I was happyOur maid service was okay but remember to tip because the one time we forgot we got bad service!!!! All in all we enjoyed ourselves and I would probably return if I got the right price. Like I said the beach was amazing and the grounds were amazing but a few things here and there could have been better.

<Content>You get what you pay for! We just returned from a 7 night stay at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana. This was our 5th trip to Punta Cana and our 1st to the Grand Oasis Punta Cana. We have always stayed at the Barcelo complex at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace, which is a true 5 STAR resort. I had read the reviews of the Grand Oasis and they were mixed review of people who love it and hated it - so after speaking with our travel agent at MKTravel - she highly recommended it, so we went for it. Our experience just like some of the other reviews I've read, are mixed. First we were put in a room in building 5 on the 3rd floor. We immediately complained as there are no elevators and we were a group of 10 in 3 separate rooms with kids, older people, etc... They moved us to building 4 on the 1st floor, we were happy, but when we went into the room we did not like the smell - to make a long story short, we complained and complained at the lobby, as supposedly, we had requested a room in building 7, but were told that we had to pay extra for that. The next day, we received a call from the manager at the reception area and she told us that she was going to upgrade us to rooms on the 1st floor at the Bavaro Suites. Now, that was A NICE ROOM!!!! We were on building #11, it was absolutely the best!!! The food was great at all of the a la carte restaurants, the buffet Windows was good, but they need more variety. The only thing that really upset us with the food was the fact that there is NO LOBSTER unless you pay $25.00 per pound for it - and this is SUPPOSE TO BE ALL INCLUSIVE. We ate shrimp, but they were not available all the time. Other than that, the food was good. The service could have been better. I think the entire resort in under staffed, so the few employees they do have are over worked and under paid, so they aren't as happy as they should be. As far as bugs and stuff, we did not see any - everything was pretty clean. The hotel is still undergoing some remodeling, but you don't see it unless you go to the actual building that they are remodeling. The entertainment was absolutely great, they do a very nice and fun beach party once a week, great disco, excellent shows at the theater, etc... If you have never been to a 5 star resort and you are taken to this one, you will love it. Now, if you have been to a 5 star resort and then go here, you will see the difference. You get what you pay for. We wanted to save some money and went here, therefore, like the saying says, you get what you pay for. Will we go to the Grand Oasis again - probably not just because we have like other resorts better - but for the price we paid, it was great!We are from Miami, Florida

<Content>Not so great! We stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana for our annual vacation. When we got to the hotel we were surprised to see how different it looked from the online pictures I had seen a hundred times. Those online pictures must've been taken 20 years ago. They told us the hotel had been recently remodeled, but guess what, only part of it has been. It鈥檚 still under construction. The facilities have still not been remodeled. The hotel is pretty old and needs heavy maintenance. The pool had mold and the water was not so clear. The childrens pool was the size of a bathtub and it didn鈥檛 look so clean. The floors throughout the pool deck were cracked, and the reception looked nothing like in the pictures. Even the bridge that goes over the pool looked way different than I had seen in pictures. We booked 2 rooms, one for my husband, the baby, and me; and the other one for my parents. We were given 2 rooms on the 3rd floor, (no elevators by the way!!). The railings at the balcony were so huge that a 3 yr old child could fit between them. We have a 1 yr old baby, so we asked to be moved to the 1st floor to avoid any accidents. Our rooms SUCKED. There was no water in the shower; no air conditioning and it had various leaks from the ceiling. When we asked to be changed to another hotel, our travel agent asked me to wait until the next day and they will change us to new rooms. We were changed to the new rooms, but I found 2 huge roaches in my room, and my parent's room smelled really bad. The safe was not included, and we had to pay $18.00 dollars to rent one. I鈥檝e been to hotels in Vegas, Cancun, Punta Cana, various cruises, and I never had to pay for the safe before. I found this very awkward. Our room mini bar had many snacks, but you had to buy them separate. Their 鈥渁ll inclusive package鈥?only included 2 drinks and 2 beers, everything else was separate.The food was not so great. The buffet restaurant is equipped for air conditioning, but it was very hot in there. We literally sweat when while we were eating. There was no lobster included in our 鈥淎ll inclusive Package鈥? If you wanted to eat lobster, you had to pay $25.00 per lb. I have been to Punta Cana 4 times and it was never like this before. I always stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace Hotel where everything is included except for the tours. The beach was good, but I've seen better at the Barcelo Palace Hotel. The people were really nice at the Grand Oasis, can't compliant about that. We had a good time after all, but I will not go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great Time...... My wife and I stayed at the Grand from July 28th-July 5th.....We had a great time. I really dont have many complaints at all. The flight there was fine, as well as getting through the airport. I think it took 20mins to get through the airport, and another 20 to get to the resort. CHECK IN: We arrived about 1120am. We were told our room wouldnt be done until 3pm. I asked Roberto to help me out, and he was able to get it done by 1pm. The front desk staff was great. ROOM: I had a Master Jr Suite building 7. I wanted a beach view got had a room on the first floor, which walked right out to the lazy river. It was the nicest hotel room I've ever been in. Kind of had a mildew smell, but whatever, nothing to bad. A little mildew smell went away when you walked out and seen the beautiful beach. Oh yeah it didnt bother me after about 4 hours of drinking the President...LOL Food: I could find something to eat everywhere we went. It wasnt the best food I've ever had but it wasnt bad. WINDOWS has a good selection but it's a buffet, dont expect mouth watering food. I wouldnt suggest the Japanese. It wasnt horrible, but it wasnt great. The steak was real good, but everything else, was so so.... DIMARIOS was very good. Not authentic italian, but your in the DR. It was very good. AMERICAN GRILL was very good as well. I didnt try AQUA, heard it wasnt that good. We also did not try MARE. I passed out after being at the ADULT POOL drinking with my ST LOUIS friends..... Just remember you are going to the DR, if your expecting the best food you have ever had, stay home......BARS: My Favorite place in the resort was the ADULT POOL. NICHOLAS is the best bar tender I've EVER HAD, even in the State. I tipped him 2 dollars after the second beer he brought to the pool for me, and I never had an empty glass. He was responsible for me missing dinner reservations...HA HA HA. The pool bar was nice, but there were to many kids floating around and I felt weird drinking around a bunch of kids. I would suggest the adult pool, except Tuesdays. NICHOLAS is OFF..... The bar behind the Pool Bar, was very good. The bartenders were dancing, and having a great time. Very enjoyable. The piana bar was closed when we tried to go. Sneakers, was ok, very loud, young crowd (we are 30) so you know it was a very young crowd. We stayed about 2hrs danced, drank, and had a good time. I drank beer all week, but after the 3rd day my wife found the best drink int he resort. FRUIT PUNCH and VODKA. Oh yeah K from ST LOUIS, I didnt forget that shot of MAMAJUANA you made made me drink. MAID SERVICE: I cant say anything bad, except one thing. I forgot to tip one day, and didnt have any towels, or water that day. I called my buddy Roberto at the front desk, and was able to get it. I didnt forget to tip again. OVERALL: We had a great time, and met some great people there. I wish we could have hung out more with them, but the time we did we had a great time. If my friends from NY, OH, and ST LOUIS read this send me a message with your e-mail. Oh yeah one more thing. Stay away from the VENDORS.

<Content>Will not return. This resort is, without a doubt, not a 5-star. We just got back about 6 hours ago and I wanted to write this review while it was still fresh in my mind. We won't be returning. First, I read trip-advisor and took bug spray, Febreeze, Downy Wrinkle Release, hangers, and loofas. I read that the bugs were horrible, the sheets smell musty because of the humidity, no irons/ironing boards, no hangers, and no washclothes. None of that was true. I also read that there is a problem with ants, cockroaches and RATS! I saw 1 ant. That's it. In fact, we ordered room service one night (this will be addressed later on) and we put the plates down at the end of the hall because I didn't want any rodent squeezing under the door to get to the leftovers. The next morning the plates were still there (not for too long) with the leftovers still on them. I would say that speaks for the non-rat problem.I'll start with the positives.Location - The Grand Oasis is just a short drive from the Punta Cana Airport (which is very nice and well organized). There are no real rules of the road so I was pleased that we didn't have to stay in the van long.Appearance - The main lobby is beautiful. It is open-aired and very nice. The grounds are also attractive. Check-In - No problems here. We arrived before check-in and were able to get into our room before 3pm. D'Mario  The American Grill - Both of the restaurants were excellent. I'll re-address food in the negatives.Adult Pool Bar - Nicolas is, as the reviews state, is amazing. Beach Chairs - These were not a problem to find. Either at the beach or at any of the pools. Finding them under a palapa early on in the morning was tougher, but not impossible. Cleanliness - We constantly saw people cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. They would scrub, or mop essentially, the walkways and areas around the pool. We saw a team of 2 men scrubbing the walls and ledges of the pools. One in the water and one out of the water. Two men raked the seaweed multiple times a day. Our room was also cleaned very well everyday. Lazy River Pool - Very nice and clean (except after they mowed the grass) and has an infinity edge. The adult pool is nice, in theory. We switched to this resort for this reason alone and everyday there were kids in the pool. I left my 2 year-old at home and, therefore, did not want to deal with other peoples' kids. There is one sign by the pool that says it's the adult pool and that's it. If you're coming from the other 2 entrances or simply miss the sign, you don't know that children are not to be in the pool. The pool was never over-run with kids (that was kept for the main pool) so when it was child-free it was very nice. The last few days of our stay, though, the water was cloudy. We would just walk over to the lazy river and swim for a bit. We liked to relax by this pool. Nicolas at the bar helped balance out the negatives of the adult pool. Thanks Nicolas!Our Room - I am putting this part of the review in between the positive section and the negative section because I have mixed reviews. We were on the main level on building 5, all the way at the end of the hall. The location of the room was perfect. We were just steps away from the beach and just around the corner from the adult pool. The room is nothing spectacular. It's a basic hotel room. We were okay with that because we didn't go on vacation for a hotel room. If you do, just book a room at the Holiday Inn. You'll save a bundle. As much as I thought it wouldn't, the rust and showerhead and things irritated my husband and me more than we anticipated. The shower head was horrible. It was supposed to have 4 different settings but they all would shoot the water out at like Mach 5. No big deal until you have a sunburn and then it hurts like nobody's business. Nice big tile ledge in the shower, though which was really nice. Nevatives:FOOD!!! - With the exception of D'Mario and the American Grill, the food is horrible. There is a big selection to choose from at Windows, but unfortunately for my husband and me not much of what we eat and I'm not picky. The food is just not geared toward our culture. (This is not a complaint, just a statement.) I am realtively certain that some of the foods that I saw out at lunch were put back out at dinner time. We were not able to get reservations at Aqua or at Mare. The Japenese restaurant did not appeal to us and is a $15 charge per person. The room service - if you book with Apple, it's free. If you book from anyone else, there is a $6 charge. My husband and I ordered room service on Saturday night, our second full day there. 24 hours later on Sunday night we had to leave D'Mario before dessert (my husband couldn't even finish his meal) because my husband was having such horrible stomach cramps. Mine started the very next morning and we continued to have diarrhea for the rest of the week. My husband is still not recovered. (I felt better after eating yogurt for breakfast.) We had unbelievable stomach cramps, gas, bloating, and diarrhea and it made the rest of the trip miserable. We concluded on the next to last day that the room service was the culprit. This is because we saw the room service being delivered...in a wheelbarrow . Lord knows how long it sits in that dirty rusty wheelbarrow before it gets to you. The vendors - This (and the room service) are reason alone to not come to this resort. The beaches in the DR are public and, therefore, vendors can walk the beach and even come into the resort to hound you! They are selling everything under the sun. Yes, you can give a firm no, but they will hound you the next day. Tuesdays and Thursdays they bring in the local vendors and they will try to charge you astronomical prices. Offer them a 1/3 of what they're asking and don't budge. One night of this would have been more than enough. Overall, the resort is just not what we're looking for in a resort. It wasn't horrible (except for the above 2 mentions areas), but we will not be returning. The El Dorado Royale in the Riviera Maya, Mexico is our definition of paradise. Go there. I will be positing pictures soon.

<Content>Good Holiday Our journey to Punta Cana was plain sailing however you have to be prepared to pay $10 to enter into customs. Once at the hotel it all looked very nice. We were disappointed when we were shown our room. We had booked the standard double room. It was very basic and dated. The bathroom had rust around the doors and the taps were coming away from the wall. On the first day we noticed there were ants all around the bathroom sink. We had to call reception 4 times throughtout the day to arrange someone to come and spray the area. They came in the evening and sprayed the whole room and we were left to sleep in the smell. We also had a problem when the toilet flush broke and again had to chase the reception staff to get it fixed.The best rooms are in block 7. They charge $50 a night to upgrade. The pool and the surrounding areas were very nice and clean but you have to be prepared for all the children to be in the adult pool. They have daily pool based sports. You collect the towels on the beach and some days there were no clean towels. We had the same problem with our room where there were no clean towels. Again we had to chase the reception staff to arrange for these to be provided. When you arrive you should book your meals straight away. We left it to the second day and was told everything was booked. We finally managed to get a booking at the American Grill but had to wait until 9.45. If you do not tip the waiters the service that you get is really poor. The first night we did not leave a tip and when we returned we did not even get shown to a table. We were treated very well once we started tipping. The food was ok. It was not great. You only get the national alcoholic drinks as part of the all inc. If you want international drinks they are charged at $7 each. The excursions are worth going on especially the quad bikes but be prepared for a long bumpy ride getting there. Do not bother with the meal for 2 on the beach. The food is not great. We had this and our table was put in the dark and we could not even see each other. We had to asked to be moved under a light. Overall we had a good time. We would go to the Dominican again but we would not stay at this resort.

<Content>Great for the Money I understand that there are mixed reviews of Grand Oasis. You have to compare what you are paying to what you are getting. For our honeymoon we booked 7 nights for a junior master suite and spent $1200, for TWO people. Our room was very luxourious, jaccuzzi, huge walk in shower, CA, cable TV. The choices of restaurants were sufficient, specialty restaurants' portions were sort of small. The buffet has more than enough choices for all meals. Our house keeping was great, remember to leave a modest tip each day if you want them to go the extra mile; ie: flowers on your bed. We chose not to do any excursions because the tour guides charge too much. We did however opt to use the sea kiaks and sail boat. You should learn a little Spanish to talk to local venders, my husband is bilingual so we had no problems. The only problem that I can mention is the venders that come out a couple of evenings, I guess they do this so tourists don't have to leave the resort. Yes they are a bit pushy, just keep walking if you're not interested. We also had to walk way down the beach, off the resort grounds to find peace and quiet. Don't go alone, for safety reasons. It was an adventure for us, we found someone selling coconuts and handmade art. There was too much activity for us and loud music at the main pool and lots of toplessness going on at the resort beaches. Bugs were minimal, and only at night. Oh, and we wanted more local music and dancing, like marangue, bachata, salsa. I think the resort mostly catered to the prodominent Eureopean crowd.All in all we were pleased with our trip, we will go back again.

<Content>Wonderful time Family of eight, Batesville, InOur family of eight, six adults and two children ages 8 and 5 spent from June 28 thru July 5 at this property. Flew USA 3000 departing Cincinnati. Flights both going and return were excellent with airline staff providing superior service.Processing upon arrival at the Punta Cana Airport was quick and easy taking less than 1/2 hour before boarding the ground transportation to the resort. Check in at Grand Oasis was also uneventful. We were treated very well by check-in staff.We were checked-in to building 5. Yes, building 5 is showing some age but it provoded exactly what our family needed, efficient A/C, hot showers with good water pressure, and a very clean and well attended room. I should also note that Grand Oasis is in the process of up-grading the older buildings as building 3 was closed for a total remodel. We tried 4 of the ala carte resturants, Del Mario (Itallian), American Grill (Tex Mex), Mare ( seafood) and the Japanese all of which offered a nice selection of food which was well prepared and nicely served. We did venture off property one evening to the Jellyfish. A twenty minute, $20 van/cab ride to a very beautiful setting with great seafood. The Jellyfish picked-up the cost of the van/cab ride back to your resort. The Windows Buffet always offered a large selection of choices for breakfast, and the Beach Resturant always had a nice lunch selection. The beach grill served grilled Burgers that were equal to most Burgers served in the US.The beach and pools were all very well maintained. Yes, there were vendors on this property none of whom ever became too pushy. Just let them know you are not interested in what they have for sale. The service at Grand Oasis was very good. The Housekeepers, Bar tenders, and wait staff were excellent. Nicholas at the Adult Pool bar has something about empty glasses. He will never let your glass be empty very long. No, we did not see a mosquito, or a roach, only a common house fly from time to time.Remember, the Dominican Republic is a third world country and 5 stars there is different than 5 stars most other places, but if you go to the Grand Oasis you will get the best they have to offer.Go there , relax and enjoy this beautiful resort. Remember not only ther house keepers, the bellmen and the bartenders with a tip but also the other support staff such as the guys who rake the beach.

<Content>First Vacation.....mixed feelings!!! Finally after 13yrs together my hubby and I took our first vacation!! I was really nervous...actually terrified because I have never been anywere outside of Canada!! I read alot of reviews before we left and I'm glad I did!! Thank you to everyone who warned us to bring lots of sunscreen and bug spray!! They really do charge $25 dollars for a small bottle of sunscreen!!Arriving at the Grand Oasis was breath taking! We were greeting with Rum Punch and staff dancing in the front lobby. Check in was very quick and the staff took you luggage to your room.(of course a tip is expected) Our room was a disapointment, I paid for a garden view room, and we got a room in block 2 with a view of construction and contruction garbage, our patio door would not open(my hubby smokes) and our shower was just a trickle of water. I complained to the front desk and the wrote our name on a piece of paper to requst a room change if one came free. So we spent our 1st night quite unimpressed!! Oh!ya! the floors were so dirty they turned my feet black!! So the next morning we talked to our Sunwing representitive and he quickly brought us down to the front desk and told them how unhappy we were and how unexecptable this was! The staff told us that he would have a new room available A.S.A.P at no extra charge. The bell boy took me to go see the new room while my husband pack up our things. Wow!!! what a pleasant suprise...we got a room on block 4 on the 3rd floor end unit (4323) with an absolutely beautiful ocean view, our balcony wrapped around the end of the building(l shaped). We sat outside everyday at different times and always had a beautiful breeze from the ocean! We found out the next day that our new room had no air conditioning, they came right away to fix it, and by the 2nd day it still didn't work so the moved us again right across the hall! My advice....if you are unhappy, complain, be nice but persistant...I very nicely told them I was unhappy and this was unexceptable, and they with the help of our representive did everything they could to make us happy!!The food was okay, the buffet Windows had something to eat, but sometimes the food was cold and the fruit was warm and dry!Try to watch for the cooks putting out fresh food, if it looks cold or old, wait a few minutes rthe new stuff will come out! I found breakfast the best at windows, you could always get fresh bacon, scrambled eggs, or omletts made to order, and the fresh orange juice is amazing. We ate at 3 of the restruants, we booked upon arrival thanks to other reviews. The first restruant was DeMario's we both has the pasta trio and Ceaser salad. The ceaser salad had anchovies on top and mixed in the salad (yuck I had anchovie taste in my mouth all night, even after brushing twice) The pasta was okay but very salty, so taste your food before adding salt.The second restruant was the American Grill, the Steak was the best I have ever tasted!!! We did wait longer to be served, but it was well worth the wait!!Aqua was the last restruant we visited, we wern't impressed at all!! Neither of us enjoyed the meal or the service!! But that's only our opinion, other have really enjoyed it!!The beach and the pools were amazing, we tried every pool and the beach more than once. The ocean was warm and very clear, it was both of our first time in the ocean and we decided we liked the pools better. The main pool was always busy lots of noise, enertainment and music, and a swim up bar. But after a few days we wanted to find something quieter so we could just relax!! BINGO!! We discovered the adult pool hidden behind block 5, right by the Aqua restruant. This was our spot for the rest of our vacation...very quiet adult only pool and bar. The bartender Nicolas was amazing, you never had to leave you lonnge chair, he walked around getting you drink orders and delivered them to you moments later. Once he new what you were drinking (if you stuck to the same drink) he brought you a fresh one before your glass was empty!! Always good always strong!!lol I had to tell him little bit of Rum Nicolas was great!! On our last day we tipped him our last 200 paso's and took our picture with him. He was so greatful he gave us both a big hug and refilled our mugs to take to our room.We went on 2 excursions (we booked through Tuiti Fruity Tours off the beach) and found it to be alot cheaper than the resort. We went snorkeling for 1.5 hrs of $15 dollas U.S each, the resort wanted $45.We had an amazing experience the guide threw pellets into the water and instantly there we hundreds of fish around us! We also book horseback riding with the same people, it was $25 U.S and the resort wanted $50 U.S each. The riding was okay, the guide Willie was a 17yr old boy who took us through a small rundown area just outside of the resort (a little scary at first) but really lets you see how live in the Dominican isn't all beautiful resorts and beaches. He then took us to a private beach which was breath taking, and cut off some coconuts and it to us to drink. I guess the riding was okay for the money we paid.Now the bad!!! BEWARE of the venders!!! The resort lets them in twice a week!! The hound you like vultures on a fresh kill!! The also try to rip you off!! Watch them as they use thier calculators!! I caught them converting 64 pasco's instead of 34, I had no money left but wanted a few necklaces so i went to the front dest to get a cash advance from my visa, the lady at the desk said that $30 U.S was only 890 paso's and the vender wanted 1190 paso's. After that we did some conversions ourselves and kept it on paper in my purse so they couldn't try to rip us off again!! And believe me everyone will try to rip you off, so be prepared with your own calculator or know your conversion and exchange rates!!Lastly.....bring Immodium!! Both my hubby and i got really sick our last 2 days. Bad stomach cramps, gas, bloating then diarreah. In fact a few people that were on our flight that stayed at this resort were sick too! 3 days after we were home we went to the Doctor's and ended up on antibiotics with an intestional bacteria infection. We took all precautions before we left, we got our Hep AB vaccinations, antimaylaria medications and Dukoral for travellers diarreah and we still got sick!!All in all our vacation was great cause we don't know of anything better it being our first. I probably would not return to this resort. #1 people we met recommended better resorts that they have stayer at (they were sick too) #2 would like to try somewere new so that we have something to compare too!!

<Content>Fantastic Holiday Eileen  Ernie Northern Ireland. We had a fantastic time at this hotel. It was better than the brochure. Cant fault it anyway. It was so close to airport, so no long coach journey. The beach is only a few steps from block 2 which we stayed in. The hotel and rooms very clean. Staff on Reception were very helpful, nothing was a problem to them. Restaurants had good selection of food , and it was always hot so no need to go hungry. The Beach restaurant and snack bar also excellent . Everyone was friendly. The only problem we found was the vendors who visited the hotel a few nights a week, you couldn't stop to view anything as they were very pushy in getting you to buy, and nearly every stall sold the same thing. The entertainment was excellent a great animation team, they put on great shows. Will definately go back again.

<Content>It was sooooo worth going! Loved it! SERIOUSLY DONT LISTEN TO ANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS AT ALL TODAY IS JULY 3RD AND I just got back today from the Grand Oasis in Punta Cana and it was amazing everyone was extremely nice! Especially Carlita the House keeper and Ernest the Receptionist! Best Service! If you dont have a problem with men in speedos or women topless than you should deffinatly come here. The food here is really good! I deffinatly recomend eating at the japanese place and Da Mario! great food also i recomend going to the disco sneaker on the 2nd floor of the lobby - great music. You will hear a bunch of bad reviews about the rooms to be honest with you i didnt rele find anything wrong except for the fact it smelt kinda funny and the only reason they are rebuilding areas of the resort are to make it better for the guests so please stop complaining! Also if you are going to book an exscurtion such as swimming with dolphins or scuba diving book it through the travel agency cause people will walk up to you on the beach trying to get you to buy through them and a lot of the time they are doing it illegally and if they see the police they will leave you stranded! It is deffinatly a family oriented place! There are tons of stuff for kids to do at night and during the day they have a movie theater, a play station room, pool tables, volleyball nets in the pool and out, they have a playground for the little kids and for the adults they have a spa and gym! The only bad thing i can say about this place is that if you DONT rent one of the safes it is very likely a housekeeper might steal one of your possessions...2 days ago our normal cleaning lady carlita left and the next day we had a new cleaning lady well we went out for the day and when we came back to get showered for dinner my mom found out she stole 5 packs of my moms cigarettes and left her with one so just lock your stuff to be on the safe side! Otherwise there is nothing really wrong with this place the beach is beautiful! Deffinately didn't regret this trip at all!

<Content>Becareful of vendors (fake cigars) I would like to share our feeling about the Grand Oasis Punta Cana. Firstly i would go back to this hotel anytime. Food was very good, hotel was good, and service was good. Obviously it could get better, but the resort is pretty good.We stayed in room 5307. block 5, 3rd floor. The room was nice, 2 queen beds and nice bathroom, very high ceilings and space. The buffets was great, good al-carte restaurants. beach and pool was very good.My problem or warning to anybody going to this or any resort, is BE CAREFUL OF THE VENDORS THAT COME TO THE RESORT TO SELL, CIGARS BRACELETS, RINGS AND SO ON.We purchased Cigars Montecristo #1 a box of 25 and found out later they were fake! There was only 24 cigars inside and the green label was not real and obviously the cigars were not as well. If your going to buy cigars from these people that come to the hotel with green shirts and love to use the calculator, make SURE YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CIGARS YOU ARE BUYING! If you don't you are going to get SCREWED!, THEY START at a very high price and will come down, if you keep to your lowest price. There prices are way to high, ex. for the whole kit of bracelet, necklace and earings with the dominican stone, MAX 35$ usd, DON'T PAY MORE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE SCREWED.! THE CIGARS, ASK TO OPEN THEM, AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW REALLY HOW THEY ARE! AND COUNT THEM! IF THE guy refused, then don't buy them, once they are bought...its too late.Also there is acouple of shops near the grand oasis, 2 minute walk,there they will deal, if you know how to deal....REMEMBER THEY ALWAYS START AT THE CRAZY HIGH PRICE, SO you go to the lowest price and stay there, never mind about the calculator they will show you..... its a stupid pressure tactic.!Remember don't buy cigars from them, unless you know ABOUT CIGARS!, most of the time they are fake!, open the box and see and count them,The whole jewelry kit with the Domincan stone 35$ max or lower!Go to the flee market, 2 minute walk and deal!Forget about buying anything at the airport, its too expensive, buy the liquor at the flee market, for the Canadians (Montreal) becareful, buy the liquor at the duty free, they may not have it available in the plane or at the flee market, unless you want to buy Dominican rum, which is good!Good luck and remember don't get screwed, deal and know what your buying!Remember your the one with the dollars, not them!

<Content>Trust ME this resort is Crappy! Crappy service and Crappy food. I was sold on a certain package and given something else. The first 2 rooms I given the A/C did not work and the shower head in the bathroom was a water bottle cut in half. Finally when we were moved the the last room they wanted to charge me $50 per person per day. Since I was moved a few time they waived the fee. I was not the only person with this problem we met 2 other families with the same problem. The food is not that good. Breakfast wasn't that bad because how bad can you mess up scramble eggs. In order to eat at one of the restaurants you need to make reservation, and the best restaurant they have is Aqua and it is hidden in the back. I got offer drugs twice by 2 other the harrassing vendors they have. The mosquitos are your room mates. Eventhough they say they fumigate take your own insect repelent. The sheets smell and so do the beach towels. I have never rated a hotel before,but this one needed my input. If you are looking for a beautiful hotel - stay at the EDEN Real Arena.

<Content>Cant complain My boyfriend and I stayed at the resort the 1st week of June. Overall we had a great time. We only had a few issues with our stay but for the most part we couldnt complain. First, the rooms. It seems that every building was built totally different. We were in building 9 which was new. The only problem i had with it were ants. The resort itself was gorgeous. Everything was really clean and the workers were always busy making it look even better. The beach was really clean and we never had trouble finding chairs, same with the pool. The drinks were really strong which was great for us and we really enjoyed the pool bar. Food, well the food was okay. We quickly learned how to eat at the windows buffet b/c most of the food was ICE cold! We learned to go to the made-to-order stations b/c we knew it would be hot. The variety of food was pretty good. We absolutely loved the italian restaurant, da mario, we went there twice. The only other rest. we went to was aqua and we wern't impressed. It was very difficult getting reservations to the restaurants so make sure you go and do that as soon as you arrive. The entertainment was ok. The night life was sort of lacking. The day time activities were always fun, such as aerobics, dancing, or volleyball. By far, the worst part of the trip was the PUSHY sales!!!!!! I understand its like this at all the resorts but we were CONSTANTLY hounded about buying excursions, time shares, and stupid lobster dinners. The resort doesnt seem to care about this taking place... it was even worse on the beach. We booked through apple which was great, i'd recommend booking your excursion through your travel agency, not guys off the beach! Things that are good to have, insulated mugs for drinks, bug spray ($20 there same as sunscreen). All in all we had a great time and would recommend this resort to someone whos looking for a cheaper trip.... NOT for a honeymoon in my opinion.

<Content>Room for improvement We stayed at the Grand Oasis from 6th - 12th June 2008, and I can say that it was a mixed experience. We arrived to be greeted with a nice cold fruit punch and a fast check in service. We immediately upgraded to block 7 (room 7220) for US$50 per night, as we had read the reviews on this site before leaving. Not having seen any other rooms I can't comment on them, but we were really happy with the room we received, except for the small sand ants that seemed to congregate around the coffee pot. We reported this to reception and they offered to fumigate our room but couldn't offer us alternative accommodation! We declined as we didn't want to die of toxic poisoning, and lived with the ants. However to be fair we weren't over-run, and avoiding the coffee pot worked a treat. The view was amazing and we overlooked the beach, with a lovely balcony and inside and outside Jacuzzis. The restaurants were hit and miss, the American Grill was the worst, we waited over 20 minutes to be served, and eventually left after being ignored by several waiters. I also asked for wine to be told no wine and then have the tables either side of us (both with Spanish speaking guests) served white. I'm prepared to be generous and say that it was perhaps a language barrier, but I discovered later on that being an English speaker made you a second class citizen as some waiters would serve Spanish speaking guests first, and they had a habit of queue jumping. However the remainder of the staff were really helpful and courteous - I guess it just depended who you got on a particular day. The Italian restaurant in comparison was fantastic, the food, service and wine (yep got some eventually) was wonderful, and I can only praise the D'mario. The resort should look to D'Marios as their benchmark, and the service would improve 10 fold.The only other restaurant we tried was Windows with a buffet style theme. I've read a few reviews that stated the food there was cold, and while I agree that it could have been hotter, it was a buffet and there was always fresh fruit, vegetables and salads on offer. We ate more in there than other restaurants as we always found something we liked and enjoyed the flexibility of not having to book a specific time slot to eat. The pools were clean and the bars were always very very generous with their measures. But you must be aware that there is a tipping culture. We tipped the cleaner $5 per day (more than normal, but I know how messy my boyfriend is), and hoped for a more special service. We received the minimum, no extra cokes or beers and the number of towels we received depended on the day. But the room was always spotless and this to me was more important. Yes there was seaweed on the beach but there were staff cleaning every day, and it really wasn't too bad. Finally the one and only thing that I felt really let the resort down, were the sellers. We were badgered all the time, and although we did buy a few items in the end we felt continuously pressured. One of the shop keepers tried ripping us off by trying to charge us 85 peso to 1 US$, instead of the ex. rate of 33 - 35. We argued, and told him take 35 or leave it and he changed his tune. I suppose that you get people everywhere trying it on, but it did leave a bitter taste in my mouth. To be fair though I don't know how much influence the hotel has over the sellers.To summarise if you speak Spanish or French and don't mind tipping a buck or two for everything then you'll have a great time. Otherwise it might be a bit hit or miss.

<Content>Not 4 Star: AVOID FOOD this hotel is certainly not 4 star like thomson claim, also it is not a new build as we were led to believe. My partner was offered cocaine by one of the hotel staff which was shocking. Prepare to be hassled constantly to buy goods, as the hotel staff let outside vendors into the resorts and you will be surrounded. You MUST haggle the price, we got ripped off on our first day, spent $100 dollars on a pot, but we soon got wise to it. Our line was we're going home tomorrow, and only have this amount of money left you will not be surprised that they will accept your offer.Now the food: Avoid the burgers! We have never been so ill in our lives, and the burgers are raw! One night, i asked the cook to cut the burger in half, as i wanted it cooked, he threw his spatula down, then started yelling at me in Spanish. The staff can be very rude, especially if you are a woman. Eventually a manager came down, and got me a burger, i said i wanted it burnt, so i knew it would be not be pink, guess what? it was still raw.We booked an excursion with thomson to saona island. We were told we could trust thomson, so spent $304 for this day out. On the day, we waited 1hr 40 mins for our pick up, only then to receive a phone call to say we would not be picked up as we were too far away. We got our money back the next day, but the Thomson rep, was not very helpful, was very sheepish, but that's most likely as she was trying to sell her excursions to a new set of holiday makers. My advice? Get the excursions off the fella's on the beach. We met another couple on a thompson holiday, and they bought the same excursion as us, from the beach and only paid $80. That's a big price difference, and they went on their day trip. We could only afford one excursion, and as that was canceled, we spent two weeks feeling trapped on the resort. There's a lot more negatives we experienced, and Thomson will be receiving a written complaint from my partner and I.Overall: Prepare to be disappointed as we were.I'd like to add, we have been on many Thomson holidays over the years, and this is the First time we have felt need to complain.

<Content>Decent resort, awful food First off, they initially tried to stick us in one of the new rooms which was supposedly a free upgrade. That particular room had an awful mildew stench and no AC. Then they tried to stick us in another room which was at least 30 years old. Finally they put us in building 10, the room was pretty nice although we had to settle for two queen beds.  Now lets move on shall we? As soon as we arrived, the peddlers were all over us. I have NEVER seen a resort that had people BEGGING you all day long to go on their fishing trips, dinner cruises, buy their cheap overpriced jewelry, etc. Usually thats what you see when you travel OUT OF THE RESORT. That was VERY ANNOYING. As we are trying to relax on the beach, CAPTAIN COOK kept approaching us to go on his stupid Lobster dinner cruise. The food? WOW, just the WORST I have ever seen. The booze was also terrible. The all inclusive is a joke. Don't even think about trying the vodka unless you want the hangover of your life. On the positive side, the service was pretty good, the staff was very nice and the pools were pretty good as well, although no water slides or pools over 4 1/2 ft deep. Also they ran out of towels continously. Basically you get what you pay for. Stay away from this dump.

<Content>Great Vacation This resort was absolutely beautiful. The staff was helpful. Cheapcarribean.com took care of our trip and could not have done a better job. Our rooms were fantastic, the pool was right outside of our back door in the Bavaro suites, the staff came around regularly to take drink orders and the beach was wonderful. We read several lousy reviews before booking this trip and wouldn't put any faith in any of them

<Content>Its great I am so fed up with reading negative reviews I am so fed up of reading such negative reports about this resort. We have been to the Dominican Republic for the past seven years, and have stayed at The Grand for the last five of them. When we first stayed there it was a Sunscape Resort, and we thought that is was very good but since it has been taken over and is now The Grand Oasis it has improved immensely.They have built three new buildings; there are now five swimming pools, and twonew restaurants. The staff cannot do enough for you and every one of them will go the extra mile, they are always smiling, are happy and polite. It鈥檚 a shame that some of the guests are not the same, and find fault with everything.The food is great, always fresh, and loads of choice. There is always lots of variation, at windows (the main buffet) as well as the other restaurants. The whole resort is spotless. Unlike other resorts we have stayed at in the Dominican Republic.We have met and made so many friends, both staff and guests, over the years, and still stay in touch with quite a few of them. We arrived home on Tuesday 20th May and I have rebooked for next year already. People ask why we keep going back to the same resort and I answer it鈥檚 like going home and they make you feel like part of their family. So why would I need to go anywhere else

<Content>Awesome Getaway! We just returned from our wonderful vacation in the Dominican Republic at the Grand Oasis. We couldn't have asked for a nicer resort to stay at! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. At first we were concerned as it appears everyone speaks in Spanish, which we do not, but after some inquisitive looks we gave them they started speaking to us in English. We booked our trip on CheapCaribbean.com - which I highly recommend. They had great prices, reviews, and took extra care of us the moment we landed at the airport. They told us things to look out for and what to do. The food at Grand Oasis is decent, not excellent, but not terrible. The main restaurant, Windows, has a great buffet that changes every lunch and dinner so you got a good variety. The other restaurants you have to make reservations for or they won't let you in to eat. So be sure to make reservations for all of the restaurants the day you arrive. The fish place was okay, the Italian restuarant was good, and the American Grill was excellent - if you like Tex Mex food.The Grand Oasis had constant entertainment. There was a sheet listed as to the daily activities and they kept you busy all day if you wanted to. With water aerobics (trust me it was a ton of fun) to salsa dancing lessons by the pool side to beach volleyball, you were sure to never be bored. The nightly entertainment was pretty neat as well - a different show everynight. Just be sure to bring bug spray or you will get bit up.Also, bring plenty of sun screen as the sun is extremely hot and the sunscreen in the gift shops will cost you upwards to $25. We sadly had to pay that price. Overall, I highly recommend the Grand Oasis as a great place to stay while in Punta Cana. I wish I was still there!!!

<Content>So Sad We had to leave!!! First of all...anyone reading this and worrying about all the bad reviews, please please trust me...they are WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!... My Husband and I stayed at the Grand Oasis from May 7th to the 14th (which was not enought time!!)The monute we walked into the lobby there was a nice man bringing us a drink!.... We upgraded immediately while checking in just because we wanted to treat ourselves. The guy at the desk was more than pleased to help us, and it was only 50 bucks extra a night. If you have some extra money, spoil yourself, if you don't, trust me, you'll be fine in the room your at. Lets be honest here...how much time do you spend in your room? FOOD... NEVER ENDING ALL YOU CAN EAT ALL DAY! The Windows is different every night. We only went to the Japanese Resturaunt once which was very good, and Aqua once which was also good. Plus if you go to the resturaunts and you don't like your meal, Windows in open til 10!! Just go there and grab something.. GET THE MASSAGE ON THE BEACH!!! ($60 for 50 min) The Beach was beautiful and clean.. I'm sure you heard it is very hard to get an umbrella on the beach, but there are plenty of chairs and plenty of shade from the palm trees. BRING ENOUGH SUNTAN LOTION AND ALOE!!!! On the resort Sunscreen in $20!!! Snorkling is awesome...We used a local on the beach. We went with another couple we met at the Hotel. The local wanted to charge us $30 a peice and we talked him down to $15. The work staff is so kind and willing to do anything to make you happy! Treat them nice and don't be cheap, tip them a dollar here and a dollar there, these people work VERY VERY hard to keep you happy! And when you do give them a few bucks, they remember your face and go above and beyond for you! BRING OFF!!!!!!!! The pools are gorgeous and always clean.... Hard to get an unbrella chair unless your an early bird!!! We did an excursion outside of the resort!!! Just know that these are 6+ hour excursions with all the traveling to the place and back.  We are already planning our next trip back there. I can write on and on and on, but you'll see for yourself. If there is a problem with something when you are there, tell one of the workers, they will help you, don't wait to come home and cry the blues on Trip Advisor. Hopefully I'll get some pictures on here soon!!!!

<Content>BEWARE of double-booking . . . My husband and I were booked into the Grand Oasis from 14th to 28th April. On arrival, after a total of 14 hours travelling from the UK, we were told that the room was double-booked. We were taken to another hotel and after three hours of negotiations were eventually provided with good accommodation. If you book a room at the Grand Oasis be aware that double-booking is common practice with this hotel - there were two other incidences of this at the time of our arrival. We were not at all impressed!

<Content>Good Value - Nice Resort We stayed at the Grand Oasis from May 3, 2008 through May 10, 2008. We booked the trip with Apple Vacations, flying out of Cincinnati Ohio. Apple Vacations did a good job. Our rep at the hotel was very helpful and not at all pushy. He gave us some good advice. The Hotel overall was nice, but not over the top or anything. We have stayed in two other all inclusive resorts, one in Jamaica and one in Cancun. Both of them were in this same price range and the Grand Oasis was better without a doubt than the other two resorts.The food is pretty good, the specialty restaurants are OK. aQua is the most interesting and their food is good. We didn't try the Japanese restaurant.Our room was in building 10. It was nice and clean and was right next to one of the pools. Maid service was good. Mini bar was stocked with cold beer, Coke, Sprite and water.The bar staff and wait staff were very friendly.The entertainment was pretty good...not like Broadway or anything but very fun to watch. We don't have children but it looked like they had plenty for the kids to do.I would recommend taking a side trip to Santo Domingio. It's a neat city and makes a nice day trip. it's a long bus ride but worth it.Overall I would rate the Grand Oasis as a very good value. It's not super posh or anything but for the price we both thought it was a good deal.Enjoy!

<Content>Great Little Resort Visit Dominican Rep. every year and try a different resort.Buzzed thu airport to transfers and to this hotel within 20 min.of the airport. We wanted to upgrade to Building 7, front desk seemed uninterested in helping us. Went to the Apple Rep., Angel. He took up directly to Caren de Vries (Rooms Division Manager) She was great! Upgraded us and gave us the best room we had ever seen. 7221, faced the ocean, 2 whirlpool baths, huge shower. Check the travelers photos, they tell it all.If you want a better room upgrade at an additionl cost of $50-$80,per day. To e-mail Caren at [-]to reserve a better room. Windows buffet food was good. Be patient, you're on vacation.Italian rest. food was good. Pool clean, maid service good.People friendly. Beautiful beach. Remember, you're in the tropics. Hot sun, some bugs, and flies. Vendors a pain.If you want a 6 gold where everyone waits on you hand and foot,go elsewhere.We would recommend resort with upgraded room.

<Content>Good and Bad Over all our trip was pretty good. A few pointer's though:make reservation's for dinner when you arrive because even if the restaruant's empty they wont seat you.Bring your own floats  lot's of sunscreen,They'll try  charge you an arm and a leg.ALWAYS bargain, there's no price set in stone (even on the hair breading at the beach) Hotel ad state's: free room service for 24 hour's, ya right. It's $6 a trip and they take FOREVER! Hotel also states free pony rides, never happened. No pony's anywhere in sight. I heard they stopped doing it along time ago. Also LOT'S  LOT'S of topless women every where even children not just at the adult pool. Bld 7 was beautiful all marble with walk in shower and jacuzzi, slidding glass door's lead's to patio and lazy river. About the food- it was mediocre, you get what you pay for, I was sick for 1 night my daughter was sick for 2 ( cant exactly say it was the food ) Our family went for 7 days: my husband ,myself, 2 children 1 age 9 and 1 age 15 they enjoyed themselves. There was alway's something to do. WWWEEEE ABSOLUTLY loved NIKKO the bartender at the swim up bar. He was the best. He was alway's in a good mood, funny and entertained the kid's. HE WAS GREAT.

<Content>Don't believe everything you read but it wasn't perfect either...... My husband and I stayed at the resort from April 17th to May 1st and overall had a great time. We tried to book Club class for the flights but our travel agent waited too long and it was all booked. We will definately ensure this is done right off the bat in the future since coach was not comfortable at all and on a 10 hour flight from Vancouver BC to Punta Cana it was a bit much. However the flight attendants worked very hard to keep you happy as best they could.When we arrived we had a similar feeling to some other folks as we dropped people off at the first resort Calodina and saw how beautiful it was, made us less than impressed with our hotel when we pulled into the narrow courtyard. We were among the first to check in and went to our room, this first room in building 10 and was horrible. The floor was dirty, the patio door did not lock(first floor room) and the bathroom was dirty too!! We complained and they sent someone to fix things but they could not to our satisfaction so they moved us to another room(we had to insist and although we felt bad being pushy there was just no way I was staying in that room) The next room was not much better but at least it was clean. It had an amazing view of a brick wall-not good but by now it was 9pm and we were hunger and tired.The next morning we went to the Nolitour orientation and found out we were not alone. The rep Sandra listened to our problems and helped us to arrange for a better room, the funny thing is another couple who were complaining had been given our first room and they had the same complaints plus the air conditioning had stopped working in the middle of the night.We were finally moved to room 9204 and things were much better here. We had to insist on being moved though and even offered to pay for an upgrade-they said they had nothing however I listened to someone complain later that day and they were moved to building 7(by far the nicest rooms-we went and looked at them)With the room settled we went about our vacation feeling much better. The elevator in our building was working as of day 3 or so and although the landing of the elevator is a bit bumpy it is not too bad.We enjoyed the food overall except the coffee in the room-it made us both sick the third day and we stayed away from it after that. Windows restaurant can fill most needs and usual waiter David gave us the best service! He even managed to teach us some useful spanish words and phrases. The aQua restaurant was good most of the time although not exceptional for sure.The Restaurants were not easy to book and we ended up eating late most nights- we were afraid to book too far in advance since we wanted to make sure we liked the food they had to offer. If we had to do it again we would have booked everything the first day.Pools were clean however they need to be better at enforcing the age limit at the adult pool. Now do not get me wrong I love children-but mostly I love that I choose to leave my kids at home and wanted a vacation that was kid free. Not a huge deal most of the time though.Casino was great, we did not spend any of our own money just used the tickets they give you.($10 per day) we would play the ticket on the table assigned and then take our money(we won 12 nights out of 13) and change it into slot tokens. We came out about $40.00 ahead for the 2 weeks so enjoyed it.We did not take in the shows except for the first night, so we cannot really comment on them. We did do some of the tours though and enjoyed the Country Adventure tour-full day and it was worth the money. Had a chance to learn about the country, see a school, visit a typical home and go horseback riding as well. The Kontiki tour was good although we were with a large group who all knew each other so we did not enjoy it that much. We went to the shopping centre twice to use the bank machine since the one at the resort did not work for us. There is a free shuttle every 2 hours so it was easy. We ate at Tony Roma's when we were there and it tasted just like home. I think we both enjoyed this since sometimes the food at the resort did not agree with us.Overall, I would recommend the resort but would suggest booking the Club class seats on the plane and would suggest you not hesitate to be a bit pushy to get the best room you can!

<Content>it was amazing. I went with 20 of my best girl friends down there from April 13th til April 20th. We had an excellent time. Rooms: Are rooms were all nice, all within the same two buildings, 2 and 3. I was in building 3 ground level and it was very nice. No bugs or rats or anything like that. Our maid was very nice after we tipped her. Food: The food was okay, it was anything special but Windows did have good food on certain nights. I ate at the Italian twice and it was very good. Drinks: The drinks were okay, it was very cheap alcohol but the drinks still tasted good. Alcides in the Piano Bar is the best bartender at the resort we loved him. It was our favorite bar to go to before we went to the disco every night. We also really enjoyed the bartenders at the Beach Bar, they were a lot of fun. Overall: It was a very good trip, we had a lot of fun, I however would recommend booking in block 7 because the rooms are a lot nicer. I also recommend if you are going to do an excursion we went on the Kon TIki, a snorkeling booze cruise and we all agreed that it was our favorite part of the trip. The staff at the hotel is amazing, too. We met one guy who is there doing the water aerobics at 6 am, and we saw him at the disco closing it at 2 am. He was at every activity and he really was great.

<Content>Had a great time We had a great time at the Grand Oasis. I travelled with my daughter and some friends for spring break.I had a room in block seven. The room was very nice. We did have a problem with the air conditionong leaking and it was noy until my friend fell in the water that we were finally able to get someone to look into our complaint. It only took four days. My daughter had a room in building three. The room was okay. She did have fifty dollars stolen from her from maintanance workers while she was in the room. We were not expecting much from this trip for what we paid but for any amount of money I don,t think you should have to put up with standing water on your marble floors. We enjoyed the ala cartes very much with the Japanese being our favorite. Breakfast at windows was delightful. Really enjoyed the smoothies and orange juice. The shows at night were fun,make sure and catch the all star review it was great. Had a lot of fun at the piano bar. We did go to lunch at jellyfish, great food and what a view on the beach. Taxi from grand oasis was eighteen dollars for seven of us. Did find vendor night to be interesting. Expect to be pretty much harrased all evening . If I ever return to the dominican republic again I don,t know if I would stay at this resort yet or not.

<Content>Not Grand, but very good My husband and I stayed at the Grand Oasis from March 24 - March 29, 2008. We stayed in Room 10209 in room block 10. Overall this was an above average hotel and experience but there were a few problems/issues. If you are expecting perfection at this resort, you will not find it. But if you are looking for a good overall vacation this resort will be great for you.A few of the issues  - the resort is still finishing room block 10 and adding on. That means that part of the hotel is quite loud with construction noise. - if you want shade on the beach you must set your alarm for 6am and be prepared to defend your seats. We saw a big disturbance between some Europeans over shade and chairs - the rooms are not perfect: there is water damage from the shower leaking into the rooms, the air conditioning does not keep up making rooms damp and a little smelly.A few things that make this resort GREAT - the pools - the friendly staff - the Aqua rest. for breakfast - the beautiful ocean and beach - the cleaning staff - the friendliness of other vacationers - the outside main bar in the eveningsWe want to send a special thanks out to staff who made this vacation even better - Wander and Sandra in the American Grill, Martha in the main bar, Lebron in Aqua and the Apple Reps Sandy and Angel were absolutely terrific!We would go back to this resort but would probably venture onto another destination if available too.To compare - the Ocean Blue is much nicer and the Jack Tar in Puerta Plata is much worse. Grand Oasis is going to fall in the middle.We got a deal on this place - about $800US including tax and flight. For the money this was worth it.Resort pictures on not deceiving - it is a picture perfect place.

<Content>Great time My wife ,myself and and 9 year old daughter flew from Toronto on April 10. The flight was fine on Air transat with exception of a couple of loud idiots poring their own booze and yelling profanity. The staff did have a talking with them , however. When we arrived in the D.R we boarded our bus(#98) to the Grand oasis which also was taking people to the Catalonia resort next door. The bus pulled into the Catalonia first and disembarked EVERYONE except for us an an elderly couple. The catalonia lobby looked beautiful at night. I started to wonder why we were the only people going to the Grand Oasis. Five minutes later we pulled into this tiny driveway which led to a building that looked more like a prison from the outside than the resort I thought I had booked to. This was our first trip and I was starting to worry. Had we made a mistake? Check-in was very informal and I received my free bottle of rum as promised. We were escorted up the stairs(elevators don't work) to room 10304. Upon opening the door , the smell of mould hit us hard but then we turned on the lights and discovered that this room looked nothing like the one in the brochures. We were also directly under the main ventilation system on the roof which was very LOUD. I was ready to make a stink but my wife convinced me otherwise. The resort itself is absolutely beautiful. It is a perfect size to manage on foot and the grounds are kept spotless. We dined at all the ala carte restaurants and the food was very good. Seriously , no complaints. The drinks were also great and we never had to wait long to be served. The beach is nice if you don'tmind a little seaweed and the pools are clean. Staying in the Bavaro side gave us exclusive use of the AQUA restaurant at which we had breakfast each day. Nice Place too. All in all we really enjoyed our stay save for the noisy room..would not let them pull that one on me again.The Bonus of staying at the Bavaro suites is the smaller concierge....it was really no easy dealing with them as opposed to the main building which was always a zoo . Go and enjoy but be careful with your room selection.

<Content>Excellent Experience We got married at the Grand Oasis in Punta Cana and it was awesome. One thing many people fail to realize its not Canada or the US.. so expect some problems to occur. We went down there expecting things to go wrong with our wedding and our stay there, but there simply were no mistakes. As bride and groom we stayed in Building 7; The rooms in this building were beautiful we had ground level, beach front and one of the pools were 10ft from our room! ALL staff were excellent to our group no complaints. Food was pretty good at the buffet, but mostly the restaurants were the places to eat. The Wedding Coordinators were more than accommodating. The ceremony was fantastic everything worked out very well. Lots of activities to enjoy while we were there. We enjoyed our stay here and will DEFINITELY RETURN to Hotel Oasis in Punta Cana. It was clean, friendly, memorable, and will recommend to others. My only regret is that I did not know any Spanish! But most employees knew quite a bit of English. Tipping the maids extra got us extra towels and beer. I just can not say enough good things about this hotel.

<Content>Beautiful Resort on the Outside My husband and I booked at the new section of the resort. I walked in the room, I saw a 1 person jacuzz that was a big turn off they need to state that on the website.Also there was mold in are room 9110. Major mosquitoe problem.And other bugs spiders, cockrocahes,flys. I think they were coming out of the floor drains, cracks. The room only had a prime job not a coat of paint on the walls. We had them spray are room about 4 times we needed a mosquitoe netting for are bed.Aso I originaly I had reservation at the edenh real arena and changed plans because of construction. It also was going on at the Bavaro Suites.About 8am to 8pm. I couldnt even take a nap because of the noise.No turn down service, No daily news breifs,No alarm clock,No big screen movies on the beach,No jet skis, No waiter service on the beach. No water Trampoline, A piano bar with no piano. The restuarnt alacarte reservation desk was a joke. Did not get 1 time that we wanted all week. We were told come back the next day .Also I realize its a tropical place but they had a RAT PROBLEM . I ALSO SAW A COCKROACH ON THE MAIN BUFFET. I also fill I would of been better off taking the run of the house room. My freind was happy with here cheaper room. Now the good part of the vacation the beach the weather the ocean was wonderful. The waiter service was great the drinks were strong,flowers were beautiful. The water sport guys did a wonderful job. Entertainment staff did a great job'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''.I would go back to punta cana again. The main problem room did not get what you pay for. Reservations for ALACARTE DINNING. Also pools were clean public restrooms , beach , hotel grounds,I would like to have drinks garnish more with fresh fruit.I am planning on going back to punta cana because I thought the people are very freindly.THE WEATHER WAS GREAT:::::::::::::::::::::: April 5th to 12th.

<Content>Grand Oasis, wonderful the second time around!!! A group of 20 friends went to the Grand Oasis April 5-12 and had a fantastic time. My husband and I had been there in January and planned a wedding for friends in this group. The wedding was AWESOME!! Jose, the PR person made all of the arrangements and even married the couple down on the beach as planned. We had champange on the beach and then had the wedding dinner in DaMarios (Italian) The housekeeping staff decorated their room. The entire staff watches every little thing, right down to the last detail. We ate at all of the restaurants, loved them all. On Friday night, we were given a special dinner on the beach because we were with Apple Vacations, steak, grilled shrimp, BBQ chicken and all of the trimmings. I cannot say enough nice things about this resort. EVERYONE does a wonderful job, from the GM, Pablo, Carin, Jose, registration staff, all of the wait staff , housekeeping and even the guys sweeping up seaweed EVERY morning. We plan on going back again in January and April 2009. May husband says he's found a new home!

<Content>an awesome vacation - loved it there First of all don't believe all the negative reviews you read. we just got back from a fantastic 1 week trip and loved our time there. We went from April 8th -15th. First all the beach is absolutely beautiful. The water is warm and clear and the sand is white. You will always find a place to lounge in at the beach. Our favorite place to lounge at though was the adult pool. If you are lucky enough to have Nico as your bartender then you will be in for a treat. Our favorite drink was the Chocolate Monkey and he truly makes it good, we had everyone in the pool drinking it at 10AM to start the day! We never had any problems with the food, we always found something to eat and everyday it was a different theme night at the Windows buffet. The service is good and fast and you can always find a place to sit down. We always had the same waiters and they automatically know what you want to drink and have it at your table before you sit down! That is service with a smile. We were in building 5 and it was close to everything, the beach, the pool and of course the buffet restaurants. The rooms were comfortable and Rosa our maid was awesome. She would always put flowers in our room and make sure our room was very clean. We had an amazing time, I would gladly go back in a heartbeat. Remember to tip when you are down there, its not expected but I know its truly appreciated by all whom work there. We are planning our next trip down there for the fall. We made wonderful friends from all over and our one week went by way too fast. Don't believe the negative talk you hear about the resort. If you go with an open mind you will enjoy yourself. Remember its not the Ritz so don't compare it to that or even go expecting that! Would I recommend this resort to my friends, absolutely I already have!

<Content>Holiday Inn on the beach meets unbearable food with plenty of "free" alcohol My wife, my 3 year old daughter, and I were at the resort during April, '08, and let me tell you, we were looking towards our trip home on the 3rd day we were there. I couldn't wait to eat something better, my daughter was subsiding on snacks that we brought from home and fruits, and my pregnant wife lost 3 pounds in one week ;-) 鈥 travel about 50% for work and I have been in my share of restaurants and hotels to compare.If you are traveling with kids, my best recommendation is to get travel insurance, I wish I had it, and from now on, I am definitely buying one! Also, make sure to bring your medical insurance cards to any trip, I am glad I did.By the way, I want to say that all Apple Vacation reps (the travel agency) were extremely polite and helpful throughout our trip, hats off to them.Let me start with good things first: If you are travel without kids, get a few cocktails to in the morning to get you through the day, and can get this resort at $700 per person / week, air included, this, probably, would be a good value, otherwise, I would stay away.Flight (3/5 stars): We booked the trip with Apple Vacations and used the chartered USA 3000 flight from Chicago. Checked in at O'Hare without any problems, Apple representatives were very helpful. The flight was non-stop, non-eventful, but the cabin was crammed, seats were uncomfortable, the plane looked old (I noticed some Air Canada logos inside the cabin), and some flight attendants weren't very polite (but some were quite nice).Once in Punta Cana, we had to pay $10 per person to get in the country (its $20 to get out if you are not with Apple Vacations, who prepay this fee). We were greeted with a bunch of luggage carriers who offered to get our bags to Apple bus, we refused and in about 10 feet were greeted by Apple rep who told us where to get on the bus. Once there, we were helped with our luggage and sat in the air-conditioned bus waiting for other people. The reason we had to wait is that some people use those non-Apple affiliated luggage people who loaded their bags on the wrong bus, and then they had to look for their luggage and reload it to the correct bus. Beware, you can still use those luggage carriers if you have a lot of stuff, just make sure that they don't leave, and you are with them to show them where you are going. Check-In (3/5 stars): I slipped the front desk person $20 to get us a good room, and we were placed in Building 2. (The best rooms from what I can see are in building 7, they can tell you that it's far (and it looks like that on the map), but really everything is very close so don't fall for that. The reason I didn't get #7 is that the guy told us he only had 1st floor, and I wanted to avoid any possible pest problems. Although we checked in at the same time, one of my fellow travelers was told to wait 3 hours to get a room, so make sure you show them the money first! In short, the check-in desk: Very helpful and accommodating if he/she knows that you are going to tip. When we were checking out, a different guy was quite rude, almost refused to take my beach towels (wanted me to go on the beach (5 min away) to return them, took my room keys and threw them on his desk, didn't say anything polite like Thank you for staying with us, and I had to remind him to get me a check-out form (which later was required to board the bus). Concierge (1/5 stars): When I tried to book dinners at the restaurants (it's required unless you are eating at the buffet), he told me that everything was booked (apparently waiting for a tip). I didn't see anyone tipping him, which explains why he looked constipated. My wife later went a raised a big deal about restaurant reservations and another lady (who was not generally taking dinner reservations) helped her, and we got all prime time reservations at all restaurants. My wife later tipped her $20 for her help.Rooms / Room Cleaning / Maintenance (3/5 stars): Room was quite comfortable, overall. But it is a Holiday-Inn style room with old bathroom and bad mattresses. On the other hand, TV and clock worked fine, there were a few US programs on, water pressure was o.k., all outlets, A/C, and fans worked as they should. I tipped the room cleaning lady $4 per day and we always had towels by noon, fridge was promptly restocked with 4-5 bottles of water (there were 2 when we arrived), 6 cans of premium beer (there were 2 cans of regular when we arrived), soda, etc. Cleaning lady did a very nice job of making beds, bringing some flowers to pretty up the room, floors were cleaned very nicely every day. I did not see any pests while staying in the room, except maybe a few ants in the bathroom. When I needed more drinking water or towels, all I had to do is call an operator and they brought everything within 15 minutes. Maintenance was fine, I saw them scrubbing streets, chopping dead leafs from the trees, gathering seaweed, adding chemicals to the pool, etc. Food (2/5 stars) / Drinks (4/5 stars): Overall, it was edible, but quite bad.Windows buffet: Breakfast and lunch were 'OK, dinners were tolerable. The servers were very helpful once they knew that they will get tipped (they refilled our coffee, juice, brought high-chair for my daughter, etc). However, if there were no servers that knew us, we had to go to a bar to ask for drinks, had to find and bring a high-chair from other table, etc, you get the picture. Restaurants: Most were pretty bad as well. (I didn't try Japanese or Aqua). They badly need chefs to come up with menus for this resort. Japanese: I didn't want to pay $15 for what I saw on the menu (poor selection) of something remotely Japanese. Aqua: Once I looked at the menu and 3 people in the whole restaurant, I said, the food does not sound appetizing, there is probably a reason why Italian and Seafood have people and this place is empty; however, my friend tried it once and said it was not bad. Tex Mex: There is Taco Bell, then 15 feet of cr鈥? then there is Tex Mex food, but the service was good.Seafood: I liked the seafood restaurant, the fish and the service were good. Italian: The Italian restaurant was hit  miss. The first time we went there, I couldn't eat their pasta, it was so bad. The next time my wife and I ordered mixed grills and enjoyed the food that evening, but I spent the next day in the bathroom. Thanks to the person who suggested bringing Imodium, it saved my life ;-) My 3 year old had diarrhea for the first 4 days and hardly ate anything, I don鈥檛 know if it was a bug that she caught in the US or down there or a combination, so I am not going to pass judgment. We went to a doctor there, who was extremely helpful and very nice, he gave us some medicine for her, it's called Perenterol and also told us not to use Imodium Pepto-Bismol with kids because it may make a possible infection much worse. At any rate, after one day of this new medicine and Gatorade (which I bought at the resort), my little one was much happier, her stool became normal and she munched the food with better appetite. If you are traveling with little kid, beware that food at the resort is generally sub par.Room Service: Almost non-existent, there are 6 sandwiches, but that is it. Keep in mind that room service is subject to a $6 charge (plus tip), unless you are an Apple vacation guest.Drinks: All alcohol beverages were good, servers used plenty of alcohol, so I'd say it was one of the best features of this place. There are no servers roaming around, so you have to go to a bar. Also, make sure you wear slippers when getting drinks, I cut my foot on a piece of broken glass near a bar, not sure how it got there since I only saw plastic glasses being used.Service (2/5): Some servers are nice, but others make you feel like they are doing you a favor. My friend had especially bad service experience, they were rude to him (refused to give bath towels saying they didn't have any, and he should come back the next day). It took a call from Apple rep to get him towels. Also, a casino dealer was very rude to him, ignoring his questions, throwing chips. What I experienced is the indifference by some service staff to the guests. It worth mentioning that not all of them speak English so you may not get much help unless you go to the front desk or call an operator. Beach/Ocean/Pool (4/5): Beach was not bad, plenty of palm trees, there were enough umbrellas to take shade under (but only if you get up at 6AM to reserve the place with beach towels). Water was warm and relatively clean to swim in, not counting occasional smell of diesel from nearby parked boats or sewer smell from time-to-time. Watch out for occasional broken glass in the sand. Also, right on the beach, in the middle of the hotel property, there is a run-down shack that's literally falling apart (apparently original owner refused to sell, so he's just sitting there day in and day out, not bothering anybody). Entertainment (4/5): Ok, my daughter was sick, then I was sick, so we didn't get a chance to enjoy everything. However, it does look like there are plenty of things to do for people with older children (10+ years) or people without children. There are games at the pool, casino, dancing, billiards, tennis, exercise, movies, etc. They go around with exotic animals (parrots, monkey, lizard) to take pictures ($10/printed pic or $50/CD containing 10 pics). There are excursions, snorkeling, diving, speed boats, deep see fishing, etc. I only did snorkeling and speed boats; speed boats event was very fun while snorkeling was uneventful, there are not a lot of fish and there is no colorful exotic reef, just a bunch of rocks. Surrounding Area (1/5): I did the trip to a nearby store to pick up some diapers and the scenery is 鈥?well, 3rd world country, garbage on the street, smell of sewer, roads are beat down, etc; in short, there is no reason to venture out. Conclusion: I would not recommend this resort to anyone except if you are traveling without kids to enjoy the sun, free drinks, and don't mind feeling ignored by the hotel staff, can tolerate bad food, average rooms, and have dollars in your pocket to flash them every time you need something. Enjoy!

<Content>Beautiful Resort!!! We just got back from a 7 night stay at the Grand Oasis booked through Apple Vacations and had a great time. Do not listen to the bad reviews!!! Some people are just snotty and forget that they are in a different country and expect the world to revolve around them. CHECK IN We checked in around 12:00 noon and got right into our rooms. We got a welcome cocktail and a cold towel while waiting to check in. Some people had to wait to get into their rooms, but people need to keep in mind that if you are checking in before 3pm (check in time) you might have to wait. Our room was in building 3 on the bottom floor. My only complaint was that the halls echoed and other guests were VERY NOISY at night, so maybe request a room on the second or third. They were remodeling the room right next to us and we were initially concerned about the noise, but it turned out to be no problem at all. They didn't start working until later in the morning. ROOMS We tipped the maids a few dollars every day and let notes about what we wanted stocked in the fridge. She did a great job. They did take the towels in the morning and then brought clean ones back in the afternoon. We always had them in plenty of time to shower before dinner.RESORT The resort itself in absolutley beautiful and well maintained. There were palm trees and beautiful plants everyone. There was always staff cleaning up. There were some flamingos in one of the pools. BEACHThe beach was beautiful and always very clean. Staff raked up any seaweed on the beach. We walked up the beach for several miles and our beach was actually the cleanest. The water was warm and crystal clear. There were always plenty of beach chairs. The huts did get snatched up early but we did not want them. We switched our towels every day at the towel hut. Make sure you get your towel cards back at the end of your stay and turn them in when you check out or they will charge you.FOODThe buffet and beach grill were both very good. We always found plenty to eat. They did a good job of offering different choices every day, so it did not get repetitive. They had Italian Night, Mexican Night and so on. There is definitley more variety at Windows Buffett. Make sure you make reservations for dinner early in your stay. They didn't let us pick the nights we wanted to go to the restaurants. They said they were full, but they really were not. I think you have to be a little pushy when making the reservations, but we didn't know that. We ate at the American Grill and Da Mario. Both were excellent. We tipped at both restaurants. The service was great!EXCURSIONWe booked the Outback Safari through our rep. I highly reccomend it this tour. We were picked up at the hotel at 8am and got dropped off a 5pm. I think it is a good idea to get away from the resort and see how real Domincans live and that is just what this tour is. We visited a school, a real home, a coffee, sugar, and cocoa plantation, a ranch and went to a private beach. The countryside is breathtaking and it was nice to see other parts of the country. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and I would reccomend it to anyone. People need to remember that they are in a foreign country and not to expect it to be just like the US. Use your brain and common sense and don't let tiny things bother you and you will have an unforgetable trip.

<Content>Relaxing Vacation This is our 4th trip south and our 2nd to Punta Cana. We always book at 4 or 5 star resorts.Go and have fun. The resort is fine an the service is good. The culture of the Dominican people is to be laid back, so relax, walk slow and enjoy.CHECK INOur room was not ready so we went ahead and had a drink and some lunch. We also went to check out where our room would be and it was going to be on the first floor. We went back and asked to be moved off the ground floor and we were accomodated and went to 3rd floor, building 4.ROOMOur room had a nice view and very high ceilings being on the top floor. It could use some fresh paint for sure and sometimes the tub leaked but that didn't bother us. Room was always very clean. If on day one you leave an extra dollar by the mini-fridge and let the maid know what you want (in Spanish), your fridge will be restocked with an extra beer or two! Some days the towels came around 4 or so but that was okay since we always went to supper around 7 or 8. Balcony was pleasant to sit out and we enjoyed it. In one review I read about too many birds ---- it is tropical - of course there are birds!!FOODBuffet was fine - typical of any the resorts we have been too. Beach restaraunt was very relaxing for breakfast as it was quiet and you were looking out over the ocean.TexMex/American Grill. Excellent. We ate there 2 nights. Very good food and very good service. Italian. Excellent as well. Ate there one night.BEACHES AND POOLSWe visited all. If you need a hut for shade - get up early. If not you can always find a chair at a good location any of the places. Beach is beautiful and being next the the marina you have lots to watch with boats, etc. Also very close to food, drinks, etc. which is nice.Adult pool. Nice and quiet for reading or napping. Nico, the bartender there, is the resorts best!Other pool. Lots of activities if you want - noisier because the Animation Team is always doing something. Swim up bar - what can you say - a swim up bar is always great!SUNWINGVery good service and Antoine was very helpful.OVERALLThere is alot of other things about the resort I could go on with but basically the grounds are beautiful but some of the buildings are getting a little old. Overall, we had a great time. It is not perfect, but if you are pleasant with the staff, they are very pleasant and helpful to you. You're on vacation - relax and have fun.

<Content>Definitely not a 5-star resort... It was our first Caribbean vacation, but I have to admit I expected more for the money.... It is not a 5-star resort!Pros:1. Room was in a good condition (bldg#2 鈥?we gave a $20 tip to get a better room), maid service is excellent (subject to a $4 daily tip) 鈥?Angela was great - the room was always clean and the fridge was well-stocked.2. Overall resort was quite clean and 50-70% of staff was friendly.3. Resort doctor was very nice and helpful 鈥?my Daughter was very sick for 4 days with the stomach flu. He gave us some kind of medication (everything is Spanish) and she was in a tip-top shape after 12 hours! Plus we didn鈥檛 have to pay anything, b/c we were able to use our insurance (not counting a tip, of course).4. Pool 鈥?great.5. Weather and ocean 鈥?really enjoyed both!6. Haven鈥檛 seen any bugs, roaches or rats 鈥?progress!!!!!Cons:1. TERRIBLE FOOD!!!!! The best place at the resort is Italian Restaurant, but in my opinion, I would rather go to Olive Garden. We ate there once and my husband got sick! Stay away from American Grill - food is simply inedible. Windows (buffet) is great for breakfast or lunch, but dinner selection is very poor (at least they compensate with the friendly staff!!). Seafood place is acceptable. Room service selection has ONLY 6 mediocre sandwiches for lunch and dinner...Japanese place did not appeal us at all - menu is limited and not enticing at all.2. Impossible to make reservation to the restaurants if you don鈥檛 tip! My husband didn鈥檛 tip and the rep gave him American Grill reservation for 8pm at night, saying that this is only one availability for the entire week, b/c somebody cancelled. When we got to the restaurant 鈥?the place was EMPTY!!!! 鈥?Later, I spoke to another rep - Annie, who was very kind and helped me to get reservations for every night of our 1-week stay there.3. Beach is not very clean. Aside from the seaweed (which is cleaned daily), watch out for broken glass.4. ATM machine dispenses only pesos 鈥?bring cash with you!Overall, our experience was o.k. Would I recommend this place to anyone? Probably yes鈥? but only for students.

<Content>Be Aware...Do Your Research Before You Go! We just returned from the Grand Oasis Punta Cana on April 13, 2008鈥irst I need to say that I鈥檝e been a member of Trip Advisor for a number of years and always read the reviews prior to booking a resort. I have found this site has given me some great information from resorts to travel advice. This is my first time writing a review because I haven鈥檛 had any problems and have always been very happy with my vacations. However, I realized during this trip, whether it鈥檚 a good experience or a bad one, I vowed to write reviews so others can benefit. Unfortunately this year I am starting with a not-so-good review.A little information about me鈥鈥檝e been going to the Dominican for eight years. We started in the Puerta Plata area before discovering the wonderful beaches on the Punta Cana side so this is where we have vacationed for the past five years. Each year we choose a different 鈥?-5鈥?star resort like the Melia Caribe, Bahia Principle, Casa de Mar, Caribe Club Princess etc., all very nice in their own way, clean, with good to great food, no complaints. I travel with friends from work and we normally stay for two weeks. This year our husbands decided that they would like to come with us, so we planned for a one week vacation instead of two weeks. Thank God we did!!!Arrival: Upon arrival at the resort (11:30 am) we were greeted with a tropical drink, and a cold welcoming facecloth. At check-in we were told that we would not be able to get our rooms until 3:00 pm, a real pain but this sometimes happens in the Dominican. We came prepared for the delay, and waited for the buffet to open for lunch. So don鈥檛 expect to get your rooms until 3. The staff at check-in were friendly and accommodating with us, however this was not the case with other folks. Others checking in had problems with the resort overbooking and we witnessed many angry people. I don鈥檛 understand how a resort overbooks once they have confirmation of a client鈥檚 reservation. The travel agencies have to start taking responsibility for this. No one should have to start a vacation on such a sour note.Rooms: We were in building three overlooking the pool/beach, so we had one of the good views. Our rooms were adjoining which was nice, and all in all not that bad, a little tired but the resort is in the middle of renovating. There was trouble with the air conditioner, but once reported they came the next day. For the entire week we did not receive our clean towels until 5:00 pm or later, which made it impossible to bathe before dinner. Facecloths and hand towels were a luxury and most of the time we had none. Apparently the resort has a shortage of linen. Food: I don鈥檛 have a lot of good things to say on this subject. There are four a鈥檒a鈥檆arts which can be booked at the same time instead of daily; American/TexMex one restaurant with terrible food, hardly edible, poor service, staff not very friendly.Seafood; food was good, again service not great, staff seemed very unhappy.Italian; the best they have to offer, we ate there twice and the staff was always friendly. Don鈥檛 let the beef dishes in the buffet turn you off in this restaurant as the beef is a real treat.Japanese; never ate there, as we felt that an all inclusive should not charge and we refused to pay $15.00 per person for a meal.Buffet; the food was the same all week, breakfast was about the best, good omelets and bacon (when they have it) with a nice selection of breads. Lunch and Dinner were the same things all week, not much taste, and many many flies all around the dining room. I have been to other resorts where they had an open buffet, this one was closed in and I think there were more insects there then anywhere else. Desserts were very sad, nothing like other resorts, again very little taste, and the same selection. On a good note the staff was the friendliest and always served you with a smile. Beach: the resort is situated next to Natura Park and is probably on the worst section of Bavaro Beach, a lot of seaweed, even though the staff was good at raking it up daily, the water wasn鈥檛 as clear or clean as I鈥檝e seen at other resorts and there were a lot of boats anchored all over the beach area. The beach needed cleaning, as garbage and glass were lying around. The only person we saw doing anything was a boy picking up the cups and taking them back to the bar. We walked up the beach (about a couple of miles) and the two resorts next door weren鈥檛 any better. However, the water was lovely and warm so we certainly took advantage of the beach, but it could have been a lot cleaner. Entertainment: Where do I start鈥?we arrived on Saturday so the first show was the highly anticipated 鈥淢ichael Jackson鈥?show, music was good, as it was original and the dancing was great. They apparently contract with a group that travels from resort to resort with the same show, they are not on staff. We didn鈥檛 know this at the time and thought great good entertainment, next night was the Caribbean show, terrible dancing, all they did was scream through the show, not much entertainment and people were actually leaving. This was the same night after night, people left before the show ended it was terrible. On a good note they had some nice music and dances for the children. Grounds/Pools: beautiful, mature trees, and flowers, nice layout for a small resort. Not very many maintenance men cleaning up the dead palms or plants, they need more staff, as the place could have been cleaner. Pools are nice, large main pool with a swim-up bar along with various sections in the pool for playing volleyball, swimming, or just sitting around enjoying the jets. There are two other pools, which are located between buildings making them rather lengthy but nice and quiet for swimming. There is also an adult pool which we saw but never swam in. My only complaint about the pools is that I never saw any maintenance or cleaning of the main pool the entire time I was there. Remember my room was overlooking the pool, so you鈥檇 think I would have seen some chemicals being added especially to a swim-up bar pool.Unwelcomed Visitors: this is certainly not my favorite subject, but one I feel is necessary. This resort has very large cockroaches, crawling around. I didn鈥檛 see any in the rooms, 鈥渢hank God鈥?but they were by the bar and casino. They also have RATS, not mice, but big RATS. Now I don鈥檛 know about you, but I didn鈥檛 feel like I should pay a good sum to see rats. I am not foolish, I know rats are mainly around food areas, but these ones were seen by the pool and by the buildings where we stay. I have never encountered rats before and pray I won鈥檛 again. I believe the trouble with this resort is due to the location. It is right off the main street, where the garbage is all over, housing for the locals is located about 300 feet from the resort and there is a major sewage problem outside off the resort. Nice welcome!!!Conclusion: I feel we didn鈥檛 make a good choice this year but we certainly didn鈥檛 let the resort spoil our time. If you have already booked your trip go with this knowledge but make the best of it, as you are the ones who will lose out in the end. If you are shopping around for a resort, be aware of what I said, it is the truth, I have nothing to gain by writing this review. We all learn from our mistakes and hopefully this won鈥檛 happen to us again. If you are in your thirties or younger you may not mind this resort, as there were lots of young people around having a great time. My husband and I, along with our friends are in our fifties and we like to have a resort that is cleaner, friendlier, with more features. The Grand Oasis is a small resort, with a casino, three bars, one by the beach, one in the theater and one located by the main pool, a theatre, spa, fitness centre, internet, and several small very expensive shops. If you have any questions please email me and I will try to answer them.

<Content>A fabulous vacation I have to say that I had an amazing time in Punta Cana. I was traveling with my family, a group of 18 people, ranging in age from 18 months to 61 yrs. The resort is beautiful and very well kept. The rooms are spacious and tended to very nicely. The staff is friendly and willing to help you whenever they can. I am a chef in Philadelphia and I must say that the food well exceded my expectations. We ate at the buffet mostly, but ate one night at the Italian restaurant and the Japanese Hibachi. I rarely ate something that I did not like or that I thought was not prepared well. For lunch I preffered the buffet by the beach.There are quite a few bars so it never took very long to be served. I felt that the bartenders at the Backstage Bar made the best drinks, but the pool bar was always the most fun.We very much appreciated the nightly movies and shows in the theatre, and mini disco was always entertaining for the kids.Some of us had spa treatments and we are all very happy with services provided. The only thing negative I have to say about the resort pertains to the scuba and fishing excursions. I am not sure if the people are directly linked to the resort but the trips were lacking just a bit and not all that well organized or of the best equipment.I can not wait to return to the resort and I know that I absolutely will!!!!!!

<Content>dominican trip # 4 I am writing this reviewing after being in the DR 4 times. I have stayed at the Grand Oasis one other time previously called Sunscape that was about 2 1/2 years ago,,things have changed. We only paid 800 for 8 days so for the value it was so worth it,, but the older buildings are a bit run down!! and no renovations or touch ups to these buildings have been made in the last 2 years ( rusted doors, doors not shutting,, cleaniness).The restrauants are good but make sure you make reservations, and when they tell you they are full,, dont take no for an answer we ate at a different restaruant every night and they were good. The buffets at Windows, and Beach Grill are very repititous and food is not great. The downfall I found going this time of year was that it is sooo crowded, we needed a hut on the beach or the pool for a few in my group we had to set an alarm for 5;30 everyday in order to get one, although we didnt encounter a problem, people at times were actually fighting over them.There are no floating mats in the pool like shown on line or in the previous years, so you may want to bring your own. If you are looking for things to do at night, there is not much Shows put on by the staff are ok,,, then there is a piano bar (that has no piano and no entertainment) Karoke is suppose to be there but was not, there is a SMALL casino,, and a disco (crowd quite young there). other than that thats it. The lazy river that is advertised is just another small pool.. I would defintely go back again to the DR,, I just think I would try a different hotel,,,,, we were told when we were there the RUI and Sunscape the beach are the nicest.Good luck, and have a great time,,the weather is wonderful!!!

<Content>All right, but too noisy and overcrowded Just came back from this resort so decided to share my experience. check in was fast, we arrived about 9pm. our room was ready for us(the thing I liked was the code card instead of a key). The resort is not that big on the shore line but it has about 7 3 store buildings, which means there are a lot of people.it was very noisy. We were awaken every day because staff was using carts on a stoned road, which makes a lot of noise, plus they love to sing and at 6.30-7am it's not a good thing.Then by 9am there is no places left at the beach so it's a pain to find yourself a chair and luck of shades is noticeable. The food was ok, but the variety was pretty poor (after Bahia principe resort) and sometimes it was hard to find what to eat.It was very expensive to shop there plus we were really annoyed by the sales people who were literally dragging us to their booths and bargaining all the time.not enough entertainments for kids, they were running with adults all the time.The bottom line is, it was nice to go to a sunny place after long winter in Toronto, but we would not go there again.

<Content>Beautiful Resort, Ugly Service Let me preface this review by saying that we won this trip in a contest. We would never choose an all-inclusive type of resort because we value quality over quantity. The front desk service was extremely inept. We were forced to wear these ridiculous yellow wrist bands for the entire week. When I asked why we had to wear them, Edgar, the front desk clerk, asked us if we wanted to eat or not. How tacky and rude. Edgar continued to be rude to us throughout our entire stay. The maid service was deplorable. At Grand Oasis, the maids must not follow the rule that towels that are hanging up should be left alone and towels that are on the floor should be taken away. We were constantly without towels. The maid removed all our towels (clean and dirty) every morning, leaving us with none until next morning. We had to beg the front desk for clean towels every day. By the third day, I was forced to lock up clean towels in my suitcase so they would not be taken away. Our safe did not work, so we were forced to lock our valuables in a suitcase. The resort is loud. There is a constant, steady stream of techno music piped throughout the lobby, all common areas, pools, restaurants, bars, bathrooms, even on the beach. The music is loud and grates on the nerves after a while. The watersports activity center was by far the worst aspect of this resort. Rude, apathetic staff ruined our snorkling trip. We paid 40 dollars US to go snorkling about a half mile off-shore. We asked about snorkling gear before we got on the boat. Monica, who worked at the watersports building, dismissively waved her hand toward the boat, indicating that gear was available once we boarded. There was no gear. We asked about the gear again when we reached the dive boat, and got a no English response. We were stranded on the boat with no gear. The boat operator found a dirty mask laying on the bottom of the boat and offered it to me. Um, no thanks. We asked for a refund and were met with attitude instead. Finally, the manager gave us our money back, but only after 20 minutes of haggling. No apologies were given for our wasted time. We were constantly bothered by Vacation Club reps on the resort, trying to get us to buy a vacation club through Oasis Resorts. We were hounded by these Vacation Club reps every. single. day. They are staked out all around the pools and outside every restaurant. A simple no, thanks was not enough. They even insulted us after we told them we were not interested for the last time by telling we were cheapskates for not snapping up such a good offer. Bottom line is this: go to Grand Oasis Punta Cana if you want to be treated poorly by apathetic, unfriendly staff. I was happy to leave that place.

<Content>Loved the Grand Oasis Punta Cana Grand Oasis Punta CanaDate: April 3rd to the 10th. Booked our vacation with Sunwing. We travelled with Sunwing and I can't say enough good about them. Flights were on time and the service on the plane was excellent. ROOM: We arrived at 1h00am and check-in was very fast. We stayed in Building 3 top floor view on the beach and the room was very adequate. Spacious and very clean. The only negative point is the pillows. They are lumpy and not comfortable. If you have room in your suitcase bring yours. We tipped the maid every day and she provided us with everything we needed. To make sure we got what we needed I wrote it down on paper and she always left what was asked for. Tip: before leaving I went on the internet and translated some phrases from English to Spanish, ex: we need more towels please or we need bottled water or beer or soft drinks. I found that very helpful and it made it easy for the maid to understand our needs.  ENTERTAINMENT: The grounds are very well kept. The workers work hard to keep it that way. The entertainment was good. Movies every night at 8h00 but mostly for kids. The week we were there: Ratatouille, Spiderman, Monster Inc and Eight below. We saw the Michael Jackson show which was exceptional. Another show with the Dominican dancers that was very entertaining as well and a beach party the last night we were there. They are shows available every night. On your way to the theatre you find the shopping area and the boutiques. We walked in all of them are the sales people were very nice, not pushy and curtious. There is also an internet cafe, a casino and a spa-gym also. At the theatre after the movies they have dances for the small kids. FOOD: The food was delicious. You are sure to find something you like picky or not. The main buffet Windows has a great variety of food from pasta to fish to pork, beef, shrimps, cheeses and so on and so on. Know that they don't have coffee cream; they only have that powdered stuff. The butter is not salted like we are used to but by mid-week we had gotten to like it. We made reservations at the Seafood, the Grill and Italian Restaurants. All 3 of them were very good. The Grill is more Mexican but I did have the best steak there. Seafood was perfect, had the mahi mahi dinner and my sister had the seafood brochette, all very delicious. The Italian restaurant had a very nice setting and the food was again delicious. No waiting at any of these 3 restaurants and the service was excellent. We did leave a tip at all 3 of them. For what you are served leaving at least $5.00 tip is certainly fair. FACILITIES: The public bathrooms around the complex are exceptionally very very clean and always decorated with flowers and palm leaves. BEACH: The beach is great and kept free of seaweeds by the workers. The water was very nice, clear and warm. There are some vendors that are selling like parasailing, banana boat rides, glass bottom boat rides, tours, swimming with dolphins excursion but I can鈥檛 say they were a bother. It is best to book your tours with your representative. They have a list of all that is available for your enjoyment and at least you know the price is good. TIP: Bring lots of suntan lotion cause buying some in the boutiques will cost you at least 20$ a bottle. On the beach there are palapas (parasol) and if you want to make sure you get one for the day then you have to get up early (6h00 am) and reserve one by simply putting your beach towel on the chairs. I don't like this system would much prefer first come first serve but that is not how it workds. I have seen some palapas reserved and not used until 1h00 pm. I don't think that is fair but that is how the system works. COMMENTS: Did not see any bugs anywhere. The staff is always very friendly and alway ready to help you out. You can have all the drinks you want but don't expect Canadian Club to mention one. You are in the Dominican Republic and will be served their local liquor. Bahama Mama is very good and so is the Miami vice. We did not go to the pool area for we are beach people. The pool areal in my opinion is good for a younger crowd. Lots of entertainment there and a bit too loud for my taste. If you like joining in the games you will find what you are looking for in such things as dancing lessons, aerobics, volley ball, all kinds of games. We met a lot of nice people there and our vacation was a great one. I highly recommand this Beach Resort.

<Content>Very Good Resort, but keep thieves in mind!! My stay at the Grand Oasis was very good overall! weather was good, resort hotel and grounds were well maintained, food was quite good, and service was very good. However, a word to the wise to future travellers that may stay here....keep thieves in mind. We all know that we should keep our valuables secured within the safe of the hotel room, which I did, however, I did not think I would have to lock up my clothes!!! Believe it or not, but the maid stole a few items of clothing from my suitcase. Ridiculous! A word to the wise...keep your suitcase locked or be present while housekeeping is cleaning your room, I know I will do this on any future vacations that I will take.

<Content>GREAT VACATION AT THE OASIS My Husband and I stayed at the Grand Oasis from March 22th to the 29th. We had a great vacation and would recomend this Resort. We had read the reviews prior to leaving and the ones that complain, probably would complain at a 5* Resort. The resort is older but the grounds are very well kept, clean and beautiful. The staff is very friendly and I was surprised how many understood french and english.The Girl at the front desk was very awesome and after a little mix-up with our room, she upgraded us building 7, which is one of the new buildings. Our room was just beautiful and we had a view of the lazy pool and the beach. The maid did a good job cleaning our room and stocking our mini-fridge everyday.The beach is very nice and the staff did a good job cleaning the seaweed every day. There are always beach chairs available but if you want shade, make sure you go really early in the morning. If you walk to the left of the resort, past the other 2 resorts, you can walk for miles on a beautiful private beach. We just walked 5 minutes every day to go swiming on that beach beacause the water was just awesome and there were not a lot of people around. If you like to take long walks, this is the perfect place for it.We didn't spend much time at the pools but we could see how nice and clean they were. We prefer the beach.The food was good and there was always lots to choose from at the Windows buffet. We enjoyed the beach buffet for lunch and we went to 3 a la carte restaurants. They were all great. Be sure to go early to book your reservation for the restaurants.All in all, this was a great place for a vacation and we would return to this resort. Remember that you are on vacation and if you don't let the small stuff get to you, you will enjoy your stay at the Gran Oasis. A smile and patience goes a long way.

<Content>great vacation for two! Rooms We got a good deal from Sunwing (after a cancellation of our Mayan Riviera destination just one week before!! with no explanation!) so we were debating upgrading to the suites, but ultimately were still on a budget so chose the deluxe room. Initially had some problems, which gave us about one hours worry about our choice, but front desk and maintenance were quick to fix an adjoining door which had swelled open (maybe a family had been there all week and kept it open?) Also took a little wiggling to get the balcony door secured to my boyfriend's standards. Room was huge with King-sized bed, comfortable, with a closet with shelves and lots of drawers to put our stuff. Not the case in all rooms as we got a glimpse of a few down the hall. Could be the difference between a deluxe and standard room? Also suite rooms in Building 7 definitely nicer, but we ended up liking our room in Building 3 very much, close to beach and activities and as one woman in 7 said much closer to the bars to get a drink! However, one thing we noticed....DAMP. Took two days for our towels to dry from home and clothes and sheets always a little damp, which strangely enough didn't bug us while there but as you will see cost us on the way home!! Jeans not a good idea in any case, as I like to wear jeans capris and skirts. Not a good idea with the humidity! Tahira, our maid, was quick to answer any concerns about the room if spoken to directly, esp. about our preference for Coke Light and a remote that worked. Otherwise clean towels, face cloths and room every day. Did tip her few bucks a day, she obviously worked hard all day, but always had a smile or singing.Restaurants We had no problems finding something to eat at any time of day. Buffet breakfast had alot of selection, Carlos, our AM waiter always ready with a smile, high five and my tea, was the best, there for breakfast and lunch. Dinner waiters we found hard to get drinks from or missing cutlery, just seemed not to care as much as earlier staff. We ended up eating and leaving quickly to go to the pool bar to relax after dinner. We also tipped when we had good service, but guess the evening waiters actually never got to find that out! Italian was ok, but our reser was for 9:45, and we ended up pigging out at the beach grill on chicken and fries so we wouldn't be hungry!!! Needless to say we were still a little full. We missed the seafood place because I got sick (tried to blame the food, but my boyfriend was quick to point out the amount of rum I had the night before....oops) But we didn't think we missed out on much because was so windy couldn't have been that pleasant. American Grill we ate at twice and really liked it...loved the chips and salsa before the meal! First time we had resers, second time on our last night we just walked in and asked if we could be seated. Good beef enchilada in the combo, liked the fajitas. Also, could still find food to eat when i was not feeling my best...nothing a little white rice and bananas couldn't fix!Bars No complaints there...when I found my drink a little weak at the pool bar just asked for a little more rum. No problem. May have been the start of my downfall that day! My boyfriend thought the Presidente beer on tap tasted like Coors light, but we also loved the Vodka and orange with fresh orange juice....and can't forget the BananaMamas! Little too sweet to drink all week tho'. Pool bar very refreshing to sit in the water and get your drink or wander around the pool with it.Beach and Pools Beach was great, always cleaning up the seaweed, and always found a nice place to lounge when we wanted. Took a long walk to the left past the other resorts (we're really nosy about how other people are living!) and found the undeveloped beach and the sunset our first day there. Meant to go back but just never made it. Main pool was nice and refreshing , alittle bit of debris floating, but a guy cleaning it during the middle of the day. Always noticed someone cleaning something! Was windy some of the days we were there so could understand. other pools looked nice but never made it to swim as main pool more active and closer to the bar! Grounds Just amazing and beautiful! Took way too many pictures of flamingoes for my BF's taste but they made it seem more like paradise. Maybe saw some kind of a funky squirrel or rodent run across the end of the hall, but it's open, what can you do.Activities and Entertainment BF caught a beach volleyball game and was quite happy, we did the banana boat for $10 bucks each one day and the 1 hour snorkelling from the glassbottom boat for $20. Was worth it, as bread in hand attracts many coloured fish, blue and yellow, with some duller striped fish and some blending into the coral. Caught two shows which were entertaining, but missed alot of them as just getting through the kids show required more alcohol than I could handle all week! My son probably would have loved it, but....little too much! Disco was fun and packed the one night we made it, with animation staff staying to get the party started...they work long hours!! Casino was fun as my bf won on the 25 cent slots...I managed to grab $175 of his winnings...paid for our dunebuggy excursion and more. Animation staff also busy all day doing all kinds of exercises, games, dancing, etc. Fun to watch, didn't get too involved tho'.Tours Through Sunwing, booked the Country Adventure tour, which we figured, you can't visit a country without learning a bit about it. Didn't regret it one bit, very interesting and entertaining guide Alberto, forgot the school supplies I meant to bring for the kids, but others remembered. Really an experience to see how other people live in other countries. Bought some oregano off of the woman who's house (shack) we visited, then raw sugar and vanilla at the ranch. Then had some panicky thoughts going through customs with an unlabelled container of green leaves and white crystals!! But had no problem there. Found out I was allergic to horses at the ranch...travellers, a little Benadryl, Gravol and Immodium can't hurt and make sure you have your Ventolin if you're even a little asthmatic...you never know what your trigger will be (I'm a Nurse). Missed out on swimming at the beautiful beach because others in our group had dinner resers and we were late already. Oh well.Next we took the Tropical Storm Happy Hour Sunset Tour. Got stuck on a boat full of french-speaking people but luckily found two other english couples. Got to snorkelling point and unfortunately the Tropical storm part came out....the waves were too big and the boat ahead of us were rescuing their passengers as we got there!! Apparently some tail-end of a hurricane was causing big waves....and clouds! There went our sunset...no wonder I had too much rum. Still had fun but wouldn't do this tour again...only rum, coke, sprite, orange soda and beer on that boat. But the little bottles of mamajauna with our pictures on them were cute and only 10 bucks.The 3rd and final excursion (we found out we're not lounge people) was the dunebuggy ride. The MOST FUN we had all week....awesome, we were filthy and loving it. Finally made it to the Macao Beach we had missed earlier, which was amazing...but alot of kids and people trying to sell stuff while you're trying to wash off! Cheapie, cheapie, just 4 u! Then back in the dirt and off to a natural pool in a cave....equally amazing. At the end they offer you horse riding...I skipped this time!Departure and Check Out Went fine at the hotel. get the phone cards to call home though...my bf mistakenly made a ten second call home to Canada and it cost us $9. Phone cards are $20 for 18 min, internet $5 for 20 min, but for two days one of the computers was free so everyone kept sneaking on! Ok, here's the thing about damp rooms....you're luggage weighs a heck of a lot more going home than when you came. I bought some souvenirs, but nothing major, some pareos and necklaces for the kids, three little bottles of rum and coke light for my bf. However, when we got to the airport, they told us both our bags were overweight and charges us $100...between the two of us 10 kilos over. I can't figure out how since when we left both bags were under, but when I unpacked my jeans felt like they came out of the washer damp....that's all I can figure out....but caution for anyone who likes to skirt the limit, they will charge and we weren't the only ones because they kept announcing for all the people who paid overweight charges to verify their receipts at the airport. I'm thinking some kind of scam too, but whatever...they took american or canadian, they didn't care as long as it was cash!! I felt like a criminal.Conclusion We definitely had a great time, our first trip away from the kids by ourselves as a couple, you could definitely have a romantic, fun, amazing time here. We have no idea what a 5 star would be like, but we're not fancy smancy people and Grand Oasis suited us just fine! had a little of everything for us. We also like the size of the resort, not so big you needed a trolley to get from place to place, could walk to everything easily(especially when a little sick and needed to get back to the room quick, LOL) We would consider bringing the fam back here if we ever considered bringing the kids back with us, but I think we might keep it our little place for now (there's five of them!!)

<Content>wonderful Resort Nfld canada Grand oasis is a great resort.Our family spend two weeks there.We had a wonderful time.The weather was beautiful. Here is just a little imformation on the resort itself.I hope it helps you with your vacation.We were welcomed to the resort with drinks soon as we arrived which was 11pm.Check in was quick .We were given building 3 top floor .Thebedroom were very clean and spaces.We did have problems with our maid though she would forget towels and to fill our refridgerator even though we left her tips daily. But a call to the front desk would take care of the issues.They were there to make sure everything was going smooth.Food: was great .We have two teenager that found there was always something there to eat.(hotdogs,hamburgers,french fries,onion rings,pizza.pasta, nachos,nuggets,).American Grill was delicious.Japanese was good.We weren't that please with the food in the Italian and Aque rest. Beach was a little disappointing.There was always seaweed there even though the workers tried very hard to keep it cleaned up you would see them raking it all day.Pools: are very clean, and the swim up bar was very nice. Quick service even for the teenagers. Lazy rivers are beautiful and very relaxing.Entertainment: The workers work very hard ,and are always entertaining you.Lots of volleyball,darts,contest,and games for all ages thoughout the day.Nightly there are movices for the kids and around 9:30 there is a show,ete.(the circus) was my favorite .The two weeks we were there I never seen any rats,mouse ,or any large bugs that some of the other reviews have said.This resort is very clean.The works are constantly cleaningJust a few items to remember to take with you on your trip:flashlights the power did go of for a few hours during the night (about 3 or 4 times )and for about 2 hours each time.medication for stomach pain .Off for the bugs. I hope you enjoy your trip and remember to relax this resort is very nice and it is very clean.I would go back ,we have travelled for the last 6 years to other resorts in Cuba and Dominican and this one is just as nice as the other 4 -4.5 star resorts we stayed on.

<Content>Great Place To Stay Me and Wife arrived at this resort on March 21- 29. Check in was speedy and we recieved drinks while waiting for our rooms. The Lobby is beautful and very clean. The room we were given was very spacious and it had a private balcony. There was a bar fridge in our room, that was stocked daily with beer, coke, sprite and lots of water.There is a safe in your room that you can rent for just 18$ for the week. It is a good peace of mind and worth the money.The resort is not overly big which is a plus and the beach is no wheres away.The Staff are very friendly and would go out of there way to please you, we were really impressed with this. Our Maid Angela De Garcia was really nice. She would have swans made out of towels and fresh cut flowers put inroom on a daily basis, she was a darling.We stayed in building 5 and our room was on the ground floor next to the pool and hot tub. There is a bar there and the bartenders name is Nicholas. He was perfect and always aiming to please us. He would make sure our bubbas was always full.The Resort is very well kept up and the gardeners are always seen cleaning up the place and picking up the dead leafs and stuff and always with a smile on there face. Pools are great and the swim up bar is good as well but closes to early in the afternoon. There is a main bar in the middle of the resort and its open till 12 every night then there is the disco and that is open till 2 every night.Be very very cautious about the people who are selling stuff on the resort. There are stores or mini mall there and they are there to rip you off big time, especially the store called TABU . STAY AWAY FROM THERE !!!!! There prices are outragous. The Girl that works there is really pushy and gets really mad once you enter if you don't buy something. We felt very intimidated and unconfrontable. It really disturbed me that the resort would allow this to go on. What you pay there you can buy on the OUTBACK SAFARI for 1/4 the cost, so be aware.The food was excellent. The resort as 5 a la Cartes and the Windows Buffett. There is also a buffett on the beach and there is pizza,fries,hotdogs,hamburgers and fied chicken when ever you want it.You have to make reservations for the fine dining, so remember to book them once you arrive. Seating is very limited.We did two excursions off the resort and loved both. We had a blast on the KON-TIKI cruise/snorkiling and we went on the OUTBACK SAFARI. This is where you can buy all the cheap things like RUM,Cigars,Art,souviniers. On this trip we visited a school, please bring supplies with you, they really need it and the kids faces light up like christmas trees. Our guide on this trip was excellent. His name was ALEX . He was very informational and showed us alot of very different things. Overall the resort and the pople that work there are very friendly . This resort is not classified has 5 stars but you get the 5 star treatment, plus the price is right. I would without no hesitation go back there again. Beautiful.

<Content>Take the good with the bad.... We have just returned from this resort booking at the very last minute this was recommended over the other sell offs we looked at and it was close to the airport which felt more reassuring having never been to the resort. The tour guide was cheerful and informative. I was disappointed by the lack of english speaking representatives/employees once at the resort. We were booked in at building six and quickly upgraded (another $300 dollars US) to block 7....amazing marble and canapy bed with jaccuzi tub....although for the first three days we had only cold water. Others informed us it was either hot or cold in their rooms. I didn't hear any noise at night in this suite until the very last night whereby new comers young and drunk arrived. Some couples informed us that they were next to construction and dogs barking at all times so when you book and it says deluxe this means very little. Aside from this there were many families and as a parent going with my partner Jeff I would deem it appropriate for both family and couples. I heard some horror stories about people arriving and their rooms were peeling, two doubles versus the deluxe and by the way the deluxe is not what it states on the review that is block 7 they are showing and we got the very last one. The food was okay and drinks were syrup not the real fruit. It was next to impossible to get a pool side recliner unless up very early as everyone puts towels on their chairs so beware of this. The a la carte venues...try booking these as soon as you get to the resort as they book up fast and unfortunately we were not able to eat at some given that we left it one day after arriving. Some charge a $15 surplus so make sure you tell the rep (who by the way doesnt speak any english). The Japenese restaurant was amazing I would highly recommend this restaurant. The other venues are by no means to our standards however the Italian was a very nice atomosphere and Aqua is very minimalist. There is a pool on the other side for adults only. We were touring at a time where europeans were there so expect topless (not that my partner minded) but is you are sensitive to this look at travel times. The night life dancers were gifted...there is true gifts in their genes! The spa is very nice I went for a Swedish massage for $60/hour but was dissapointed going back for a pedicure with my boyfriend (who also had one) given I have them all the time I was not impressed with sanitation of her utensils. I also used the medical portion as I broke out in a rash (coppertone and heat) they wanted to give me an injection and I refused so I took the oral medication. We went on the tour to Sanoma Island it was nice but not work the $80. People hound you for money so be prepared. I would not rate this a 4 star hotel I would rate it a bit less. The cleaning ladies and wait staff are excellent but remember no one speaks english. The people at the bars are not as friendly as I have seen at other resorts and we ended our friends we met ended up in an argument with a french couple about saving spots poolside...the stand off was one hour. Silliness really. Walk along the beach about 5pm and play tennis. There is a basic gym at the resort which wasnt busy afternoon or night. I have traveled to may resorts and we wanted a cheap getaway. Remember you have to pay $20 each to return to the airport and vendures bring jewellry to the resort so you really dont have to leave. My cell phone would not work and the bank maching didnt work the entire time I was there so bring cash. The casino is small and not impressive. Would not return to this resort ; overall,it was a nice time and great weather but being with the man I love always helps. I would not return to the resort but I had a nice time.

<Content>Good resort, value for Monay We travelled with 3 other families all with pre-teen kids from Sunday 23rd March to Sunday 30th March on Sunwing from Toronto. Canada. We make this annual trip to different parts of the Carribean and this was our first to the DR. Resort: Nice layout, although the rooms are in a building' format with inside hallways (some might prefer 4 unit blocks). advantages - right on the beach and everything is close by - could walk the whole resort in 5 minutes - great for finding the kids! Some buildings have older rooms which are much the worse for wear (like Building 3 where we stayed) but buildings 1 or 2 have been done up and the ground floor rooms on the North have a walk out to the lazy river pool. Airconditioning, washrooms , water pressure etc were good, and other amenities acceptable for a 4 star. The always stocked Mini bar was a good plus.Check-in and out was smooth and efficient and although we did meet Caren we did not need her help as the desk staff took care of our requests to get rooms together (and on the ground floor). Suggest to take your own recognizable beach towels and use them to secure good locations on the beach early morning. Some people tipped hotel security to hold prime spots, but we were not that particular. Beach: Good for short swims and canoing/catamarans etc. need to book early for the catamarans, but we had great weather and enjoyed them all. Also paid $ 10 each for the kids to ride the Banana boat and they loved it. Plenty of seaweed, but not a show stopper, and if you wear water shoes does not bother you much. Walk North past other resorts for a better beach, South past the small village for a lovely walk or bicycling trip. Food: Overall was above our expectations, with choices to suit everyone. Loved the Beachside buffet for lunch, Windows was good for Breakfast and occasional dinners, and we managed to get bookings for all 4 A-la cartes. Italian and Japanese were excellent, Tex Mex good and Aqua below par (poor service, bad location with no proper air circulation, food nothing to speak about). Drinks were generally good, but the red house wine was terrible if not chilled. Made friends with some bartenders and waiter so got premium drinks and special cocktails. Used our insulated mugs on the beach, mostly for Beer or the Caipirina cocktail we all loved. (Lemon juice and bitters with premium rum)Did 2 excursions: Bavario splash speedboats (recommended) and Bavario runners (buggy tour) - Not recommended. Will write a more details review of these in the excursions forum. also did the horse riding next door and Entertainment: amusing and entertaining, and good fun if you go with the right expectations. Disco ok, Piano bar acceptable (with no Piano) and Spa/Gym/games area ok for 4 star levels. Overall: Go with the right expectations (this is a good 4 star, and don't go looking for problems), plan your time well, do not overindulge in food or drink and you can have a great time - as we all did.

<Content>Pretty Good I was a little worried heading to Grand Oasis after reading the previous reviews but I can say I was pleasantly surprised. Transport to the hotel was fast and comfortable in a new air-conditioned bus. Check-in was also fast.Our room was quite nice and we had no problem with either the air-conditioning, shower, or electricity.Contrary to other reviews, I thought the food was excellent with a great variety at the buffet. I do, however, agree that getting a drink, especially a re-fill is near impossible and you will not be offered a coffee after your meal by anyone. You may want to try to a la carte restaurants- I visited the Italian restaurant on the first night and thought it wonderful- food and service. Our second night we went to the Acqua restaurant which, I must say, was really bad- the atmosphere was unpleasant with a bad smell, and our server seemed to hate his job. After that experience we stuck to the buffet but I did hear good things about the other restaurants from other tourists. Oh- and make sure to make your a la carte reservations one your first day if possible.It's true what the say about chairs- both at the pool and the beach. I noticed that people would leave a towel or shoe or book or any random item on a chair in the evening to reserve it for the following day and then wouldn't show up till late afternoon.There was also a lot of seaweed both in the water and washed up on the shore but not really much you can do about that- it could be a seasonal thing.Overall, I quite liked the place and think you will enjoy your stay.

<Author>beach bum in ohio
<Content>Nice resort We stayed at the Oasis March 21-28, 2008. First, I'll say that my husband and I knew we were going to a resort that was supposed to be a step down from what we normally went to. On an Apple Vacations scale from 1-6 apples, this resort was rated a 5 overall. That's pretty accurate. We'd give the resort grounds 5 apples and the older rooms 4 apples.Grounds: Check in/out was fast and easy. The lobby is very nice and large, with lots of places for people to sit and mingle or wait for their rides. The gardens throughout the resort were clean and very beautiful. They were constantly grooming the place to make sure it looked nice. Main Pool: huge and winding. lots of places for kids to play and for adults to relax or join in pool activities such as water aerobics. The smaller adult pool looked decent but we never went over there. we preferred to stay by the swim up bar. The wading pools near the newer buildings looked nice but we didn't go in those either. The ladies public bathroom by the main pool was clogged twice during our stay. I'm not sure if that's a result of guests who don't know how to flush or if it's a problem the resort was having.Beach: the beach is pretty big (as are most of the ones in the DR). there was a lot of seaweed but that's just because of the way the wind blows the waves in to shore. There's not much you can do about that. They were constantly cleaning it up though. We were told when we checked in that there had been a huge storm and some trees were uprooted and the original towel hut on the beach was damaged. We saw a dilapidated building on the beach, so maybe that was it? They made a big dent in removing the debris and seaweed during our stay. HOpefully that shack will come down too. Rooms: We were in room 4123, first floor, right next to the beach. We considered upgrading to the newer buildings but, once we saw our location, we decided not to. The rooms are a little older and could use some fresh paint and recaulking around the sink and tub. They're overall very clean though, and pretty much what we expected.Restaurants: the food was good no matter where we ate, but the Japanese and Italian restaurants were the best. The Japanese restaurant was our favorite. We also tried Aqua. The food was good but we didn't really care for the atmosphere. I wouldn't bother with that one. We only ate breakfast and lunch at the beachside buffet. The food was good and there was plenty of variety. There was always kid-friendly food like fries and burgers. The grill on the beach is good and is open all day if you want a snack between meals. The only staff person we had a problem with was the guy booking restaurant reservations. He was rude and didn't really listen to what you were saying. All other employees were awesome. We ate at the main buffet on our last night there and were waiting for an outdoor table. One employee made room and brought out another table for us, even after we said we had no problem waiting.Bars: we only tried the beachside bar and the pool bar. all were good. Sometimes they didn't understand why we wanted to mix certain things, but that was ok. they just laughed at us. tipping goes a long way here. we wanted mimosas a few mornings and they told us there was no champagne, until we tipped them. then all of a sudden it appeared. The white wine is better in the restaurants than it is at the courtyard/swim-up bar. They don't shy away from the alcohol in mixed drinks. A couple of times we had to tell them to ease up on the pour.The entertainment was too late at night- 9:30. We only watched the Michael Jackson show, which was pretty cool. I caught part of the beach party show and it was really boring. They took too much time getting it going.We had no problem with bugs or mosquitos. I did kill a few mosquitos in our room, but i never got bit. We always take Avon Skin So Soft bug lotion with us and never have a problem. It's better than the spray -- not so sticky and you don't smell like bug spray.Overall, I would definitely recommend this resort. The grounds are as nice as any other all inclusive we've been to. The resort could easily get a higher rating with a fresh coat of paint in some spots and redecorating the older rooms. But, if y ou're looking to save some money, book this resort. you'll have a great time.

<Content>Very relaxing vacation My wife a I had a great time on vacation even though we spent the first day and a half with no luggage. This was just one of those weather issues that screwed things up, no ones fault. If you let those kind of thing bother you need to spend your vacation at home. Now to the Grand Oasis.The Grand Oasis is a excellent resort. Very clean and maintained. We stay in Bld 7, which is the new building. Very nice junior suite. Refrig is stocked daily with beer, pop and water. The room safe is included in the room price in Bld 7, not so in the other building. I believe it was $3.00/day or $18.00 for the week in the other building. I did hear a few people complain about noisier than average air conditioners in the other buildings. My suggestion would be to make sure you book for Blg 7 just to be safe.Before I talk about food let me explain something. As many Americans that are at this resort or in Punta Cana there are as many if not more Europeans. In order for the resort to keep everyone happy, you might not find that the sellection is what you have found in Aruba, Cancun, St Thomas Etc. My purpose for going on vacation is to relax, have fun and experience different things such as food. The food here is VERY GOOD. There was always something to eat at the Windows buffet and new things were added nightly. The a la carte restaurants book quickly, so book early in your stay. I waited and was only able to get in the Tex-Mex. I have the Red Snapper which was excellent. Service. The service was great and friendly every where in the resort. Check in was quick and both the resort and Angel, our Apple rep where helpful in making sure we got our luggage and had called the airport to assist us. Most of the help speaks 3 or more languages which is pretty amazing to watch. We Americans have a lot to learn.Beach. The beach is very nice. Yes as others hace said, there is more seaweed here then at other places I have been. Its just the way the currents flow. The staff does an excellent job of cleaning up the beach. The Storm the other reviews mention consisted of just strong winds that really increased the surge. The staff and the Dominican Civil Defense team where out surveying the beach and geting thing cleaned up before we left. If you want a good walk, hit the beach, turn left and keep going. Talk water, sunsceen and your camera. Wished I would have done it earlier in the week.Pools. Clean and fun, but poolside a little crowded for my taste. Really didn't go that far to sit at a pool so it didn't mater to me, I could sit in my bathtub at home if thats what I wanted.Things to do. Nighlty entertainment is good and lots of activities during the day. Outside excursion are available. I would recommend the Outback Safari. Excellent trip. If you have room in you luggage, take some school supplies. The guides will make sure the schools get them. Trips to the larger cities are a little far away. If you are look for somewhere to go and relax and not run your butt off, Punta Cana is the place to do nothing. I mean this in a GOOD way.Over all this is an great resort that I would go back to. Yes we did get our luggage and met a great couple from Canada in the process. Spent the week relaxing, eatting, drinking and shootin the bull. Needed about 3 more days.

<Content>Beautiful Location Just returned from a week's vacation and had a wonderful time. We stayed at the Grand Oasis Bavaro Suites which is adjacent to the Grand Oasis. The rooms are new and much nicer. Absolutely no complaints or problems with the room. Ate at three of the four a la carte restaurants which we enjoyed and would recommend you make those reservations. A nice change from the buffet and more relaxing. We thought the food was very good but did not like their house wine. The staff was very friendly overall - maybe noticed a couple that weren't. I think the only drawback we had was they could not understand English at all and any communication/correspondence we received was in all languages but English and a few people mentioned this. So not a major problem. Also both my husband and I did get sick and think it was from the glasses they use around the resort.. Last year in Cuba we noticed they used disposeables but here they were plastic that were rinsed - I am sure they clean them properly at the end of the day but they seem to run out of them during the day so quickly rinse them out when you order a drink. All week we carefully used bottled water for absolutely everything but had no choice but to drink out of unsanitary glasses at the snack bars. The pools are all warm and clean and the beach is spectacular. We would definitely go back, but would want to again stay at the new Suites.

<Content>I Give Paradise a "B" My wife and I stayed at the Grand Oasis for 4 nights, from Mar 17-21. It was our first trip to Punta Cana. My wife isn't crazy about flying, but if you want to see the world, you gotta do it! I would rate our overall experience a B. It's hard to give a lesser grade to paradise without being a spoiled brat. We feel very fortunate that we are able to get out and see places such as Punta Cana. Apple Vacations gives the Grand Oasis a red 5-apple rating. That is probably a stretch. Our non-stop flight from CLE went smoothly. We left CLE @ 6am  landed before 10am. It's nice when you don't have to waste a day travelling. When we loaded our bus for the resort, we were happy to learn that we were the 2nd stop, and would arrive within a half hour. We went to check-in  were told our room wouldn't be ready for about 4 hours. Somewhat disappointed, we grabbed our suitcases, set them down in the large open-air lobby, and started to grab our swimwear. When I looked up, the bell hop, Martin, told us that he took care of it (that our room was ready). 5 minutes instead of 4 hours! Could this be some sort of scam they conjoured up in order to get a bigger tip? Whatever the case, we had our room. Building 4 on the 1st floor. One of the closest rooms to the beach! The room was large, tile-floored, walk-out porch w/view of Caribbean, and pretty clean. No complaints. The beach had plenty of chairs. We never got to sit under an umbrella because they were always spoken for by 9am. That's OK, we'll take the sun! The pools were nice and clean. The pina coladas were the best! The service was very good. The employees  natives always seemed happy. There were only about a handful of topless women on the beach. Unfortunately, they were the ones that shouldn't have been topless! It was really no big deal. The food was OK. You never go hungry. We had reservations for Italian one night (A), Japanese another night (A-), and also Tex-Mex (C). The rest of the time we ate at Window's the buffet (C-). I strongly recommend making reservations for dinner for your entire stay as soon as you arrive at the resort! The entertainment was OK. They sure know how to dance! It's a comfortable open-air theater. The casino was small, but nice. I won $15 the 1st night, $150 the 2nd, and then my wife wouldn't let me go back. You're pretty much stuck on the resort. The excursions, as we have experienced in the past, are rather expensive. If you do venture off the property by foot, you'll only find your typical Caribbean gifts (necklaces, t-shirts, paintings, native artifacts, etc.). They're very friendly, but you feel bad if you don't buy anything. I really didn't need that stuff. We just wanted to explore. We liked the Grand Oasis, but if we ever go back, we'll most likely try a B+ or  resort.

<Content>Great week March Break 08Hotel:The hotel was very well maintained. We stayed in building 4. It wasn't the newest or the nicest of the buildings but it was very clean and comfortable for our whole week. Plenty of hot water, towels and water every day.Beach:We Chose Punta Cana because of the beach. It was a very nice beach with enough shade to retreat to. There was no shortage of lounges and it was a busy week for the hotel. Nice enough swimming area. It was the best amongst the hotels in the same area.Food:Food was good. Never had any trouble finding something delicious to eat. I think my only complaint for the whole trip fits in this category. We had to make reservations for the a la carte restaurants. We ended up with a few early meals because it was so overbooked but the 4 nights we ate at the a la cartes they were pretty much empty every night. I'm not sure if people were making reservations and not keeping them? There was no need for us to eat as early as we did or no need for a reservation for that matter. Something small we took note of.Staff/tourists99% of the staff were super nice and accommodating. Very pleasant and enthusiastic. I found we had a great mix of people down at the same time as us. Everyone was very friendly and easy to get along with. If you're looking for quiet and boredom the adult pool is the place to be. The music, games, and fun are in the main pool. (where I spent my days)OverallI would definitely recommend this resort. I will return if I want to play it safe. Meaning if I don't want to try somewhere new. Can't beat the beach and the drive to the airport. 20 mins (if the guests at the other hotels are ready). I would recommend 7 nights is enough. 10 would be fantastic but 14 would be too much! Please email me with any questions!

<Content>Fantastic Time...Loved our Stay!! My husband, our 2 girls (7  9 yrs.) and I just returned from a wonderful week at the Grand Oasis, Punta Cana and we LOVED every minute. Our room was in block 3...a bit older, the room was average but very clean and well kept. They weren't in a big hurry to bring fresh towels or even enough for all of us but when we called the desk they were there with them right away. The room would be the only thing I marked a little lower on the scale in my opinion and really we were there to sleep and shower...other than that we were enjoying the beautiful, hot weather. The grounds were well maintained, the food was fantastic and the staff was superiour. We felt so comfortable, relaxed and safe our entire stay. Our entire family had a fantastic week and we highly recommend this hotel...wish we were still there!!!

<Content>This is not a 4* or even a 3* We are very disapointed with our stay at this hotel. When we arrived, our room wasn't ready but I'm not complaining about this, we arrived early afternoon so we decided to go for a bite to eat while we waited. Not even 1 hour after we arrived, we saw a rat around the (seafood restaurant). I wanted to go home right away. To make a long story short... we saw rats, had roaches in our room and saw plenty of mice at the buffet restaurant...The place was filled with partying teens and didn't sleep for 7 days. Security did nothing to stop the partying and the noise, this was the worst of all. The food at the buffet was not good at all, but at the restaurants was pretty good. Service was bad, everything we wanted we had to ask at least 3 times before we got it. A few nights, we got our glass of wine, after we ate dessert and we had ordered it at the same time as the meal. The beach is Okay but it's not the Bavaro beach I know. There are much nicer beaches out there. I'm happy to be home and I do not recommend this place to anybody. When you've seen a lot better it's hard to settle for less.

<Content>Dreadful Have to agree , advertised as 4 star more like 2. Rooms were musty and smelly. Plastic glasses were swilled under a tap and reused. If it rained only place to go was back to your room. The hygiene took a lot to be desired at the bars. Food was average nothing special with the exception of the Italian which we couldnt fault.We have travelled around the world and this is the first time I cried because I wanted to come home after 9 days.Considering that it was not a cheap holiday we were absolutely disgusted with it . NEVER again .

<Content>Rest and Relaxation I really don't understand all the complaints about this resort. Not only did we have beautiful weather, the service was outstanding. We visited this resort on March 10th through the 17th. We really did not like the first room we were in, but the hotel dealt with the problem in an urgent and extremely professional manner. We were moved the next morning to a much better room. The first one was run down and in need of several repairs. In defense of the hotel, we were assigned to a room in building 3 upon check in, but the other couple we were with were in room 5. We asked to possibly being put in building 5 and this was the only room available. After my husband looked at the room, I guess not closely enough, it was not up to standard so they agreed to change us, again but we had to wait until the next morning. The new room was fine with a beautiful view of the beach and ocean.The maid did an excellent job of cleaning everyday and stocking our fridge with water and diet coke. We never had to ask for more. The restaurants were good, the best in my opinion being the Italian restaurant and the American grill. The buffet was pretty good. We could always find something to eat. We always made sure to sit in Angel's section because he is a excellent waiter. Angel is extremely friendly and always had a smile on his face. Our coffee cups were always full without having to ask for it. The beach grill has excellent fried chicken and french fries. The nachos were only okay, but edible. The beach is absolutely beautiful with an abundance of palm trees all along the beach. You do have to go down early to reserve a hut if you want shade, but the palm trees served this purpose also. The pools are also very nice, but we stayed on the beach the entire time. The drinks were also excellent, especially the Coco Loco. Most of the bartenders did not skimp on the alcohol, but if you got one that did, you can always ask for an extra shot and they are very happy to oblige. The entertainment was typical of most all inclusive resorts, with the Michael Jackson show is the best. The casino is pretty small, but I'm not a big gambler anyway. I won $200 and I took it and ran. You shouldn't expect to win big at any all inclusive casino anyway. Pointer: stay away from the multi-ball roullette. It looks like a rip off. They try to get you over to the table by giving you free chips to play. I saw a couple playing and it looked as though they were winning a little in the beginning and they had big smiles, but when I looked over later on they were not smiling anymore. Also, the casino personnel do not let you stand and watch the game. They say it's a private table with no spectators allowed. There's also a sign on the table stating the same thing. Sounds and looks like a big scam to me. There are vendors on the beach walking around trying to sell excursions, but they are not pushy and if you say no, they keep walking. The same thing is true with the vendors that have stands that are set up by the main bar. There was a flea market set up twice a week around the resort. Those vendors are a little more pushy, but we just said no and they didn't bother us. I did notice that they're not as flexible when you try to bargain with them. They'll let you walk away. We did not get approached by any Time Share vendors our entire stay. If you booked this hotel, you'll have a great time. Just remember to be polite even if you have a problem. If you treat them with respect instead of yelling and screaming, you'll get a positive result. Also, it's all how you deal with it. I guess we could have let our room problem ruin our vacation since it happened in the beginning, but if you laugh about it, then you will have a great time. The hotel staff do try to help you, but you can't be rude. Also, remember that there is a language barrier as many of the staff do not speak a lot of English. But we were able to get our point across each time. Remember the Dominican people are proud and hard working and they do deserve to be treated with respect. If you run into a few kinks, just go with a smile on your face and you'll be amazed with how fast the staff tries to fix your problem. Also,don't sweat the small stuff, nothing is perfect whether you go to a 5 star luxury resort or a 2 star budget hotel.

<Content>Broken My friend and I traveled to this resort for her 30th birthday. Aside from the AWFUL food and overall lack of clenliness in our room (ie. the sheets were not changed at all, the shower was as disgusting on day one as it was every day after the maid finished working, the maid asked my friend for money everyday that we were there), we were foolish enough to trust the Water sport personnel to take us out on a Banana Boat. The birthday girl and I returned to sure, both with broken ribs and cuts and scrapes from the absolutely life threatening efforts of the boat staff. He laughed at us the first time he intentionally caused us to fly off the boat, and subsequently continued to proceed in an erratic and dangerous manner. We expressed our displeasure, and he repayed us by tossing us again as we were proceeding towards the shore. It was a horrible way to spend our time. The guest relations manager provided no satisfaction after speaking with him about the above mentioned. Fairly certain that he didn't care. Overall not worth the money.

<Content>Wonderful Week Our group of 3 couples just returned from a wonderful week at the Grand Oasis. We all had a great, relaxing time.Check in was fast and efficient. The staff were all very friendly and the service was excellent. One couple had some initial concerns about their room, but these were dealt with very quickly.The beach and pools were wonderful. There was always a lot of selection at the restaurants. Not all meals were what I would consider fine dining, but the quality was reasonable and I was never hungry.I am not a fan of the aggressive sales methods in the towns and in the shops on the resort, but that is a feature of the local culture rather than the resort.In summary, the week was exceptional with no significant complaints. I would gladly return to the same resort in future.

<Content>Great Vacation Was Had by All! Hello fellow trip advisor readers! We travelled to the Grand Oasis, Punta Cana resort from February 23rd, 2008 to March 1, 2008 and had a wonderful time! There were 6 of us in total: 2 girls aged 12 and 15, my husband and I (45  38), and friends of ours (49  69).The overall consensus was that it was a great vacation and we want to be back there now instead of being back in the Ottawa weather that we're experiencing now!This was our girls first time to the Dominican and they loved everything about it. Everyone else has been to the Dominican 3-4 times before. We love it down there! You just can't go wrong with the beaches or weather!Okay, down to the details:Check In / Check Out: Very quick and no problems whatsoever. We were to have two rooms - my family in one and our friends in another. At check in we had asked if we could be located close to each other and Sandy at the front desk was very helpful in doing so - managed to get us in the same building - Building 3.Rooms: Our rooms were nice but you could tell at first glance that they needed some freshening up. Everything was neat and clean but the TV stand / dresser drawers have probably been around for a number of years...not that that really matters in the grand scheme of things. We later found out when we showered for dinner that our bathroom shower leaked and so did the sink, which left large-sized puddles on the floor but nothing that throwing down a towel couldn't fix pretty quickly! Our feeling is that we spend very little time in our room so as long as it has a comfy bed to sleep in and the amenities work, it's all good! The maids kept up our room clean and supplied with drinks in the fridge and towels in the bathroom. The one day that they forgot to leave us water, we simply visited the front desk and within 15 minutes we had two bottles of water. They did not provide our room with facecloths so we used our hand towels instead...no big deal. Our friend's room was absolutely fine with no issues (well, except that they had trouble accessing their safe but again the staff was very quick to respond and help them out). They were on the third floor so their room had nice high ceilings...made the room look that much bigger. Both rooms had a nice view of the beach!Food: Great stuff to be found at the buffet restaurant Windows. Our girls are a tad picky when it comes to their food but they absolutely LOVED the pasta section where you pretty much create your own pasta dish. The Italian (D' Mario's) and the Tex Mex (American Grill) a-la-carte restaurants were amazing - both in respect to the food and service. We loved the Italian so much we went there twice and the entire group of us thoroughly enjoyed our Tex Mex Fajitas and Combo plates. Nobody was particularly interested in the Seafood restaurant so we didn't venture out to that one. Yes, you have to make reservations for these restaurants but it's pretty painless compared to other resorts that we have stayed at. Bars: For the most part the drinks were good and plentiful but they appeared not to have a menu of any kind which may have suggested what they knew how to make. We got by okay though!! We were served their version of Bailey's after dinner with our coffee and Liquera de Mentha (Creme de Menthe) and Amaretto on ice...all very yummy! They have premium drinks available (Absolut Vodka) but they are supposed to charge you $5. If you're nice to them maybe they won't charge you...worked for us a couple of times! Drinks are served in reusable plastic cups - very small which means you have to visit the bar more frequently. We always bring our own insulated mugs. It just so happened that we got to the airport and we realized we forgot our mugs so we ended up buying some at Tim Horton's with our breakfast vouchers that SunWing gave us due to the flight delay we experienced on the way out). Thanks SunWing!Beach: Awesome! All days but Friday the water was as calm as could be. Very nice to get in there for a cooling off! Friday was windy so it stirred things up a bit. The Grand Oasis staff kept the beach as clean and seaweed free as possible. I wish I could say the same thing for other people at the resort who left their lunch  snack plates (full of left-over fried chicken  fries, etc) all over the place, not to mention their empty drink glasses! There were a number of groups of university kids that were at the resort at the same time as we were and while most of them kept their area tidy, there were some who were pretty inconsiderate too! Kudos to you guys that did your part to clean up your stuff! Always lots of chairs but we are fortunate enough to have our friends who are early birds get us chairs in the early morning...thanks Paul  T!Pool: The main pool was nice but busy. At times the university kids were pretty inconsiderate by jumping in and not caring about who they were splashing (i.e. the bartender at the swim up bar) or how loud they were. Not all were rowdy, just some. The lazy river pools were nice and relaxing although I must say that we spent the majority of our time at the beach. It was hard to tear us away come 5:00 / 6:00pm.Spa  Beauty - only walked by and had a quick peek inside...looked gorgeous!Gym: Nice and very clean. Only one of us (our friend Paul) used the gym. The attendent was very helpful to him when he was there in showing him how to use the machines (they are a tad different from what we have in our gyms at home).Entertainment: Great fun! Michael Jackson show was amazing. A lot of time and effort went into putting that together. Anthony is one hilarious and fun-loving guy! My girls absolutely adored him! We could watch him perform 24/7. Don't forget to check him out dancing to Shakira...that boy can shake his bootie better than us girls can! The Ideal Couple show was funny...couldn't stop laughing the whole time. The group of them entertain at 110%.Disco: Went only one night. It was a lot of fun but the strobe lights kind of get to you after a while. We were way too tired to venture out to the disco again. Most nights we were back in our rooms after the show ended at 10:30. It's a hard life relaxing on the beach all day, filling your gut with food and then trying to stay up past 11:00!! :o)Doctor / Medical Services: Unfortunately my youngest daughter had a medical issue before we left and she almost didn't come with us. The doctor in the Children's Hospital Emergency gave us instructions to pass along to the doctor at the resort. We were more than a little leary to be needing to visit a foreign doctor but everything worked out just fine. The doctor was extremely friendly and helped us for 3 days with changing bandages, etc. One other couple that we met in his office on the first day also had very good things to say about him and his staff. Thank goodness he was there. (He is the only doctor and works on call 24/7 between the Grand Oasis and the SunScape resort right next door.) We also were fortunate enough to meet a doctor and his wife, who happened to be a nurse, from Boston. He very kindly offered to have a look at my daughter's arm to make sure things were healing as expected. Thank you again!We met tons of people - mostly like us trying to escape the winter - all of which were very nice. Hopefully we'll be bumping into you again soon! There were a lot of foreign languages (French, German, Spanish) as well which made for an interesting time just listening to them speak.Ladies, if you are getting your hair braided - Kathy by the Water Sports building was very nice.Try to catch a sunrise in the morning if you can - spectacular!Did we have fun? Yes, we sure did! I'm sure you'll love your vacation as well!

<Content>The Honest Truth About Grand Oasis .. My family and I stayed at the Grand Oasis just recently, February 24th - March 2nd 2008 . We enjoyed our stay here but there is still some things this hotel can improve on. Here is the honest truth about the main components at the Grand Oasis.Beach: It was probably the nicest beach I have ever seen. The water was clear and turquiose and was just amazing. Loved the beach and so did my family.Pool: The pool was alright. It had a swimup bar, but it was always packed there.. however a few times it cleared up. The pool was pretty big. I might add that they have two lazy rivers, one on each side of the resort. They also have an adults pool with a jacuzzi.. these were all nice and refreshing. Service: The service was actually very good. We usually got our food and served right away so again there was no problems here.Food: Wow pretty much describes it. The food was very good. They had a main buffet resteraunt called Windows that offered an assortment of food. I always found something to eat. We also ate at the three a la carte resteraunts.- American Grill - Was pretty good. It is mainly mexican food. The service was excellent.- Italien Resteraunt - Was my familys favourite. The resteraunt was really elegant and nice, and the food was amazing! Great service as well.- Seafood Resteraunt - Was slightly disappointed. They didnt have much on their menu, but the food was still very good. the service wasnt the greatest either.BREAKFAST OPTIONS: you could either go to Windows buffet or down by the beach they have another buffet.LUNCH OPTIONS: Windows Buffet, buffet down by beach, the grill on the beach.SUPPER OPTIONS: Windows Buffet, Italian Resteraunt (reservations required), Seafood Resteraunt (reservations required), American Grill (reservations required).Rooms: When my family goes on vacation, we don't really care about the look of the room. Our rooms were alright. Nothing too fabulous. Me and my brothers shared a room and my parents shared a room right next door, Our rooms were in the 1st building, numbers 1206 and 1208. My parents had more problems with their room than we did with our though. It wasn't a big deal with the rooms so if you dont really care either, dont worry.Check-In and Check-out - the check-in took a long time since we arrived with a bus load of people. But once we got to the front it went quick. We also had to wait a bit for the bell boys to take our luggage over. The check-out was quick and easy, we got there early to do so.TIPS: - do not keep your cards for your room with cellphones, cameras, anything that might act like a magnet because it will cause the card not to work. I think i went up to the front desk three times before I figured this out.- do NOT buy packages with tutti frutti tours or any person who claims to work with another company that is on the beach. They rip you off and take your money. You will know the difference between the people who actually work at the hotel and those that dont. - the vendors near the lobby can be very annoying, so if they ask you to go over just make up an excuse to go. (i often said I have to go eat! or something like that). - if you are looking for vendors (me and my family were) dont even bother heading down the left side of of the beach. To finally get to the vendors is about a 2 hour and 30 minute walk one way. Go on the right side, their is some vendors about 5 minutes away. Also their is vendors who came to the resort on the Tuesday and Thursday when we stayed.- the a la carte resteraunts require a reservation, to make one go to the lobby and there is a guy on a computer to the left. just talk to him there.Overall, I would recommend this resort for people who want a nice beach, and great food as well as a good pool. I hope this helped you somewhat.

<Content>horrible Don't stay here! Checked in on 4/12/07 and the air conditioning was leaking from the ceiling onto the tile floor, the ceiling tiles were falling down, the light in the shower did not work and the room smelled. I went to the reception desk three times and each time I was told a maintenance worker was on the way to fix the problems. This NEVER happened. I went to see the Apple Vacations representative and was told that weI could not have a new room until the next day and we would have to spend the night in this room. We had to leave the room by 10:00 in the morning and the new room was ready for until after 12:00. On 4/12/07 we made reservations with the concieger for dinner for two of the nights we were staying, when we went to the restaurant for dinner we were told that our reservation was for the following night and not that evening. The conceiger made us two dinners reservation for Saturday night and nothing for Friday night. The restaurant was full and could not seat us but suggested that we check with the other restaurants to see if any of them had a cancellation and might be able to fit us in. We were able to eat at the Italian Restaurant. One night there was a beach party and the food was horrible and the bugs were really that night. This is definetly not a 5 star resort. Don't waste your money at this place!

<Content>Loved Punta Cana We just returned from Grand Oasis, Punta Cana, DR on 3/1/08. The weather was absolutely beautiful. We had stayed at Natura Park 2 years ago and the Grand Oasis was a much nicer resort in our opinion. Natura Park had a lot of seaweed on the beach but Grand Oasis beach was very clear, free of seaweed. The food was much better than Natura Park and the drinks were better. Most of the staff was very friendly. There were a few that did not smile or try to be friendly. The food at the reservation restaurants was excellent. We never had a problem with our room being cleaned or having enough towels. The first night and each night after we left $2 for the maid and she took very good care of us. We stayed in Building 3 and had the room closest to the Beach. Our balcony wrapped around so we could sit on the balcony and see the ocean. On Saturday night the Michael Jackson show was really worth watching. I am not a Michael Jackson fan but they did a terrific job in putting on this show. There were a few times that we had to wait to get beach towels as they had run out and had to wait for clean ones. The Vacation Club salesmen were all over the resort. My husband wanted to see the rooms so we sat through their presentation. The Vacation Club rooms were really really nice. You do get a free T-shirt and hat. We didn't have any problem finding chairs on the beach near our building. We didn't have to go down early and reserve chairs. We just went after breakfast and never had any problem. We didn't want to come back home and would definitely go back to this resort.

<Content>Great Time Spent a week at Grand Oasis Feb 20-27 typical all inclusive vacation.Resort itself is older but well maintained with alot of updates we were in building 2 our friends were in 1 both the same.Did get to see inside building 7 which is newer much nicer inside.The layout of the resort is nice since your never far from the Beach,Pool or Bars.Service I would rate very well a few dollars go a long way.All of the people working there did a great job and this made our vacation very enjoyable.The American restaurant was our favorite the beef tenderloin was excellent.The buffet was typical.The beach Food variaty was also good.The venders can be quiet pushy at times and they do have tables in the resort twice a week just say no thanks every time you walk by.The timeshare people are also there and always talk to you very politely trying to get you to ask them about the vacation club we never asked or told them we were busy.I see people complaning about sea weed on the beach the staff is cleaning constantly not a problem the other resorts down the beach seemed to have more.The water in this area is very calm there is a reef way out in front breaking all waves.We used the sail boats windsurfers and kayaks.Great beach for children.Bars only thing we missed was there lack of any canadian whiskey could not find it anywhere.Wheather was perfect comparing it to cancun area for febuary it is much warmer always in shorts.We also lost electricity a few times but were never in room.Would return again

<Content>The Worst Vacation Ever This was by far the worst vacation I have ever been on. If we aren't able to get our money back, the very least we can do is prevent anyone else from making the same mistake we did by going to this resort. As two young adults looking for a great value on a vacation we were not expecting the Ritz by any means, however the Grand Oasis was simply unacceptable. Not a single thing was as advertised and it was a disaster from the moment we stepped on to the property. We were moved from our room several times then placed in an upgraded room in the new building. We had no hot water, no air conditioning, the ceiling fan did not work and neither did the fridge. The toilet ran and leaked 24 hours a day. The excess moisture attracted flies, which infested our room. The staff at the hotel all but refused to help us in any way, shape or form. The restaurants were absolutely abhorrent. RATS were running around the windows eating area every night we went in there. It was no surprise when my boyfriend contracted a HORRIBLE case of food poisoning from the mush and scraps they offer to their patrons as meals. They use bottom shelf liquor in all their drinks, which are very watered down. The rental equipment is all dingy and out dated- not to mention impossible to try and reserve. There are WAY too many people therefore impossible to get a chair by the beach or the pool. I could go on however I chose not to re-live the worst vacation of my life. PLEASE, take my word and book another resort, I promise you will thank me.

<Content>Don't book with Adventure tours booth near the pool Party of 8 people- the Grand Oasis is beautiful, clean resort, food buffet was great lots to select from and 3 la cartes- no problems in booking. Stayed in building 2- clean, quiet, air conditioner in 2211 not working properly but only on last nite, (did hear about building 5 - noisey and full of teenagers) Swam in all pools and the ocean. Managed to get beach chairs every afternoon near the lazy river or far side of beach with no problems. Nightly shows were lots of laughs and all bars served whatever we wanted, baileys, sinapore slings, tequila sunrise, etc. No complains about the resort.!BUT PLS DO NOT go on the Adventure Tours booth set up near the pool- Scai Quads/Tropical Wheels @ 110.00US per couple for dune buggies. At 7;30 am was told 20 min bus ride- to drive dune buggies to ocean then to caves and retn back to resort by lunch. Turned out 40 min bus ride to the place, drove dune buggies down side of busy paved roads to ocean-Thompson Park bugged by vendors and trying to sell beer, left there heading back stopped at a store to buy stuff,( we were here to enjoy a dune buggy ride not shop)! being passed by other dune buggies on the road and back past the place we started at down a road to the caves.Issues all on this jouney were 1 buggy kept stalling -2 guys part of tour at the back kept repairing along the way, 1 bike battery cables sparking and smoking, our bike left front wheel broke right off. No other dune buggies available was oftered the ATV they were driving- (similiar to the ATV from CT 250s) but with semi flat tires and broken pieces. Once again 1bike stalled and I needed to use the bathroom- not far back from breakdown and told the guide I was going to drive back on the ATV- he say to get on with him and he would take me back. Upon our retn to the breakdown of dune buggies he tipped the ATV on me and the broken reverse shifter caused me to have 2 bad bruises back of calf and knee(hobled around resort for the rest of the wk) Not pls at all but to far to walk from the group, back on I get with the the stearing all bent and never spoke to him again. All of us had enough and said forget this trip to the caves and take us back to the resort. Guide offered tomarrow another trip - NOT Discussed with rep at the booth that the bikes were unsafe and need maintenance and that person was injured- unable to talk with his boss or get satisfaction by complaining to them- Wish to tell others- though that this booth being in the middle of the resort was reputable. Beware

<Content>Good and bad Just got back from the Grand Oasis this morning and anyone trvelling to this hotel in the near future should read and believe the reviews on this site, good and bad. The rooms are tired but housekeeping kept our room clean and well supplied with anything we asked for. The food is good and plentiful, you have to be careful what you pick but we didn't have a problem finding something to eat. Front desk staff were professional and helpfull with a problem we had with our door lock.Maintenance showed up promptly and quickly had the problem solved. The reason you need to read all of the reviews is we met a couple while we were there that did experience some of the nightmares reported.(dirty rooms, long delays) so go prepared.We had a great week but it seems with this hotel it is hit and miss.

<Content>Resort was Good, a few issues though We just returned From Grand Oasis Bavaro Suites Cameleon. The staff there was excellent. Our room was a Junior suite and was in Building 10, 3rd Floor ( really need to get that elevator built). The Room was clean and comfortable. Our maid did a good job and after a little tip we went from 2 beers in fridge to 6. We ate mostly at the Agua restaurant which is a buffet for breakfast and lunch and then a la carte for dinner. Food was good. We did the Italian restaurant once and it was very good and we did the Tex-Mex once and it was more than adequite. Service was good everywhere on the resort. The food does become a little repetitive by the end of the week but _No_Montezumas Revenge for either of us. Always found more than enough to eat and Variety was OK.We stayed almost all the time at the Adult pool and Nicolas and Nico did a great job making sure that the drinks were never empty.( Thanx guys). We also had a great bunch of Canadian people and 2 couples from Baltimore that also hung there most of the time and made for a fun time at the pool, except for a small European invasion on a couple of occasions. For the most part was a great time at the pool.The entertainment was OK, nothing fantastic, but not bad either. The entertainment staff did a good job trying to get people involved but most of their activities were around the main pool.The beach was great as ussual and the staff did a good job trying to keep up with the sea weed problem. I would like the thank the doorknob that left a broken wine glass on the beach instead of picking it up. The wife found it with her foot and really appreciated the fact that she did not have to swim for 2 days. I would like to thank the Doctor who came down to the beach and tended to her and again the next day in his office.Over all it was a good trip. The building still has a few minor growing pains but nothing to ruin a good holiday, but you have deal with the minor problems. The whole trip was a good value for the $$$ that we spent. The airplane food on the flight there was pitiful. We did appreciate the fact tha Nolitours paid our $10 to get into the country and our $20 to leave. This was our 3rd trip to the Dominican and we would definitely would come back here again.

<Content>Awesome Place ... Just Dont be Ignorant This was our first trip ever outside of Canada and it was a wanderful experience! We tipped generously to the bar tenders (mainly the 1) and he was always making sure we had fresh drinks in our hands even if we didnt' ask, i'd walk up to the bar and he would already be making my drink. My boyfriend and I are way too trusting in the sense of money. We went shopping on the resort and bought quite a bit from one particular store. The boyfriend was charged $23US but informed us that he only accepted pesos so he kindly converted and we got our credit cards and used the ATM paid him what we thought was $23 but in reality when we got home was $147 US. Aswell with me I was told $235US and knocked it down to $200 US but once again didn't accept US dollars so I did the same thing this time in reality paying him $488! So know your exchange and dont trust them to do it for you, there's nothing we can do about our loss try to not let it happen to you :)Other than that we would 100% think about going again to this lovely resort.

<Content>Just Ok Stayed Feb 21 to 28th '08. Charter was with Sunwing which was first and last time booking with Sunwing.....flight 14 hours late and representatives on sight were/are completely useless.We are a family of 4 with 2 young teens and this was our first resort vacation after 4 cruise vacations.The positiveEnjoyed the resort property. The pools were great and the beach beautiful. Food was good and plentiful and locations convenient.Staff was great except front desk staff. Maid service was excellant and very deserving of tip provided. The negativeRooms, we stayed in Building 4 which had really nice garden view however the room was well worn...bathroom ceiling leaked, bathroom was very worn. Resort is short of beach towels so you need to bring your own.All rooms lost electricity on 2 occasions due to mechanical problems. This effects plumbing, therefore no showers, toilet, etc...200 college kids (Canada, USA, Spain) arrived which made sleeping impossible as partying was 24hours in the hall ways. Broken beer bottles in the lobby and pool area. Just like living in the University dorm again....good memory's bad vacation. 11 year son enjoyed the sights of the drunk, topless young Canadian college girls running around the resort.!!Kids got a craving for a candy bar but changed their mind when they found a cute little mouse on the second shelf in te resort store munching down on its own candy bar.Anyway...resort is a absolute maximum a 2.5 to 3 star resort (due only to the grounds, food and staff) therefore do not pay anymore than a 3 star price. We were fortunate in that we purchased a last minute deal that was cheap. Resort run spa was scam as you needed exact cash payment as change was not available therfore larger tip was requested...as appearantly 20% was not enough.We most likely will not return or recommend to anyone unless very cheap price.

<Content>Not a 4+ My wife and I just returned from the Oasis. Given what we paid, it was very good value. However, it is not a 4+ star and I would not pay the book value. Staff and service are very good as is typical of a Dominican 4 stars we have stayed. The room was large and clean. The beach itself is very nice and there are plenty of chairs.On the downside:The buildings are very close together inhibiting the view of the ocean. Our building backed onto a grimy residential/business area that would be seen as you enter and leave your room. The wine was a vile concoction that a wino would think twice about consuming. A la carte restaurants: Italian good (I had the beef tenderloin), seafood okay, American grill not so good. We were able to order good wine at $35 per bottle at the Italian.Hot buffet breakfasts are always a challenge. Oasis did not do well. Scrambled eggs, french toast and pancakes were not warm. Lunch and dinners were good.Mixed drinks were passable with the exception of pina colada which were bad. One I had at least worked well as a laxative. We had to endure a gauntlet of badgering merchants who set up on the property several nights however this is typical of Punta Cana resorts.There was no live band. A garden area featured a large cage of budgies. It is a great feeding station for rats. On one evening we saw one feeding inside the cage on what looked like bread.Overall we had a good time and would consider Oasis again at the sale price we paid.

<Content>You have to be lucky My wife and I were at the Oasis for a week early february 08. The hotel is very well organised and clean.Staff is friendly and competent.Rooms are the problem: About 70 % of rooms are badly located with no view at all...30 % of junior suites are just great. We had one.( just plain luck )The food at the specialty /a la carte restaurants is very ordinary.Buffets are better ! Breakfast on the beach is great..The cheap wine the serve everywhere is simply impossible to drink. Beach is beautiful and safe. Marc

<Content>Would never go back to this resort We were there Jan. 13 to the 21st and originally booked to stay in the junior master suites because the Bavaro suites were not ready yet, there were 57 of us down for a wedding. We were booked in all different buildings. We were one of the couples that got booked in the Bavaro suites, block 11. There were a few other people from the group in that building as well as block 10. We didn't have any hot water the cold was white, the phone didn't work, construction went late into the evening and started early in the morning (sometimes 5am) and the dogs on the other side of the wall barked all night. Some people had no running water at all, so therefore there toilets didn't work. Most of the problems were fixed the next day.We also got locked out of our room the one day because the lock didn't want to work anymore, so we went to the front desk and they sent someone to fix it...half hour later, they had to actually replace it. There was also a giant spider in our room, not impressed, and another couple from block 10 had a few cockroachs. .The food was pretty good, the pool and beach were great. Not impressed with the maid service though, ours had an attitude.The wedding went well except for the minister not showing up til after dinner, 3 hrs late actually. So he just signed papers for $600. There friend that was reading the translation had to marry them, because they obviously weren't waiting. So after this stay I will never go back to this resort if I go to Dominican again.

<Content>Wonderful vacation place for family!!! After our booking, I read the reviews for Grand Oasis, and must say that we are so nervous about some of the complaints. We stayed from Feb 7 to 14, 2008, turned out that we had fantastic time there with my husband and two boys. Every one found something we can enjoy. The weather is beautiful, the beach - do have seaweed most of the time - there are three staffs clean them consistently. The staff is trying very hard to make our stay clean/comfortable, the entertainment staff is everywhere and we really enjoy all the activities they create. Especially the Aqua-gym, mini.Disco - every night for the children, dancing lesson, and night shows. Even though, there are minor problems from time to time (switch for the cold water to hot water, missing towels, but the front desk solved the problems very quickly.Food is pretty good, lots of varieties. The three special restaurants are offering very unique food, we loved the seafood one - the most!!We really had a relaxed and stress released vacation!!

<Content>Great Resort My wife and I just returned from the Grand Oasis this morning. When we first booked the resort and then read the reviews we were nervous. However, the week was fantastic. The food, people, sand and accommodation was great. The weather, well what can I say about the weather except it was exceptional. I must mention two staff that went above and beyond. Cathy from the Bocchi Ball area never stopped smiling and always was upbeat. Anthony who part of the pool activity area and as well part of the evening entertainment made the week more enjoyable for us.In our week at the resort, we saw 6 nightly entertainment shows. All but two were entertaining. The content of the shows ranged from comedy to dancing. The two that I did not enjoy particularly were the shows of the adult nature. Our main goal when we first booked our trip was rest and relaxation. These were achieved. I highly recommend this resort.

<Content>What a wonderful week! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! I was reading the reviews before we left, and was starting to worry about our choice. I am not sure where some of these people were, butthey certainly weren't at the Grand Oasis! We were originally supposed to be at the new Grand Oasis Bavaro Suites, but a weekbefore our departure, they moved us to the original resort (Grand Oasis). We were upgraded to Building 7....and we are still amazedat our good fortune. The rooms were gorgeous and we overlookedthe ocean, with a tub on the verandah outside!! The resort is amazingly clean and the staff always pleasant. The food was great.Sometimes the buffet wasn't perfectly hot, but that would be impossible for the length of time that the buffet is open. They do their best, and the variety of foods were amazing...something for everyone! The 3 restaurants (Seafood, American Grill, and Italian)were great, and we had no problem reserving a spot for when we wanted. The only downfall for the week, was that there was noCanadian Club whiskey for my husband, but he made out okay with a few other things and we had taken a bottle from the duty free at the airport, so he drank that in the evenings. I would totallyrecommend this resort to others, and would certainly go back again! It would be nice to see what the Bavaro suites is like, when it is completed. I also have to mention that the shows in the evening are a lot of fun. My husband was asked to take part in the Miss Oasis competition (which is very unlike him) but had a lot of fun doing so...and we have pictures to prove it!! He ended up with a funky hair-do, and his Miss Oasis won the competition hands down!Holidays are what you make of it, and this week at Grand Oasis was beautiful! Thanks to the great staff!

<Content>Great Resort! Hi Everyone! I just got back from the Grand Oasis Punta Cana at 3:30 am this morning! Usually I'd wait a few days before posting a review however I felt the need to given all of the 'mixed opinions' on this site!I travelled from Toronto, ontario to punta cana with sunwing. firstly, I have to say that sunwing is an awesome carrier to fly with! they did not stop serving us food and beverages - hot meals on both the departing and returning flight, complimentary wine with the dinner, champagne, hot towel service etc. A great flight!As for the resort - honestly I don't know what people are complaining about. Here is my quick review:1) Rooms - overall they are nice and spacious. we were NOT in building 7 but in building 3. the rooms are large and clean. that's what matters most! also we had no issues with the AC and even had to turn it off at night sometimes because it is fairly strong2) Food - I'm vegetarian and so I'm usually pretty limited in what I can eat. i found that they had enough variety even for me. The one thing that I really appreciate about this place, is their nighttime snack bar. most resorts that claim to have a nightime snackbar usually just have cold sandwiches and stale fries. this place serves rice, chicken, vegetables, french fries, a few salads etc up until 5 am... which is awesome! Overall the food was very fresh- I travelled with a friend and neither of us got sick. I liked Windows (the main restaurant) - it was very spacious and overall well ventilated... not sure why everyone is complaining. The staff there are very nice as well - always smiling :)3) Drinks - my goodness, do they ever serve up strong drinks! usually places like this will limit how much alcohol they mixx into a drink, but we actually had to ask them to make our drinks light once in a while as they are not shy pouring the alcohol4) Resort - these guys do a good job trying to keep everything clean. they are constantly racking the sand to get rid of seaweed - they wash the premises everynight, the bathrooms are overall very clean outdoors which is rare. I don't get the folks that complain about this resort being dirty - I beg to differ!5) Entertainment- I have to say that the animation team works extremely hard... they are all very nice people and very friendly - Kathy and Reynol especially! Also some very attractive folks working on that team which doesn't hurt ;)6) Things to look out for - every tuesday and friday, they have vendors that come in from offsite and set up shop on the resort grounds - these guys are like vultars and I really hated having to walk past them. They do not relent and constantly try to harass you into buying things! On the positive side though, I spent some time on the beach and did not get hounded or harassed like many others have mentioned in their reviews - so for me this was a non issue. Be careful of the folks that have stalls set up permanently on the resort - they inflate prices like crazy, you can get items even cheaper than what they may quote you at the actual resort shops. Overall, I had a great time. I know some folks complained that the AC wasn't working in the rooms, or that it was really loud - I think we got lucky because our room was just fine. The staff are great, don't speak much english but make a good effort. The medical facilities are awesome as well; my friend had to visit the doctor and she was an absolute sweetheart - even called the next day to follow up and make sure all was well.I'd recommend this place and maybe even go again!

<Content>We had a great time We had a great time at Grand Oasis.I was a little leary after staying at Excellence last year but this place was great.We stayed in room 3325 and the maid service was usually done in the morning. No complaints at all about hot water or water pressure. Nice view of the ocean while drinking our coffees on the balcony in the morning.We spent most of our days by the swim up bar and met alot of great people. Ola to all of my friends from Carol.The restaurants are good. We loved the American Grill. Jean is fantastic.Go to Grand Oasis and have fun. You won't be dissapointed. If you have any questions just ask.

<Content>Don't worry.... not a bad place We stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana from Feb 2 to Feb 9. Like other travellers I was very nervous about going to this resort because of the reviews I read before going.This may be a long review but I want to be honest and somewhat thorough.Firstly, don't let all the negative reviews ruin your holiday before you arrive.Let me say that if you are a picky traveller and like things to be top notch and to have everything in order from the service, to your room to the overall resort to the restaurants then this place is not for you and you won't be happy. If this is what you want then you need to pay top dollar to get that level of resort in the Dominican.We were looking for a decent and reasonably priced resort for our family of two adults and two kids as well as grandparents and another family of four with teenage kids (group of 10) and that is what we got..We were looking for a clean room, lots of sun, things to do for the kidsas well as decent quality of food and drinks so we wouldn't get sick. We got all of this.Yes there were things that were annoying and could have been better, but overall it was no where near as bad as the previous reviews had made it out to be...thank goodness. We felt we got our monies' worth.Check in and Check out went well and was quick.Food: We could all find something to eat on the buffet. Sometimes Pizza wasn't very hot and the drinks/juice need ice to be cold. Breakfast was good with the usual stuff plus a great smoothie bar. Lunch had a variety of dishes plus usually pizza, stuff for sandwiches and again always fries. So'me days at the buffet were better than others but we were never hungry. There was a pasta bar, salads, breads, lots of fruit and each night varied with chicken, pork, beef, lamb , ribs, fish, fajitas, always french fries, vegies, potatoes etc etc...The deserts were better than we have seen in the past. Always icecream for the kids. So I don't know how anyone could be hungry. There is also the Beach Grill which was good and a nice change. Just a note we ate at the big buffet Windows but we also at e at the smaller one over by the American Grill Restaurant for breakfast and lunch. At breakfast the lineups were much smaller for omellets and eggs etc. and still lots of choice but just on a smaller scale...same for lunch.We ate at two of the ala cartes...the Italian one Da Marios and the American Grill (Tex Mex) and we all liked both of them... the kids preferred the American Grill. Some of the group didn't like Sea Food so we didn't eat there. Yes, some of the meals were better than others but it was a nice change from the Buffet and the food was pretty good and some of the dishes were amazing. For 10 of us we had no trouble getting reservations. We went the first day and booked for the week. You can have 3 ala cartesfor the week. The only time there is a problem is if there is a wedding and it is full. We talked to other people and opinions vary so... you will just have to go yourself and form your own opinion.Service...yes sometimes depending on when you went there was no utensils or napkinsat the table... but no big deal just take from the next table or ask for them and you got it...but as I said if you like the service to be top notch... you will be upset at times. We just dealt with the issues and did not let it bother us. It was much better then being at home in the cold. They did their best to please with drinks and any other requests. Yes there may be some staff that were better than others...but if we worked the hours they did and received the numerous complaints they do...we may not always be in the best of moods. Overall...they were great.Rooms. We were in building 2 and the rooms were OK...pretty big in comparison to other resorts we have stayed at.. We were just there to sleep. We did look at the rooms in building 7 and they were beautiful, but expensive. Since were were travelling with the kids and for the most part only in the room to change and sleep it was not worth the money for us to upgrade. If the nicer rooms is an issue with you than pay and upgrade and you will be happy with your accomodationsRoom was cleaned every day and fridge was cold and well stocked and once we learned that the patio door had to be completely shut for the air conditioner to work and our room had to have the door card in the slot for things to work it worked well.. haha If we needed anything they did their best to get it or fix it. We had lots of hot water...sometimes too much. Downfall of our room: Only light that worked all the time was the table lamp... others would come on when they felt like it including in the night. Since we were on the third floor one night when it rained hard our roof leaked.... Since it was not near where we were sleeping we did not let it bother us.... and yes the toilet was a little testy at times. Other families we were with also had problems with bathtub or showers... but one or the other worked and we just didn't let it bother us.Entertainment....not bad... what we saw was better than we have seen in the past at other resorts. Only complaint was it started to late... 9:30-10:00 p.m. which was too late for the kids and most of the time us to so we did not get to see all the shows. Would have liked to see more of it. They tried hard to include the kids in an earlier program and they seemed to really have fun.The Spa was good and we booked the big hot tub located in there for the 10 of us for $5.00 US pp a couple of times which was fun. The one located in the adults pool was cold. Someone with us got their hair done and another got the massage which they enjoyed.Shopping. We walked just outside the resort in a little shopping area and got pretty much everything we wanted. They were willing to barter and were very friendly and if you said no thanks they respected that.We also went by a taxi boat down the coast and stopped at a Plaza and looked around. This was bigger and had a good selection of items. They didn't tend to come as low in their price. We found you would have to wander from place to place to get a better deal, but overall their prices were higher. But again very friendly and for the most part respected no thanks.The vendors they let on the resort were more aggressive by far...and you had to be firm in saying no or just keep walking.There is also a little mall on the resort... but their prices were higher and they did not like to come down in their prices.There was lots to do outside the resort if you wanted to pay and do it. We went horseback riding on the beach and rented a boat to take us up the coast to look around. Other than that we went for a bicycle ride which is included, walked the beach alot , went swimming, played volleyball, pingpong. You could be busy or just sit and relax.Be careful with the internet... they tended to duplicate the codes so you were not getting the time you paid for and you have to make sure you are logging off properly or when you go back your time is done. Any problems we had they were good at helping and fixing them.We were not bothered with time share sales people or reps from the vacation club like I have read in past reviews. There were also no vendors on the beach except for people to braid your hair. In the spa a full head of breads was around $40.00 and on the beach it was around $25.00 or $30.00.The weather was good. It was pretty windy most of the time. Yes there is some seaweed on the beach... but they worked hard to clean it up. We were pretty far down the beach and there was seaweed in most places.The language barrier can be tough. Sometimes it was hard to get things because they couldn't understand you... but in fairness they did try and so did we.They were always sweeping and cleaning up around the resort. If you look hard enough you will find lots of things that needed fixing and sprucing up...I think that would be the same pretty much anywhere whether it be at home or on holiday in the Carribean. We didn't do this.. we just wanted to enjoy the sun and our holiday and we didn't dwell on the bad.Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the Grand Oasis and our time there.Don't pay much attention to all the negative reviewsyour vacation at the Grand Oasis will be what you make it... whether it be good or bad.If I can help with any of your questions just ask.

<Content>One BIG Problem turned into more We (2 couples in our 30s without children) stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana from January 19th to January 26th 2008. To give anyone perspective on our benchmarks we have stayed and enjoyed them all:Punta Cana (DR)- Iberostar Bavaro- Caribe Club PrincessPuerto Plata (DR)- Bahia PrincipeMayan Riviera (MX)- Riu Playacar- Bahia Principe TulumSo, about the Grand Oasis Punta Cana / Bavaro ... We were booked for the Grand Oasis Bavaro - Junior Suites Cameleon Package. This building wasn't ready (under construction) so we were put in a Master Junior Suite rooms in the Grand Oasis Punta Cana - block 7. Grand Oasis Bavaro and Punta Cana are the same resort just the Bavaro is the name for the newest building - block 11. The room (7304) was outstanding - by far the best we've stayed in on any of our vacations in the Caribbean. HOWEVER, the air conditioning for the entire building (block 7) did not work for our entire stay. You may wonder why we didn't ask for a room change, and that was because we were told it would be fixed (over and over by the resort, by our tour rep and every other guest in the block - we all kept getting assured it would be fixed that day) ... additionally, our building was the only one with the junior suites and the rooms in the rest of the resort are a little below average for the Caribbean (very worn).In any event, not getting sleep 'cause your room is 35 degrees (Celcius) or more all night can make people grumpy and tired. We didn't have the energy to go on any excursions so we slept in the shade a lot during the day and then sweat all night. It can also make you see everything with a little glass is half empty point of view so I won't share any more thoughts on the resort because I don't have much positive to say.And, because we really wanted to see a resort map before we went but couldn't find any online, I've enclosed a copy for reference. Building 7 has no air conditioning but the rooms are great (there are some traveller photos of them). I wrote on the map where Building 11 is and this is where anyone booked to stay at the Grand Oasis Bavaro will be staying once the construction is complete.

<Content>Don't do it The food is horrible really had to try hard to find something to choke down. Bit into two raw hamburgers a raw piece of chicken and raw pork tenderloin(spent lots of time on the [--]). Tried to order room service three times it never arrived. The rooms in some blocks are nice the other are old and beat down. The nice blocks however are under construction expect a 9:00 a.m wake up hammer. Most of the service was bad with the exception of the bartenders and waiters. The only thing that saved the trip was the 8 other amazing people we spent the 7 days with and the beautiful Beaches and cold Beer.

<Content>Overall it was Great! We stayed at the Grand Oasis from January 20 to the 27, 2008. I read all of the reveiws prior to going and went with a very open mind. It was overall a fabulous time.We stayed in one of the new buildings number 11 and our room was quite nice. Unlike some of our travel companions who had minor room issues(the gigantic spider, a warm fridge and finicky toilet) we had no complaints about the room. Our Maid Carlita Flores was an absolute sweetheart and did an excellent job keeping our room clean and well stocked. Our room safe was bolted into the wall of the closet and we were not charged for the use of it. I assume it was included in the price of our package through Sunwing tours. They were still working hard at getting the rest of the building opened up so there was some construction going on throughout the day but we did not find this to be a problem.There is a beautiful new pool outside of building 11 and we watched them complete the final touches on it and open it up just as we were about to leave for the plane home.There was enough food there to feed anyone. Yes there were certain things that were on the buffet every day but they did try to switch it up by having different themes each evening. Considering the many different types of people that were at the resort I thought they did a pretty good job of trying to have something for everyone. Remember you are in a different country and they are trying to cook what they think you like to eat. I over heard 3 american women say that in the future they would not go to any all inclusive resort that didn't serve grilled cheese sandwiches and kraft dinner....hmmn if that is what you are looking for than don't go!!!!We tired 2 of the ala carte restaraunts Da Mario(italian) and Marinera(the seafood).....Da Mario is a beautiful atmosphere and the accomodated a large group for us for a birthday party for one of our Travelling companions(there were 13 of us all together). The appetizers were all a great hit but the main courses were not such a success. Those who chose the pasta as a main dish all seemed pleased but the Pork was extremely tough and very bland. They made a beautiful birthday cake that was extremely well presented with a large group singing to the birthday girl in Spanish and in English!!! It was absolutely deliscoius!!!!!!!!Marinera was excellent. Eating under a thatched roof in the light of the full moon beside the beach. The food was proabley the best I had all week. We did 3 trips while we were there. The first one was the quading adventure... my husband and his brother went and although it was fun I highly doubt we would pay to do this a second time. The Quads were no in the best of shape and it is a follow the leader type tour so you only go as fast as the slowest person. For people who have quadded before it wasn't really an adventure.The second was a half day charter with FIRST CLASS FISHING. It was beautiful day and the waves weren't to bad. Unfortunately we didn't actually catch anything but the other boat that went out when we did actually caught a couple of really big fish. My biggest problem with the fishing was the disel fumes from the engine when we turned the boat around. Despite feeding the fish my breakfast about halfway through the trip I would not hesitate to head out on another deep sea fishing adventure. The stay of First Class Fishing were just that first class.Our last trip was definately the highlight of the trips we did the day trip to Saona Isla. Absolutely beautiful. We travelled by bus to the Catamaran then by Catamaran to the beach on Saona.(As soon as we got on the boat a Canadian guy got up an tied the canadiaan flag to the front and that started the trip off on a good note) Once at the beach we were fed an excellent buffet lunch and given a few hours to spend on the beach. Following the beach time we were taken by speed boat to the natural Starfish habitat and allowed to go in and check them out. Way to cool!!!! I would definately do this one again but when they say full day trip they mean all day. We left the hotel at 7:30 am and did not return til after 7:30 pm. Overall our trip was most enjoyable might have had something to do with the wonderful group that we travelled with or the many new friends that we made while we were down there. Party Goat Rules!!! I would definately return to the Grand Oasis Punta Cana....

<Content>Beautiful Resort I was at the resort from January 20th to 27th.The place is beautiful! The staff, the food, the drinks and the beach were all wonderful! The staff was always smiling and always said hello when they saw you. We even saw one guy hanging on a bench from the roof of one of the buidings painting, and he waved at us when we said hello. It was a crazy sight!The hostesses in Windows are right there to seat you breakfast lunch and dinner. They make sure you have what you need. The staff in Windows make sure you have a coffee or tea ASAP and also at night a lunch or drink, whether it be a beer or a pop and the glass doesn't stay empty for long at all. The beach did have quite a bit of seaweed that washed up this time, but the grounds keepers did the best the could to get it off the beach quickly. The beach huts went quickly so you had to be down at the beach early to get one. My only complaints about the resort was that the toilet in our room wasn't working towards the end of the week, the fridge didn't work but I enjoy room temp water so it wasn't a big deal, and the giant spider we had in our bathroom one morning. We called thr front desk and they sent someone up right away to dispose of the spider and to fix the toilet. Overall it was a great experience and I would go back!

<Content>Grand Oasis with Family We stayed at the Oasis from Jan 14-22. I was with my mom(Granny) and 2 boys, 3  5 years old. We checked in at 10:30pm. Everything was fine. I had requested building 2 on the lazy pool but was told it was unavailable. After showing some money I was told I could be moved in the morning, but the desk clerk walked us to a room he said would be better. It was building 6 near the adult pool. It was a suite, with 2 rooms, 2 balconies. Very spacious and nice. We decided to stay.Food was plenty and good. Always choices that pleased adults and children. Pools were clean and not too overcrowded. We did swim in the lazy river it was much cooler and didn't have alot of action for the kids. The kids club was a little lame. We did play there but I would not leave my children unattended as no one seemed to watch them carefully. The beach was nice but had a lot of seaweed. The hotel had men cleaning it up constantly so it didn't bother us. We did 1 excursion to Animal Adventure Park. The boys loved it. They picked us up on a boat for the 2 minute ride to the park. We got to touch sea lions, parrots, a nurse shark, starfish, sea urchins, monkeys, large snakes and a tiger! My boys were in awe. All in all we had a good trip. The hotel is a perfect size with everything within a quick walk.If anyone has questions feel free to contact me.

<Content>Perfect size We traveled with others who stayed at a larger resort and did not seem very happy.. We loved it and the one positive they said we could aways find each other. The service was very good..could use more bartenders during peak hours and the beach party was not worth our time...we upgraded to the suites but got none of the extra amenities but over all it was still a great vacation.

<Content>Enjoyed the Grand Oasis We stayed at the Grand Oasis January 20th thru the 27th booked thru Apple Vacations. Our only complaints are: Some very rude guests, and had our rafts stolen because WE left them at the pool under our loungers. We rate our experience above average because the service, food, and employee friendlyness were great. There are some agressive vendors here, but if you are not interested in thier service, then all you need to say is No Thank You. This is a very clean resort. Our special thanks go out to Vanessa of Guests Services.

<Content>A bit of false advertising..... Stayed at the Grand Oasis from Jan 17-24th. The Chameleon Suites were recommended to us by a travel agent with Holiday Market on line agency. Right up until the day of arrival we were unsure exactly what we'd be getting into as there were conflicting reports as to whether the building/rooms would be ready for occupancy. It's unfortunate that the agent didn't seem to be fully informed as to the status...I'm going to start with the not so good and end with the good...So.....the internet pics showed a floating rock climbing apparatus in the ocean-not there-it showed a large private pool alongside the ocean-not there-showed a nice hot tub in the spa area-did not say you had to pay $5.00 for 15 minutes to use. Showed a lazy susan style pool exclusive to Chameleon Suites-not filled. Booked in a group of 12  asked to be booked in the same building-assured this wouldn't be a problem-it was-we ended up in 3 different buildings-and not all in the Chameleon Suites. Friends in building 11 had no hot water a couple of times. Friends in building 6-had 2 beds pushed together vs a King size bed and the hallway smelled like raw sewage-they asked to be moved and it took a couple of days to get this changed. Our room in building 10 was nice-fridge wasn't very cold. We tipped our maid daily with money, candy etc. Didn't notice any extras -but we fully intended to tip regardless :)Chameleon Suites advantages advertised: Private Check in  out-unsure what this exactly meant as we received no special treatment here.Free internet-had to pay $5.00 for 20 minutes-and it wasn't up and running very often.Beach towels in room-never happened in our room-and it was only for the 1st day-the rest of the time you had to go and get yourself.Poolside drink service-never happened.$10.00 per room/day for casino-did get this, but could only be used at black jack or roulette tables. Could only use 1 voucher per day and Casino staff were very rude and accused a couple of people of trying to use more than 1/day when we didn't. Casino staff did not speak english.Restaurant reservations-we were able to book this-outside of the scheduled booking times for other guests.We enjoyed the entertainment. Most of the Recreation staff were fun and polite-we liked Yeti, Kathi, Coco Loco and the M.C.Kathi-braids hair at a good price and is located on the beach by the water sports building. Just barter with her as she will start off at a ridiculous price.DON'T book the dune buggy excursion with the fellas by the pool. They told us it was a 20 minute drive from the hotel-it was 1 hour 1 way. We were supposed to visit dunes and caves and swim in a natural spring. First of all-we were 1/2 hour delayed as one buggy had no brakes-one buggy's wheel fell off after driving approx. 20 feet. They didn't have enough buggy's for us to begin with. Once we got to the beach, 3 buggy's stalled and it took us at least 45 minutes to get up and running again. So we finally just told them to take us back and send the bus-we didn't even finish the excursion. We managed to get a bit of money back-but it wasn't worth the time it took.Even though it seems as though it wasn't that great-our group made the best of it and actually had a good time. We enjoyed the Karaoke nightly and had a great time by the pool each day. If you're travelling in a group-it's best to get someone to save your seats early in the morning as lounges get taken up quickly.The food was fine and the Italian restaurant was good.

<Content>Not Impressed at all! Stayed at the Oasis Jan. 13 - 20Not Impressed at all.......Got to the Hotel and had to wait 3 hours for our room to be ready. 3 hour in the non-air conditioned heat waiting is not fun. Group of 8 of us, 4 rooms and not 1 was ready for our stay.Room was Ok, big and fairly clean but nothing special....stayed in building 3 close to the pool and beach. Location of the building was good, but very loud at nights due to the bar out the window. Had to call twice to get the air conditioning going, and it was unpredictable throughout the entire week.Beach was nothing like what i remember Punta Cana to be (stayed in Barcelo - Punta Cana last year and it was 100 x better) full of sea weed and the water was not clear. the further South you go the better.The entertainment was horrible, and I do not expect much from the all inclusive shows.....just bad, dont waste any of your time! Cant describe how bad it really was!If your going on an excursion dont buy from the booth poolside, although they are cheaper then the tour operators in within the hotel the product is inferior; Sona Island tour was ok but the boat was a little more run down then others, ATV's broke down every two seconds. Oh ya 20 min. drive = 2 hours!!!Not going to comment on the food b/c it is pretty much what I expected, ok but not great.3 * at best, spend the extra money and go to barcelo - punta cana or baha principe, beaches, service and atmosphere far superior!I do not reccommend this place to anyone,

<Content>I Do'nt know what the complaints are about!!!! My husband and I went to the Grand Oasis Jan. 10 - 20. We flew and booked with Sunwing, nice flight, food and service. We stayed in building 3 on the ground floor, when we first arrived we had no towels, but soon as you let them know, they were there within 10 minutes. This resort is always clean and the staff are always hard at work to keep it that way. We found the beach was nice and we never had a problem trying to find a lounger at any time of the day. The main pool did get a bit busy, but if you did'nt like it you could go to the Adult Pool. We had a male maid( Appollo) and he was one of the best, anything we needed he was right there. The bartenders were always right on top of things and there were no long lineups. The food was fine ( do'nt forget you're in the Dominican, not at the Ritz), the best a-lacarte was the Italian, we went twice while we were there, very good. Overall we had no complaints about this resort, and do'nt forget you are not going to get 5 star service for the price you pay, it is a 4 star resort.

<Content>Tried hard to love it Have taken many vacations to tropical resorts and know what to expect when in a different country. Had read the reviews before going and decided that the few negative ones I had read were probably just sour grapes or inexperienced travellers. NOT! The beach was white sand covered in seaweed, our neighbours room was flooded because of an evening rain storm...and they did nothing to right the situation. Our room had cock roaches, smelled terrible, patio door didn't slide open, and we had to find our maid and ask for water and towels several times. The restaurants were nice...at best.... but we were seated at a table with dirty linen and a stained tablecloth...was verging on disgusting. Our special Christmas Eve dinner was a 400 person cattle drive....the food was nice but service was...well impossible even if they wanted to do well.The resort allow venders ON the resort so everytime you pass by to get food or go to your room (which is several times a day) you are approached to buy...very tired of saying no..10 times a day. On the plus side...well not much...the weather was nice and the hotel staff were very friendly....our teenagers enjoyed the beach grill and the rum bingo..... The evening shows...amateur at best! I rate it 2 star....no more than that!

<Content>Great activities Just returned from our week vaction and had a great time. The resort is presently being remodeld. I went with teenages and they had a great time. Staff was friendly, your typical Dominican staff. The shows at night are great, food is ok, avoid the American Grill. We stayed in one of the brand new buildings and it was super clean. If you like activities this is the place to go. Do not expect everybody to speak English, this is a Spanish speaking country. The alcohol was brand name, despite of what other people say - except for the rum which was local. This was our third trip to the Dominican and we were pleased. This resort has everything from shuffleboard to seakayaks, bananaboats pulled by motor boats, water arobics in the pool etc. For extra charge there is scuba at the coral reef, zip lines, parasailing and horseback riding and much more. We felt very safe and happy.

<Content>Neither Grand nor an Oasis We (3kids  wife) rented 2 rooms over Christmas/New Years Break. Wife and I stayed in the Suites for $50 extra per day. We had no AC the entire week and they would not give us a different room even if we took a downgrade. Kept telling us it was going to be fixed then on the 3rd day told us it was a hotel wide problem but our kid鈥檚 room had AC the entire time. Frig didn't work (warm beer - yeah) and when we went to get ice - no ice machines, had to walk all the way down to the bar (200 yds away). Couldn't get a beach towel or seat at the beach for the 1st 2 days sorry we鈥檙e really busy鈥?that was the standard reply anytime you ask for something from staff. They allow merchants to set up INSIDE the hotel grounds so every time you walked to a meal or the pools someone was trying to sell you a timeshare or carved coconut, very annoying. If you鈥檙e like me and need the shade, it was very limited unless you wanted to get up at 6:30 and do the towel save move and they had no umbrella鈥檚 to use or rent. Hotel was understaffed, not doubt. I didn鈥檛 see staff sitting around, those who we saw were running and hustling, just did not have nearly enough. Most breakfast meals you had to find someone to get you coffee only to get blown off and had to get it your self. All-inclusive was weak. No bottled water, no bottle or cans of beer 鈥?everything was served in small 10oz plastic cups, didn鈥檛 matter what you ordered. Couple of stations were you could get self-serve water or soda鈥檚 rarely had cups (understaffed problem) so you had to go to one of only 3 bars for the entire hotel and wait in line.We used Apple Vacations who were of no help with our room situation, beach towels and other problems, they were only interested in booking our excursions which it turns out we could have done on our own for less. The weather and beach were awesome; we went on 2 excursions that were great, saw some nice spots and had a good time once I let go of the poor choice we made with the Hotel. We talked to other folks during our excursions and they had much better experiences with their hotels, wouldn鈥檛 give up on Punta Cana just the weaky-joe Hotel improperly call Grand Oasis, should have been called the Grand Mirage鈥?.

<Content>Disaster Resort This is my review for Grand Oasis Bavaro (Cameleon) Punta CanaFirst of all I have to say to everyone who is reading this, do not think that Grand Oasis Bavaro is a new Hotel like the Travel Agencies like to describe the new section of the older resort the Grand Oasis or whatever this Resort is called, it has 10 different names and 10 different ratings and 10.000 confusions about this Resort. Please read every review that people have left and think twice before booking or you will pull your hair afterwards!Entrance/LobbyAs we arrived the lobby was empty and the check in was really quick and the bellboy was right there to take our luggage. The Lobby at first looked OK not really impressive but OK, on the second look I realised that it is old and cosmetically needed an makeover, the desk is all wood painted probably quite few times and looks like and older low class European Hotel that probably will be demolished pretty soon. One thing that saved the Lobby look from total bad review are the nice new chairs and couches plus glass elevator that takes visitors from the ground to first level where the 鈥淒isco鈥?is. There is not much to say about the lobby any more just maybe that it has two half round stair well and open air space from font (entrance) and back into the actually resort.RoomsWe stayed in the new building 鈥?鈥?witch is still not fully ready but fully occupied and is still under construction. Anyhow, the room looked quiet nice, we had a double queen bed room with a 30 inch flat screen TV and a nice bath with Jacuzzi tub(never used it) so I can not tell you if it worked. Shower worked pretty good and had most of the time warm water, 2 times we had to warm the water in the coffee maker to wash our 19 months boy. Hair drier was not working until the second last day and after 3 calls for repair. The balcony door had no lock until the last day and the safe box could be carried out because it was not attached to anything, it was on the floor, the door lock did not work properly so we had to go back to the lobby x-times and make clear to the unfriendly personnel that our door is not opening, I went nuts. The room service was really nice and friendly, we had nothing missing. We found out that they slack if you tip same every day. Also I have to say we found two roaches and had about 20 mosquito鈥檚 every day to kill. Bring mosquito sprays!!!!RestaurantsHere I could write a novel, quite simple, the food is low bellow my expectation of good food. The Grand Oasis Resort offers 1 Buffet Restaurant,1 beach restaurant that transforms into 1 a la carte at night, 3 a la carte and one beach grill that has the size of two hot dog carts. 鈥?Buffet or 鈥淲indow鈥?restaurant is quite big but not big enough to accommodate the huge crowd, sometimes we had to wait or try to find table and even harder to find was a high chair for our boy. There are some wooden table (not very new) and half of restaurant has plastic garden chairs and tables, also to mention is, do not expect to have a clean table cover or chair.Unfortunately we had to eat most of the time here because no other or better choice. In the morning you can be sure to find always the same food over and over again. For better understanding the breakfast could be compared with the Danny鈥檚 restaurant in the States or Canada, if you like to eat at Danny鈥檚 you will like the breakfast at Windows Restaurant. Lunch we found out to be better than breakfast or dinner. Again, not my food choice but at lest you will not starve.Dinner was really bad also, same food over and over again, lots of pork, low in see food and salad bar sucked. Plus you can expect roaches to visit you while you eat , we have been visited by an giant cockroach witch tried to climb my wife鈥檚 leg.鈥?Tex Max (a la carte) Restaurant was the worst of the 3 a la carte, we had a good laugh and 鈥淧residente鈥?beer , the food was returned, so much from Tex Max.鈥?Sea food (a la carte) Restaurand was OK nothing special but also not as bed as Tex Max, I had 鈥淢ai Mai鈥?filet, my wife had grilled chicken, we did not returned it. To my great disappointment we had no choice of free lobster nor shrimp, Lobster dinner was at extra cost of $35 US 飦?) really great price for such Restaurant. I could not think of anyone who would pay that much for 1 pond lobster tail at low class restaurant.鈥?La Romario (a la carte) Italian Restaurant was the very best choice of all the restaurants at Grand Oasis. Food choice was good, and the taste was not bad as well, the salad and beef tenderloin I had was quite good prepared.Again to say the food was not according my taste but I was not sick either, in total the food could be compared to Denny鈥檚, Montana or similar restaurants in the North America.PoolsGrand Oasis has now 5 pools, 1 main centre pool is quite big and about the size of two Olympic swimming pools but only 1-1.35m deep, you will find one small baby pool, two lazy river and one adult pool with hot tub on side, all pools are in pretty good shape and are not dirty, just you have to wake up early in the morning about 6 to reserve a spot.BeachBeach is quite nice, lots of palm trees and palm umbrellas that provide enough shade, again early wake needed to reserve good spot. Beach bar is close by and should provide enough counterfeit boos. Also to mention is the beach sport choice of volley ball, soccer, bocce, dart, free kayak, catamaran.BarsThere are 4 bars, and 1 pool bar, all serve no name (counterfeit) alcohol, you will not find any brand name. If you like to get drunk have fun drinking a lot doe to lower alcohol content than other similar brand name drinks.All in total , think twice before booking, do not rush into this resort and do not believe the 鈥済reat reviews鈥?some people leave here, I have no idea what kind of Resort they stayed at.In my eyes this was a Disaster Resort, nothing went smoothly, from check in to check out nothing but trouble and stress. I have to say that people I have met at the resort all had the same opinion and experience. Do not think that Grand Oasis opened a new resort and that you can use the new and old facility, there is NO new resort just new rooms to cash in and get more tourists. Be aware of annoying time share dudes and lunatic vendors that will try to grab you and sell you a key chain for $10 US cost of 20 cent and so on. This was definitely the first and last time at this resort and probably in the Dominican, people are to rude to support them, Cuba is much more attractive to me now than it was ever before. I would not recommend this resort to experienced travelers nor expecting first timers, travelers with small children forget it. I would recommend this resort for younger travelers that do not expect much or do not care about services and care only about alcohol and some opposite sex action.

<Content>Horrible service.....Stolen mp3 player We went to the Grand Oasis Punta Cana and stayed for one week. The hotel is bought out by Globalia, so there is bad management. While we were staying the weather normal (lots of rain). It rained 4 out of seven days, but the rains were pretty short. My worst experience was that I couldn't go snorkelling becauce my leg was broken, but my other family members say there weren't much fish to see.OUR FLIGHT TO PUNTA CANA:We flew by Sunwing. The flight was about 4 hours long.CHECK IN:Check-in was fast and effective. We got our room right away, and when we decided to move to a more private room, we got that room right away too.GROUNDS:The grounds of the resort were beautiful and very tidy. The resort is put together pretty well. There was some construction going on beside the adult's pool but that was hardly noticable.STAFF:The staff were very friendly and also very helpful. We rented a wheelchair for me (as I had a broken leg), and when I had some problems with it, the staff always helped. Though when we went to the Marinero (seafood) restaurant one of the staff was very unfriendly (he handed us the menu without even looking at us!) and completly ruined our experience there.SERVICE:The service was very bad compared to the hotel Playa Costa Verde in Holguin, Cuba. There if you give them a tip, they will do anything. At GOPC they just continue on with their work not paying any attention to you as though you didn't give them anything. When you ask for cofee you have to wait for a minimum of 20 minutes to get it, and they bring it cold. They don't seat you when you come, so they don't know where you are and that also adds up to the time. An example of bad management.FOOD  RESTAURANTS:The food was completely excellent! There were three 脿 l脿 c脿rt猫 restaurants: seafood, Italian and the American grill. We figured out that the Dominican Republic's national food is eggplant, and they serve it every day.Buffet:The food was excellent and there was a big choice of foods there. The buffet was built with a circle of food in the centre and tables around it. For those of you who like to smoke, there is a special area (you can eat there too). You can also request a table outside. There was a large roach on the cuttlery and the staff didn't even worry about it (!).Marinero Seafood 脿 l脿 c脿rt猫:As I said earlier, the staff completely ruined our experience so I can't exatly say anything about it. Our waiter was rude and we went without ordering anything.American Grill  Tex-Mex:The food there was delicious. The restaurant was made in a mexican ranch style. The menu consisted of both mexican and american foods. We were pretty happy with the restaurant.Da Mario's (Italian):The best restaurant I went to. There were lots of food choices and the food was delicious. It was probably the hit of the trip. A wedding was going on there and everyone got a piece of delicous wedding cake.BEACH:The beach is OK. There are some choppers frequently going around the area, but that didn't bother us much. The beach has some vendors on it, but they just sit there doing nothing. There is also a beach bar (really good!). They have burgers, fries,hot dogs, chicken and pizza. The ocean is murky and you have to go to another area for clean water. My family members say that that there weren't any fish to look at and that the snorkelling trip was a rip-off.OTHER:The maid stole my 100$ mp3 player so I was extremly dissapointed.OUR OVERALL EXPERIENCE:We didn't have a very good time, and we don't reccomend this hotel to others. We will never come back to this hotel again.

<Content>Do your research First... Good Points. We upgraded our room with the hotel reception, the first room they gave us was pool view, horrible smelly room, we upgraded to Block 7, beautiful, comfortable, very clean and luxury.Reception staff and entertainment team great, the girls in the mini club are lovely.Weather was fab for the 2 weeks.Got out with a staff member, wish we had done this earlier cause day 7 we needed to do something else, as confined to the hotel it does get a little boring.Bad Points...The food is TERRIBLE,,,, Lots of food poisioning, I am very fussy when it comes to food and especially countries like this I don't trust there meats etc, my husband is Italian and we have a restaurant in the UK, we checked out the Italian rest on site, it is disgusting, myself and my son were both ill for the next 3 days.Coffee is bad, mineral water has a horrible taste,,,,,,if you just wish to eat fruit and veg all 2 weeks then you will be fine, burger, hotdogs, chips are served at the beach bar with a load of green flies all over them, stay clear!!!!!!!!We felt the need to bring some issues to the attention of the Manager, as that day in the childrens play are we were aware of a live cable coming out of the sand, we made them aware of there service which is definately not to 5 star standard, this is more like a 3 star.Overall if you want cheap, cheerfull, not bothered what you eat, and can cope with swimming in dirty water then this hotel is for you.......We WON'T be back ever.........

<Content>Awesome We were 10 in our group. 6 adults 4 teenagers. Arrived Dec 20 and stayed for 2 weeks. If you get into building 7, congrats, if you are willing to pay an addition $30US per night. We were in building 3, which was just fine. We spent the whole day at the beach/pool. The beach was beautiful, but not enough huts. All you need to do is get to the beach early by 6:30 to reserve your favourite hut. You might want to purchase soem cheasp beach towels at home to mark your spot on the beach if you can't get towels sometimes until 10:00 a.m. Rememeber staying at building 3 will put you overlooking or very close to the courtyard were there is lots of noise from bands...etc. Building 2 might be a better choice for those that like it quieter.Yes there was some noise with the garbage trucks, removing the old huts and bringing in new sand. Once completed the new beach area near building 7 was quite and tranquil.A must is to check out the adult only pool and bar. Very relaxing and quite.The fitness centre is next to the spa and theatre, my kids worked out every day with great equipment. Niece went to the spa for a treatment. Enjoy it. Son went golfing at Cocotal. Played as a junior for $90 US. We also took the Country Adventure tour. If you have back problems, don't go. The roads are full of pot holes. Countryside is beautiful and mountainous.The pool was very well maintained as were the grounds. If you hear negative posts about buildiing 10, be aware that this building should have been completed by the Christmas rush, but unfortunately it was not. I know that our tour contact, Antoine, did everything in his power to help those who travelled with Sunwing and were originally booked into building 10. The rooms were spacious and clean. The maids are a bit slow.Here's how it works with the beach towels, between 8-12 tickets for towels, between 12-4 towels for towels, after 4pm towels for tickets. The food was amazing, we got treated to 2 nights of lobster. Amazing. Our server, for breakfast and lunch at Windows was Angel. He really is a great guy and helps you with your Spanish. There is a 24 hour bar and food service down by the beach. Unfortunately, there was one incident were we couldn't get any food after midnight, but a little palm greasing goes a long way. Finally, take lots of $1 bills to tip the servers and other staff. Take enough US cash with you. Don't pay by credit card, you will charged an extra %. We wanted to pay for golf by credit card and were told that it costs $90 US which, converted to pesos was 3240. Now when I get my MC bill it will be converted to Canadain so now I weill be charged $112.00 for a round of golf( hey aren't the dollars on par??). Rent the safe for 18.00 we paid for 2 weeks and keep your US cash there. You should take at least 600.00 US to take advantage of the great tours available. For great value this is a good place. You should remeber that Oasis has just taken over this hotel and within another year or so it should be top notch. Make sure you visit your travel doctor before you go and don't rent a car too many pot holes- barter with the taxi drivers. Vendors in the courtyard 2-3 times per week. Don't pay full price- remember let them go to their lowest point, then offer half and walk, if they don't want to sell, there are lots of vendors with lots of merchandise.About 1/2 km from the hotel, there are vendors that used to be on the beach. And a little further down from the vendors is a mini market store, were you can purchase items without bartering, the staff is very friendly. Take personal items like immodium, tums ($12 US for a small bottle) and gravol, the hotel stores charge outrageously for these items.Have a great time- Cheers

<Content>Only Getting Better !!! Stayed at the Grand Oasis Dec. 9 -14th, this was our 10th trip to DR and our third to this resort, but when it was the Sunscape before. Things have only gotten better ! The room manager was wonderful ! We traveled with my cousin and his wife. We requested a room in the new building 7, third floor and ocean view. We were placed in rooms at the end of the building, facing the beach. There was a hottub on the deck outside. We were there the day tropical storm Olga hit, one of only three named storms ever in Dec. in 100 years, (our luck), but that day we filled the tub up outside, relaxed. The rooms in building 7 were breathtaking, we stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro the last two years,those were nice, but these were a step up. The food was great at all the resturants. The staff could not be nicer and always will to help. We used the new Spa for massage, very nice and relaxing. The new casino was a nice added feature. Caren, the room manager and her great personality, made a great trip that much better. If you get a chance look her up. She is a great asset to the resort ! We are already making plans to return this Dec. and stay at the new resort next to the Grand Oasis, the Grand Oasis Bavaro Suites. Would recommend this resort to all. You can't go wrong.

<Content>clothes stolen stayed at the grand for two weeks 23dec-6jan the we were upgraded to a junior master suit in block seven , we had originally booked to stayat the cameleon but the building was not complete. we were promised all the services of the cameleon..we recieved none we arrived at 10.30pm no welcome drink, checked in as normal. no private conciergeroom was nice but the fridge had not been closed properly and the drinks were warm and there were small bug runing around. the safe had been closed i called to have it opened after 3 days and numerous callsthey eventually opened the safe. the door to the toilet was locked, again i called twice and at 1am two staff arrrived armed with a table knife they eventually just broke the lock and said they would fix it tomorrow it was never fixed. beach towels should have been in the roomthis was hit and miss some days there was 1 other 3 and some none on new years eve we noticed my daughters evening top and bra top missing valued at $300 i went to the desk to report it they sent a security guard and i filled in a form they said they would investigate and check to see if it had been taken to the laundry. the next morning i went back to the desk i was told by vanessa nothing was found and the investigation was closed and there was nothing she could do. i obviously challenged her she said i could complain to the police so i asked her to call she refused she said i would have to call from my room where i would be charged she did offer in the end to call me a taxi to go to the police station at my own expense, i asked if she would accompany me as i dont speak spanish she refused and said it hads nothing to do with her after more heated discussion she reluctantly called my tour rep .. karin from nolitours who basically was as equally unhelpful said the police would give me hard time and it wasnt worth it i asked to speak to a manager but i was told he was a busy man!.the food in the resort was okay nothing special and majority of the time it was warm/cold with the exception of the american grill where the food was actually served hot the staff away from the front desk worked hard the maid service seemsto depend on who you got as i had heard some good reports by other people the entertainment staff were amazing and my son(11) had a wonderful time with them one word of warning if you have a teenage daughter as i do (16) be aware that the staff continuously hit on her, making sugestive comentsand remarks and making her at times feel very uncomfortable. putting all that aside we had an okay time would i go back..NO WAY!!!

<Content>Great! Normally I go to Cancun.My wife convinced me to go to an all inclusive so off we went to DR Oasis.Beach: Excellent. Reefs outside break waves so you don't have large waves and you can swim without worrying about undertow (yes, I do worry about it, since somebody I know died that way). I swam every day.Guests: Mostly Europeans  Canadians. Kid friendly but things to do for adults. Not a heavy singles scene, no spring breakers.Food: Loved it. That was my biggest beef with the previous all inclusive. I live in NYC and love good food. The buffet was excellent. The tea was perfect.Rooms: Large, everything worked, new. Some of the rooms can be dark (if between buildings).Entertainment: Daily show. Off-off-off-off-off Broadway, but fun.Go to Michael Jackson. Dance lessons: Bachata, Merengue  The Oasis Club Dance. Ping-pong, tennis.Gym: Dumbells, a universal type machine, some stationary bikes. Not bad at all.Safety: No probs, you are in the jungle, nothing around you, felt safe.Previous experience: mostly Cancun, Acapulco, Bahamas, Florida (never again), Barbados.Night life: A wonderful bar outside, small but neat casino, disco and piano bar.Staff: Fun bunch. No attitude. Just remember: you are on vacation and the Dominican 5 minutes is 1/2 hour in real time.Overall: I recommend it strongly including to my father.

<Content>3 star quality My hubby and I went to Grand OPC and were extremely disappointed by a few things:1. Bed bugs - got bit on second night and spent 3rd day at medical clinic b/c my arms swoll up twice its normal size; 2. Medical consult was $500 (included anitbiotic cream  tablets); not allowed to drink alcohol or exposure to sun for 2 days after! 3. Toilet wasn't working - made noise all night;3. Ants and small bugs always in sink - did they come in from drain system? 4. We signed up for honeymoon pkg  provided docs. Wedding planner (Scarlett Garcia) lied about pkg items even though they were advertised in brochure - in blue  white! Roberto  Domingo (mgrs at the time) refused to help; 5. Sunwing rep was not available after bed bugs/ bites incident;6. Stray dogs on beach We liked a few things:- Italian a la carte resto mgr was GREAT! meal was fantastic - white sand  water in Punta Cana are gorgeous! The year before we stayed at the TROPICAL PRINCESS which was definitely a 4 star  Caribe side was value-added! At the TROPICAL PRINCESS:1. Rooms  wsahrooms always clean - no bed bugs2. Beach was clean, gorgeous and no stray animals; 3. Ainmation team was terrific / they remembered our names  favorite dances from day 1 onwards;4. Food was terrific;5. Service was excellent  Much preferred Tropical Princess in Punta Cana

<Content>Just ok... Nothing great I stayed at the GOPC from Dec 29 - Jan 5. The weather was pretty poor. I was in Punta Cana last April and did not have one ounce of rain. This week it rained 4 /7 days and when it wasn't raining it was either cloudy or very windy. I guess Dec is their rainy season.... Now for the review of the resort:CHECK IN / CHECK OUT: Prior to the trip, I called the resort twice to ask if I could check-in early and both tiems they said yes, check in at noon would be no problem. My partner and I arrived at the resort at 1pm and our room wasn't ready. We waited until 4pm. Not really a big issue though - we dropped our luggage at the front, grabbed some lunch and explored the resort.Checking out was a breeze. No problem.GROUNDS:The grounds were exceptionally clean and well kept. We always saw employees of the resort working hard up keeping the gardens, or picking up any trash along the resort. RESORT:The resort is nice, however I think it looks much better in pictures. The resort is well laid out, however some of the rooms/buildings look run down and in need of some serious renos.PEOPLE/ SERVICES:Some of the staff were friendly, however we found that most were not. We found that we did not get what we wanted until we threw some money at the situation. As mentioned by previous guests, most of the employees do not speak English. Our maid only knew three english words: clean, coke and thank you.The staff in the Amercian Grill (one of the restaurants) were terrible. We (along with other guests) tried to order pizza at 11pm and they got very annoyed. They were also so slow and extremely lazy. It took over 45 minutes for us, and others, to receive our pizza or burgers. ALso, during checkout, we randomly overheard two of the reception staff talking about how two of the American Grill staff were fired last Friday. I wasn't surprised at all. They were horrible. FOOD:My partner and I found the food to be almost terrible, but I knew other people who found it to be ok. I found like most of the resort, the food catered mostly to Eastern European tastes. I also was extremely unimpressed with the food times. If you missed breakfast, it was 2 hours until lunch, and if you missed lunch it was 3 hours until dinner. The variety of food was also pretty poor. Same thing everyday it seemed.BEACH:The beach was great. However, I previously stayed at the Princess and the beach there was much better. Sand was much cleaner and the water was much calmer. If beach condition / location is very important to you, I would strongly advise that you book else where as this resort is right next to a marina, which means there are constantly numerous boats in the water, making noise and creating large waves. Also, there was a lot of seaweed that was constantly being washed up on shore. Some guests have said that you need to reserve a beach chair by 6am or 7am. We did not find this to be true at all. We were there during a very busy time of the year, and we never had any trouble finding beach chairs around 11am, 1pm 2pm or later. ROOM:We stayed in room 7201, the master junior suites. It was a very large spacious room with a jaccuzi. The only issue we had with the room was that it had a very strong musty/mold smell the entire week and our fridge did not work at all. Also, on the first day our a/c did not work, however we called front desk and someone was up within a few hours and it was fixed.OTHER: One poster mentioned that many ppl harassed him/her about buying time shares. We did not have one person approach us about this during the entire trip. However, be very careful about the vendors on the resort. They are EXTREMLY pushy and they try to rip you off. I wanted to buy a necklace and the man told me it would be $85 because it was a rare dominican stone. I laughed at him and told him I would give him $10. He said ok. When they give you a price for something, divide that number by at least 4 (seriously) and that should bring the price down to a reasonable number.OVERALL: I woudln't return to the GOPC. I did not like how the resort catered almost exclusively to Europeans, and I did not like the beach location of the resort. The food was also almost inedible for my partner and I.

<Content>Buyer Beware Our stay at grand Oasis was okay but still disappointing. We are a middle income middle aged couple who have travelled to a handfull of sunny desinations. I would only give a very honest and frank review.We lucked out on our rooms bigtime. I cant tell you the nightmares I was hearing from other canadians about thier accomodations. One poor family even got put in the workers quarters and they had booked a suite. They were devistated....finally moved on the forth day of thierstay.Another family who booked suites got the brand new building 9....it wasnt a suite,they were on the ground floor and thier patio door didntlock, no shower curtain, no working tv, no safe...on and on.We stayed in building one where 20 times a day you had to get past thevendors who were relentless.We left a tip as well as a gift everday for our maid....this got us nobath towels or faceclothes on most days.The room was big but the furniture delapitated.....at least it was clean.The vacation club people are also to be wary of.We were told we could see the new suites and an offical tour only to have waisted 3 hours and to be hit with a 14,000 dollar proposition to buy in, followed with anger when no was our reply. Real shady characters I can assure you.The food was good for the most part.We couldnt get a reservation at the itialian,we ate twice at american grill and it was excellent. The grounds were immaculate, the bar service down right rude at times, butmost often decent.The beach and pools were nice but aquiring a cabanna on the beach onlyhappened for us on one cloudy day.Pool loungers were also a hot commodity and were hard to get.Bring your own towels they really helped with the shortage of bath towels and less worry about the hotel towels.Forget snorkling off the beach...the water to choppy and lots of seaweed. They did keep the beach looking chean however.All I can say is buyer beware...maybe stay somewhere you will be sure to get what you booked.

<Content>A week in the DR Let me tell you a little bit about the trip. The flight down there waswith Zoom. It was a non-stop 7 hour (give or take) flight. They servedus okay food and showed three movies to pass the time. The airport in Punta Cana is really small but the neat thing about it is its a thatched roof building with very few walls! Its all open. We took the shuttle bus that was arranged for the different resorts by Sunwing. It worked out really well because we were the first stop.The resort itself was very nice. The lobby, the pool, the grounds werein great shape. The rooms were a little shabby. Our room was clean andcomfortable but nothing special. We noticed little things like peeling paint and rust but with the humidity down there its to be expected. The only thing that confused us was how to get the power to work in the room. When we got there there was one lamp on in the room.We tried the other lights, the TV, the hair drier and nothing would work. Eventually we figured out that you had to put your room card in this little slot by the door. I guess they do that so people don't leave lights and the AC on all day. Once you pull that card out, the lights turn off in about 5 minutes. Everybody says to tip the maid andyou'd get something a little extra in your room but we found the exactopposite. The more we tipped the less we got. In fact on one day when we left $5 they TOOK beer from our fridge!! The next day we left $2 and we got more beer and more towels. I don't get it. The beach was FANTASTIC! White sand that was so fine it was like baking powder. The water in front of our resort was a little weedy on some days but not too bad. A 20 minute walk up from our resort was the best. The ocean was completely weed free the bottom was all soft sand and the water was warm and a brilliant blue. The food was nothing remarkable. It was what we had expected. The buffet had a pretty good variety each day. For the most part it consisted of pasta, rice and various meats (chicken, beef or pork). There were seafood dishes but I stayed away because that's just not my thing. The a la carte restaurants were okay, on par with some of the chain restaurants we have here. The staff at the resort were for the most part really friendly with the exception of Osiris at the front desk. He was a bit of a crank. We didn't really do many of the activities that they offered (aerobics, dance lessons, volleyball, etc) so we didn't talk much to the activities staff. The bar tenders seemed to be friendly for the most part. We tipped a little bit but it never seem to have any effecton the level of service that we got. We went on a snorkelling tour and it was worth every penny! Neither ofus had either been snorkelling so we have nothing to compare it to butit was a lot of fun. I was a little anxious because I swim like I'm wearing cement shoes, so jumping off the side of boat in the middle of the ocean a couple of miles from shore was a little scary. They give you a floatation device that goes around your waist so everythingwas good. Once I overcame the instinct to hold my breath when my head was under the water I quickly got the hang of snorkelling. You don't need to be a strong swimmer at all. They have a pen that is about 30 feet x 30 feet that you snorkel in. In this pen there about 15 string rays 6 nurse sharks and various other fish. It was amazing! After snorkelling they took on a little cruise along the shore to a natural pool that was about 5 feet deep and they served us drinks in the ocean. The weather was great. It did rain a couple of times but they were short lived showers. You can see the weather coming in from the ocean so you have ample time to head for dry ground. After 10-20 minutes of hard rain the sunshine would return. The temperature never changed much. It was always between 25-30 degrees. It was an awesome week spent lying on the beach, reading, napping and relaxing.

<Content>Great vacation We were in Grand Oasis Punta Cana from 19th Dec. 2007 to 26th Dec. 2007. We had a great time and my daughter who is 16 years old wants to go to the same place again.We liked our room (# 3130); it was next to the beach and the pool. Everything was very close by and in couple of days we feel safe to send my daughter to the room alone even. Hotel and surroundings were clean all the time.We really enjoyed all restaurants and food specially seafood including lobsters on Christmas even. We eat Lobsters lot but never had delicious Lobsters like that. My kids freely went to the beach restaurant and picked what they wanted during the day. Non-alcoholic drinks were very good. I never forget the Christmas Eve dinner at Windows.We enjoyed all activities: Table-tennis and Tennis (they have rackets), bike rides (with no helmets.. my son was not comfortable with it, but he did it) in the morning (thanks for the guide... sorry I forgot his name) especially with my 8 years old son. My kids and husband spend lot of time near the Pool table and thanks to Carmen for her kind smile and support all the time. It was an open and safe place for kids even.Except one day always our room was clean. Did not see any bug. Air-conditioner  iron worked fine. It was an ordinary hotel room but I liked the size. We took the Safari through Sunwing and it was a day long trip. I wish it was shorter than that. They could take us to a place for horse riding closer to the place we went. We saw the same thing on the way and it will be nice to organize this trip couple of hours less than now. They took us to a souvenir shop but prices were very high. I bought a mermaid wood statue from one of the vendors in the resort for US $ 60, but this shop said similar one is US $ 450 (finally he came down to US $ 200). All the fancy jewellery and cigars also were very expensive there. Sunwing should take us to a reasonable store for shopping. Be careful for buying things from this store.I learned to bargain during my holidays and got couple of good deals. If they say US $ 30 then ask it for US $ 5. I bought lot from Miguel and he bought things from the city even for my request.We tipped couple people but they were not expecting from us. I gave couple of Canadian pens and notes pads too. Everyone was nice, very polite and always smiling. Some could not speak English but we did not have any problem.I loved the coffee they make at the Beach Bar. I asked them to use a bigger cup and enjoyed every late night.We did Para Sailing, Kayak, Catamaran (thanks for the guy who trained my husband) and enjoyed all. We did not find hard time to find chairs in the beach because my husband or I went to the beach around 8 am and reserved them for the family (like others do).We enjoyed dance and water aerobics lessons at the pool during noon.Animation team always worked hard with kids and adults to make them happy. On 25th Dec. Santa arrived by motor boat and gave gifts to every kid.We had couple of disappointments too. - We want to get more US $ (they advised us not to use our Credit Cards) but there was no Bank Machine. Front Desk also did not have enough cash. They asked us to get a taxi and go to a bank. But my husband walked to another resort and got it done.- Somehow my husband lost his wrist-watch. I complained it to the front desk and they noted it. That was it. I do not think they do anything to find something you lost. There is no Lost and Found place or no inquiry with the staff (especially maids).- Most of Night Shows were great for adults and kids. But, there was one show not good for kids. These shows should suitable for the whole family because we have to go there with our kids at night.I would like to recommend this resort to anyone who likes food, relaxation and other extra activities during a vacation.

<Content>Not 5 Star! I recently got back from this hotel on the 21st December 2007 after a weeks stay in what i thought would be a 5 star hotel. Don't get me wrong it was well worth what we paid. However, WARNING! I advise that if you are travelling from the UK you DO NOT upgrade your room through your travel agent. Wait until you get there. I had set my heart on a room with a jacuzi and was utterly disappointed. We booked through the agent and paid an extra 300 dollars only to find that when we got there we had been upgraded to the Deluxe Suite which was in building 2 not 7. After enquiring at reception we could have paid that amount at the reception for the room we wanted however, although we had already paid one this was a standard upgrade charge so then would have to pay again! AS IF IM MADE OF MONEY! anyway after that we got into a room in building 2. It was adequate! the air con was an absolute god send. The alcohol was absolutely disgusting, i hardly drank anything all week. The food i would say was ok. Breakfast had a very good choice and was to a good standard and the evening meals were ok! didn't get ill thank god! As for the beach, it was lovely. However, be careful as you will continually be hassled everywhere on this resort by shop owners, time share guys, watersports guys etc! They drove me in sane! Also watch out for the local market people that appear at the resort twice a week! just dont even look, i spent half an hour getting very stressed trying to tell them that i WAS NOT going to pay 150 dollars for a stone necklace! They think your stupid! All in all i had a wonderful time here due to the fact that we booked on lots of excursions. Therefore, not spending much time on the resort. (Definately do the Outback Safari its a fantastic day out. Just hope you dont go on a day when there is a tropical storm like we did. ) If you go with an open mind you will love it here, just don鈥檛 expect the rooms to be anything like the pictures. The food also looks like its from a glossy magazine! How WRONG!! Take money with you and do the trips! And last but most importantly if any one approaches you JUST SAY NO!

<Content>Magnificent Time at Grand Oasis Punta Cana, Domenican Republic Stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana from December 19-25, 2007. There was nine of us on this trip, us being middle aged with our children, some in their teens and some in their 20's.Travelled from Toronto on Sunwing, which we really enjoyed. They had a champagne dinner with great food. Now let me tell you about the resort, with feedback from the other eight people that accompanied me.Food: Was very good, fresh, and very tasty compared to some of the other resorts we have stayed at. No one got sick, not even heartburn. There was a good variety with always great foods that we loved to eat. We are of Portuguese descent, and there was fresh Passion Fruit there, Wow, was that a bonus. With a small tip, we got extra passion fruit during our stay.Service: Excellence with a smile. As i have posted in my past reviews, I love the Domenican People. They are most humble and present themselves very well. They are very appreciative of any tips you give them, but i never got the impression that someone was serving better to get a tip. Even if we didn't tip them, we received excellent service. Ok, so once in a while they would forget to bring us our drink, but i could see that they were extremely busy. It wasn't because of tips. Not at this resort anyways. But we did tip a waiter the night before Christmas Eve at one of the A La Carte Restaurants. He remembered us on Chrismas Eve, and we ate outside at one of the best table available. We also needed help with our safe, as it wasn't working, and they came to help us within minutes.Excellent Service at Front Desk as well.Beach: Weather was Gorgeous thoughout our trip. The only annoying thing was the first 2 days, there were trucks passing back and forth on the beach. Apparently, there were a few huts that were demolished and had to move out, so these trucks were carrying all the garbage and wood from the left of our resort. It was a nuisance, but only lasted 2 days or so, and that was it.A nasty storm had passed by there a few days before we arrived, so there were remnants from the palm trees in the ocean. It was not seaweed as some travellers have mentioned. For most part, the water was pretty clean, no complaints. Animation Staff: Although we didn't travel with small children, I found that the Animation Team was Fantastic. There is a kids club there, and if you have small children, this is the place to be.They spend a lot of time with the children, and even put them on stage doing either a little fashion show or other things.Some special Animation Staff that we met were Pedro, Anthony, Desiderio, Yety, Orchidia (which i met at Majestic Colonial in April), she is now at this resort, was so nice to see her again.They work so hard to keep all the visitors happy, congrats to you all for making our stay such an enjoyable one.We took the Safari ride into the country for one whole day. We really enoyed it. Got to see how the poor people live. We took clothes, toiletries, hats, gum and candy to all the different children. Stopped for lunch at a Domenican home, went horseback riding on their farm. Saw how they make the coffee beans, and also visited a sugar cane site. It was a lot of fun for 75 U.S. dollars a person, worth the trip really. Stopped by Macao Beach on the way back.There is a casino on this resort, as well as a Disco. There are vendors with small huts on the resort, which you can really bargain with when buying jewelry etc. Work with them down to half and you will have a deal. They are very nice and well mannered. Overall, We all loved this resort. Didn't see any bugs at all.There were a couple of mosquito bites, but you get that everywhere.Overall, we had a great time at this resort, and would recommend it to anyone. It was clean, great people, good food.Would go back in a heartbeat.Thank You Trip Advisor, for allowing me to post this honest review.

<Content>Grand Oasis? Property does not meet its name We arrived at the Grand Oasis the 22nd of December for 7 days. We were a party of 18. Fortunately, we booked a room in building 7 and obtained a room on the 3rd floor with an ocean front view. The room was large with a king size bed and sitting area. 2 jacuzzi tubs- 1 in the room and 1 on the outside deck. The room was clean except the pillow cases smelt like mildew and the maid service was late in the afternoon around 4 pm. One day, no one came and we had them clean the room while we were at dinner. The rest of the party stayed in building 4. The halls were dirty, rooms were old (needs updating) and the hot water was not plentiful.Internet - Not that you go to a resort to work, some of us have to - If you stay in building 7, there is a room opposite the elevator that has a large t.v., couches and 2 computers with free internet access. We were originally told that we would have internet access available in the room; there is none. The property has an internet room between the lobby and casino with only 2 computers that is for a fee for service. The front desk will not let you know of the free service in building 7 when you check in. I had to ask for the manager until the front desk finally told me about the room in building 7. The front desk help is good at deflecting requests.Food - The food is terrible. We have been to the Club Med in Punta Cana twice. While Club Med food is not spectacular, it was 5 star compared to the food served at the Grand Oasis. While there were multiple choices, I do not want to see another hamburger for a while after 6 straight days of eating them at lunch. I had a hot dog the final day. These were the only things that were edible. For Dinner, stay away from Windows cafeteria and make reservations in the Italian or Tex Mex restaurants. You order off a menu and are served. The Italian restaurant requires men to wear pants. I could not understand if i could eat in shorts at Mortons in Puerto Rico, why i would have to wear long pants at a restuarant at a resort that was no where near the quality of an Olive Garden.Beach - the water was dirty with debri washing on to the shore. We went on a fishing trip on the Atlantic side of the island and the water was clear and appealing to swim in. There was plenty of seating. The saving of seats was just as obnoxious as any other Carribean resort i have stayed. On 2 occaision around 9 am, we had to wait for towels. I would never return to the Grand Oasis unless they made great strides in the food. I could deal with the other issues. It is a trade off, if you want a cheap vacation to get a sun tan the place may be for you. If food is important, try another place.

<Content>Needs Updating, Great Weather! We just returned from a Christmas vacation at this resort. We arrived on Dec. 20th and returned on Dec. 27th. When we arrived, we were amazed at all the Christmas decorations. Although it was our first family trip away over the Christmas season, the atmosphere was certainly festive. We have travelled to Punta Cana 4 other times prior and found that this resort was by far the most in need of upgrading. ROOM: We stayed in Building 5 and found that the first room we were assigned had bed bugs jumping on the sheets when we first pulled down the covers. The TV and the air-conditioning were inoperable as well as the mini-fridge. We immediately attended the front desk and they were able to relocate us to another room. Great customer service in this regard. We viewed two rooms before we found one that had operable air conditioning. We did see cockroaches, they were HUGE! FOOD: I have read several reviews that the food was awesome鈥?not according to our family. We aren't too picky but out of our group of 10, we were definitely disappointed with the food. We recommend the Italian and the American Grill. Christmas Eve was rather interesting! The resort had two sittings in the buffet restaurant (Windows) with a very expanded menu of lobster, roast beef, pork, etc. The line-ups in the buffet were long and the festive cheer was not too positive. People were yelling at others for jumping the line. There wasn't much Christmas cheer in those line ups! We are still talking about Christmas Eve dinner, it certainly was different!SERVICE: The best service I have ever received in any of the resorts I have been to! I don't know if they brought in extra staff for the holiday season but I did not have to wait for a drink at the bar, never had to wait for beach towels, always had hot water for showers with our room always stocked with bath towels. Service was awesome!BEACH: The construction that you might have read in a review earlier was just finishing up when we arrived. We did see the heavy machinery but all was removed by Dec. 22nd. The staff were constantly raking the beach and you still see them using their wheelbarrals to dump their contents on the other side of the towel building but I found them to be aware of pictures being taken. They are hard workers! The availability of beach chairs is no different then any other resort. We usually were out getting chairs at 8:00 a.m. and there was slim pickins but I wouldn't leave it much later to get them. We found that people were dropping off their towels the night before, especially for the umbrellas. We had fun with those people鈥?moving their stuff to the other end of the beach. Grow up people, at least play the game in the morning with the rest of the guests!OVERALL: Would rate it a 3 star and would definitely not return to this resort, mainly due to state of rooms and food. There are plenty of resorts to try in Punta Cana.Cindy, Waterdown, ON

<Content>Beware Time share hawkers everywhere! This was the third time for my family to visit this resort. We were here in April 2006 and in June 2007. Things have changed since then. Our trip was December 11th to December 25th, 2007. When we were there before, it was an All Inclusive resort only. There was one set of wrist bands worn. Now you can see yellow, white, fusia and blue bands being worn by vacationers. The Bad:BEWARE :The 'time share' people VACATION CLUB were a real pain in the butt with their hard sell. They stand usually in threes at any and all strategic points on the resort meaning every time you want to get something to eat you get harrassed by them. They also chase anyone and everyone down on the beach area.They hang out in the lobby as well. In the end, my family had to be a bit rude and asked them to stop the blah blah blahs! We would have to shut our eyes on the beach and pretend to be asleep to avoid them many times. We were used to the banana boat ride, parasail ride, glass bottom ride, tube ride vendors. We also got used to the massage and hair braiding ladies. Also the selling of disco nights out of the resort. We tolerated a lot of harassment that was very stressful on a constant basis.  There was a great deal of construction going on when we were there and this totally inconvenienced everyone on the beach. Children couldn't build their sand castles without dump trucks, garbage trucks, pick up trucks, front end loaders, motorcycles, wheel barrels etc. going by on a constant basis. This was ridiculous. We told our Sunwing representative about this and he confirmed that there were many complaints about this, too. The beach is supposed to be protected by the hotel and is not a public beach where every vehicle can travel up and down on a constant basis with their black fumes erupting whenever they went by. The vehicles honked their horns for people to move out of THEIR WAY. People had to move their chairs or else get run over. Also, coming back to Punta Cana Airport at Security we had two telescopic umbrellas taken from us as they were considered a weapon by the Dominicans. Never heard that one before. They were nice new ones, too. Also, not metal but plastic with nothing pointy or heavy about them. We strolled by to take a peak on their whereabouts and they had disappeared within 5 minutes. We had a pen taken also. It was a good one. They let us keep a cheap hotel one. Many women lost their lipsticks as they were considered a threat also. But they would pick and choose if they liked or disliked the brand name, colour or the condition of your makeup to whether they would keep them or not. We had to pay $72 cash for they CLAIMED that our baggage was overweight. We were underweight when we left Toronto Airport and did not purchase anything. Also, we used up a lot of product within the 2 weeks that we were there, so we should not have been overweight. The people behind us had to pay $130 and they weighed their luggage at the gym before leaving to the airport and thought that they were okay as well. There were two girls behind us who had to pay $300 for being overweight as well. They were nicely dressed and their suitcases didn't look very big either. They had no cash on them. They offered to use their Visa card to pay the extra cost but the airport wouldn't take it. They had to go back through the airport to find a debit machine as Security wanted cash. There were many other people that we spoke to who also got dinged for supposed being overweight with their luggage. We feel that we were TAKEN as far as this goes. Some people were foolish enough to have purchased rum at the resort and had the bottles in their carry on luggage. Well, these definitely were taken away, but they let them keep their resort water bottles and walk through with them to board the plane.  The whole picking and choosing and making up the rules on what was allowed and what was not allowed by Security made us very angry and others felt the same way, too. My advise is to make sure that you have a lot of cash when you return through Customs. Also, U.S.. or Dominican dollars. They do not accept Canadian cash at the Airport. Other:Food is very good, resort is relatively clean, nightly entertainment is good, but the raunchy club dance gets old fast-why must the animation crew always dance like they're fornicating, even in front of the children. The canned songs they play have disgusting lyrics, not appropriate for a family vacation spot.The karaoke bar was supposed to open 6 days a week, but in 14 days it was only operational 3 times. We were told it was because no one came in, but that was completely untrue, many people came and went because it wasn't set up. No, I would not go back, the time share hawkers are too intrusive, a relaxing family-friendly vacation spot this is not.

<Content>Wonderful  We stayed at this resort from November 26th to December 3rd. This was our 2nd time to Punta Cana. The air port was very cute, and very fast processing us. We were taken by a van to the GOPC about a 25 minutes drive away. Check in was fast and efficient. Rooms:We were in Building 5 - corner unit on 2nd floor with ocean view. Our room was very clean and the mini fridge worked just fine. The maids were very helpful, and always left us a little flower and neat design with towels and bed comforter. Room was always clean. Food:Loved the food! Don't know what all the complaints were about from other reviewers, as I found the food to more than acceptable and plentful. Sometimes buffet hot items could have been a little hotter, but hey, they are cooking for hundreds of people.We ate at the American Grill 2 times, once by reservation and the 2nd by invite from Roberto (manager), service was great, and they have the best steak I've ever had outside of Canada! Enjoyed the Italian restaurant but they do kind of rush you in and out. - not sure why as there were always several empty tables. You could eat at the specialty restaurants as many times as you wanted, just make the reservation! We never ate at the sea food restaurant as it was outdoors by the beach and due to the regular breeze on the beach we thought that our dinner would cool off to fast. We spent several of our late afternoons at the adult pool with Anthony the bartender....too much fun. Be warned though, the construction of the Cameleon next door to the GOPC is still ongoing and there is lots of sawdust floating in the air and on the chairs. We met some wonderful people who were celebrating Aunt Diane's 75th Birthday - truely lovey people and great company!The shows were pretty much what you would expect from an all-inclusive HOWEVER the Michael Jackson show was AMAZING!!! This production is put on by an outside company and its like being at an actual MJ concert! This group of 16 dancers is really spectacular and well worth the viewing on a Saturday night! It was one of the best parts of this trip.Please email if you have any questions. As I said we relaxed on this trip so we did not take any excursions outside of the resort.Briggitte

<Content>Much neede rest and relaxation!! We have just returned from a week at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana. We arrived Nov. 30th to a beautiful sunny day. The air port was very cute, and very fast processing us. We were taken by a van to the GOPC about a 20 minutes drive. Check in was fast and efficient. Please remember that I am not an experienced traveler, one of the people we went with was and did not share the same perception of the resort as I did.Rooms Bldg 3 Room 3106:Found our room to be very clean, the decor was average, but we only slept there any way so that is not a big concern. It could us a bit of a touch up, and those we traveled with found it to be a little below what they are used to. The tv didn't work, we never called as we didn't watch it, we may have called if we had terrible weather, but that was not the case.The coffee in the room was amazing. We were on the ground floor, and didn't find the room musty at all. We also did not see any little critters. The maids were very helpful, and always left us a little flower and neat design with towels and bed comforter. Room was always clean. Food:Wow, loved the food! Don't know what all the complaints were about earlier, as I found the food to be fab. Ate at the American Grill, service was great, food also very good. The buffet was wonderful and so were the staff, always smiling, chatting and singing!!! Loved it, miss Angel already!! Bread and cheese were wonderful, pasta bar good, and all the fresh salads and fruits were enough to keep me going and more!! I personally did not enjoy the wine, and I guess that would be my most disappointing part of the holiday. You could order bottles from a special menu, but our group were not big drinkers and split between red and white, so we only ordered one our whole trip.Loved the Italian restaurant and we ate there three times through out our stay. You could eat at the specialty restaurants as many times as you wanted!!! We never ate at the sea food restaurant as that didn't appeal to those we traveled with. There was a beach grill, beach buffet at lunch...also enjolyed.The bar staff were great! We went to all the bars but the swim up one. We hung at the beach most of the time. Chairs were easy to access, shade was hard to come by. Beach was beautiful., Water was warm.Excursion:The country safari was our excursion. Loved this,,left at 8:00 am returned at 6:30 pm. Long day in the beautiful country side of the Dominican Republic, the mountains, rice fields, plantations along the way kept me in awe. We stopped at a school where we met the children and were able to leave a donation for the school that would go towards what was needed (breakfast, paper, pencils supplies etc) then to a farm house, met the family and saw their home. We then went to the plantation for lunch, and to enjoy a 20 minute horse back ride, learned how to make coco, coffee, and had lots of laughs!! Our tour rep Antoine was great!! We then saw the sugar cane, went to watch cigars being made and then stopped at a beach for some fresh coconut juice!! The county is truly spectacular!! And the Dominican people very kind and helpful!The disco was fun, the shows were great! The grounds were beautiful! The entertainment staff were fun, and very energetic. Time went by so fast.I had a chance to meet Mike F. from this forum which was an honour, thank you for going out of your way to meet with us!!!!!!I only missed the mojitos, and the sangarias, as they did not make them here!I would definitely return to this resort, and would hope to see the same staff there!!Ps no problems at all with the Spanish English thing!!!!! Everyone tried their best, and were much better than we were!!! and taught us a few things along the way. I hope to learn how to connect my camera to the computer soon and will see if I can post some pics then! I won't bore you with another review....unless I remember things I am forgetting today.If you do get a chance to go please remember to take some donations with you, they are truly appreciated, and there are some people from this post that can help get them where they need to go!!!Any questions please shoot!Oh they were still working on the Cameleon next door to the GOPC, we didn't use the adult pool, because you could hear a bit of the construction, and I just need time to rest the mind!! They seemed to be working on it quite late at night also. Don't know when they are going to be done but when i enquired I was told in 3 weeks, before Christmas!!! It is booked for Christmas!!!!!Hope I didn't ramble on too long!!Cheers Fadia

<Content>What a fantastic hotel My husband and I arrived at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana on Ocober 39th 2007 for 2 weeks. Having read reviews before we went we were not sure if we had done the right thing - but WOW. I really do not know what some people expect. We could not fault it.The setting is fab. Right on the beach with a lovely pool area. Plenty of sunbeds all over and very good water sports.The food - well I really cannot say much as it was all EXCELLENT. You can eat 24 hours a day, - a buffet breakfast in the main restaurant or on the sea front which we did every day as it was so wonderful, snacks on the beach during the day and buffet at lunch on the beach or in the restaurant. Some days there was a party by the pool with such as paella cooked in front of you. In the evening a different theme each night in the main buffet restaurant with so much choice of cooked meals or cooked in front of you, or there was A La Carte - we tried them all more than once and they were all fab. I cannot say we had a favourite as it was too hard to choose.All the staff are so friendly and work so hard. We had great fun trying out our Spanish and all the staff were always keen to help us.The drinks were always flowing and served with skill - even all the cocktails.If you just want lazy days on the beach or in the pool that is what you can have or you can take part in the entertainment - the Animation Team work extremely hard all day and night with many different ideas to keep we lazy tourists occupied, in fact they never stop with every language just rolling off the tongue.We did not try the Casino simply because after a few drinks and a lovely meal we had usually had enough but it did look great fun.We could have joined in more but were quite happy doing a little now and then.The Manager's cocktail party must be the best I have ever been to - a real friendly, homely atmosphere.The rooms are well air conditioned and very roomy with fresh coffee daily and a well stocked mini bar should you wish to sit in your room.The guest relations staff are also very helpful - nothing is too much trouble.The hotel is having an extension but I have to say we were not aware of any disturbance from the works. It will be nice to see it when it is finished.All in all we had a fantastic 2 weeks and are looking forward to returning. If you have a holiday booked at this hotel I cannot think that you would not have a good time.

<Content>Great Place We stayed at Oasis for a week and we were a party of 19 with 12 adults and 7 children ages 8-14. This was our 3rd time in 4 years and we still had a fantastic time. To begin with we were welcomed with drinks and cold cloths during check in which took no time at all. We stayed in building 2 and our back yard was on the lazy river, the kids enjoyed that so much especially in the late afternoon we would all sit out there and relax watching the kids play. The wait staff is as excellence as always. They are delightful and ready to accommodate you in any way. Always smiling with great sense of humors. The entertainment staff is just as wonderful they are great with the kids. Fernando, Spaghetti, Anthony, Koco Loco, Evelyn, just to name a few that were always fun and including us all in activities. Thank you to Caren for making our trip even more special. She is wonderful and really does a great job! The food was good always finding something to eat. Enjoyed the Italian and Tex Mex but the buffet was always a good choice especially for the kids. Our rooms were nice but they REALLY need updating, shower curtain had burn holes as did our sheets, toilet didn't flush right, our comforters were ripped, the pillows were really bad and the curtains in the room were dirty. But it didn't take away from our fun. All in all we had a great time and will be back next year!!

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic --- Always something to do A girlfriend and I recently took off for a week of sun and fun in the Dominican, leaving our husbands and her children at home for a girl's week away.There is absolutely nothing negative that I can say about the premises -- they were immaculate, we stayed in the newest, building number 7), the spa services were excellent (I had a massage, and my friend had braids put in her hair, they lasted 2 weeks.) I'd heard horror stories about other all inclusive places, and how the food is terrible .. not true in this case. I have a very sensitive stomach, and I was not sick at all. The food was fabulous, make sure that you try eating in the a la carte restaurants as well as at the buffets. The drinks were free flowing, make sure you go to the Umbrella Bar for Karaoke, and see Alcide, the bartender. All of the staff that we encountered were friendly, attentive, very accomodating, professional and eager to assist in any way possible. The animation team was fantastic, they worked tirelessly every day, leading water aerobics, putting on Latin dance lessons (meringue, pachata -- sp??), performing in nightly shows, then dancing with the guests of the resort late into night in the discos. I'm not much of a dancer, but they taught me how to dance, and we laughed so much every single day. To name names, Koco Loco, Desidero, Eduardo, Anthony, and Evelyn were lots of fun, and unbelievably talented. If you are thinking about a trip to the Dominican Republic, I would absolutely recommend this particular resort, and I would absolutely return without a second thought.

<Content>Not bad, not great Stayed for a week. Food was just ok. Set up reservations in the speciality resturants. Windows (buffet style) was average but the staff was VERY friendly and helpful. Our room was a suite, HUGE room, very nice. No water problems except first night when the hot water heater went out, fixed the next morning. Nightly entertainment was ok but VERY annoying when you are trying to sleep (starts at 920pm, ends at 1130pm). LOUD!! Maids are very helpful especially when you leave a tip and a note of what you want (bottled water, beer, etc).  We were actually near that LOUD, annoying family of 19 who wrote a review below. Hard to get away from them, one drawback. You never know who you will end up near.BRING AN UMBRELLA!! It rained pretty hard at times and it isn't always ok to get wet. Beached are VERY sea-weedy. Beach towel exchange is strange and not very easy. Vendors prices can be talked down if you have the time and patience. Enjoyed our visit. Staff was very friendly. ORLANDO made GREAT burgers!!!

<Content>Loved It! Our family of 19 visited this resort for the third time in 4 years. We were once again thrilled with our choice! Our party consisted of 7 children from 8 to 14 years old and 12 adults. I would like to begin with our rooms. All of us, except my in-laws, were located in building 2. The rooms were spacious and clean but could use a bit of renovations. The bathrooms especially. The shower ran extremely hot and had very little water pressure. The door frame needed repair and the tile looked old. The beds were quite comfy except for the worst lumpy pillows ever! The absolute best part was the pool in our backyard!! Our sliding door opened to a wonderful lazy river pool. The kids loved it! The food was so plentiful that an hour didn't go by without us eating something! We ate at all the restaurants and we had no problem finding something we liked at each one. The service staff was awesome! Every waiter, maid and bartender were always smiling. Communication never seemed to be a problem, actually we enjoyed trying to speak our minute amount of Spanish and get our point accross. I can't finish this review without mentioning the entertainment staff. Fernando, Coco Loco and the rest were the key to our fun. These men made us laugh and play every day. They got us to play: darts, bocci, water polo, volleyball and olympics constantly. Every night one of us stood on the stage to receive a diploma! All the shows were great! The Michael Jackson, Circus and the Staff shows were my personal favorite.None of this fun would have been possible without the extraordinary efforts from Caren. She could not have been more wonderful! She greeted us upon our arrival complete with a huge banner hanging in the lobby welcoming our family! Whatever we needed she was there to help! Not only was she there for us but we spoke to other families whom she gave her immediate attention to and serviced all of their needs. She is a warm and fun person to deal with and it was such a pleasure to see her once again. Our family can't wait to come back for many more visits to our favorite spot in The Dominican Republic!

<Content>Watch out for the beach vendors Well lets see..... It was my 2nd anniversary and after 2 calls to the resort to confirm a suite for my wife and I they over booked the resort.....This is only the begining toa bad start...Then after we got settled in our room not the suite we comfirmed on twice we got swarmed with pushy vendors that dont take no for an answer.After that the staff were helpful in getting us our suite only after 3 days of complaining at the front desk...and 2 days after my anniversary...After those 2 issues we had a wonderful time... The grounds were exceptionally clean and the bar staff were awesome...The buffet as good with a differnt theme every night and the ala carte well the are slow...the shows were good and the drinks even better..lol...The accomidations were average but the suites in building 7 are georgous...We hope to go back in April but not sure about this resort because of the pestering vendors.....Best Regards Chris

<Content>Had a fantastic time - not 5* but more than acceptable! my friend and I are from the UK and just returned from a week at the grand oasis yesterday - had an absolutely great time. The hotel is huge and theres lots to do if you want to join in the fun run by the amination guys (resort entertainments team).Room - we were in building 6, very nice, spacious. Cable tv was a bit fuzzy and water was luke warm the whole time, figured out you have to let it run for 15 min first before you get it so its warm! sheets did smell a little manky on one day,Food - the main buffet restaurant is great, the food is VERY nice, freshly cooked, tasty and there is so much choice that im sure everyone can find something they like. Its also different everyday so you dont get boared. There is also a beach garden restaurant open all day for you to pop in off the beach and get some food - again, great food! there are 3 posher restaurnats, tex-mex, italian and seafood - we ate in all 3 and the food was fantastic - highly recommended. the beach garden kitchen is open 24 hours so they can knock you up a burger, pizza chips etc throughout the night. everything is safe to eat. we ate everything, salads, rare meat, seafood, fruit and drank the filtered water available everywhere and we both had no problems at all - its all fresh.Night life - the main pool bar is open till midnight, the beach bar is open 24 hours! theres also a piano/kareoke bar and a disco. the disco is ok, its best to go with a huge bunch of people and get drunk and just have a laugh, the dj played house/hip-hop when we asked him too so that was cool. This resort is very quiet though and mostly old people, couples and families. so its not the best place if you are young and want to party - we were the only people at the bars past 12pm! if its a quiet time, chilling with some nice cocktails then this is the palce for you.beach - beautiful, it does get a lot of seaweed washing up on it though (they do clean it daily). if you walk up the beach to the end, that part is much nicer and the water is amazing.entertainment: theres stuff going on at the resort all day that you can join in with, salsa lessons, pool games, aerobics, bingo, beach games. on the beach you can do non motorized watersports for FREE and also do parasailing, speedboat riding, snorkelling, horse riding, quad biking  more! - just haggle with the sales guys for a good price! theres a movie everynight at 7.30 and a show put on by the ents team everyday at 9.30 - we saw the spoof comedy show and a dance show which were so much fun!top tips: bring stuff to do if it rains, boardgames cards, a laptop for dvds etc - it did rain a bit on every day we were there and there isnt a lot to do when it rainsbring only US dollars, everything inc. trips is charged in dollars, you wont even need pesos or any other currency at allyou need to pay $10 when you enter at the airport and another $20 when you leave. Learn a few key prases in spanish, the staff dont speak much english - but we didnt speak spanish and got by just fine!DO go here if:* you want to chill out* you want a quiet relaxing time enjoying food and drink* you want to chill on a beautiful beach or relax by a great pool all day* you want a holiday tropical/spanish experience - salsa music is the backdrop here* you want to meet differnet poeple - mostly from Europe thoughDont go here if:* you have kids - there wasnt many other kids around so they may get bored* you are in your 20's or a group of singles - its full of old people and couples who go to bed early!* you want active night life - there isnt any in this resort, you just eat and sip cocktails until the early hours* your looking to meet people of the opposite sex! its not that kind of place* you only want to meet english poeople  listen to english music and expect that everyone should speak english. * you want to get out and about - theres not much life outside the holiday village. Overall - highly recommeneded resort if you want some RR, a great beach and are looking to relax and enjoy some time eating and drinking and being merry. Dont expect 5* service or standards its not - more like 3.5- 4* (uk official standards) but its very clean and is very nice!

<Content>Had a great time! I just returned from a great week in DR. The beach was gorgeous and the staff was great. The food was ok. I was always able to find something I liked. Breakfast seemed to be the only meal that was short staffed. We often got our own silverware and coffee. We ate at Demario's (Italian) twice. The steak there was very good. The Tex-Mex was okay. I liked my meal, but another in my group ordered chicken kabobs that weren't cooked all the way. We stayed in building 5. The rooms were a bit dated and in need of some minor repairs, but the maids worked very hard to keep them clean and our fridge stocked. The night life was a bit too organized for my liking: show at 9:30, karaoke 10:30, discotheque 12:00. Most of the music was in Spanish. If you want to leave the resort for a day I recommend the Safari. We had a great time learning about the culture and the boogie boarding was a blast! For the money this resort is worth it. If you don't expect 5 star dining and you want to relax on the beach then you'll be just fine.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay-Need new chefs! Dining Services were 'slow' Sad thing is. This resort was recently purchased by Oasis a very popular hotel owned organization. I can only hope they hire good chefs and get new waiters in the Windows dining area. Worst service I ever had. I tipped one continually and he did work hard his name was David. The breakfast food was good. Rest of the waiters were rude. It just wasn't because they could speak our language. Mexican and Italian nights in Windows Dining area was great. You need to not wait till we go get our meals to offer a beverage. Please make sure your milk and OJ juices are really cold. They were always just chilled. GEtting refills were horrible. We gave that one up. Also, they were chort staffed in the Dr. and they had about two coffee pots in the whole dining area. Cock roach on ice cream bar....It was alive. Never ate the fruits or salads, or ice cream once after I saw one of those critters.Tex Mex was okay. But, don't say you have a steak house if there is no steaks. Seafood restaurant? Not the best. Also, they charged you $35 per pound of lobster should you desire to taste real seafood. Not good. Just not good management there.*On Thursday: Travel agents came and we saw shrimp, various food for the first time that was tasteful. Don't wait till travel agents come into your facilities to wine and dine those who worked hard all year and paid for this vacation like everyone else! Kudo's to Amy from St. Louis who woke me up on what was taking place!*We sat over at the pool bar. What I noticed was that we kept missing a bar tender. He would run into this room and close the door about half. I then discovered. He was running to the bar on the other side and waiting on others there. He had to work his tail off. This was not right. I felt sorry for him. He never would smile. I knew why. At first I labeled him as Mr. Personality until I realized his situation. It reminds me of local nursing homes who are always short staffed and nobody smiles because they are overworked and underpaid. Next, don't even get me started on the hounding sales people on the premises who try to sell you things. It made that part of the trip...Very sucky! They would sell more things if they left everyone alone. Your hotel MUST do something about this! Not only do you have a cock roach on your salad/ice cream bar....You have ants running after you when you do your best to get by those sales people. I have traveled many carribbean places. Salespeople will leave you alone the first time when you tell them no in an abrupt way. You might as well say...We were abused to no end with those vendors on the Oasis Property. They all need fired. They will only hurt your business. *I would come back if these things changed. Finally what really made the vacation nice. Meeting great people. (Vacationers) Our room was to die for. It was a master suite. It was clean. All of our housekeepers took great care of us. So, did the bell boys. The front desk people were fantastic. So was Luis. Refrigator had all that we wanted. I just didn't like the beer. The beach was gorgeous and clean. You must put a bar on the beach. Most newly renovated places have them. It was old running back and forth. The water was awesome. We always had loungers. The dive shack staff was awesome....Even though the girl and the dive guy told me not to touch those green berries...Luckily one didn't break open! LOL I was very curious. On our last day there...It was the beginning of a tropical depression. We laughed and laid under a thatched hut on loungers and slept and didn't get blowed away. It is all of what you make of it. *The beach being more of a European style didn't bother me. It was just the food. I didn't mean to be critical. I am in management and it does involve everything from customer service, business, housekeeping, food, programming and activities. I would like to come to Punta Cana again and experience better food, dining services and less Vendor Terrorists as I called it. I went to the Michael Jackson Show. It was good. It was outdated for most of us in the US because Michael does not perform here any more. He was awesome in his day. The dancers were great. *Nicolas was great at the Adult pool. It seemed like he was there 12 hours a day. He told us he would be off on Thursday. Another guy worked and sat and flirted with a vacationer and he even closed down at 4:50 pm for the day. Nicolas worked until atleast 7:00 pm daily. For the price, the beautiful weather and room....You couldn't beat it!

<Content>Can't really complain I read so many reviews of this place before I went so thought I would add some comments for anyone else travelling to this resort....We stayed in Block 7, we upgraded direct through the hotel as it was much cheaper than doing it through Thompson. Although we emailed  confirmed our upgrade with the hotel the week before we travelled, our upgraded room had not been reserved for us when we arrived. Not a problem though as once we explained the problem we were given a room in Block 7. The room was very nice, well worth upgrading as I did get a look at the other rooms  am glad we had upgraded. We had a jacuzzi bath in the room as well as a big four poster bed  a lovely large walk in shower. We also had an ocean view if you leaned over the balcony a bit!! As said in previous reviews, the bathroom wasn't exactly ideal. The toilet had a frosted glass door  ours didn't shut properly so wasn't great when you got a bad tummy...which we both did get....The food was okay. The buffet did get a bit boring after two weeks but luckily as we went off peak there was no restrictions on how often we could eat in the a la carte restaurants. DO NOT eat in the American Grill!! The service was awful  the food wasn't good, we were both ill the day after we ate in there. The Da Marios restaurant was very nice, good selection on the menu  Marinero was also very nice  had a nice ocean/beach view from the restaurant.I thought the grounds of the hotel were beautiful  the area of the beach by Block 7 was nice  peaceful. You did need to get up faurly early to reserve sun loungers with some shade but also not a problem for us.The vendors on the beach  in the centre of the hotel were a real pain in the bum They wouldn't leave us alone  in the end we just had to take a route where we would avoid them!!Like I said, we were both ill for the duration of the holiday which did spoil it a bit as we had to watch what we were eating  drinking but I think that if you go to an all inclusive then you have to expect to get sick at some point.Although we won't be going back to the Dominican for a while as we went last year as well, I would go back to this hotel  I would recommend it as long as you don't expect The Ritz!Enjoy!!!

<Content>OK - but needs polishing Just returned from a week at the Grand Oasis. Stayed in one of the upgraded 'Master Jr. Suites' - really just a large room - in building 7. I believe this is the newest building. Good:Very nice room, good housekeeping service. If they were short on anything when making up the room, they would return with it later. Strange thing about the room is a little lack of privacy in the bathroom. The head was in a small cubicle with a frosted glass door like a shower. The shower is large, polished stone, and has a glass door. Both open on to the main room, so if one person uses the sink, you're a glass door away from the toilet. Not a major problem for us, but some might not care for it. Check-in and check-out was smooth and quick. The property is big enough, but not too big. Beach itself is clean with soft, white sand and calm clear waters. The weather was very warm, with afternoon rain most days, but plenty of sun earlier. Never swam in the main pool, although it looked nice and was large. The pool next to our building was very nice. Staff was helpful, and language wasn't a problem. (I know a smattering of Spanish, but you could get by without.)OK:Grounds are nice, but could use some cleaning and sprucing up. I thought it strange that the maids picked flowers from the grounds to put in the rooms. They would have looked better on the grounds! Food in buffet and theme restaurants was OK. We always found something to eat, but nothing that made us say, wow. The shops on the resort have mostly tourist merchandise - souvenirs, cigars, etc. - plus some snack food and HB products at the usual inflated prices.Poor:Service in the restaurants was inconsistent. One time you'd get immediate service, and the next you'd be asking for someone to bring water and take a drink order. There are shops on the beach adjacent to the resort. Supposedly this is because the beach is public. However, I didn't see any shops by the two resorts just north of ours. The vendors are constantly hawking their wares, even at the shops on the property. (Beach vendors aren't allowed on the property, but there are the time-share guys, cigar shop guys and a few others on the grounds.) It wears a little thin after the first day or so. We couldn't use our own phone cards. We bought a 20 min. card from the Apple rep. for $15 that worked. I think this is by design. Other calling methods are very expensive. I never got my ATT international cell phone to work. It detected two networks, but wouldn't connect.

<Content>Good Deal for The Price My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Oasis the first week in October. It was our first trip the the DR. I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews of this resort. We are not picky travelers in anyway and went with an open mind.The resort itself is rather small in comparison to others in Punta Cana but this was rather appreciated by us. The grounds were lovely and well maintained. I personally would not consider this a five star resort in anyway but for the price we paid, it was very comfortable. The room itself was large and spacious with a king size bed and a nice balcony. We were in building four in a corner room overlooking the main square. We had a chance to upgrade but knew we wouldn't be spending that much time in our room. The room was in need of updating, fresh paint, etc but was more than comfortable for sleeping, showering, etc. We had no issues with hot water and most of the time, it was too hot. While it is all inclusive, tipping goes a long way! I purchased a few small gifts to leave the maids as well as tips for wait staff, bartenders, etc. The maids were very appreciative and by the second day were leaving us cases of bottled water outside our room. One of our waiters in the buffet actually presented us with a bag of Dominican coffee to take home. We were very touched by his thoughtfulness.The food was surprisingly good to us. Neither of us felt sick at anytime during our stay. The desserts were unbelievable and the ala carte restaurants were excellent in our opinion. We never had a problem finding things we could eat. The drinks were not so good. The alcohol was all domestic and most of the mixed drinks were far too sweet to enjoy. The beer, Presidente, however was surprisingly good. Nightlife is rather non-existent.The beach was lovely and the water, though not perfectly clear was warm and inviting. We took our own snorkel equipment and were amazed to see several sea snakes in the seaweed beds just off shore.Now to the cons of this resort. There is definitely a language barrier if you are English speaking, both with staff and guests as most of the guests are from Spain, Italy, Germany, etc. A little Spanish knowledge goes a long way in communicating but we still felt somewhat isolated on the resort. We did meet a very lovely couple from Ireland and spent several days with them but overall, it was difficult to converse with others. For this reason, I much preferred my stays in Jamaica and Mexico.My only real beef with the resort was the number of vendors, time share people, and people selling excursions on the beach. The beach is the one place you want to relax and not be bothered and this was just not the case. We were lucky to have booked this trip during hurricane season as the resort was pretty empty. Though it rained a few days, the weather was generally lovely and we had no problem securing beach chairs. I could see this being a problem during peak season as the best chairs are reserved by rude guests the evening before. A side note, if you travel left of the beach passed the Allegro and Natura Park resorts, you will be treated by a long stretch of undeveloped beach where the water was clearer, very few guests except for those walking along the beach, and very pretty scenery could be found. If you snorkel here, just be careful as boats run along the shoreline pretty close.All in all, we had a lovely vacation though I personally would not book this resort again. We passed by other resorts further up the coast and was surprised at the shopping areas and restaurants outside of the resorts. You won't find that here as, other than excursions, there is nothing outside of the resort. For the price, it was a nice resort though I could not imagine staying for more than a week.A few more tips we found helpful on our trip. Bring plenty of one dollar bills for tipping. We didn't bring nearly enough and found that you could not change money anywhere on the resort. Get out on an island excursion if possible. Seeing the local Dominican people and how they live was a very eye opening experience that I wish our kids could have seen. I highly doubt they'd complain about being bored or not having the things they want after seeing the island. The people off the resort were very friendly and it was a pleasure to meet the locals. Also, as others have noted, if you try your luck in the casino, stay far, far away from the multi-ball roulette. They attempt to lure you into playing by offering a few free chips to use. We saw the scam almost immediately but several unlucky guests along the way lost thousands.

<Content>Wonderful week at Grand Oasis We had a very enjoyable week at the Grand Oasis from Oct 6-13. We flew with Sunwing and both flights were smooth and on time.The resort is very easy to get around and the grounds were beautiful and well maintained.Our room was in building 7,third floor above the lazy river with ocean view. The room was beautiful with king bed, jacuzzi, fridge,clock radio, coffee maker,ceiling fan,iron,ironing board and a safe that was included at no additional charge. It had the most closet and cupboard space I have ever seen in a hotel room. The fridge was stocked daily with water,beer and soft drinks.The beach at G.O. was nice. Not the nicest I have seen but he ocean water was very calm and warm. The beach activities included volleyball,soccer, basketball, ping pong, darts shuffleboard, badminton, trampoline and kids club. They also had organized beach games and tournaments. The pool area had scheduled dance lessons and acqagym. They also have a daily agenda posted there of the daily events.There are three a-la-carts.The American Grill which is tex-mex, Dimario's/Italian, and the beach garden restaurant which changes to a-la-cart for the evening -Marinaro's/seafood. The only one we tried was the American Grill which we very much enjoyed and Jean our waiter provided excellent service.Windows buffet was quite large and air conditioned. It was split up into a smoking and non-smoking section. We thought the food presentation and quality was very good and perhaps the best we have encountered to date with this being our 4th four star all-inclusive. And for us ketchup lovers, they did have packets of HEINZ ketchup.For those wanting a general idea of the layout, building 2 and 7 run along the lazy river which was a very nice and quite area for relaxing. Building 3 is closest to the pool area which can be quite loud at times. Buildings 4,5,and 6 are closer to the beach.The animation team was very visable throughout the day and did a good job keeping people entertained with beach games and vollyball tournaments. The evening entertainment started at 9:30 pm and was held in a covered theatre. The best shows being on Friday/majic show and Saturday/Michael Jackson show.The only negatives I have at this resort is that the beach vendors can get quite annoying by weeks end. I would also recommend to bring your own pillow because I found theirs smelled sour due to the humidity. I also found the fridge did not keep your drinks near cold enough.On a positve note I'm a picky eater and I always found something good to eat. I'm a light sleeper and I was never disturbed by any noise at night. So thanks to Grand Oasis for making our vacation a very enjoyable experience. Also, hello to Roger and Brenda the only english speaking couple we met while there. We enjoyed your company the last couple of days. I would not hesitate to recommend the Grand Oasis.

<Content>Worst Ever!!!!!!! We recently returned from our first family vacation at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana! Our trip started off on the wrong foot the minute we left the airport! Upon arriving at the punta cana airport, we went directly to the Sunwing Rep who had a booth set up, We asked her to get a taxi to take us to our resort, We went with the Taxi driver who was appointed to us, 5 mins outside the airport her pulled off the side of the road claiming car problems, we called another driver from his phone to pick us up which he did, when we arrived at the hotel, we noticed that the first taxi driver stole our laptop case which had a laptop, psp, money, medication and a few other valuable items, We reported it immediately to the front desk at the resort and asked for them to call the rep to see who the taxi driver was, the staff was very unhelpful, we were told we could call the airport, but it cost a $1 a min, we informed him all our money was stolen and he did nothing to help. We tried to get ahold of the Sunwing rep at the hotel and was unsuccessful, the front desk never told the rep of our problems and nobody contacted us. The food was terrible, the service was terrible, I booked this trip because of all the kids activities they claim to have yet when we get there, the kids had nothing to do!!!! We spent the whole week at the pool with the kids, not much of a vacation for anyone.. The rooms were not very nice, and to upgrade the room for the week was and extra $400...We were charged for all collect calls we made, I was charged for a fax that i needed to allow me to recieve money from home on our second last day so we could leave the airport, and i was charged 10% of the money i recieved as well, I was unable to use the debit machines, and the front desk told me our bank cards dont work on the island, yet the people on our flight were able to use their debit cards at there resort, SOOOO we had a family of 4, no money, no help, bad service, horrible food. Never ever again would i travel here and i would never send anyone here either, Our first family vacation has no good memories!

<Content>The Honest Truth Philly Style My wife and I stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights at the end of September. We do travel alot but are not snobs. There is the backround and this is what you need to know about the resort. I hope it helps. 1. The beach and water are absolutely amazing. You will not be disappointed in this or the weather.2. The pools are clean, warm, and the pool bar area is awesome.3. Building 7 is new and the room itself is very nice. However our air conditioning did not work so there was a moldy smell in our room the whole time. 4.The food was not very good. If you go in with low expectations you will be ok. The breakfast buffet was good, the lunch on the beach was average and the dinners were awful. A previous poster said that the buffet pasta was better than the Italian restaurant and he was absolutely correct. The Tex-Mex place was practically inedible as the beef there is definately different than what most Americans will be used to so beware. We stayed at Excellence in Cancun last year and the food was 5 star. FYI there is an Excellence in Punta Cana.5. There is no top shelf liquor and your fridge in your room will be not so cold and stocked with only 2 beers and some cokes.6. The previous poster are correct in that the multi ball roulette game is a complete scam. Stay Away. Thank God I pulled the plug after losing only $200.00. Bottom line to this place is if your looking to relax all day at beautiful beach and/or pool on nice grounds this can be the place for you. However do not expect good food and just hope your air conditoning works. We had a great time here but would definately go to Excellence Punta Cana the next time.

<Content>Had a blast!! We just got back to the good ol' US of A from the closest thing to paradise we've ever experienced. We've never travelled out of the country other than to go to Canada and not fully knowing what to expect, we were very pleasantly surprised especially after reading other reviews. We spent the litle bit of extra money to upgrade our room to building 7, a master junior suite; it was worth the money; building 7 is the newest of the buildings. The room was stunning; always kept clean and the view from our balcony was beautiful (we overlooked the pool and could see the beach/ocean). The mini bar could have been colder; we did complain but didn't seem to get a resolution. The room was cooler than outside but not as cold as we would have liked; it was tolerable but we showered 2-3 times a day. Never had problems with hot water like others have said in reviews we've read. We were a bit disappointed because there were no ice machines within any of the buildings around us. It was only a short walk to the bar and they were willing to give you bags of ice but without a cooler it was difficult to keep the ice from quickly melting. Next time we'll take a fold up cooler. And there will be a next time!!Regarding the food, overall it was pretty good. The buffets offered a number of selections and the italian and tex mex restaurants were good as well. It's difficult to accomodate so many cultures and we thought they did a great job. Remember you're in another country; don't over indulge and your tummy should be fine. The grounds and pools were beautiful; well maintained and clean. Juan is the best bartender ever (he's at the swim up bar where we spent most afternoons). At first he was polite but not friendly; after a day or two and a few bucks, he'd see you coming and have your drink ready!! We enjoyed talking with him; teaching him more English as he taught us more Spanish. No communication barrier there!! Dos cervezas, por favor!!Tipping wasn't really necessary but we did find that leaving a few dollars for the housekeepers and for the bartenders went a long way!! It's a good idea to take some $1 bills for them; they are very grateful and appreciative. The beach was also well maintained. There were days when the seaweed was worse than other days but we thought they did a great job of keeping it clean (after all it is the ocean). The water was clear and refreshing. Plenty of fish swimming around you; take some bread and you'll wonder where they all came from!!It didn't take us long to find others who spoke English. We enjoyed talking with couples from Canada and Germany as well as the group of ladies from Pennsylvania.Be prepared for hot and humid weather no matter the time of day. Drink plenty of bottled water (in between the rum and beer of course) and absolutely use sunscreen. And last but not least STAY AWAY from the multi ball roulette game. It is a complete scam; fortunately we didn't take the hook but too many others that we talked with lost thousands of dollars. The dealer was very slick and spoke fluent English. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and plan to go back (hopefully sooner than later!)

<Content>Great time! BEWARE of the Roulette Game!!!! We had a great time!!!! If you go to the Casino STAY AWAY from the Mini Ball Roulette!! It is a total SCAM, we spoke to and heard of more than 8 couples that weren't warned and lost BIG. Obviously you sit at the table with the expectation of only playing the complimentary chips, however the smooth slick talking dealer is good at what he does and before you know it your only 1 point away from winning the jackpot but that 1 point doesn't ever seem to turn up. If you think you're not big gamblers and you won't be stuck in that position just be careful. We are not big gamblers at all yet we fell into the trap. If you do decide to give it a try make sure you count the numbers on EVERY single roll, the dealer counts very fast and we think he doesn't add them correctly.The resort has lots of things to do and there's always a bar open and ready to serve you. The food was great, we ate mostly at the buffet, however we did eat at the tex mex and italian style resatuarants which were both great! The beach is beautiful and be sure to take advantage of the snokling, you can see some great fish without swimming far at all! The rooms were ok... I would recommend upgranding your room... our room could have used a few upgrades but all and all the room was ok.

<Content>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly Be prepared for the 10 dollar per person (cash only) tourist card you have to buy as soon as you get off of the airplane. Once you buy the card, you take 20 steps and hand it in at the next desk....Check in was smooth an easy. The room (building 7, Ocean View RM#7220) was very clean. The view was a panoramic view of the ocean which was stunning. The pool beside building 7 was clean and clear (as were all of the pools) and it seemed to be a few degrees cooler than the others.The beach is raked in the morning to remove the see grass. There are no waves. The ocean water is extrememly clear and warm. Also, even though I dont believe the beach is designed for topless, I believe I probably saw around 800 pairs of breasts on the beach while I was there. It seems no one cares to have their boobs out.The food was decent at all of the resturants. There is also a grill on the beach that serves deep fried chicken, grilled hamburgers and french fries. Very tastey. You won't go hungry here but you will probably miss American food.Cons/Warnings:Do not drink the water. The water is filled with bacteria. The maids provide you with 3 very large bottles of water to drink. If you run out, just call room service for more.Stay away from the Casino. They will give you free chips and drag you over to the multi-ball roullette table. We met 5 couples and they all got it down to 1 or 2 and the game ended. I don't know how they do it but the game is rigged so you can only lose. After coming home and researching it, it seems like many others say the same thing about this casino.There are vendors in this resort. Everytime you walk within 20 feet of them they will be yelling at you in 5 different languages hoping you will purchase some of their junk necklaces. They almost always show you the domincan republican stone necklace, bracelt, or earings and then ask you for $40.00 USD. These vendors get very annoying. You will have to learn to avoid eye contact and almost get mean with them because they will try to put a ton of pressure on you to buy from them once they have you standing by their stand or looking at their junk.The only beer they have is called 'Presidente' also known to the staff as 'Domincan Water'. Its OK, but you will be happy to come home and drink your own American beer again. We did shots of a drink called Mama Juanna and it made both of us very sick. After research, this drink is supposed to be some kind of an liquid viagra. I recommened staying away from it, all it tastes like is warm cough syrup.The Micheal Jackson show is ok. Some of the dancers can really move and the do a decent job of portraying and dancing like Micheal Jackson.Also, no one there, not even the guests, really speak a bit of English. We didnt meet anyone at all that spoke english until the 3rd day.The air conditioning (Building 7) was not very good. It was usually only about 10 degrees cooler in the room than compared to outside, and it's hot outside. We were without hot water at all during one of the days we were there.Room service is ok and it is included. They make their pizza with no sauce so be prepared for that. Also, the hamburger through room service is almost not even cooked. The room service people cannot speak english very well at all. Even if you ask for a well-done hamburger it will still come raw.OVERALL:We had a good time. The beach was nice, the couples that we met were great. The resturants were good and the staff seemed friendly. And karoke was a blast.I would recommend this resort to younger couples and for no more than a week.

<Content>Amazing Resort, Don't Play Multi Ball Roulette! Don't play Multi Ball Roulette!! When you go to the Casino they will give you chips to play Multi Ball Roulette and then they suck you into betting big. We met 6 couples who played the game and every one of them lost money, 2 couples lost $2500, 1 couple lost $4000 and a couple from England lost the most, $6000. The dealer is very slick and we assume is working on commission. We were watching one couple through the window at the casino and tried to warn them not to play and after they lost $4000 and walked out of the casino visibly upset we saw the dealer laughing with the pit boss. This game is a Scam! I work at a Casino and none of the pit bosses have heard of this game. Stay Away From Multi Ball Roulette!!The resort was amazing! There were bars all over the resort, one near the beach that was open 24hrs. The swim up bar Bartender, Juan, was amazing and had a great time with the customers. There is nightly entertainment, movies and live shows every night, Karaoke on Sunday, Tuesday and Friday and the Disco is pumping every night as well. The Italian restaurant was OK even through a lot of reviews said it was the best, every couple we talked to including ourselves would say the pasta bar at Windows Buffet was better then this place so don鈥檛 waste your time. The American grill was AMAZING and we ate there twice during our stay. The service was top notch and the food was by far the best on the resort. The food at the windows buffet was great, you had to pick through to find the stuff you liked but over all it was good. The theme changes every night so you always have a good selection. The beach is beautiful and over all the resort is well kept and a great place to spend 7 days. We paid $1500 for the two of us and we could not have asked for a better vacation.

<Content>americans may want to skip this hotel My husband and I and our 2 close friends just returned from our trip here. Let me start with the good news...the beach is beautiful. The weather was fantastic. The water was clear and the fish were everywhere....really beautiful. OK, here's the rest....the food is really bad. I am not sure if it is bc as Americans we expected better quality, but it is just not at this resort. Honestly, breakfast was average but lunch and dinner were horrible. The choices were limited as far as restuarants, but even the Italian place which was their nicest, had terrible food. Just not what you would get at any decent place in the states.Also, as americans we were in the minority. This was not initially a problem for us, but as the days progressed we realized that americans were not being treated the way other guests were. This was by the Dominican people and by the other guests. This was sad for us, as we have travelled all over the world and have never been treated like this anywhere. The staff was not friendly. Don't expect anyone to say good morning, etc to you. It was a very different trip than Mexico, which was our last vacation. There, the people could not have been kinder and really were hospitable.Anyway, would not go back. Air conditioning did not work in our room all of the time and the rooms in Bldg. 7, which were supposed to be the newest ones, smelled. It was a moldy, mildewy type of odor.I would not recommend this place to anyone, but as someone from the U.S., I would tell others from here, beware.

<Content>Beatiful Setting to Relax As with all trips and hotels this one had its very high points and it lows. Overall the value of the trip was well worth it! We stayed for 10 nights. The hotel room was very nice, much nicer than we expected since we had a standard and did not upgrade. The room was very large with vaulted ceilings, jacuzzi tub, seperate shower, marble throughout the room. The beach was very beautiful and peaceful. There was absolutely no problem finding lounge chairs at the beach. The huts were differnt story, people let their stuff on it overnight. It was actually really entertaining watching people fuss about the huts. They are nice to get especially if you are sick of the sun. The pools were all very nice. The main pool was hard to get a lounge chair until after lunch. The service started off poor but once they recognized you after a couple of days they were very helpful and extremely hard working. The food was good for the first two days, after that it got old since it is the same thing day in and day out for the most part. The buffet was more than adequate and we found something, none of the restaurants are gourmet by any means but adequate. There was always salad and fruit that was always fresh. I would recommend bringing a small container of seasoning if you like taste to you food. Everything was very bland in order to serve the masses better. Roomservice was good the first night especially after all the drink during the day that tasted refreshing in the heat. The room service menu is very slim and consisted of stuff from the buffet we ordered it late a couple of times and never got the same thing twice even though we ordered the same thing. The bar was ok if you are a beer drinker not so hot if you were not, The wine was terrible! Overall for the amount that we paid it was actually much more than we expected. this place is perfect if you want to just go to a beatiful resort and relax and soak up the sun, especially if you don't speak spanish since everything that goes on is in spanish. We would definitely go again but this time remeber to bring seasoning, snacks for the room and a couple of nice bottles of wine.

<Content>amazing resort! We just returned from our stay at the Grand Oasis. In our group there was my parents, a 21 year old, a 19 year old, three 18 year olds and one 10 year old. Overall I would say our trip was amazing. Everyone there was so nice. The rooms were big (we stayed in buildings 2 and 7). Building 7 was incredible, my parents stayed in the junior suite there which was amazing. The Italian restaurant was the best place to eat; after we ate there the first night, we went at 8 the next morning to get a reservation for the following day. I wouldn't recommend the Tex Mex Grill restaurant at all. The buffet, Windows, was very good and always had a wide selection. You can never run out of food at this resort. For lunch we went to the beach garden cafe which was good. The server AMADOR was our favorite, he was always eager to help us out. We didn't see many people tipping anyone that worked there but we tipped them all a couple dollars everytime they served us and they were entirely grateful. We also tipped our maid 2 or 3 dollars a day. The beach was amazing, especially at night although it was pretty much empty since everyone goes to sleep or to the bars. Most of the people there are not American and speak very little English, but we didn't really mind. The shops on the beach are a good place to get souvenirs, much cheaper than the shops at the resort. I LOVED this resort and if I ever return to Punta Cana I would definitely want to stay here again.

<Content>Not As Good As you Expect Grand Oasis Punta CanaJust returned after 2 weeks 11th Aug - 25th Aug 2007. We did review the site and it was rated by customers anywhere from 0 to 5 my husband and I would rate this resort 3. It has been bought over by Globalia and is having some teething pains. The food although plentiful was very repetative the buffet was boring. The rooms although clean were in need of updating and although you do not spend all your time in the room it would still be nice to have it painted. There are 3 pools the main pool needed to be cleaned. In the 2 weeks we were there we in it once and for the whole time it was cloudy not sparkling like it should have been. The adult pool was better but still not as clean as it could have been. The 1st week we were there our fellow guests except for the 6 others who arrived with us did not speak English most of the guests were from Spain, Italy and France. The second week some English people arrived so we did not feel so isolated. So be prepared to brush up on your Spanish or you will have a hard time making new friends. The staff all tried to speak English and did very well although we found that they could have been a bit more friendly.We are not Dominican virgins and have visited 4 times twice to Punta Cana and twice to Puerta Plata but this vacation was the worst one we have had in the Dominican.To end we would not recommed this resort and if you are going just 1 week would be enough.

<Content>Great holiday place We have just returned from our vacation, and we had a fantastic time. The food was great, the service was good, and the pool and beach were great along with the rooms being comfortable and clean. The one place where I would advise people to stay clear of is the Tex Mex American Grill, although the food was good the service was awful and in fact put a dampener on the evening. Apart from that I have no complaints what so ever with the fantastic hotel or restaurants. One piece of advice I鈥檇 give you, is to stay well clear of the tap water (even when boiled), I made a coffee in my room with the tap water and paid the penalty, I consequently became extremely good friends with the large white telephone, and by that I mean the toilet. Apart from the time I was ill we both had a fantastic time at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana, and would defiantly recommend the hotel to friends and family. This was our first time to the Dominican Republic and it is a very interesting island, you must go and see its fantastic county and its local way of living. I just love the RUM yum yum!!!

<Content>Definitely a great place! M We stayed in this hotel for two last weeks of July and it certainly was a great place. It was not our first time in the Dominican Republic, so we knew kind of what to expect. The hotel itself was great! Rooms were clean and maid worked really hard to keep it this way. Our first maid Ciara excelled in making fancy shapes out of our towels and flowers. We were even laughing that if we stayed there longer she would have probably succeeded in making and Empire State Building out of our towels. We had some problems there however, but we have to say that they were dealt with so fast and so professionally in a matter of minutes. Our tour operator Melany from TMR ( Tours Mont Royal ) was amazing . Great hats off to Rooms Division Manager, Caren De Vries. We have never seen such professionalism, care about the guests and pleasant attitude. She certainly is to be commend and will be remembered. We are seriously considering going back there, knowing that Caren would be there. As for the food in the resort... absolutely fantastic, including the Thursday dinners on the beach. There was nothing in the buffet that we could complain about. As for the a la carte restaurants, there were three. The Italian was great, the service was fast and friendly and the food was great. The seafood restaurant was equally good. The only probleme we had was at the Texmex called American grill... Apart from the lack of AC that day, although the food was really good, but the service was extremely long and the waiter did not speak the word of English... I guess it would have been helpful to learn at least a menu. If you speak even a little Spanish it is certainly helpful there, but the main thing is to keep positive attitude and thing work out great. If you have someone like Caren there, you should be in good hands. If you go there you may give her the best regards with hugs from Jack and Mark. Overall, the resort is very good, way above average of what you may find. The beach is great, lots of activities ( maybe adding more water sports would be good like water bikes) , bars and other things. No matter whether you are a couple , single, family with or without kids you will certainly enjoy the place. You will however find around you many guests who seem to have come there only to complain without a reason and forget that they came to the Dominican Republic and not Ritz Carlton in NY. People, come on ! Have time off , relax and enjoy the weather and fantastic surroundings ( including the live pink flamingos) . This place is definitely where you can find it all.

<Content>It was o.k. Punta Cana: Grand OasisDate: July 21, 2007Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Mississauga, ON  We just got back from the Grand Oasis Punta hotel. The resort was very nice, beautiful gardens and lobby. They checked us in, bellboy took our luggage to the room. The room was fairly nice, simple, but overall clean. The cleaning staff was very nice and efficient, at least our lady was. There was a small T.V with about 60 channels, with some english channels. They provided us with one beach towel card per person. There were three a la carte restaurants (Italian, Tex Mex and Seafood) and one buffet restaurant. The food was great at all the restaurants, the service, a little better some more than others. They had one main pool which was a bit crowded at times, and I believe two other smaller pools throughout the resort. There were always employees around cleaning up and making sure that everything was tidy. There were a couple of shops. The people working in the shops were not that friendly, infact they seem like they don't want to talk to you and if you question something they'd start to argue with you, but the stands out in the open have really nice people willing to bargain with you so try to bargain if you can. Make sure to take plenty of nausea and upset stomach medication as we met many people who got sick, including myself and my mother. Buy travel insurance, if they need to take you to the local hospital you will be looking at $400 to $700 US in fees, plus the taxi fair of about $20 US. The beach was nice, but not very clean, lots of seaweed. They have a beach party on Thursdays where they serve all kinds of foods and desserts, and have a show. It gets packed so arrive early, I believe it begins at 6:30pm. There are also many snack bars, those were o.k, some of the food just sits there for a while so it gets dry looses its flavour, and some of they people working there can be so rude, almost as if they don't want to serve you. I read a review from another traveller and he/she mentioned that the majority of tourists at this and possibly other local resorts are spanish. This is true. There were many spanish speaking tourists, and yes they can be rude, but I am spanish speaking and I did meet some people that were friendly. There were many tourists from other countries and backgrounds as well and they had the same attitude as well. But you gotta just see past that and just ignore them. I probably won't return to this resort as there are many others that I still need to visit and many other countrys that I would like to visit. But overall, it was o.k. Don't recommend it though.

<Content>hated this resort We are a family of 5. My husband and I with 3 children (one of them being disabled). We stayed at this resort from June 23-30, 2007. Our room was ok, but there were times where we did not have any hot water. Each time we had contacted the service desk to advise them, they would respond with an attitude. Most of the staff working in this resort looked as if they were not happy and therefore this reflected tremendously on the service. The food was terrible. We were all sick and I ended up in the hosiptal (only to beg the doctor to discharge me early due to my three children). The hotel claimed that no one else has been sick and therefore it was our imagination. Our rep suggested that we only eat bread for the week (nice suggestion). The hotel was well aware of my hospital stay as an ambulance had to pick me up from the hotel because the doctor's office was not equipped to handle my bacterial infection. No one from the hotel contacted us to see how we were doing, in actual fact they treated us as if we were garbage. Now the kids club. What kids club. My children who are very active and love to swim, play sports and interact with other children did not want to go to the kids club. Why, because they did nothing there with them. Also the kids show at night. Again what kids show. Every night they sang the same songs in a circle and that was that. It broke my heart to see my children not having fun as they should have. Every two years we go away with the children. Having to travel as a family of five is not cheap. Especially when it takes us two years of putting away money little by little in order to enjoy a week vacation. I was very disappointed in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone unless you are young going with a bunch of girls or guys. They seem to like those types of travelers. I have lived in the DR and have travelled to the DR over 15 times but never have I been treated so poorly as I did here. I ignored some of the posting on the site warning us but figured these people must have been too picky. I now realize that there are some hotels in the DR that are just not worth it.

<Content>Great Vacation Spot After reading reviews before our trip I was a bit anxious, but after arriving to this beautiful resort I was very pleased. We stayed from June 27 to July 6, 07. Overall our group, including 3 pre-teens, had a great time. The resort is beautiful, with lots of palm trees and flowers. What we all agreed made our trip was our room location. I had done some research before (much thanks to Candlemaker's suggestion) and had requested two rooms in building 2 facing the lazy river. Thanks to Caren Devries for meeting my request. We would go out to the beach every morning until mid afternoon (you do need to get up early to reserve shaded beach chairs) and then return later in the afternoon to enjoy relaxation in the pool. It was right out our doorwall!! The kids loved ordering room service each afternoon and the food was fresh and tasty. You can always find something good to eat at the Windows Buffet. If you don't like the first thing you try just go back up. The omelet station for breakfast is very good and so were the ready to order smoothies. We really enjoyed the Italian restaurant, DiMarios. Try the beef medalions. The food was excellent and the kids had fun ordering virgin Margaritas. The Beach Garden for dinner was also very good and the wait staff was very friendly. It is so beautiful eating outside under the thatch roof seeing the moon and the ocean. The American Grill however was very disappointing. The service was terrible, we waited forever for a drink, and the food was not good either. The Thursday night beach party was nice and they work real hard to set everything up. Bringing singles for tips worked out good (you don't have to tip, but they appreciate it, especially at the bars). We did three excursions. Deep sea fishing, (caught nothing and got seasick), parasailing and the glass bottom snorkeling. All of these are available for purchase right on the beach. The snorkeling was very nice, there is a reef with lots of fish and sea creatures. Floating in the ocean with our home-brought drink mugs was the best. Lots of fish to see and they do clean the beach. What's a little seaweed. All in all we had a great time. Go with a good attitude and you'll bring back great memories.

<Content>Worst vacation ever We just returned from a week's stay 7/11-7/18 at The Globalia. We are a family of four and my dad accompanied us. The resort was well maintained and the staff was mostly considerate. Our room's were in building 2. We had a problem with ants and the air condition didn't work for the first three days we were there. They finally resolved the problem for what it was worth. The air never really gets that cool. The beach is cluttered and we were disappointed in the water clarity. Also the swim area is small due to all of the boats surrounding the property. It's like swimming in a marina. The food was awful. This is my first day back to normalcy. We have been ill for 9 days. I got sick the fourth day we were there and remained sick until today. Four out of the five of us had severe diarrhea. We have had 5 trips to the doctor's since our return home and we were all treated with antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection. We spoke to many other travelers who were also sick and disappointed. We met another family on Sunday that had just arrived on Friday for a week's stay and they left Monday morning because they got sick the night before. It's not what we were accustomed to. I would definitely go to Mexico before I go here. For us, it was the first and last trip. We would never go back.

<Content>First three days were great but then....... We traveled with a group of 8 (6 adults-2 teens). The resort is beautiful and well manicured with more palm trees than I've ever seen and I have traveled quite a bit to the Carribbean. There was a beautiful breeze nearly every minute of the day and night if you were at the right spot on the beach. The beach water was clean but not the gorgeous Carribbean color I expected. I didn't realize this resort is on the Atlantic Ocean side and, as a result, there was quite a bit of seaweed floating around with you. It was promptly cleaned by the maintenance men each day from the shoreline. The food by American standards was good and tasty overall, although we always found the meats to be very tough. Burgers are certainly not what Americans are used to (very mushy consistency). The food from Room Service on the other hand is horrendous (except the pizza). The staff was extremely polite and very accommodating with few exceptions. (i.e. the maid who stole my husband's gold and diamond ring from the night table while he was sitting right on the balcony-she also let herself into the room while he was napping on another occassion-hours after she cleaned the room to leave a survey on the bed) The security staff concluded their investigation within 2 hours (and without contacting her since she had already left the site) and said their investigation was negative, whatever that is supposed to mean. They suggested we contact the local police (yeah right). We stayed in the Suites in Building 7 which we paid a $300 USD upgrade for. The room was very nice and had a beautiful view but was invested with ants. We requested an exterminator from the same thieving maid who assured us that one would come but no one never did. We lived with an inordinate amount of ants for the week. The biggest problem of all was the severe vomitting and diarrhea that every person in our party and on our bus to the airport seemed to have contracted (at least 30 people). We all spent the last 2 1/2 days of our trip in our rooms taking turns on the toilet. Today is the 3rd day since we arrived back in the US and we are all still sick! 5 1/2 days later. Our local ER Doctor at the hospital suggested that it is a parasite in our digestive systems. It had to come from the ice or the bottled water. It was the only thing we all had in common. We could have made a fortune selling Imodium but even that isnt working. As we were leaving the lobby for the airport we met numerous other people both Americans and Europeans all complaining of the same thing. If diarrahea and vomitting for half of your trip doesn't bother you, then this is the place to go. The only other complaint is there is no live music at night for dancing. We left on Thurs during the day so werent there for the Beach party which I understand is alot of fun and has live music. That would have been a definite plus. It's a shame that we all got sick, if that were not the case, we would go back there, it was a great value for the money. However, we definitely will not go there again now. One more thing, if topless on the beach bothers you or your children, don't go there, there's plenty of it.

<Content>Very good resort I stayed there with my family from July 2nd to July 16th and it was actually a great vacation.We got rooms in building 5 which is not the newest one. The rooms were very large and comfortable. The bathrooms seem to be a little bit old and need some refurbishment but nothing dramatic. We asked to be on the second floor with sea view and they made arrangements for us.The beach is excellent but there are not plenty of places with shade. So it is tru that you may need to wake up at 6am to reserve a good seat. We stayed a few years ago at the Catalonia Bavaro and it was the same. What is really different here is that you can really swim in the sea. Almost nobody does it but the sea is deep enough. On the contrary the pool was a bit disappointing because the maximum depth was 1.25m... and a lot of people were just sitting in the beach and drinking cocktails.Her we come to the bars. The bartenders seem to be used to serving only beers. But there are very good cocktails : coco loco, caipirina.... There is no need to tip to get enough alcohol. Just ask them!The buffet was really amazing. It was different every evening with a lot of special themes. There was plenty of choice and the food was excellent.The animation staff works hard but they are only 6 and seem to organize the same activities everyday : stretching, shuffleboard and volleyball. The good thing is that you can win some bottles of rhum.At the water sports house you can borrow canoes, catamarans, windsurfs for free. They also give lessons for free whereas you have to pay in the other resorts. Scuba diving is also great with an ewcellent divemaster (Frankie).To sum up : do not hesitate to reserve, this resort is great even if it is not very expensive.

<Content>A Hidden Gem We stayed at the Grand Oasis from June 30 - July 7 2007. We too were a little worried after reading some of the reviews, please do not worry if you have booked this resort...it really is beautiful. This is the first time we have travelled to Punta Cana and it certainly will not be the last. The Beach was amazing lined with palm trees and the gentle breeze at night was breath taking...We stayed in building 7 - the newest building (they are currently constructing new buildings - 100 new rooms will be added to the resort along with a new marina) the weather was flawless between 90 and 100 everyday!!...bring the sunscreen if you tend to burn. The bartenders are ready to attend to your every need and bottled water is plentyfull...the buffet will please even the most pickest of eaters....burgers pizza and fries everyday at the beach grill...shopping is not great - prices are high on the resort..and all seem to be selling the same things..we met some fantastic people from the UK, USA and Canada..the adult pool is really great if you just want to chill and be without the activities of the main pool...The beach party on Thursday evening is amazing..the dinner, show and dancing are done on the beach..the wait staff work so hard..and are eager to please..it rained one night quite hard -...and there was a definate odour after the rain fall..but you must remember they do not have the same water systems we have - you are in a third world Country and need to take a few things with a grain of salt...we also lost power one afternoon for about 3 hours the buffet restaurant had candles everywhere what an adventure...the off resort excursions are also plentyfull...my Husband went deep sea fishing with some folks we met..$80.00USD for a 4 hour trip..they had fun...had a couple of bites...but did not catch anything...I would advise brining USD - small bills for tipping..also better to barter with...bring a book for the airport as they bring you there 2-3 hours before your flight leaves....but the airport is nice with shops and coffee stands..I hope you have as great a time as we did..Nigel and Christine

<Content>Great Vacation This is our 4th trip to Dominican we have stayed at hotels from one end of the island to the other end and in the middle . As far as this hotel goes the rooms and food were good compared to the other hotels and the grounds were beautiful and everything was a short walk which I like. We had an amazing room with a King size bed and ocean view which I have always asked or but never got. This ocean view was spectauclar day and night that alone was worth the trip. The only complaint I have was that I was not aware of the marina next door and I dont like the thought of boats being so close to were I am swiming and also breathing the fumes in. The seaweed didnt bother me and the water was very clear but I think the bavaro beaches are much better this one is situated in cabeza de toro. This hotel sets up a wonderful beach party barbecue every thursday night. The staff works very hard setting it up and all the restaurents gettogether and prepare the food and they even have the entertainment on the beach the only problem was that the clean was up was underneath our room so it was very noise all night while we were trying to sleep The shows we found were more proffesionaly done than the other ones we have seen . Tthe Michael Jackson show which we have seen in other hotels does not compare to this one this one was very good as well s Shakira. Overall it was fine and I dont understand why people complain about he food there was plenty to choose from every day and we have never gotten sick only my husband once but thats because he had too many Pina Coladas which can be like a laxative.P.S. We tried getting the Pallapas on the beach every morning by getting up at 6:00 to no avail we did manage to get one at 5:00 one day but it was the last one all the towels were on the chairs already so I came to the conclusion that people are puttting them on the chairs at night before going to bed.

<Content>Nice My boyfriend and I took our first vacation together to Punta Cana. They resort was very pretty and very clean. We enjoyed the many pools and the beach, daily. Some Concerns:1.NO HOT WATER, and no water pressure (2 days)鈥hen we inquired, we were hung up on by the front desk staff.2. No international Drinks, only Dominican Drinks3. You felt that you had to tip everyone for good service, even though it is all inclusive.4. Fridge was not refilled if we forgot to leave money.5. Food left little to be desired.6. One towel place far from resort.7. All extra activities cost $$$ ie. Tennis, snorkeling etc. when it is stated all inclusive. You have to pay for tennis balls and leave a non-refundable fee for taking snorkel equ. and kayaks out, etc.I know I have a few concerns, but the people were very friendly and I couldn't get over how clean it was.

<Content>Fun Fun Fun heterosexual couple wanting warm tropical holiday. Booked via an Apple vacations rep. Stayed June 23-June30th, 2007. Had a blast, met great people and saw why this place was a 5 Apple hotel. 1. Bring $100+ in $1 and $5s for tipping. 2. Bring extra sunscreen. You will need more than you think. 3. Book tours with hotel. They will ensure you are with people who speak the same language as you. We did deep sea fishing off the beach people and there was no communication because 4 pple were english, 3 french and 2 spanish. wasn't good for a rough seas day. 4. Be warned the Beach and Adult pool allow for topless bathers and swimmers. remember this is primarily an European hotspot. 5. Try to speak Spanish to the workers. Most try to speak English, It is all you can do for visiting their country. 6. Food was good. Remember school food? Well it's better, but not much. Good variety. Hint for breakfast: Bread pudding is like french toast with the syrup already on it!!!7. restaurants: had better food quality than buffet, but not as much variety. 8. You will miss Iced Tea/Sweet tea if you enjoy these drinks. 9. You will miss a good burger, if you enjoy them--all we wanted was a whopper when we got home, and we don't really eat BK!!10. Don't make eye contact with the vendors if you don't want to be hassled. just keep walking or say no not today. Don't let them say they need to add $5 for commission, $2 is fine and fair. Those that don't push you to purchase something are those that will give you a good deal. they will say it is ok that you don't have your money, they will remember you and allow you to pay later. Don't accept this, it sounds too sketchy!!!11. Entertainment: cheesy but fun all in one. If you sit in the front be prepared to be put into the show one way or another, especially the lip sync show and the magic show, these are both shows that bring in outside companies for performances. 12. The Coca Cola is not the same as here, because it's not made with corn syrup, it's made with sugar, so it seems flat. But not bad. 13. Our mini fridge was refilled everyday, no questions. 14. Construction happening off the adult pool so it's somewhat loud but still relaxing (over by building 5). Nicolas is the bartender at the adult pool and will really pay attention to you and bring your drinks to you at the pool. he works hard for his money for his family!!!15. Excursions: we did deep sea and snorkeling. Deep sea was a rough seas day so it didn't go well for us due to sea sickness, the boat crew was awesome in helping us. Don't expect to go back though, everyone on the boat has to agree to go back, as it isn't fair for them to go back early because you are sick. Snorkeling was fun with the sharks and sting rays. you can see their pens off the beach shore from Globalia. Friends we made said they enjoyed the outback excursions very much. Others said Saona island was great too. 16. Saona Island: if you are contemplating on this one, here is something to know. It is a 1 1/2 hr bus ride, 1 hr catamoran, 2 1/2 hrs on beach, speed boat back than 1 1/2 hr bus ride back to hotel. Bus ride can be more than 1 1/2 hours and catamoran and speed boat can be reversed. While on the island you will enjoy good food, beautiful beach, huge living starfish, etc. 17. Staff: all are excellent and work hard for you. Don't let a language barrier decieve that. You work with them they will work with you. 18. If doing an Apple vacation Luis is the man. he will remember you and what destinations you did. He goes for lunch for 2 hours somewhere between 11am-2pm. he works all but one day. He is there for you no matter what!!!Loved the Grand Oasis Punta Cana

<Content>What a great hotel!!! Just came back from Punta Cana. Stayed in Oasis Grand...and I had the best vacation ever. I dont understand how people can write bad reviews. It was simply a fantastic hotel. First the staff in general very friendly, from housekeeping to waiters. The room was very comfortable and clean, like I've rarely seen before in other hotels.Food wize...i gain 5 lbs....it was very yummy, great selection, great taste, great presentation. Try the a la carte restaurant . Great pizza in Da Mario ( italien) and Fajitas in the American grill.Animation was great...dont miss the Michael Jackson show!Over all, I would recommand this hotel to families, couples, single...anyone!!!! Sure there is 5star hotels...but quality / price can beat this one. HAVE FUN......

<Content>don't do it. We have just returned from Globalia, family of 4 stayed for 10 nights in building 7. before we left I contacted Carin the room manager and request room with ocean front on second floor. Our request was honored, the only problem all junior suiteshave only king size beds and they try to fit two more extra beds in room which wasn't design for it. extra beds was old shaky and dirty. Beach was OK. I saw much better. If you want find spot under the hut be prepare to reserve it at 5:30 in the morning. 6 am will be late.On the right side of the beach you will find small marina with several fishing boats, you will breath all smoke in the morning when engines starts, one more thing, when boat's are coming back after fishing trips with some fish they start cleaning fish on the ramp and guess where they put all guts and staff -- right - in the sea.Also about sea weed, lot of it. and because of it water looks dark not relaxing at all. Food was OK , not a lot of choices. you can survive.

<Content>Just Got Back Just got back from 1 week vacation Jun.4 - 11, 2007 at this resort which is now called Globalia Punta Cana Grand. Traveled with a family group of 8 people which included 3 kids. Apple vacations rated this resort as 5 apples but I think 4 apples would be more fair. I am basically comparing this place with other apple resorts that we have stayed in in Mexico within the last year. I believe that reviews from people who stayed in a newer building such as #7 would be a much better rating than those who stayed in the older side including buildings #4 and 5. We were in rooms 4110/ 4112/ 4109 which are great locations near the pool, close to the beach and very close to all of the restaurants. The rooms were a bit run down but decent. If you go expecting a 5 apple place you will be disappointed. If you expect average you will be fine. Food was fair in general with the Thursday night Beach Party being the highlight. There is no beach or pool bar service. Room cleaning and food service staff barely speak English so be prepared to show them what you are talking about. I personally prefer the resorts in Cancun and Riviera Maya, Mexico because you get more for the money all around. But - to each his own.

<Content>WORST HOLIDAY EVER My sis and I arrived 1st May for 3 week stay. On entering our room in building 3 we were overcome by the smell, never did work out what caused it. We had no water through the bath tap and the drain was blocked with goodness knows what. We were standing in dirty water when showering. The a/c unit was encrusted with filth. We booked with Thomas Cook, and as their brochure stated that standard rooms only had one bed, we paid for a junior suite. We discovered that all their guests were in the same room as ours and nobody had paid the upgrade. BEWARE this is a con.My sis contracted bronchial pneumonia within 4 days of us arriving and although we have no proof, we feel the conditions in the room were a significant factor.Building work started on the floor above us and the noise was unbearable, no way my sis could rest. She ended up in hospital.There were RATS running on a daily basis between an open drain and the beach garden restaraunt, we saw them so often we named them!We informed our rep, Yo Han of all our concerns, but he was as much use as a chocolate fireguard! We did eventually manage to get moved to building 6, and guess what? That was the room we had paid the upgrade for! Unfortunately the walls are so thin in there that you could hear conversations through them. The behaviour of some guests was disgusting, resulting in security being called twice in 4 days.At the begining of our third week we had had enough,and told our rep he either get us out of there or get us on the next flight home. After offering us a refund of our upgrade fee, but insisting we stay at the hotel, we flipped out! Eventually we were moved to the Melia Caribe Tropical and what a vast difference. This is a 4*plus hotel, but compared to the supposedly 4* Punta Cana Grand it was no where near. There were at least 2 * difference.PLEASE don't think I am being a whinging brit here, I travel abroad 4 times a year and have NEVER felt the need to warn others about any hotel before. If you do decide to stay here, then you will need to bring your own sunshade, almost got to fights on the beach every morning as there just aren't enough umbrellas for the size of the hotel.

<Content>Good time, cannot beat it for the $$ My wife and I, age 28 from Detroit, stayed at Globalia from May 13 through the 20th and enjoyed ourselves immensley. We went to Jamaica for our honeymoon 10 months prior, and paid over twice as much, for maybe a 15% better time.Getting to the DR was fine (except for the 6am departure) - straight shot Detroit to PC. The airport in Punta Cana is rather unique, pretty much a bunch of large huts with grass roofs. Customs was a snap, plenty of folks to show you to the right bus and you are on the way - 20 minute drive to the resort.We arrived to the resort at 10:30ish, so of course our room wasn't ready for a few hours. No issues there, just got into our suits and hit the pool.We stayed in building 2 - our room was right next to the meandering pool - ground floor. The rooms are not the best we've ever seen (remember what you're paying), and they obviously were not new. But who cares about the room anyway? If you want a nice room go to your nearest Ritz for vacation - you're supposed to be outside. Beds were fine, not great but you're so tired at night it doesn't matter. Fridge stocked daily with water, coke and beer (Brahma!). Shower was fine, we only got 3 towels a day which was good enough. Did not see one bug in our room the entire time, and no flooding issues. Biggest downfall is that the walls are very thin - you can hear people out in the hallway in the morning even if they aren't being loud.Food - we went to every restaurant at least once:Italian - was our favorite. Get the Beef Medallion or Chicken alfredo. Caesar salad was also quite nice.American Grill - Solid - had the steak, no issues.Mexican - Got the ribs, they didn't look great, but were very tasty. Wife got the fajitas, another recomendation.Windows (buffet) - If you like Mexican food, go there Mexican night! Awesome food! They have a different theme every night. We ate there the first night and it took a few tries to find something we really liked, but that's the reason it's a buffet, right?Breakfast - Best meal of the day. Omelet bar, fresh fruit juice bar, GREAT bacon, breads....Lunch - we just snacked on the outdoor grill every day. Burgers were bad, hot dogs were worse, chicken was absolutely AWESOME.Pools - we did not go to the adults pool, since there seemed to be more action at the family pool. They have activities throughout the day (we did aerobics every morning), but most people seem content to hang out on the sides or by the pool bar. Very clean.Entertainment - we thought it was solid - the shows are only about an hour long, so it leaves time to do other things at night. The Michael Jackson show was the best, and the dancing/lyp-synch shows are also quite entertaining. And if you don't like them, it's easy to come and go as you wish.Bars - They have a piano bar which is pretty much your typical dark hotel lounge bar, which we kind of liked to be at after a long hot day - they have karaoke 3 nights a week and a piano player the other nights. Nice little spot that you can pull right up to the bar at and get some mammuana from Juan. They also have a disco, which we only went to once and it was not very full, but it's a place to drink and dance to the latest dance/hip hop hits. We went to the casino once, pretty small with maybe 5 tables and 50 slots.Gym - about what you'd expect. Nothing great but good enough for a week. 6 cardio machines and a couple universal weight machines, a free weight set as well.Beach - Thought it was great. Nice sand, water is calm, everything you'd want. They have a marina to the right of the resort, and there are boats in the waters which you can go kayak around. You will not be able to find a spot under the shaded areas on the beach or the pool, but that's what sunblock is for, and there are plenty of areas to go to get out the sun if you need to. I never felt the need to be in the shade.Service - Never had an issue. Sure, some people come across as more friendly than others, but isn't that the case everywhere? Never had to wait a long time for a drink, to be waited on, etc.Excursions - We went on the Outback Safari and the Kon-Tiki snorkeling party boat and reccomend both. The outback safari will give you a good idea of what the Dominican countryside is like, and the party boat, well if you don't know what that is then get a life. But the crew on the boat really make it a fun time.For anyone on their way to this resort, a few tips:1. Bring $50 in one dollar bills and use them all on tips for one week. We tipped $2 at every sit-down meal, $1-2 a day to the housekeeper, and $1 to the bartender if he gave us say 3-4 drinks at one sitdown. This isn't one of those resorts that don't accept tips, and I go as far as to say they half-expect it. Don't be a cheap (--). On the other hand, I never felt like I received poor service if I didn't tip.2. Don't put suntan lotion in your carry-on bag. We made this mistake and ended up having to pay $28 for a bottle at the resort gift shops after it got taken at the airport.3. Bring a beach towel for each person. They give you a towel token to use but it seemed sometimes they ran out.4. Bring your own cup for drinks. At the pools they only have cheap little 6 ounce plastic cups, but bartenders will fill up anything you give them.5. Take it easy on the drinks - have your 1 or 2 pina coladas a day, but other than that stick to the old standby well drinks and beer.6. RELAX!! We had a great time, things will go wrong at times while you're at the resort, but why let it affect your vacation? I seriously think the only way someone would not enjoy this resort is if they went in expecting the world, or they just have an axe to grind. Remember what you're paying for. A week in Jamiaca at a 5-star resort cost us $4,500. This cost us $2,100 for the same length of stay.Enjoy, feel free to contact me for questions.

<Content>Highly Recommend We stayed at this resort in March when it was called Globalia Punta Cana Grand. Our favorite part of the vacation is the Staff at the resort. They work hard each day with a smile. Beach is nice, didn't mind the little bit of seaweed which they clean up. Go to the left of the resort to see beautiful crystal blue water. Food was good. Especially loved the fish. The entertainment at night is a must see.

<Content>Sun, Sea, Sand and.......Sangria!!! Me and my friend stayed at the hotel from may 7th through to may 22nd and had a really good time. the flight was really long so by the time we arrived at the hotel we were a bit pooped but were warmly welcomed with a cocktail and quickly checked in. We were assigned to block three, the rooms were pretty basic but clean, tidy and had everything you needed. The shower was hot and the mini fridge was stocked, It was also great value for money. It was possible to upgrade our room to block 7 for $350 over the two weeks but we were happy with what we had even though we saw the rooms in block 7 and they were amazing.The actual hotel was stunning, from the lobby to the beach and was all very well maintained. The staff worked very hard to keep it all clean and tidy.The hotel had three restaurants plus a buffet. Our favourite was the Italian Dal Mario's. The food was out of this world and the service was impeccible, Mr Frank the manager couldn't do enough for us and was soooo friendly and helpfull. The American grill was also good with really friendly staff and nice food. Cant really understand the reviews where people say they couldnt find anything edible cos they had everything! Obviously your not gonna like all the food but i think some people are just too fussy.The beach was just beautifull, crystal clear water and white sands, who cares about a bit of seaweed?? They cleaned the beach every morning anyway. The pools were also really nice, especially the lazy river pool which was really chilled out and quiet.Night life was pretty good too. There was a nightly show which was always a laugh and you saw some really good dancing, especially in the Michael Jackson show, even if they were cr*p at miming!! The umbrella bar was cool and had a really nice barman who's name i forgot, they had Karaoke most nights which was good but most of the songs were in spanish so we didnt have a clue what they were singin about!! The disco was ok, played a range of music but got a bit boring after a while. They do a disco tour every night though if you fancy a change but we gave that a miss.They've got some wicked excursions too and i thought they were pretty cheap. We went snorkling, on safari and quad biking and had a great time on all of them. We also went kayaking and had a scuba lesson which were both free.The only thing i would complain about would be some of the staff especially the entertainment staff. Dont get me wrong, most of them were really friendly especially the ones at the front desk, beach towel hut and some of the barmen. HOWEVER as we didnt speak spanish some staff took full advantage of that and there were times when they seemed to be having a private joke on our behalf. ha ha, we have now taken up spanish lessons!! Us being two young women we found the blokes to be a little overly friendly (If you know what i mean.....) which became a bit annoying after a while.We tipped quite a lot, especially the maids and the room service. I wouldnt say it got us better service though as they tried their best anyway, i think if you smile and are friendly and use good manners then you are treated with the same attitude. Some of the spanish and American people were so rude to the staff though and treated them with no respect at all. The bar staff seemed to put up with it in case they got a tip which i thought was quite sad. There were very few English people around when we were at the hotel, mostly spanish and American but we still made a few good friends and had a good time.All in all we had a wicked time and would definatley go back again if given the chance but only if we spoke better spanish!

<Content>worst hotel in twelve years to dom rep. just returned from this hotel and can honestly say this is the worst hotel i have stayed in twelve years of travelling to the dom. rep.if you want to spend your vacation on a construction site, well thats up to you.the so called quiet adults pool was yards away from a pnumatic concrete breaker working from 8am till 6pm every day and in and throughout the property, workmen banging and drilling ,with plaster and cement dust on floors in the corridors all day.each morning you were woken up at 6am to loud music from bars, but this was very handy, as this was the time to go to the beach to reserve your shade,(cause any later you had no chance).the so called entertainment at the theatre was a joke unless you were aged from 5 years to 7ish,and the highlight of the week, the micheal jackson show was pathetic compared to other hotel chains.to be fair to the staff ie. the maids, barmen,waiters gardeners etc.they did a very good job and deserve all tips they get.usually i dont like my vacation to come to an end, but after spending two weeks at this hotel, i was actually glad to be leaving, and will never return.

<Content>brilliant brilliant brilliant myself,husband,brother and sister in law have just returned from a fantastic 2wks at the punta cana grand we were celebrating our wedding anniversarys and to everyone who have wrote bad reviews on this resort i have great pleasure in saying how very wrong you were.Having read bad reviews prior to our departure we strongly considered cancelling. how glad we were we didnt.Everyone working at the resort from caren the rooms manager to the gardeners were extremely friendly. we ate at windows all the time simply because the food and servicewere excellant,the waiters were very friendly and couldnt do enough for us[and not for tips as we didnt tip anyone until we left as we believe in tipping to say thank you not just because its expected] we got to know everyone by their first names and when we spoke to them in our brocken spanish their faces lit uo and readily spoke back. we stayed in building 5,caren gave us ajoining rooms which were very spacious and comfortable. the maid service were very good, fresh decorated towels everyday and the rooms kept very clean. the fridge was re stocked every day with sodas beer and water, again not for tips as we left her a tip when we left. On several occasions we saw caren walking around the resort and she always made the time to come and chat and ask if everythink was ok. the entertainment staff were first class very friendly[look out for olivia and chockolate] two very friendly,funny people] if you want to have fun and join in the activities. the evening shows especially the Michael Jackson show were second to none ,very very proffesional. we walked on the beach several times every day and yes at 6am they were some seaweed after all it is the ocean!! but by 7am it had been cleared away.we always managed to get sunloungers both at the beach and by the pool and the beach towels were always available. we would like to say a great big thank you to caren and her staff for helping make this holiday one of our best and if you are considering going to this resort, i strongly reccomend you give it a try, go and have a good time, you will have the best time ever,we did and were sorry to leave.

<Content>Globalia, Beautiful place with bad food and drink My husband and I went to the (Globalia) Grand Oasis Resort from 5/16/07-5/20/07. Upon arrival to the airport, you are expected to pay $10.00 (US Dollars) per person for a photo that is supposed to be some kind of country entrance ID. They tell you you can have it when you leave the country. What they don't tell you is that you have to pay another $8.00(US Dollars) for it! The Globalia itself was a very beautiful resort. We stayed in new building 7. It was very comfortable and clean. The beach and pools were great! If you want an umbrella at the pools or the beach, get one in the early morning . The resort employees are all very nice and work very hard to make you happy. We tipped even though it wasn't expected. This is a very poor country. They all speak English fairly well, so no worries if you do not speak Spanish. There seemed to be a black out with no power or hot water every afternoon for about an hour. It really wasn't a big deal. It became funny after a while. When the power finally comes back on, cheers are heard from all over the resort. I will say the the food and drink is terrible. Edible, but terrible. We just kept in mind that we were in a different country! Breakfast is okay. We never got sick or had any problems. We used bottled water for everything. We went on a day trip to Santo Domingo through Amstar/Apple Vacations. It was great. Angel, our tour guide was wonderful. It is about a 3 1/2 hour drive each way. If you have any kind of driving fears, it may not be for you. The trip was one wild ride! Probably the scariest drives I have ever been on! There are no real rules to the roads or driving. They all drive like maniacs! Dominicans are true professionals in defensive driving. It's a constant game of chicken with other cars and drivers turning small 2 lane roads into 3. It's very scary! On our trip, there were a lot of screams from fearful passengers on our tour bus! Nobody wears seat belts, and you will see a lot of motorcycles. It 's their form of a taxi. No helmets. No protection. I even saw a newborn baby on the back of one in the arms of their mother. It was a scary sight. For them, its a way of life. If you are grossed out in any way with meat, be prepared. The city streets have freshly killed meats hanging with the heads still attached. I guess they are killed in the morning. It's a frightful sight. We were told they hang there all day until 7:00pm. Yes... they hang there all day. Out in the open heat and air. Kind of gross. Its a real shock. I did not eat any meat while in the Dominican.

<Content>Neutral Opinion We went to this resort April 20-27. We read all the reviews from various sites and found the resort to be a mix of the good and the not so good, all of which depends on your priorities. Reading the negative reviews made me want to post my own because we found the resort to be quite nice, although a few flaws noted.Beach had a lot of seaweed, although this apparently is not always the case. There were plenty of chairs but not many huts so we did set our alarm to reserve one. Unfortunately you had to.Pools at various locations so all buildings are relatively close to one. Topless bathers only permitted at the adult pool tucked behind building 5 which some families preferred. Any Pools I saw did not have a deep end which may be nice for kids. Worked well for activities and walking to the swim-up bar. I havent mastered the art of swimming with beverages in hand.I would advise the hotel to purchase more towels or puchase more washing machines - the pool and room towel rotation is very slow, we had to ask for extra towels and a face cloth and did wait almost daily for blue towels.Activities were well posted and organized, Playstation units were available in the core area with pool tables, current movies played each night in the theatre. Shows were good, many of us agreed the Michael Jackson show is the best resort show we ever saw. The Magician was really good as well. Dancers were fabulous, guests need to remember its not Las Vegas, there is a lot of effort put into these shows. We played volleyball, pool and darts. There is always something to do and it was never too busy.I received a rude attitude from one person at the front desk, but equally met two dozen members of staff who were exceptional. I meet rude employees at home sometimes too. That's life.We stayed in building 5, we did notice the room a little musty at first but just left the balcony open for a few hours and the fresh air and AC cleared it up. We had a few ants but nothing I bothered to complain about, the furniture is relatively new, the rooms are clean. We didnt hear anything about bad room experiences. I was annoyed about the late afternoon room cleaning because towels were arriving late. Building 5 was nice because the adult pool has a bar which is only attended by the patrons of that pool so the bar was never busy AND it is one of the closest buildings to all the restaurants AND it is partially right on the beach although no rooms face the beach.There was some construction taking place off property next to building 5 but they worked reasonable hours and never really disturbed us. Although I'm sure it may have annoyed the people trying to use that pool during the day. The pathway around building 4 to building 5 does pass something that is a little smelly (perhaps the sewage treatment I'm not sure) we did notice it but only while passing by. No other construction noted.I couldnt hear the people in the rooms next to me but I could complain that the noise in the hallway travels and echos. Luck of the draw whether you have quiet people in your building or not. Plus, the humidity must make the door frames shift because you had to slam your door to get it to close which was part of the hallway noise problem. I did find it inappropriate to charge for the room safe, that is typically included for free at other resorts I've been to.We found the main buffet to be the best resort food we have ever had. They make fruit smoothies, eggs to order, great pancakes, french toast, bacon, you name it. Fresh fruit selection could be a little better, if you care for that sort of thing. Al a cart restaurants were a nice change, we personally preferred the buffet.The beach dinner on Thursday is stunning. They close all the restaurants and set up all the tables and servery on the beach. The movie and show take place on the beach as well. Unique and a HUGE effort by the staff.We did the free guided bike ride which was something different and nice. We went through the side street of town so dont worry about the bus traffic. Then it goes along the back side of another resort's golf course, then a private trail for the excursions (ATV and horses were sharing our route). Then you stop at a beach area and head back. The tour is about an hour but he will take you longer if you want to. I dont know if the route changes but that was ours.I found the excursions a little expensive, but the resort is further from the main Bavaro stretch of beach so that may be the reason. We did the Tropical Storm which was great. Large catamaran goes near the ship wreck site at Bavaro beach, then to the largest inflatable slide, then snorkelling and a ocean area for regular swimming - the toss an inflatable bar in the water and you can stand around, pick shells, walk the beach. They provide lunch as well. Nothing fancy.I used the gym twice. It was adequate if you're not an athlete. Weights were ok, two treadmills, crosstrainer, rowing machine. A weigh scale which is off by a few lbs but that will impress you when you get home and realize you didnt gain as much as you thought!!They let you walk through the spa if you want to see it. It was very nice. If I went back I would definately book something there.The grounds were spectacular, lots of greens and grass.Did not hear of any crime or troubles.The disco is not very good but I found similar situation in another DR resort as well last time I was there. However, they have a disco tour where the bus will take you to the good discos at 11:00pm. two nights of the week. We didnt do it but it was available.There is a lounge behind the elevator where you can play cards or board games. We discovered it on our second last night (of course). There is a TV in there that gets channels you cant get in your room if you're hoping to see the hockey playoffs or special programming. The room TVs did get many of the North American channels - we watched a few of our favorite evening shows.Bring an insulated reusable cup - dont add to the litter of this world. Plus it gives you a larger drink that stays cold longer.Bring a mini container of hand sanitizer, I've heard that the easiest way to get sick at any resort is from sharing tongs at the buffet.. Use the sanitizer before handling your food.If you are the type of traveller to leave gifts for your room cleaner (many of whom were men here), bring ballcaps or baseball stuff for the men and fragrances for the ladies. We didnt really have an opporunity to give stuff to the kids in town but you can do that as well. They ask for school supplies. Gum was very popular as well. Bring $1 bills for tipping, the staff really appreciate it and they deserve it. Tip a variety of people, not always the maid or bartender. I gave a dollar and a pack of gum to a grounds keeper and he greeted me every day thereafter. There is a stretch of vendors on the beach to the left where you can buy items cheaper than the hotel shops. When you walk the beach, expect them to ask you to visit their store but they dont push you to. They may give you their business card or ask your name. HOWEVER, once you are in their store they beg you to buy anything cheapie-cheapie. I felt so guilty I bought something almost everywhere even if was just a $2. figurine. They always suggest a price to you which is way too much, I dont understand this but it is how it is done. Think reasonably what you would pay at home. I paid $3 sml coffee $5 lrg, $20 medium painting, $60 for largest painting, $6 necklace). The vendors on resort property have to pay a fee to the hotel to be onsite so they rightfully need to ask more. When I walked the beach later in the week and they approached me, I told them I was already in their store or I already bought a painting and they thanked me and left me alone, I should have thought of that strategy earlier in the week I suppose..Overall, I tell people to relax, you're on vacation in a remote location. You may see a bug or two, big or small (although we did NOT see any worth mentioning). You have them at home too, they are just hidden better. For the most part, this resort is great as long as your expectations are not over the top. This hotel is posted as a 5-star which is a little high in my opinion but it does deserve a 4-star. Food is great, shows are good, great for famillies or a quiet week. If the price was right we would go to this resort again. Hope that helps.

<Content>Not Hot .. if You Can Avoid the Stay Please do so  We booked a room with two beds. Upon arrival, all goes well until my sister and I get to the room, this room only had 1 bed. We called the reception desk they told us they would bring a bed to the room, lord only know what they were going to bring us (a fold out?). During our wait we inspected the room, the bathroom looked old, the sheets seemed unwashed, the mattress was falling apart, the pillows didn't have pillow covers, discusting, there was one towel in the bathroom. We had a wedding to attend at the resort and to avoid being late, I went to the reception desk to try and speed things up. I got nothing but attitude and a reluctance to help, when I requested another room, the guy at the desk aimed his employee badge at me, as if that was supposed to scare me or something. The man's name Epilio. Epilio went over the the individual that set us up originally and told him, in spanish, take care of your own [--], i'm not fixing this crap for you. Knowing I understood every word. Juan, not sure about the name, he moved us to another room with two bed and pillow covers. At that point I had realized that if i didn't know the language, I would have been screwed. We got to the other room to find it tolerable, but did notice that the mini fridge had never been cleaned and the refreshments in it looked 20 years old. Went to shower and discovered there was no water pressure. I was forced to shower under a trickle of water.  I was happy I did not bring my son along on this trip.The beach is beautiful, if this is supposed to be a family friendly resort, I didn't understand why every one was top less. The hotel should post that kind of activity, since it is allowed around children. I know i didn't get the memo.The food was mediocre, We were careful on what we chose, there fruit selection was poor (no strawberry's, oranges, grapes etc) there salad selection was poor, all they had was lettuce. Whatever was at the snack shop was not at all edible. The activities were minimal, nothing to do, and what there was to do was an extra additional cost. The highlight of the evenings were the shows, Michael Jackson show and the Dominican show.I have always known the people of DR to be very happy and helpful, this is my first experience encountering the oppisite at this resort.

<Content>Wonderful Relaxation My two friends and I stayed at the Globalia the week of May 2 through May 8. I must say that I was concerned about the booking after reading some of the reviews, but we decided to go into the week with no expectations. What I can say is that we had the most relaxing wonderful experience. The service we received was excellent....from the bartenders to the front desk guys to the maids. Everything we asked for was provided...and was provided with a smile. I think the most important thing to remember is that if you give respect to someone and treat them nicely, they will in turn, treat you with the same. The food was fine and the service in the restaurants was wonderful. No problem getting ill...just be smart about what you are eating and drinking. A previous review stated the house wine was not that good....I would definitely agree. So, just buy a better bottle or find something else to drink.I would also agree about previous comments made about finding a chair under one of the huts. We never made it out there early enough to grab one, so maybe the resort could do better with respect to this. I will say, that no matter when we went out - to the beach or the pool - there were always adequate chairs available. Not once was there not a chair for us to use.The beach is beautiful...a small amount of seaweed, but nothing that is terrible. I advise everyone to walk down the beach...past the shops and other resorts. The beach is practically deserted and the water is absolutely wonderful. Saw many fish and starfish. Oh, take your own snorkel equipment....the resort only allows you one hour with their equipment and you must stay on the resort to use it.My suggestions for a wonderful experience:1) Take an insulated mug/cup....cuts down on trips to the bar and keeps your drinks cold2) Take several dollar bills for tips....the staff really do appreciate the gesture3) Take your own snorkel equipment and beach towels4) And finally....take a good attitude. You are coming to the beach to relax.....try to let go of all the little things. Remember you are on a beautiful beach with cold drinks and good food. And, always, smile.

<Content>The BEST vacation ever! I read 2 bad reviews and could not understand who wrote them. My family and I stayed at this resort for 7 nights at the end of April 2007. We absolutely loved it! The first day was a bit disorganized as the room was not ready on time however the rest was just absolutely above my expectations. The beach was clean and beautiful, the room was comfortable and clean. It was cleaned every day and decorated with fresh flowers. The food there is just a delight, especially desert. Fresh fruit and fresh juices of different kinds every day. The stuff was very friendly and made us feel at home. The resort area was very clean. I loved the activities so much: aerobics and kids club (I traveled with my son) during the day as well as movies and different performances every night. The performances were very professionally organized with beautiful costumes and special effects. There were also a lot of other activities available like boat tours etc. but as I was with my mom and a toddler we did not take any.We also met many people from Canada and US (including those who booked through Apple Vacations) and they all were happy about their stay in this resort.My mom visited Punta Cana Princess resort last year but after visiting Punta Cana Grand this time with me said that Punta Cana Grand was much better. We had the best vacation ever. I told all my friends about it and I am planning to visit it next year with my family and a couple of friends. I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially families with kids.

<Content>Definately not a 5 apple resort!!!!! OK where do I begin!!!! We stayed at this resort the 21st-27th of April...Before we left, I read the reviews...some good and some bad well I can see where the bad ones came from but not the good ones.We arrived around 11:30 from a direct flight from Pittsburgh. (Good Flight on time) When we got there our room was not ready so they gave us an armband and told us to go ahead and use the resort..We asked where we could eat lunch since we had been traveling since early am and they said that we could not eat until 1:30 at the main restaurant and 12:30 at the beach grill.( So we quickly found out you cant eat when you want to unless you want to eat the food on the beach that has been in the sun all day) .We went to the restroom and changed into our suits and headed to the pool to catch some sun...That is when it all began. We could not find one chair to sit in...They were all completely taken so we had to sit on the cement in the sun with all of our carry on bags, purses, money, etc....We went to the grill to eat and not a very good taste of food...French Fries and omelets were the safest bet...When our room was finally ready more than an hour after they said it would be...what a disaster we walked into...We were in building 3 on the first floor, the smell that came out out of our room was nauseating. It smelled just like the sewer system on a hot day....i walked in to find incense burning stuck in a crack in the wall to cover up the smell....had to put a card in the wall to keep the air on and 4 cockroaches greeted me also. I told the maid about it and she just smiled and said Hola!!!! We went to the front desk only to get no help from them and only rudeness!!!! We had been traveling with friends and were to be booked by them...well we werent!!! We actually had been booked in building 7 and them in building 3. We didnt know one room number from the other so when asked to be switched near them that was no problem cause they were happy to give away smelly dirty roach infested rooms...When asking to be switched to another room they said that it was my fault i was were I was because we were upgraded to begin with at no extra charge... and there were no rooms to switch to...I would have to deal with it...Who would no room numbers??????We booked our trip through apple vacations and when we found our rep..he was no help either...said they would try to get us out of the rooms but wasnt sure if we could move....At this point my relaxing vacation was Stressful.!!!!!! We were there for 5 minutes and met a couple of people who were just as dissatisfied as we were....Finally the next day we were moved and had to pay for an upgraded room for the rest of our stay which wasnt that great either....to sum them up..water on the floors....ants all over the room....hard to get clean towels.....maids wouldnt clean your room till 4 in the afternoon so forget about relaxing from the sun.....had to run the airconditioning so that you wouldnt wake up with damp clothes in the morning..Its a wonder we didnt have pneumonia. Maids do not knock so keep your doors locked..do not really clean your rooms and if you dont have your towels on the floor in a pile you don't get new ones...No matter if you tip or not.You need to be up at 5am to get a chair by the pool...so be prepared....early riser you will be..Service at dining areas is slow so if you want drinks with your meal bring your own from one of the bars cause you will be done eating before you get it...Service is very so at the Italian Restaurant so be prepared. We waited 25 minutes just to get waited on...We were warned no to eat at the beach party on Thursday Nite...You Will get sick...food is prepared and set out all day long before the party starts...We made the best of the trip.....only cause you are basically stuck there if you dont. No flights out even if you want to leave...We did enjoy the shows they performed at night...Michael Jackson is a Must See!!!It was great.....And if you want to do and excursion go on the Kon-Tiki Tour....The bus ride is long but it is well worth the money....You get to snorkel for an hour and then party for 3 more....Lots of dancing and Fun !!! we enjoyed this....This is not a 5 apple resort at all....They are fooling you by saying that it is.....We will not ever go back to this resort Ever...Make sure you stay farther up on the carribean...Iberostar resorts, barcelo...are ones that have been highly recommended by friends of ours who go every year..We were talked into this resort by our travel agent....(She definately got a phone call when we got back)We will never go back to this resort and this experience has left a bad taste in our mouth about Punta Cana....Just beware of what you are booking for!!! Read the reviews....5 apples arent all what they seem...We would hate to see what a 2 or 3 apple was like!!!

<Content>This is not paradise! My husband and I booked this trip through Apple Vacations. We were given false hope and was told this was a 5 star resort, I would rate it as a 2 star. Our first nights stay was awful. There was a horrible smell in our room, cockroaches and it was dirty. The bathroom door was falling off the hings and the iron did not work. Our Apple rep at the resort strongly suggested we use the safe in our room, which by the way they don't tell you cost and extra $15.  The next morning we decided to upgrade our rooms, the front desk staff could not have been more rude. Finally when they said they had a room, they told us it would be ready at 12:00pm. Wrong....we made several trips to the front desk only to be told come back. I feel this became a fun game to them. The new upgraded room was better,but the floor was constantly wet. Not damp, I mean soaking wet. When we asked the maids about it they just shrugged their shoulders. We were lucky if they would clean our room by 6:00pm and give us a clean towel. Our shower drain did not work. After each shower we had to use our foot as a plunger! The food was not bad, but the service is SLOW!!! One night we made reservations in the Italian resturant and waited 20 minutes at our table before anyone even brought us water.The pool was fun, although there is a lot of nagging to participate in games from the staff.The shows in the evening were good.All in all anyone we met at the resort felt they were given false hope of their vacation too. I may visit Punta Cana again, but I will NEVER visit this resort again. Be careful of the name changes. Our Apple rep told us they had just changed the name of the resort thats why it was such a good deal.

<Content>The Cesspool of the Carribean We booked our trip through Apple Vacations and don't recommend them for travel advice ever again. The resort has construction going on right beside the resort against building 5. Service from front desk to waiters was horrible. No one was around when they were supposed to be working. The food was bland and disgusting. Many residents, including my wife and I, became ill after eating the food. The resort was purposely overbooked and we were given a room that was not what we purchased. The room we rented was supposed to be in building 7and it was paid for already. Well in order to get the room we paid for, we had to pay an extra $250. The beach was beautiful and there was ample sun. That's It!!!!!!

<Content>Excellent resort for a great price My family and I stated at the Punta Cana Grand from April 23 to April 30th. I was a little concerned about what we were in for from reading some of the reviews - but was more than pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Our plane was delayed so we arrived late afternoon but were immediately made to feel right at home on this resort. The resort is beautiful - very well kept, easy to get around, well laid out. The staff are wonderful - so patient and kind and really seem to be interested in making your stay a good one. We were immediately shown to our rooms which were connected and on the second floor in building 3. The rooms are spacious and clean. We never had a problem getting clean towels, the air conditioning worked and the mini bar was filled everyday. The food is wonderful at this resort. We ate at all of the a la carte restaurants - twice at the American Grill. The pico de gallo and tortilla chips were a hit with my vegetarian daughters. They never had a problem finding something on the menu - and the staff were more than obliging to make them a special plate. Da Marcos is amazing - the food was delicious, the service was amazing and the atmosphere was classy. And yes, there is seaweed on the beach - it's the sea! But everyday it was raked up. It was a little frustrating to have to get up at the crack of dawn to find a beach umbrella - but this is the fault of the visitors not the staff at the hotel. I think that some people put towels on the chairs under the umbrellas in the evening 'just in case' they needed them. I noticed that many chairs never had any people sitting in them. In fact, the only drawback to our stay at the Punta Cana Grand had nothing at all to do with the hotel staff and everything to do with the people staying there who 'drank all day,' (and sang a song about it) sat around the pool bar and were loud and obnoxious. We were shocked at how rude some of the 'guests' were - perhaps these are the same people complaining about this hotel? The entertainment in the evening was really quite good. The magician was amazing and we really enjoyed the Michael Jackson show - great dancing and costumes. There is lots to do on this resort and Anthony and his coworkers are great at getting people involved. I started to wonder if they ever slept - they were there early in the morning and late at night - always smiling. There are people on the beach trying to sell you various items - but say no thanks politely and they walk away. We had some sun and some rain and some wind - not much you can do about the weather. It sure beats the snow we encountered when we arrived home! To sum up - I would definitely come back to this resort. Great food, great people, lovely beach - what more can you ask for?

<Content>Just the right size resort We left Halifax on the 7th of April traveling with Air Canada vacations. All was well, flight was on time, had to de-ice the plane, but that is normal this time of year. Had a good flight, warm breakfast meal on board, two choices. Arrived in Punta Cana, and when the doors opened, the heat rushed in, a wonderful feeling. As you arrive, there are Dominican girls dressed in costumes and they take your picture as you enter the airport. You walk across the tarmac from the plane and that is when you really feel the heat. When you leave a week later, the picture is waiting for you to purchase if you want it, at a cost of $8.00 American or $10.00 Canadian. It was good quality so we purchased it as we were leaving. Had a great flight back, on one of the new Air Canada A320 jets with individual tvs and bigger seats and choice of two hot meals. Flight went fast and was on time.The ride to the airport was a little bumpy. There is a new road, but it鈥檚 still a bit bumpy. Eventually it will be a 2 lane highway. We didn鈥檛 mind. We were in a mini-bus with the closed in trailer attached for our luggage. Only 8 of us going to our hotel, so we got on our way immediately. It was only about a 20 minute drive to the resort.No line up to check in, got our luggage, and we were given our package from the desk clerk, we were assigned Room 3202 in Building 3. Very close to everything, middle floor. We had the last room at the end of the hall in the villa and it had a wrap around deck. We were very pleased with our room. There is a separate vanity, sink area, and a door closes to the toilet, shower area. Large tub with nice large area to lay your shampoos and toiletries at the foot of the bathtub. Water pressure was great and we always had plenty of hot water for showers. We arrived at the resort around 11:30 AM and were told to leave our luggage, given tags to claim it, that the rooms were not ready until 2-3 and to go enjoy the resort. We had a few drinks, went for lunch and shortly after before 2 we got our rooms and were ready to hit the water.The room was very large with a large dresser, lots of drawer space, and an armoire, with 4 more drawers and enclosed TV, and mini fridge. A few cans of beer and lots of bottled water. Every day this was topped up if we drank anything and lots of water was left. There was also a coffee maker, ice bucket, and a table and chairs. Two night tables, phone. Very well equipped room. Hair dryer in bathroom that worked very well. Makeup mirror on the wall. And the best part was the quiet air-conditioner with the ceiling fan. Hardly knew it was on. It didn鈥檛 shut off either when the patio door was opened or when we left our room. Safe worked well. Lots of closet space and shelves for folded clothing. We didn鈥檛 have to put a card in a slot either to keep the air-conditioner running. Ice Machines in each villa building. Also, there is a nice seating area on each floor at each entrance with nice wicker padded chairs to sit in. There is always a nice breeze blowing in.Everything is close at this resort. The main bar, at the front and pool bar at the back is in the middle, just a few steps from the large marble lobby. The lobby has two staircases that go up to the second floor where the disco and piano bar and the tour operators have an office. There is a nice lazy river pool between two of the sets of villas. It was nice to go there in the afternoons as it wasn鈥檛 as crowded and the water was cooler and very clean. Nice steps leading into it. There is an adult pool as well, but we didn鈥檛 bother with it as it was a very hot week, and the adult pool is more secluded and you didn鈥檛 get a breeze. Very hot here in this area of the resort. Nice little bar beside it but we needed a breeze. The week we were in the Dominican, it was at least 35+ degrees, sunny everyday and not a drop of rain. We lucked in.The main pool is a fairly decent size. I鈥檝e seen bigger, but for the size of this resort, it holds everyone. The pool bar also gets some sun, which is nice because I have found many pool bars seem to be shaded and believe it or not, can get a little cool there. Drinks were great, and flowing plenty. We never had a problem getting drinks. The bar tenders were always friendly whether or not you tipped them. The language barrier wasn鈥檛 a problem either, a lot of the entertainers and the bartenders spoke very good English. At the main bar there is a hot dog machine all day and evening and you help yourself. Very good hot dogs and fresh rolls. Also a popcorn machine at night that you can help yourself.Down at the Beach Grill, you can either go inside or outside, and help yourself. They have lots of fresh salad fixings, fruit, a few hot dishes, hamburgers, hotdogs, pastas, desserts. Outside, there is fresh pizza, nachos with salsa and guacamole and cheese sauce. A Panini sandwich maker, with fixings for sandwiches, fried chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs. No shortage of food. Ice cream in all the restaurants. I can鈥檛 see how anyone could complain about the food at this place. If you didn鈥檛 like something there were lots of other choices. The beach is very close to the pool and to most of the rooms. Everything is close and handy. We had a great deal of fun with the Entertainers and found their English very good. They worked hard to keep people involved in the activities and it was fun to watch them as they were full of energy, no matter how hot it was nor how long of a day they put in. The shows at night were very good as well. We went to the casino once, spent $10.00 in the slot machines, had two beer and left. It was nice but we are not casino people.The food was plentiful, Windows is the main buffet. The beef is a little tough, if you got slices of it, but if it was in fajitas, or at the specialty restaurants, it was very tender. There was always a lot of choice of meals for anyone who wanted something different, lots of variety of fresh fruit. Good omelets for Breakfast, good breads. There was a Mexican themed night, and a Dominican themed night at supper, other nights, I can鈥檛 recall. The Beach party night is the best. They work very hard to make this a fantastic evening for everyone. Dancing on the beach, wonderful meals, the workers take all day to set this up. It鈥檚 a must for anyone at this resort. They close the restaurants that night (Thursday) and everyone attends the beach party. Good entertainment as well. We tried the Italian Restaurant and we had very good meals. The steak here and the pork were wonderful. Pasta was good as well as the soups and the appetizers. Desserts we chose were Strawberry Cheesecake and Chocolate Cake, and everyone said they were perfect. Best cappuccino as well, very creamy and rich. We met many people from all areas of the Globe at this resort. It was the break for teachers in the US, so we met people from Wisconsin and Newfoundland, plus lots of other places. People were very friendly. Being at a smaller resort, you saw the same person more than once, and it made it nicer as you got to have conversations with the same people on a daily basis. We had a lot of fun with everyone we met. We would not hesitate to recommend this resort to everyone. I too had read the reviews about the resort prior to going, and can鈥檛 figure out what people were complaining about. We loved the size of it, the staff were great, the place is clean, well cared for, beach is nice, well groomed. The workers are always fixing up the grounds, and cleaning. They could use a few more chairs around the pool area and beach or some rules about saving chairs. You did have to get up at 6:00 AM or so to get a chair. I think they should implement a policy that you cannot put towels on your chairs at night to reserve them. Many resorts stack the chairs at night, so you have to put them out in the daytime. Perhaps this would work so that people didn鈥檛 reserve the chairs after midnight and more people would be able to use the huts at the beach or pool. Carin, the manager, is great to deal with. She cares about the travelers, and wants to solve any problems they may have in a courteous manner. If Globalia staff read these reviews, I would highly recommend that they seriously consider changing your house wine. The white house wine is not drinkable. The red is drinkable, but not of very good quality. We have traveled to All Inclusive resorts for the past 12 years, and this was the first resort that we could not drink the wine, which we really enjoy with our meals. This is not a complaint, and did not change the way we felt about the resort. There were lots of other drinks, but I do enjoy wine with my meals, and missed having it especially at supper. You do have the option to purchase bottles of better wine starting at $25.00 US Dollars, but being at an All Inclusive, I didn鈥檛 feel it was worth the extra money to upgrade the wine when I was only there for 7 days. I could do without. Otherwise I think Globalia is doing a great job with this resort and consider it definitely a 4+ star.

<Content>Nice Grounds But that was it Travel from April 22nd to 29th........Ok I read all the reviews before I left but thought how bad can it be... well I didn't know what I was getting into. First I booked with Apple Vacations in which they have it as a 5 star... this hotel is not 5 star it's more like 3. I see good and bad reviews and all I got to say is I'm happy to hear some people have a good time at this hotel we didn't come across anyone when we were there that thought highly of it.The only good things I can say about this Hotel is that it has a wonderful beach and the grounds are kept up. They have shows every night and most of the people are friendly. We took a trip to Saona which was the great. I would recommend this plus they have a lunch that was so tasty.Will I return not a chance. I would say if you are going to go to this hotel just be aware and not to expect much.When we were there 1 out of 5 people was sick for at least 3 days and we heard of many people getting stuff taken from their rooms. For some reason maybe we went at the wrong time but in talking to others at the hotel I don't think anyone there will return. People say to tip well we did but it did do any good once you gave a tip they just walked away and you never saw them again. There is construction going on around the Hotel so relaxing at the adult pool was not possible unless you like Hammers going.Here are some of the issues we had:Check In: Is suppose to be at 3 if you get there early they will give you a band and let you use the grounds. If they give you a time your room will be ready forget about it. It won't be ready till an hour after they say.If it rains water: If you get a room on the first floor and it rains make sure you have nothing on the floor because water will come down the hallway and into your room. If you call the front desk they will do nothing but say they will come by after the rain stops.Towels: If you enjoy taking baths or washing up don't think you will get any towels. And if you think your going to call the front desk and they say they will bring you towels forget about it. You will have to go to the front desk every day to request towels and don't think you will get them before 5 pm. Mostly they just hand the dirty ones. Oh beware they don't know before going into your room.Room getting clean: If your a person that enjoys a break from the sun in the afternoon don't think you will enjoy it in a clean rooms. Rooms don't get cleaned between 4-6 pm. Sickness: There is a good chance you will get sick. So bring medicine with you. If you need to go to the doctor just know that the visit will cost $150 just to see the doctor plus what ever medicine he gives you so total around $280Service: You like to have water or pop when you eat your meal you can forget about this. Waiters are very slow and most of the time we just got up and got our own drinks. They have more fun talking at the bar then helping you out.Food: One thing that was good was the room service. Don't eat the burgers because they are not done and make sure you check everything you eat. They have a way to cook fast which means not all the way done. Not taste to their food at all.

<Content>How it's changed since Sunscape ownership On our return journey from Sunscape Casa del Mar in February, my wife  I were informed (by the senior Thomson rep at Punta Cana), that the Oasis Group had now taken over running Globalia Punta Cana Grand, formerly (when we last stayed there in 2004  2005) Sunscape Punta Cana Grand; now known as Grand Oasis Punta Cana; and that Thomson were to market the resort in the UK. So we decided to book a week in April to check it out, to see if the resort had declined or improved:We have to admit that, overal, the resort has improved in many areas. Our pre-arrival contact with Caren de Vries (one of the Managers who stayed on after Sunscape), resulted in our being afforded a welcome back suite in one of the various new blocks, which are fantastic. If you go to the resort, try and get room 6207. It doesn't have a sea view, but it's a fantastic suite and close to the adult pool.The service, friendliness and attention to detail afforded by all the resort's staff has noticeably improved, and they are really great.Felix (the Resteraunts Supervisor; still there from Sunscape days) continues to do everything he can for you, whichever resteraunt you go to. Rolando (at the Beach Cafe lunchtime; at the Italian evenings), always ensured there was a chilled bottle of wine on the table as you rolled off the beach for lunch.The beach squad were on the beach every morning clearing the overnight seaweed invasion. HOWEVER, since we were last there in 2005, the lagoon itself has become overun by seaweed and is constantly floating loose in the water, making it not very enjoyable to swim in. It's not a problem if you're a Pool person, but my wife  I are Beach Bums so I have to admi thatt the seaweed is a downer in our books.The food is the standard you come to expect at any Dominican resort. It has depreciated in quality and variety since Sunscape, but it's still mostly enjoyable whether bufet or a la carte, usually helped down by (in our case) chilled white wine or, on Managers cocktail night, by champagne.In all, it remains a very good, well run resort. It's intimate; not big and overcrowded like some of the other places. It is still far better than Sunscape The Beach, but not quite as good as Sunscape Casa del Mar.By the way, Sunscape are bowing out of Casa del Mar in October 2007, and the Barcelo Group will take over the reort.

<Content>The Best Ever Holiday- (please read) I want to go to the same resort every single year every month if I could.I loved it so much I cried when I left it.I have never ever wanted to stay somewhere for more than two weeks but this hotel I could live there.I have read some of the reviews and alot of you are picking on little things like the food.the food is really good I think:American grill- get given margarita's to start and you have a choice from a amazing range of food from starter through to dessertBeach restaurant- this is the same sort of way as the American grill except you are over looking the sea under a large cabana.Demarco鈥檚- is a very posh Italian and again it has a very good variety of food.Windows- this is a buffet that you don鈥檛 need to book for and it has a lot of choice of food for you to choose from and it isn鈥檛 the same all the time it had different night鈥檚 like a Spanish night etc.Beach party- this isn鈥檛 a restaurant but it us the night that all of the above restaurants are closed and all the staff spend all day preparing for the part very Thursday it is amazing fresh meat being carved, home Dominican stew simmering in a large cauldron above the ground, the entertain ment is amazing.The rooms are immaculate and very clean they get cleaned every day and are done to a high standard when you first go into your room it is presented beautifully with towels made of swans and decorated by fresh flowers. The mini bar gets filled every day and you get more coffee if needed. No need to bring a iron or hairdryer as they have one there, the room has plenty of storage, and the entertainment in the room is given by a large TV which has a number of channels in different languages. In the room they have a laundry bag if you fill it up and seal it then you get it back the following day. You can have room service from anytime you like and it will reach you within 30 minutes.There are three pools:Adult pool- over 18s and it has its own bar and Jacuzzi.Main pool-family pool which has a swim up barSide pool- for everyone too.The beach is seconds away from wherever you are in the hotel and is stunning.It is alright saying all about the hotel but I am missing out the best part if the hotel this is the people. They are so caring, friendly and so fun to be around. The staff made my holiday and are the main reason why I would like to return I am missing them all already and I have only just got home.thank you for readingNicciAge-14xx

<Content>Great resort, but will not be back We have just returned from a week at the Globalia on April the 24th very nice and tropical. Check-in time was 3:00pm we had to wait 4 hour for our room to be ready. The room was nice on the 1st floor, clean but noisy as it was on the gound level in block 5 and close to the beach,high traffic. After complaining they moved us to the 3rd floor with side ocean view great rooms.Buffett dinner at the Windows resturant had variety and was good. We ate at all 2 of the a la carte resturants, but didn't enjoy them had to return to the buffet resturant to finish dinner. My daugther is vegiterian and there is nothing for her at the a la card resturants, Make your reservations early. Lunch was usually the same everyday at the beach resturant, Pizza , chicken  rice. But we sat outside and viewed the ocean while we ate, beautiful  relaxing. The beach was beautiful, white sand, but lot of sea weeds on the ocean and the beach side. never took more than one dip., get your lounge chair early arround 5 am or you will not be able to get one. My wife and i walked on the beach every morning  all lounge chairs under umbrellas at beach  pool were taken. The weather was not that Great! rain some times and Sunny  warm another. Water sport is a joke , you have to be there by 9 am sharp to put your name on a list for a free lesson , not one minute before, even if you book, you will never go as its always to calm (no wind) or to windy cant go, they want you to by insurance to take the katamran out $ 5 for 30 minute. We had some problems with the rooms, no towels, air-conditioning leaks. All of this would not have been much of a problem, except when we reported these problems it was looked after but after some time. Our kids had a great time as this was their first tripto the Dominican. What upsets us most is the harrasment you will get at the resort and on the beach when you go for a walk. On the resort sales people want to sell you trips, water activities etc. and the photographer will walk arround alomst ever hour with some exotic animals and ask you if you want to have your picture taken with the animanls. Money grab $ 8 for a 5X4 print or they could put it on a CD for $5 a picture minimum 6 picture. The shpos on the resorts are not better than the beach they are hunders time more expensive and you will still be harrassed once you pass infront of them. I would not return to this hotel again nore the Dominican there mentality is that you paid for this trip so you can afford to pay for other things too. There were just too many inconsistencies in service.

<Content>Some Problems We checked into Globalia on March 8th very pretty and tropical. Check-in time was 3:00pm we had to wait an hour for our room to be ready. No that much of a problem as we had lunch, but our kids (10  13), wanted to go to the pool. Our room was nice on the 3rd floor, and clean. We proceeded to the pool, there were not enough pool towels. When we asked at the desk for towels we were told they had to go to the laundry to look for more, after some more excuses we were finally given 3, there were 4 of us. We went back to our room to take showers  dress for dinner, we only had 2 bath towels, there were 4 of us. Once again we had to go to the front desk for towels.  Buffett dinner at the Windows resturant had variety and was good. We ate at all 3 of the a la carte resturants, and enjoyed all, make your reservations early. Lunch was usually the same everyday at the beach resturant, chicken  rice. But we sat outside and viewed the ocean while we ate, beautiful  relaxing. The beach was beautiful, white sand, clear carribean water, but get your lounge chair early or you will not be able to get one. My husband walked on the beach every morning at 6:30  all lounge chairs under umbrellas at beach  pool were taken. Unfortunately people would claim spots and never use the chairs. Do not walk past warning signs on beach. The weather was Great! Sunny  warm. Snorkeling from the beach was OK, not that much to see, but fun anyway. We would go to the pool at about 4 pm for coctails before dinner, had a fun time talking to other guests. We continued to have room problems, no soap, towels, air-conditioning, refrigerator, and TV,(we just wanted to see the weather for our return trip). All of this would not have been much of a problem, except when we reported these problems to the front desk, we were given excuses instead of the supplies we needed. I understand they were short staffed  completely booked, as it was Spring Break week. But the staff is only as good as the supplies given to them by management. I would have to look for maids on other floors for help. We were not the only family complaining of inconsistent service and supplies. Everyone seemed to be having diffculities.Our kids had a great time, and meet other kids from Canada  France. They all exchanged e-mail addresses. We also meet some very nice couples. We went on the OutBack Safari excursion. Had a great time and learned alot about DR culture. We asked our guide about hotels. He liked Iberostar. Stated Globalia was going through new management, and looking for more employees. Make sure you drink alot of bottled water becuause it is so hot, and use plenty of sunscreen, can burn very fast. Also use bottled water to brush your teeth. We even took bottled water to dinner, you can get as much as you want at any bar. None of us got sick while we were there, or when we came home.I would not return to this hotel again. There were just too many inconsistencies in service. Sorry my photos are not ready they do show how pretty everything is.

<Content>Don't even consider Unfortunately we have had our first horrible trip out of 10 wonderful ones we have taken. The Globalia Grand in Punta Cana looks good on the surface but it truly became an unacceptable, nightmarish experience. The room looked beautiful but never even had luke warm water for showers. The ceiling leaked, streaming down over the tub and coming from a light fixture. The room smelled so stronly of mold that we became sick. The smell of mold penetrated our suitcases (which are now ruined) and was on the sheets, towels, and pillows. Beach towels smelled and looked as though they were not washed. We asked for these issues to be resolved but were not understood or lied to telling us it was fixed. Food was of such a poor quality, we struggled eating anything other than potatoes. We are adventurous, easy-to-please eaters but could not eat the main entres wandering what mystery meat we were consuming. And finally ,we spotted one rat near the walkway; and the last day found feces floating in our pool. Communicating with staff was near impossible. I have contacted Apple Vacations and Carols Travel in Orland Park.....will update you with their response.

<Content>Horrible Place!! I read previous review and should have listened. Even my travel agent warned me about the overall quality of this resort prior to booking. It was a group of eight adults that went on this trip and thank goodness for the comfort in friends...we would have booked a flight home shortly after arrival. When the transfer van pulled up, my stomach fell. The outside is old and run down and this only radiates throughout the entire resort. We stayed in Building 3 and constantly had problems. Our other friends experienced the same headaches. There is only water pressure if you take a COLD shower, water trickles out when switched to hot/warm. Mini-bar was hot...if you are used to hot soda and beer you will be fine. The room was awful!! By far, the worst accomodations I have ever stayed in. Furniture was chipped and very old, the bed posts were broken, cracked/dented lamp shades, smudges on sliding glass door, A/C would NEVER cool beyond 74 degrees, rust/mildew covered bathroom, shower curtain was molded, mildew in grout, tiles did not match, shower head was barely stable in wall, door frame entirely rusted, water would be turned OFF during evening for repairs, out of beach towels everytime I asked (3-4 X day), no alarm clock, the entire resort would be without electricity (even in the restuarants at night---kind of scary), tile work around the resort missing and crumbling, pond for flaminagos was puke green, fence around that thing was broken and falling down. Frozen drinks were NEVER frozen always watered down and tasted like syrup. Nothing top shelf even available if you wanted to pay extra. ONLY Classico brand liquor and El Presidente beer. We were so sick of this place, we could not even drink enough!! That is pretty sad!! Need I go on????On the positive side, the food was edible. You will not look forward to dinner for the food, but another day almost over and closer to departure. This resort is about ready to change its name to Grand Oasis Punta Cana and I am familiar with the Grand Oasis resort and they are of poor quality and taste. The bartender Nico was great. The orange juice at the Windows breakfast buffet was good, that is when they did not run out!! Hey, the old saying is true...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!

<Content>Good Time at Globalia Overall we had a great experience at Globalia Punta Cana Grand. The airport transportation was excellent. We were transported from the airport to our resort in an air conditioned van in just about 15 minutes. Check in was a breeze. The people behind the counter were extremely friendly and helpful. We arrived at noon and check in is not suppose to be until 3:00, but our room was ready for us when we arrived. Our rooms were excellent! Building 7 is a must. Marble floors, large walk in shower, ocean front balcony, two jacuzzi tubs, canopy king size bed, safe, and a stocked frig all made for an excellent room. One jacuzzi tub is on the balcony overlooking the ocean, very romantic at night. We did have a problem with hot water though. We only had HOT water for one evening shower. The water was warm, but not warm enough to be enjoyable. Our friends that traveled with us and roomed next door to us had hot water everyday, so I guess it varies from room to room. The food was good, nothing exceptional and not as good as a fine dining restaurant in the states, but good. They had a large variety in the Windows buffett. However, the options were the same everyday. The salad bar was great and the egg station for breakfast was wonderful. Refills on drinks were hard to get. You receive a small glass with your meal and have to chase a waiter down to get a refill. My husband walked up to the bar after waiting 5 minutes for his drink, which resulted in the bartender shouting at him to sit down. The desserts were great at all the restaurants. This was the best part of the entire meal. Service was extremely slow at the Beach Garden restaurant. We could not get a reservation until 9:00, so we were very hungry. The tropical salad was great; I highly recommend. And once again desert was great. The day you arrive make sure you schedule reservations to the restaurants to ensure a decent eating time. We scheduled ours the morning after we arrived and the only times we could get were 9:00 and 9:15. We ordered room service one day to hold us over. Room service is included so take advantage. The food was good and service was quick. Pizza and sandwiches were great. All of the pools were nice, however getting a chair is difficult. We never laid by the large pool with the swim up bar due to never finding 4 chairs together, we couldn't even find 2 chairs together. People would put their towels on the chairs to save them, but were never around. This was very annoying. One day there were about 20 people at the pool and no chairs. There are probably 100 chairs total, but most were empty but had towels laying on them. We had no problem finding chairs at the adult pool however. The bartender at the adult pool was excellent. The drinks were great and his up beat attitude was a plus. He would walk around and ask if we wanted a drink and then would bring it back to us, very nice! The beach was nice, seaweed is a problem that can not be helped. However, if you walk to the left of the resort about 10 minutes there is a beautiful secluded beach with clear water and no seaweed. I highly recommend taking a towel and walking down there to tan and swim. We used all of the non-motorized water sports and had a ball. The catamarans were so much fun. We also windsurfed and used the kayaks. We purchased additional excursions. We went snorkeling one day and did the shoppong excursion the next. The snorkeling was a big disappointment. They take you out about 100 yards from the resort and have an area that is fenced in to do the snorkeling. There were several sharks and stingrays, but the guide had to swim down and pull on them to get them to swim around. No tropical colored fish. Overpriced and a big let down. The shopping excursion was great. We went to a cigar and rum shop, an expensive shopping center (Hard Rock cafe), and a flea market type center. We bought a lot of stuff at the flea market, but check the prices on the beach first. Cheap Charlie gave us a lot better deal on our shirts. Overall we had a great time and I would recommend this resort and may even return myself.

<Content>Truly Fantastic place. I stayed at the Globali punta cana grand in march 07. I went to the Hotel to write a review on this resort, that is now complete and has been passed onto many travel agents. I read over 100 travelers reviews on this hotel before i left and i was so surprised at the variety of good and bad reviews, so i looked forward to visiting myself. I am going to tell you as much as i can and hope this will help many of you when reading these comments to pick the holiday to suit you.Transfer to hotel =20 minsCheck in= Quick,polite The reception is lovely and grand with its double marble staircase and glass lift. All the staff where eager to help and all smiles!Bell boy's very polite and quick to please.The overall feel of this hotel is one of peace. I would say it is more suited to couples young and old or families. The grounds are wonderful and immaculate. The variety of landscape, pond's, tree's,and grass area's provides a tranquil setting for this beautiful hotel. It is big enough to have a nice walk aroung but not too big to get lost or need a buggy to get to your room. All restaurants and the beach are minutes away from the room's.There are 3 pool's. The largest in the middle of the resort with the swim up bar and another bar above with covered seating area's overlooking the pool and beach. This is lovely in the evening when all the pool and beach lights are on. The choice of spirits here are excellent. With popcorn and hotdogs all inclusive on the latter bar in the evening. Great for the kid's or peckish late night drinkers! Then you have the adult only pool open till 11 pm with its own bar and hottub lovely idea. You also have the lagoon pool that winds its way in front of block 7 and down right to the white powder beach. THE BEACHThe beach is wonderful with its fine white powder sands. There are a variety of shop's along the beach front just to the left of the hotel offering hairbraiding $20 T-shirts $7 beach wraps $7. This is a nice place to have a little shop when you are bored of sunbathing.There are lots of sunbeds on the beach but they can get reserved early in the morning.WATER SPORTSThe water sports are all included you get a 30 min lesson and then you are free to sail once a day per person for 30 mins. This is well worth doing. The snorkleing is ok the water is clear and warm but you have not many rocks in front of the hotel which is excellent for swimming but if you want to find marine fish you can easily 5 mins to your left where ther are more rocks.The RESTAURANTS are all superb most all inclusives i have stayed in over the years have not come close to this hotel. I cannot understand how some people have not enjoyed the food. The chioce is huge and every taste covered if you cannot find something you like then there is something wrong. THE ROOMSThe hotel at the moment are upgrading its rooms, redecorating and adding new lighter furniture. Some of the rooms still have darker older furniture and older bathrooms but All the rooms come with 24 hour room service with a menu in each room for meals around the clock that are all included in the price. They also have a daily stocked bar of beer and soft drinks included at no extra cost. These features are what makes this resort a 5 star resort. Some of the older rooms however are perhaps not up to 5 star standard at the moment as with the rest of this wonderful hotel but this is soon to change. Dont let that put you off. If you are really not happy with the room you get dont go home and give the hotel bad press contact the room division manager whilst you are at the hotel Caron de vries she is wonderful and will do all she can to make your stay perfect.  If you are truly wanting a full top class 5 star holiday then i suggest you pay the extra supplement and upgrade to block 7 rooms. These rooms are to die for and are spectacular. They are marble throughout with jucuzzi baths, large marble shower, kingsize 4 poster bed ,lovely seating area with vanity unit overlooking the laggon pool and some the beach. You can upgrade at the hotel on arrival. I feel this hotel is very competative compared with other 5 star hotels along punta cana. Even if you pay the upgrade to block 7 you will still pay less than most other 5 star resorts making this a very good choice of hotel for all travellers. ENTERTAINMENTThe shows are good they are the usual carribean show's the venue is great with a huge roofed open air area with a long bar a good stage and a movie each night before the show. In the day time there is entertainment in the main pool only. Members of staff come around the pool asking you to join in but they are not pushy which is nice, if you say no they walk on by. There is a playground with slides swings on the beach and also a trampoline and badminton vollyball net.CHILDRENS CLUBI cant say enough about the girls that run this club. Fedalena and Rosia are fantastic. They are based in an airconditioned play room on the beach. It is in a great place handy for the pool and beach. They have games and a tv with console, toilet, drinks etc. There have daily activities for the children and these 2 girls look after the children as if they are their own. They even have horse riding and a trip to the animal park included.Thank you to all the staff that made our stay so enjoyable its lovely to be able to write such a favourable report on such a wonderful resort. Thank you to Caren de vries for looking after us so well and for the lovely meals on the beach at the chefs table. This is such a great idea of your's for welcoming special guest and returnee's. I am hoping to be a returnee! next year, so please reserve my room caren.... :-) and hopefully we'l meet up with you and sandy and her mum and have another wonderful holiday.All the best Vicki and daniel

<Content>Michelle and Jamie kick it at the Punta cana grand This was mine and my friends first time in Dominican Republic and we had the best time. Most of the staff were very friendly (but single girls beware of how friendly you are it may be taken the wrong way) and the resort itself was absolutely beautiful. The weather was perfect, I've never had a better tan! The food was great but we did not try all the restaurants. The disco was a lot of fun, it was full every night we went and the rec/dance staff also were there working long hours to make sure everyone had a good time. Mr. Paris, Thanks for finally teaching me some rhythm, on the dance floor that is, and don't be shy, come to Canada and look us up!Thanks Punta Cana Grand for the excellent time away!

<Content>What a Blast! - Loved It! I would highly suggest visiting the Globalia Grand on your visit to Punta Cana. The people were friendly, resort clean, entertainment awesome and food excellent!The people are extremely helpful and friendly. I didn't pass one employee that did not greet me or smile to acknowledge me. Mnay of the employees know a good deal of English and some also know French and German. Communicating was not a problem.The resort was very clean and well mainained. Our room had clean towels left each day and the cleaning ladies put new soda, beer and bottled water in our room each day. We left a $2.00 tip for the ladies each day. Each day you can turn in your towel to recieve a new towel. Make sure to not leave your towel lying around or forget to pick it up at the end of the day. Thsi did not happen to us, but another couple forgot their towels and then had to pay $20.00 for new towels. I would suggest getting up early (7 am) to put your towels over chairs so you can eat breakfast and then go back to your chair. Also, if you are not traveling with children under the age of 17, make sure you frequent the adult only pool. It is off in its own little area and there is no noise. This pool has beach chairs, palm trees and a bar. Very relaxing! The entertainment offered was fabulous. This resort truly caters to the adults as well as children. Each day, there is a shedule of events the visitors can participate in. Some events include dancing lessons, water aerobics, bingo, beach volleyball and the lisst goes on. Each night, there is a movie shown in a big theater. This theater also houses events such as magic shows and other kid events.The food at this resort was great. When I was reading some of the reviews before my husband and I went to this hotel, I noticed some people were saying that they became very sick from the food and told people to avoid the resort. Then I looked at their pictures they attached to their review and realized why they got sick! Just keep this in mind, be aware of what you are eating and don't drink the water. The fruits and vegetables are washed with filtered water. I don't eat much meat so I was a complete vegetarian on this trip. My husband did eat soem of the meat but was careful with what he chose. He avoided the seafood and hamburgers. The three restaurants to choose from are good but we highly recommend the italian restaurant (de Mario's). If you want a superb meal, here's what to order. For the appetizer get the sliced tomato with cheese. For the soup choose the minestrone. Get the pasta trio for your main course. Finally order the chocolate lasagna for dessert. It's like the dessert they used to have at the Olive Garden only much better! Order this and you will not be disappointed!So I think I managed to inform you as best I can about the Globalia Grand. Make sure you check this hotel out. It was fabulous. We will be back with the whole family next time! Enjoy!Sarah and Kyle from Wisconsin

<Content>best holiday yet we have just returned from a two week holiday at the globalia punta cana grand and i cant praise this hotel enough.Went with family ages 4 to 67 and i must say this hotel had something for everyone.The location was perfect lovely white sandy beach we could snorkel and sail most days this was inclusive in our holiday cost ,We stayed in block seven it was the most luxurious room i have ever stayed in and as a retired travel agent i have visited many hotels all over the world but this topped it all.Our stay was enhanced by the attitude of the staff who all seemed to be very happy to be of service to all the guests, and to Caron who invited us to dine at the chefs table on the beach what a beautiful memory to take home with us .The restaurants had a good selection to suit everyone and with such choice we always looked forward to our evening meal and for those who wanted it a good entertainment program every night,but all good things must come to an end so thanks to Caron and the friends we dined with ,Sandy and her mum Fran for helping to make our holidaya memorable one . Margaret and Leonard

<Content>Great Time at the Grand Met our group from last year ( Ocean Bavaro ) Mike  Janice, Brent  Boomer and us Sandy  Cam at the Punta Cana Grand. Our group expanded to include Tim, Ross  Gail, Ken  Mary, Jeff  Melinda, Frank  Penny, Rick  Val and George. The hotel is rated 4.5 stars and I'm sure that everyone agrees. We were in building three, third floor with a cathedral ceiling which was really nice and handy for everything including the beach, pool, bars and restaurants. All the restaurants combined provided a huge selection of food. Also you were never far from your next drink! Thursday nights all guest were served supper on the beach. You can only imagine the looks from the Manager and all vacationers when our group put on the fake nose, glasses and moustaches along with the hillbilly teeth. The beach party provided the perfect setting to celebrate Boomers birthday which included a pair of serengaudi sunglasses. The Karaoke Bar provided Sandy with her chance of stardom on Dominican Idol. The pool bar also provided Mike with his first job in the Dominican, beertender! Our excursions included four wheeling, speedboat/catamaran ride to Saona Island, and snorkling. I personally did the flying zodiac boat ride down the coast for twenty minutes getting an aerial view of many resorts. The staff was very friendly and provided an nightly show which included a great Micheal Jackson show. The Casino even co-operated with me and paid out one night. The only negative was the flight times by Sunwing, leaving at 2am and landing at 6:45am made for a very tiring drive home from the airport. Hope to see our group next winter at the next destination being????? We'll review it next year and let everyone know the good  bad.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Just returned from a glorious week's stay at the Globalia Punta Cana Grand. We were in Building 7 and cannot say enough about it. The rooms are outstanding, with the hot tubs both inside and on the balcony. The Ocean Front view is absolutely beautiful. We could not find one thing to complain about!!! We have never encountered such friendly and helpful staff. Caren, the Rooms Manager, Adriano and Francisco, from the Windows Buffet were the best. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and took wonderful care of us. The language was not an issue at all. We had such a good time with all of them!The food was very good in all the restaurants. We had no issues at all. We were pleasantly surprised to see such a variety of food in the buffet. The desserts were amazing!The beach was pretty good overall. There was some seaweed in the water at times but not so much that you couldn't go into the water. The water was warm and very clear for the most part.We will definitely return!We would like to extend our sincere thanks to all the staff at the Resort for making our vacation such a wonderful experience.

<Content>Punta Cana Grand was "GRAND" Returned from Punta Cana Grand on 3/24/07 with the feeling that I left family at this resort. From check-in to check-out, our experience was nothing but wonderful. Thank you Caren for your hospitality, insuring that our rooms were incredible. You made us feel that we had been coming to the Grand for years - and - we will return. Thank you Mildred for keeping the rooms soooooo clean and always refilling towels and washcloths. To our waiters - Adriano and Francisco - you made every meal a delight (speaking of meals - the food was excellent, large assortment and varieties - and oh, the fruit!!! Anyone that rates this resort as anything but 5+ stars is not telling the truth. Each of the specialty restaurants was excellent (3) and the main buffet where we spent most of our time was excellent. Thank you Pedro (Tex-Mex) for the unbelieveable time that we had on our last night. Overall - there is NOTHING I would change about this marvelous place because I want it to be the same when we return. Thanks for the vacation.Pat  Bob (Ohio)e-mail: Pattyb4686@aol.com

<Content>Good friends, GREAT Resort, lot's of Fun Why fix what's not broken........Let me start by saying that our next years vacation resort has already been choosen. A special thanks to Caren for her attention and concern for us, and for the memories of staying at a wonderful place. Although the idea while on vacation is to enjoy the sun and sand, when in our room it was very comfortable, spacious and most importantly clean. The beach area was also very clean, had ample chairs, plenty of activities, and a beach grill topped with a bar that can quench any thirst. Poolside was just as entertaining and keeping in mind that just about all of the hotels ammenities are with-in eye shot or a very brief walk, which included shoping and a Casino. The restaurants and food were beyond our expectations as well as the nightly entertainment. All in all, good friends + a Great Resort = lot's and lot's of FUN !!!!!! See you next year !!

<Content>Would definitely go back After reading some of the reviews right after I made the reservation I was really afraid that I had made the wrong decision but boy was I wrong. The resort was wonderful. I don't know what some of you were complaining about! The white sand beach was clean and beautiful. Yes, there was seaweed that washed up everynight with the waves but the guys at the resort raked it up every morning. Some of the resorts down the beach had it much worse and it didn't look like it was raked up as often as our resort. What a job! There was no liter or bottles or cans laying around on the sand. There were plenty of beach chairs - we never had a problem finding one (you might have to drag a chair to where you wanted it but there were chairs available).We had an oceanfront room with a wrap around balcony in building 4. Our room was clean and and very well kept. Our bed was comfortable, Our shower worked well and we always had hot water. Our mini fridge was always well stocked with water, pop, and beer. Our balcony was in good condition and cleaned everyday as well.We dined at all (3) restaurants that we needed reservations for - the Italian Restaurant, the Seafood Restaurant and the Tex-Mex Restaurant. I made reservations the first morning we were there for all 3 of them. Our reservations were for 6:45 each night. You need to be flexible about times but you can get reservations. You can adjust what you eat for the day to accomodate any dining time, have a snack or an extra filling drink! Remember you are on vacation...We ate at Windows the other nights and there was plenty to choose from. You certainly will not go hungary!The dinner on the beach is romantic and alot of fun. Candlelight on the tables with tablecloths and wine glasses set up on the sandy beach. Tiki Tourches everywhere, Food stations with every kind of food and a delicious dessert bar as well as entertainment and music. These people try to please everyone by trying to include foods for all nationalities. Remember there are guests from many countries visiting these resorts..The drinks were good and we never had to wait more that a minute to get a drink at any of the bars. Each bar tender had their own special drink and I tried them all. Have fun and don't get all hung up if they don't have what you usually drink at home!You are there to have fun and relax....I'm sure you wil find something you like as there is alot to choose from. Bottled Water was available for the asking from any of the bars or restaurants and it was always in your room.The staff at the resort mostly speaks spanish but I didn't have any trouble communicating (I only speak english). I always got my message or request across. The staff at the front desk speaks english well so you should not have any problems expressing yourself to them. We emailed the resort with a request for an oceanfront room and indicated that we were celebrating out 40th wedding anniversary. When we arrived there was a bucket of champagne and a large fruit basket in our room - a nice added touch that I did not expect.The shows at night were entertaing and the casino is big enough to have fun. The main pool had activities to get involved with if you wanted - arobics, pool games, spanish lessons, fruit cutting  presentations. You could be busy if you wanted or just lay around and go from beach chair to the bar to the restaurant and then to the adult pool then back to the bar and the back to the restaurant etc. Excursions are also availble from the resort and we talked to many people we did those as well. They all seemed to have a good time.We travel every spring to the Carribean and it's our second time to this resort. Whatever you do - remember you are on vacation and have fun. Things are going to happen but make the most of it and make it part of your memories...good  bad. That's what makes every vacation untique!

<Content>Great Little Place I went with my wife, two kids, aged 3 1/2 and 16 months, my wife's parents, sister and her family (10 of us in total) from March 12 - 18, 2007. We stayed at the Melia Caribe in Punta Cana last year. We wanted a smaller hotel where we wouldn't have to take a tram to get to the restaurants and where everything was nearby. Globalia fit the bill, and the food was actually better than average for this type of all-inclusive. We stayed in Building 7. The staff was friendly and everything went very smoothly. The kids loved the mini club, the trampoline, and of course the beach and the pool. They could use a few more bartenders by the beach to minimize waits, however.Overall, I would recommend this place and go back.

<Content>Amazing Block 7  While I have been in the Dominican before, this was my first trip to Punta Cana. While we had a very good time, there were a few things missing. We had our room changed from the original room (block 5) to Block 2 lower level the second day. While in the second level, the A/C was broke, we had no towels and no maid to be seen for the 2 days and when I spoke to the Manager of HK, Caren DeVries, I cannot tell you enough how incredible this woman is. The first most important thing is that she spoke ENGLISH! It was beginning to get nerve wrecking the fact that not only the Dominicans didnt speak much English, neither did about 80% of the vacationers! She was right on that phone getting things done immed. While the A/C was permanently broke, I asked if I could upgrade to block 7. She was able to get us in and I cannot tell you how INCREDIBLE those rooms are. It was nice to see that Caren really cared about us. The wait staff in Windows were also unbelievable. In the mornings, our cappacino was waiting for us..they work so damn hard and get little acknowledgement from vacationers. The Italian restaurant was really not that great unless so I hear, you like fish. The tex mex American restaurant was amazing, we ate there twice only problem being lack of air. God was it hot! All in all I would have to say the resort itself would rate a 4 1/2 but the rooms definitley a 3 at most. Would I go there again...if I am in block 7...for sure! The customer service is this place is AMAZING!!! Thank you Caren for honestly caring about people!

<Content>You'll like this resort! Stayed here Feb 18-25. Upon arrival at airport girls in native costume greet you and take your picture, which cost $8 to get when you leave. Nice airport, everything is expensive, though, bring your own snacks if you're waiting for return flight. 20 minutes to Globalia, check-in a breeze and $10 U.S. to the desk clerk got us a room in 7 block with a jacuzzi, alll marble interior, 8 x 6 foot shower, large balcony, etc. Dominicans love U.S. dollars, bring plenty! Leave maid a dollar a day for great service. Breakfast buffet a real treat, don't miss it! Lunch buffet was fine everyday, no complaints. RIU lunch buffets were awful, so this was quite an improvement. Restaurant reservations were taken once for all 7 days, not like other resorts where you stand in line everyday at 11 am waiting to reserve. Dinner was fine, American restaurant a little hokey, Italian was excellent, dinner buffet was superb! Beach party a feast on Thursday, don't miss it. Best steaks at this resort compared to all others I've been to, and endless Champagne at Managers cocktail party, where dancers entertain in costumes that don't cover much. Pools all over, my favorite the adult pool with jacuzzi, where kids are asked to leave, tasteful toplessness, and this resort is 70%European. Easy enough to get used to. At the adult pool bar is Nicholas, who doesn't let you come to the bar, insisting on serving you poolside. His drinks are STRONG, best I've had, and he keeps the place clean. When the staff is knocking down coconuts, ask for them to cut a hole at the top so Nicholas can fill it with your favorite! Great guy, we gave him $5 when we left. Beach is perfect white sand, a little seaweed, but why complain, it's in the water and very little. Staff cleans up beach seaweed all the time. Get use to aggressive souvenir salesman, if they quote $25, tell them $5 in the U.S. and go from there, you'll pay probably pay $10. I've been to resorts all over the Caribbean and Mexico, and this was one of the best, and just $1,089 with non-stop air all inclusive. For the money, some aspects matched the $10,000 a week resorts I've been to. Come here and you should enjoy it!

<Content>This hotel is a 5 stars for facilities but 2 stars for service I was in this hotel from the the 05 march 2007 till 12 march 2007 and i will give you some comments of this hotel.First of all, the hotel has a colonial style as everything is made in wood and infrastructure is very good has there 2 swimming pools, tennis courts, etccc and the rooms are big.and clean. The activities are also well organized.But of course there are some very serious problems for a 5 stars hotel like :- the food is bad, be careful at what you eat as they repeat the same food everyday. For example : day 1 : normal chicken day 2 : the same chichen with sauce day 3 : the same chicken but fried day 4 : the same chicken in salad and so on; I had 2 times belly problems. Be careful also because they want to give tap water on your glass, so ask always bottle waters.- there is no enough parasols on the beach. If you want one, better wake up at 07.00 in the morning; put your towels on the chairs and go back to sleep.- the service on the restaurant is very slow. You can wait till 30 minutes before they bring you your glass or it never comes. Also if they need to repair something in your room, it can take 3 to 4 days (we did not have hot water for 4 days). - the doctor cost s 80 dollars a visit - there are shops int hotel which do not stop to call you and annoying you in order to try to sell you something. Even in the buffet, the waiters try to sell you necklaces and so on. This creates that there are some areas in the complex you want to avoid.etccc..In summary, the hotel facilities can be a 5 stars but the service is really 2 to 3 stars maximum. -

<Content>Wonderful vacation My husband, myself and our two daughters aged 17 and 6 stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from March 3rd until March 10th. We had a wonderful vacation. This was our 2nd time in Punta Cana and you just cannot beat the beaches here. We were in Los Cabos last year and the beaches were hard to walk on and you could not swim for the powerful undertow. Punta Cana has powder sand and beautiful warm salt water. The resort was great, although I don't think it was a 5 star. 5 star to me, means perfection, and although I have no serious complaints to me it is a 4 plus. We stayed in building 3, facing the flamingo's and the bar. It was never overly loud, and when I suggested we move for my daughters sake, they said they liked falling asleep to the music. Their is a lot of Europeon people at this resort, a lot of different languages and a lot of different temperments. Just go with the flow and make your vacation what you want it to be. You must reserve your chairs early or you will not get any. A lot of people don't like it but it is just the way it is. I was down every morning at 7 to get chairs under a hut, so that we could have shade. I used the beach towels and also my bathing suit wraps so I could tell they were mine. There was some difference of opinions while we were their among other people who's chairs were who's. The pool area is quite active, always something going on. We didn't go the the lazy river pool or the adult pool, but others we talked to loved it. They have fun games and aerobics and the animators work so hard it is unbelievable. We ate at all of the restaurants, Beach Garden for dinner was our favourite. The beef tenderloin is fantastic. We enjoyed the Beach Garden for breakfast and lunch as well. We found Windows a little bit more chaotic. Service at Beach Garden was faster in our opinion. My 6 year old who is very picky never had a problem finding something to eat and thank goodness for watermelon juice because that's all she drank along with bottled water. Water pressure in our building was terrible. Not that is ruined our vacation, it just took a longer time to get all the soap off, the water wasn't hot, but you get used to it. All in all we had a great time, last time we stayed in Punta Cana it was at the Bavaro Princess, and this resort is much smaller. Please go and see the show's they are a lot of fun and the people work so hard in them. We thought the magic show on Friday night was amazing. The interactive show's are pretty funny although a couple of time's I wondered if I should have taken my 6 year old out, as the games between the adults were a little -- over the top, but in the end she just thought they were funny. Have a great vacation

<Content>Nice place to stay The area is beautiful, the hotel rooms were okay. They need some work. But over all they did keep clean. The food is different and you need to watch what you eat. No raw veg. or salads. Do not drink the water use only bottle water even to brush your teeth. It is very layed back so if you are looking for a night life not here. But you just want to relax and sit by the pool or ocean and read this is the place. We did go on a horseback riding trip in the country side and the was great we were on horses for about 2 hours and saw so much. Well worth the money. If you bring children which we did you will see alot of topless women even at the pool were it is not allowed. That can get to you after awhile. Make sure you have lots of ones and fives they love american money and it goes far. They are not credit card happy so make you sure you have alot of cash. Do not go to the Beach Grill For dinner not very good. The American Grill and the Italian was much better.

<Content>A Nice Surprise! It was our first visit to the DR and Globalia, so we were nerveous too... but the place and the country, the climate, most of the people, the nature surprised us in a good way. The Hotel was neat, employees helpful. The entertainment was o'right. We saw the Michael Jackson show, of which the acrobats part was so entertaining. The food was good too... We went one night to The Beach Club I thing it was called, and we had to get up and leave, because the staff around us was busy, seemed frustrated and the selection was for someone who had no other choice of place. We got chased first by the hostess, then by the manager and begged to go back to the table. That felt so uncomfortable, so we promissed to eat there next night, of course we never did. Instead we went to Da Mario - GREAT FOOD, that's all I can say. Definitely try Windows, the buffet there is honestly outstanding, compared to any other All inclusive place we've been to so far - we were so stuffed we couldn't walk..:)One last thing - The vendors on the beach and the ones in the hotel were just so anoying. Don't buy anything, unless you are prepared to dig deep in your pocket, get into a fight, or literally cursed out. Example: My husband needed new sandals for the beach, and went to see if they will have any in their little sheds on the beach. The guy was asking $40, for something you get at the Dollar Store for a buck. But when I showed up, the show was over. I talked him down to $15, then finally completely changed our mind, because he asked for cigarettes and beer on top, didn't buy them, and the vendor made a rough comment about my nationality that was hard to swallow - almost ruined my vacation mood there. A trip someone offered for $110/pp, we got for $70.Overall, we had a great time and lots, lots of beer...

<Content>Wonderful Experience! We arrived at Globalia Punta Cana Grand after Riu Bambu had given away our reservation. (See my comments on Riu Bambu site policy regarding overbooking their resorts).Our first impression was that this was a much quieter and less crowded resort than the Riu Bambu. When we arrived at 9.30 p.m. there were painting scaffoldings in the lobby as they were redecorating this area.The check-in service was friendly and prompt and we were told to have some dinner first while the restaurants were still open. We thought that this was very considerate and nice!Our room in building 3 faced the activities hut, flamingo pond and pool/bar and had particial ocean view. The check-in person told us that we could change the room if we found it too noisy. We were fine, even enjoying the flamingo calls at 6 a.m. as well as late night bar hoppers singing and talking. The resort is very well maintained and looks as if it has undergone recent renovations. All staff (with the exclusion of the watersport hut staff) is very friendly and hardworking.The food was good for an all-inclusive, comparable to the Club Med in Punta Cana I had been to before. A good variety and the layout of the Windows restaurant makes for easy traffic flow.We enjoyed the beach which had some sea weed due to storms during our stay. We took out one of the Hobie cat sail boat every day and found the watersports staff difficult to deal with. They have three boats, but would only rig two and were reluctant to accept reservations for a half hour sail.The nightly entertainment (Lipsing) was outstanding, especially the dance group which has incredible talents! The Michael Jackson Show seems to have had a technical mishap when we saw it as Michael had no singing voice, just great moves....We had a wonderful time and can wholeheartedly recommend this resort!

<Content>Wonderful Vacation - Hope to Return Next Year This was our third trip to the Punta Cana Grand (PCG). The first two times, in 2004  2005, the property was owned by Sunscape. It is now owned by Globalia. Globalia has made many upgrades to the property that we really enjoyed. They built a new building on the beach - Building 7, which is where we stayed. Our room was 7322, our friends stayed in 7323. We had ocean-front rooms with hot tubs on the balconies and in the room between the sleeping area and bathroom.We had e-mailed manager Caren DeVries before we arrived and she made sure we had ocean-front rooms, DVD players and restaurant reservations made in advance.We arrived at the resort around 11 a.m. and one of our rooms was ready although check-in is not until 3 p.m. The rooms were the nicest of any all-inclusive resort that we have ever stayed: in Mexico - the Iberostar Tucan, IB Pariaso Del Mar and in La Romana - IB Hacienda Dominicus. There were fruit baskets and a bottle of rum sent to each of our rooms. We had bath robes, DVD players, coffee makers, irons and ironing boards, hair dryers, refrigerators stocked with beer, soda, water . There was plenty of closet and storage space for clothes. In addition, you receive up to 20 minutes free internet access daily by staying in this building. The only problem we had is the ice machines did not work and the first day the resort had no hot water in any of the rooms until early evening, after we already took luke-warm showers. The other six days we had no problems with hot water.Globalia has expanded the outside deck for dining at the Beach Grill. The Beach Grill is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner with outdoor dining, right on the beach overlooking the ocean. They have also switched from an ala carte menu at breakfast and lunch to buffets for both. The food was excellent with many choices. In the evening, the dinner menu is ala carte and the steak is excellent. Juan Ramon and Vincent took good care of us here.The second night we ate at the American Grill, which is casual, fun and Tex-Mex cuisine. We reunited with Sergio, our server, who we recognized from the Sunscape. We had excellent service here and returned a second time for dinner.Windows is the main buffet and is opened for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We went for breakfast and Sergio was there to wait on us again. We had excellent food and service here and returned for dinner. We had dinner twice at Da Mario's. The first time the service was slow, but the second time it was perfect. The food is very good, but my husband and I liked the food and menu better at Da Mario's when it was owned by Sunscape. There seemed to be fewer choices and the quantity and quality was not quite as good as previously. The steaks here were excellent though - and this is what the wait staff recommended we order. And the desserts were excellent as well.Of all the pools, we enjoyed the Adult Pool the most and Nicholas, the bartender there (My name is Nicholas and we're opened till we close) was one of our favorite employees.The beach is beautiful and the best maintained of the resorts within walking distance of the PCG. If you walk to the left you can walk for about 1 - 2 miles, past two other resorts and then beautiful, empty beaches which remind us of the movie Castaway.Overall we had an excellent experience here and look forward to returning. We highly recommend this resort.

<Author>travelwith5kids
<Content>5 kids had a blast! We arrived on 2/5/07, and left 2/10/07 with 5 children aged 12,10,8,6,and 4. The main pool was accomodating for them all,. which was very cool for them. Our check-in was very expedient, and our rooms were as we expected. We had asked for ajoining rooms due to the kid factor, but we we in building #4 which was booked for the duration of our stay. This was our first time travelling with the kids, but as a watching parent, I would definitely reccomend this resort for those who are looking for the additional trauma of hauling them along for the ride! All the activities are centered very close to the complex, and allow them to have a blast!. The rooms were very nice, we brought along $500 in fives for tipping, ($1 works, but a 5 is golden!) for room service and for the additional staff.I am in the casino business, and found the table games adequate for play. The cards in use were not what you would expect, but the house rules for blackjack, poker, and roulette is what you should expect in the states. We actually took over a table, me and the wife, making a few hundred bucks in the process, betting $10 a spot x7. I don't know about the slots and how they pay, but tables are OK. Watch out for a ringer at the hold e'm game, he is decent and brings in his bro's for a quick kill. He stayed away from me, knowing my ability, but beware!With 5 kids in tow, we only journeyed out for the outback excursion. Eddie was our guide and he was the Bomb! go for the half day trip, it was long enough for your needs. The main pool fit our children perfect, many times I looked for their location, and nothing sweeter than seeing your kidsplaying volleyball in the pool and seeing your 4 and 6 year-olds sipping on a coke at the swim-up bar!Room service is OK, limited menu, Make reservations for the three restaurants when you check-in for a quality dining experience.Plenty of diversity w/ the crowd, euros and canadians. The hagglers will take 1/3 asking price, just tell them your final and walk away,. It works. They acutally put a purse on my daughter 's arm that I wanted for her, but I put it back, and the vendor came around! 1/3!!! period.. Again, with 5 kids, I would go back. Our parents never did this for us growing up! have a blast, and respond w/ any questions. gnvspot@wctc.net

<Content>Forget it!! Save yourself some time and trouble and forget this place. The food was bland and not much of a selection. The water sports left a lot to be desired, and the sea weed situation makes bathing an unpleasant experience. On a couple of occasions we had to wait hours (lierally) for fresh towels, after they told us a few more minutes each time. The staff tries hard, but the language thing (Spanish vs. anything else) can be an issue at times. And the goods hawkers reminded us of downtown Tijuana. Save your pesos and go to Cancun instead!

<Content>Great resort if you like alot of activies To start I have to say that the service we received from all the staff was as good as any service we have received at a Ritz or Four Seasons Hotel and far surpasses our last stay at the Palm Desert JW.The airport is very nice with it's thatched roof and open feel. They take pictures of you with women in native dress as you arrive. When you depart you can buy these photos at the airport.On arrival at the resort (10pm) we were given a choice of 2 rooms, one was a basic first floor room, the other was on the third floor and was one of the 8 rooms in the resort that looks directly on to the ocean. The ocean view building decor was much nicer and newer. We opted for the additional $100.00 per night and got the incredible view. We enjoyed the room and jacuzzi hot tub on the balcony. 25 minutes of internet time at the internet room is included in the price. The first day I left a note in spanish that we would need lots of bottled water each day and a one dollar bill. That night we had 5 bottles of water. I left a one dollar bill each day after that. We always had plenty of bottled water and the room was cleaned very well each day. One complaint is that the pillows were not very good.The resort is very clean. Maintanence is being done everyday early till late in the evening. My only complaint is that the public toilet facilities tend to always have issues, broken doors, clogged toilets, wet floors and such. It just might be the people that use them. The beach is fabulous. A little seaweed but nothing ridiculous. The ocean bottom is silky soft sand. The water is warm and clear. We found the lounge chairs to be very uncomfortable. You can not lay flat in them. Each time I would doze, I would wake up when my head loped sideways. Take a travel neck pillow and you should be ok. The topless issue is real. When we were there you couldn't not see it. All around the pool and all over the beach there were women in bottoms only. We had no problem with it, but I want you to be aware.The food is fine. At the non reservation restaurant they have such variety that I can not believe you can't find something to eat. Kelvin one of the waiters in the nonsmking section is so friendly and happy that we looked for him each morning. He greeted us with a smile and coffee. We ate at the three reservation restaurants and the only one we would recommend is the Italian.Bring lots of sunblock!!!!! I would be wise to pack bug spray since some people were being bitten. Also I recommend you bring a nice big insulated mug. I wished I had one lots of times.We are a couple in our 50's so like things a little quiet and relaxed. So the constant loud music was too intrusive for us. I felt like we were on a cruise ship. If you want people constantly doing activities and giving lessons this is the place.We both had massages and felt that these were not trained individuals, just people we paid to rub us. So don't bother. Give the money to your honey and have them rub you.I played at the Casino on property each night and had a good time. If you know how to play BJ you can win but do not sit at the tables with other players. I sat at tables where players were splitting 10s and all other crazy moves that are done by the amateurs. The casino will open a new $5 table just for you if you ask. I did and left the place with double my money each night. (I had one dealer that couldn't add and she would never know if she should pay or not so always count your own cards) I'm not sure how she got the job. LOLWe rented a car and drove to Casa de Campo. That was quite the trip. All traffic signals are suggestions only. We were almost wrecked twice by cars going full throttle through their red lights. We were honked at incessantly at red light by drivers behind us wanting us to run the lights. Casa de Campo is gorgeous. I would stay there next time. It is very upscale and quiet. The only issue is that you must get in your vehicle to get to the complex the beach. All in all it was a great vacation and we would most definately go back to DR but to a less noisy resort.

<Content>Best hotel, out of this world!!  I would certainly reccommend this hotel to everyone who would enjoy a luxurious stay at a 5 star hotel!!!! Our family was treated like royalty!! The staff were 100% comitted to making our stay as enjoyable as it could be. I think the manager tries soooo hard to please the guests. They have wonderful games, shows and movies which are played and shown daily. The food there is excellent! They have a number of restaurants of different cultures that offer an excellent variety of food. The rooms were very nice, I definately enjoyed staying in our room, the beds were comfortable, the washroom was kept clean. The maids did a fabulous job. The drinks there were nice. They had nice fruitty flavours, soft drinks and authentic concoctions. You can choose if would like alchohol in your drink or not, for your child's sake. Mentioning your children, they have a place were your kids can stay during the day called the Kids Club, which has a very nice nanny who looks after all the children throughout the day. They go and play in the pool, go inside and play with the lot of toys they have or go and dance with the staff who will show them alot of dances which they will remember. I know I will!!!! They have a tremendous snorkeling trip, where they take you out in the crystal clear ocean, on a nice boat, and will assist you in and out of the water, so you can swim with all the colorful fish which will swim around you. They have parties on wednesdays, thursdays, and on the weekend. There is the manager's cocktail party, where you get to dance with staff or your wife/husband. They have a lovely beach party where they set up tables on the beach, and they also set up a buffet. There is live music, dancing and games to play. I give my full support to this hotel and all the staff that works there. I hope you will take this reccommendation to your own advantage. I also hope you will take a chance on this hotel, because you will not be dissappointed!!! I am definately coming back next year for an extra week!!!!!!!

<Content>Nice place to stay After reading all reviews I did too had some doubts regarding the hotel and the grounds, but to my pleasure it was real nice place. The grounds are well kept and they are making all kinds of renovations to the place, so its kind of busy and noisy at times, but the end result will be GREAT. The Food is good, and will introduce you to some of the local food. but there are 3 choices (need to reserve) to have dinner at different venues. The beach is not too deep, but it has some seaweed washed in the AM. but the cleaning crew always take care of that, this is a good place to take a long walk if you like, Not a place to go if you are the kind that likes to see the local culture, the hotel is isolated from the bavaro town and public transportation is scarce. Also if you are the kind that gets tickle out by people speaking anything but english at your side (not me I do speak Fluent Spanish), this hotel has an appeal for Canadians and Spain nationals. in short ... you wont regret your stay there.

<Content>Wonderful Week at Punta Cana Grand My sister and I left our husbands at home in the snow and enjoyed the last week of January at Punta Cana Grand. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed ourselves. Everything from the beautiful grounds, the beach, the food and especially the staff was beyond any expectations we might have had. Our room was large and spacious and kept very clean by the housekeeping staff. The beach was beautiful and the water warm and yes there was seaweed but it was easy to just walk out into the ocean beyond it (staff were constantly raking it up)People did reserve beach chairs by putting towels on them and so did we....but there were always empty chairs...sometimes just single ones here and there but they were easily moved.The food was excellent and the beach party was our favourite evening. I can't believe how much work the staff does for their guests and all with a smile. We are already planning next year's visit....oh....we did see a little mouse....he was living in a wicker pot on the outside deck of the Beach Garden cafe and would come out now and then to nibble crumbs that had fallen. All in all a dream vacation...Penny....Ontario Canada

<Content>Globalia Punta Cana Grand was just OK My mother and I just returned from a week at the Globalia Punta Cana Grand. The travel agent at Apple Vacations recommended it to us because it fit within our budget of $1100 per person for a week. This was our 5th trip to the Dominican so we are very familiar with the way the all inlcusive resorts are run. I must say I was a little dissapointed. I had read all of the reviews, some terrible and some were encouraging. I believe the reason for the broad spectrum of reveiws must be because people have very different standards. Apple rated this a 5 apple and I definately disagree and would have rated it a 4 apple. The check in was quick and easy although the front desk employees were not overly friendly. the bell hop took us to a room that smelled moldy and the very small bathroom was very old and had a chipped sink, broken toilet seat and had mold in the grouting of the floor and walls. After a few minutes in the room we returned to the front desk and said the room was unacceptable and that my mother fell off the broken toilet seat. They moved us to a room that was much newer and nicer and quite acceptable, although the view was awful. You looked directly at a tin roof of a smaller building. we had asked for building #7 which is what the reviews said you should do, but they told us it would be an additional $50 a day for building #7. The maid service was excellent.The biggest thing that stood out to us the entire week was the fact that this was a very old resort that needed a lot of updating. the food at the main buffet was overall good although the food at the beach resturant was awful. We were always able to find somehting we liked at the main buffett and the wait staff was very accomodating. We did see a little rodent twice, once in the diningroom and once in the theater. I am not sure if it was a mouse or small rat, but it definately freaked us out. The seaweed that I read about was also an issue but it was not only at the Globalia it was at the Allegro and Natura Park and that entire little stirp. We walked the beach each day and I noticed it was infront of all three resorts. The maintainence guys did a great job of cleaning it up all day with rakes and removing it with wheel barrows. The entertainment was what I had experienced at all the other resorts but some of the games had too much of a sexual overtone to it and I was a bit offended and embarrassed at times. I guess I am somewhat of a prude and I was with my 76 year old mother. the drinks were awful - very poor selection, no vodka, whiskey or gin, just rum, beer and wine and the pina colodas and frozen daquries were watered down and syrupy sweet. Overall it was Ok but I think you get what you pay for and although it wasn't horrible for $1100 a week, next time I will pay an additional $400 and go back to the Iberostar or somewhere a little more upscale.

<Content>its an okay resort I just got back from this resort its nice,but the beach is horrible they have to change the pics on there site.There was a public beach 100 yards from the hotel and it was immaculate.I would get up be up around 10am and there is no way to find a beach chairs you have to do it early people would just get up run to the beach stick there towel on the chair and leave to eat or hang out at the pool and during that time they would have there chair saved on the beach.Thats ----,I was there for 2 weeks and it was the same all the time.The pool is nice and if you like to drink in the afternoon and be drunk this is the place for u.cause at night around 10 pm its a ghost town everyones asleep.The staff was great very attentive towards their guests bring dollars to tip them and they will love trust me they make no money at all so $1 would make there day.The food was very good especially dinner it was great.The rooms were not that good the ac was so loud it was hard to sleep with it on they mention there is cable its a hit or miss i got no cable some were complaining that they could not shower cause there would be no water.I would not go back to this resort again.

<Content>Upgrade to Building #7 Room: There are only six ocean-view rooms with TWO jacuzzies. The asking price was extra $50/night. Negotiate and tip the guy at the front desk to get a better deal. Ask for free Internet with the room upgrade.Room Service: 24/7, nice selection, pretty fast. Use it.Food: good selection of mediocre food. The food at the specialty restaurants was a lot better. You need to make reservations a few days in advance. Da Mario was wonderful. Beach: very nice and clean. Some seaweed in the morning but the staff tries to clean it up.Pools: get there early to get a good spot. Adult pool by building #7 was nice and quite.Casino: Nothing special. Watch out for the $2/5 NL Poker game. I saw the same people not staying at the resort play all the time. Staff: very friendly and helpful. Tip right and you鈥檒l get anything.Entertainment: don鈥檛 miss the Michael Jackson and the Dominican shows. They were great.Shopping: the shops don鈥檛 belong to the hotel. The owners are very aggressive. Better to stay away. After five days of negotiation I bought a paining for 20% of the original asking price. So bargain.Nigh life: not much going on but who cares if you got a jacuzzi on your balcony:)

<Content>Great Vacation This was our very first time in Punta Cana. My friend and I had a fantastic time. We were at the Punta Cana Grand from Jan 16 until Jan 23. Our accomadations were excellent, check in as you are told is at 3:30 and the room was clean and very spacious. As for the restaurants there are two buffet restaurants available as well as three a la carte restaurants. Make your reservations when you arrive at the front desk to guarantee an evening. The weather was hot during the day and the evenings were cooler but very comfortable. The beach is beautiful, the sand is white, the water is warm and yes there is seaweed but thats nature and it was spectacular. You can walk the beach and feel safe. The vendors do come up to you and ask to come and see their shop, just be friendly say OLA and if you want to go and see what they have to offer make them happy. There is no harm in looking. The people and staff at the Punta Cana Grand are extremely friendly and accomodating. They are always smiling and available if you need anything. The waiters and bartenders are fantastic, even though english is not their first language they really attempt to make themselves understood. The beauty of vacation is to learn and communicating with these people and getting to know them is what makes our travels so memorable. The ANIMATION staff was excellent. What a great group of people. Their goal is to entertain and they do that indeed. From 9 til 12 they are there to make you laugh and enjoy yourself through activites and games. We really had a good time. We would like to thank Mike, Willy, Anthony, Santos and the girls of the group for making our trip great. Travel with an open mind and if you are friendly and appreciate culture your experience at the Punta Cana Grand will be as fantastic as ours was.

<Content>Faboulous Vacation Will Be Back Next Year Ontario Canada What ever you do don't beleive the negetive reviews you see about this hotel. We just returned from a weeks stay there and it was more then I had never expected. Me and my husband have done alot of traveling and this hotel is in our top pick. Our age range is 30 - 35 and they had so many activites for all ages. The beach was beautiful ( great snorkeling). The staff was more then friendly they were great all around, The food was good so much to choose from in the buffet resturant, the specialty resturants were amazing. The rooms were good not a huge isse for me because we were never in there. But very clean and roomy. And altough I didn't take my son I watched the girls in charge of the kids club and I was blown away with how good they are with all the kids they were watching. I have never seen anything like it. They were just amazing. And the best thing is the kids enojyed them just as much. I would more then trust them with my 3 year old completly.Overall all I would definalty reccommed this hotel to anyone, we had a great time there and will return next year. Oh ya the weather awesome. ENJOY

<Content>Upgrade to Building #7!!! We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks. Upon return, we were curious to read other peoples reviews and were very surprised to see low ratings and negative comments about the food.The hotel is great and although we are pretty picky eaters, we had so much choice that we couldnt even try everything. The buffet was great with a lot of excellent choices. We had the Romantic Dinner on the beach (for an extra charge) and it was marvellous. Personalized service with a candlelight dinner. Every couple should indulge - it is such a romantic experience!My biggest piece of advice would be upgrading to a room in Building #7. It is like a completely different vacation - gorgeous room with marble floors and a Jacuzzi inside the room. When we arrived and inquired about the pricing for the upgrade, we were told it would be $40/night. After negotiating with the clerk at reception, we were able to reduce it to $20/night!! We also asked for lower prices at the spa, and got significant discounts. The spa is great - clean, with beautiful facilities.The service wasnt always amazing, but you have to remember that the staff works crazy hours in an incredible heat. Everyone is human and for the mere pennies that they get paid, I think that they exceed expectations.

<Content>Love the People March /April 2006 the Punta Cana Grand 4-4.5 star resort. I don鈥檛 know where to begin 鈥︹€?.this trip did wonders for me, I needed to get away. I was unsure about going and I did not want to pay the amount that I paid but apparently upon my return I got a really good deal and I CERTAINLY got my money $$$ worth. O yeah we went back again in JUnE2006. There are two things that I express to my friends before going on this trip. I NEED to be in a nice hotel and have GOOD FOOD! THE GROUNDS 鈥?talk about clean!!!! When you see people raking the beaches and wiping the garbage cans. BEACH- AMAZING I loved it. The white sand was soft on your feet you could hardly feel that you were walking on sand. ACCOMODATION- The room was spacious exactly what is in the travel brochures. The room was clean and was clean daily. The beds we made daily and fridge stock daily even thought we didn鈥檛 use anything in the fridge. FOOD- Man, Man the food was AMAZING. Words CAN NOT express how good the food was. Put it this was I put on 6 pounds so what does that tell you , I ate 2 plates at the time because I was not sure we would gte to try it again . There buffet change themes everyday and there were some different food so I have to eat everything at the same time. Breakfast was the one meal take pride in when I am at home but the breakfast at home does not compare. We would go out to the club and get home at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning and breakfast is served until 10:30 and we would set the alarm for 10:00 rushing to shower and get dress just to get breakfast. We look forward to lunch (our Dominican Markham Station - only if your from Scarborough/Toronto, Ontario you know about Markham Station) and dinner. I have to say I haven鈥檛 eaten 3 meals a day since I have been on my own for the last 9 years so you must know that this was like heaven LOL.  STAFF- was courteous and polite. It was hard to communicate with housekeeping but I I stuck with 鈥淥la鈥?that works. They were friendly made you feel like you at home. Victor in the Di Mario鈥檚 A La Carte, Oswaldo and Humberto from the Tex Mex American Grille are our new friends. Front desk staff Siris - o my we gave them a hard time in a loving way but they were so accommodating. Paco was great he got us what we wanted. The Bell Guys 鈥?Mr. Baseball Some other front desk we so by the book but I guest they are really doing there job but hey you just have to find they right person and at the en of the day it is who you know. And of coure the head Honshu herself KAREN 鈥?you are the best and we miss you. POOL- Clean - had so much fun. I was looking forward to being on the bridge from when I saw it in the travel brochures. Love the swim up bar the staff at the bar was great. Travellers : Anesha , Martha , Latoya , Kixxs, Justis

<Content>Martin Luther King Day Prolonged Weekend We enjoyed our stay at the Punta Cana Grand.We were a group of 10 guys, ranging in age from 42 to 78 who go on an annual soire to various resorts , on Martin Luther king weekend (5 days) for 25 years. We are a very diversified group. A Judge, college professor, plumber, stockbroker, etc.The hotel facilities were very nice. Excelent layout, clean rooms, adequate food. A great deal for the money. $1,000 for the entire package. 4nights, five days, round trip from Kennedy.The food at all these all inclusives is good , not great. I call it Diner Food. Nothing wrong with that as long as that is what you expect.This was our first trip to Punta Cana, recommended by our travel agent, Reko Tours. The one problem was service. We are generous tippers and hand out dollar bills very freely. That usually is magic at most resorts. Here, no waiter service at the pool. The staff seem to be confounded at out tipping. In Boca Chica we have a trail of staff following us.In summary, I would recommend this hotel. For the $$$ it's a great deal.Newt, the Judge.

<Content>Stay Away We were bumped here from Catalonia because they overbooked.... this place is small, cramped, the view from your balcony is the building across from you. The toiletries left in the room looked like they'd been used (1/2 full), the bed was not that comfortable, towels were like sandpaper, beach towels smelled like PEE. The staff made PLENTY of inappropriate comments to our group (5 women) in english and in spanish. To top our tip off MY CELL PHONE WAS STOLEN FROM MY ROOM.....I had a brand new palm smartphone(gift) that had NO service in DR so I left it in the room....it was taken from the room. The hotel has yet to get back to me about the theft.

<Content>In One Word "Great" - Ontario, Canada Just got back from Punta Cana Grand Jan. 17-24! Weather, resort, food, people was great! Booked through Nolitours, great travel agent to deal with - great service! I had read and read dozen of reviews of this hotel and by the time I left on my holiday, I was a little nervous if we had chosen the right one? Our flight was smooth, our arrived time was perfect, transfer from the airport to the Grand was short, got to the Grand had to wait for l/2 hour for our room, but we told we could go have lunch, enjoy the pool, whatever until room was ready - good service! They were right, we got our room key in l/2 hour, room was clean, bright, nice view! All the food spots were good, Windows the buffet was great, no problem with the food. We were careful what we ate, just like at home! The beach was a wee weedy but we did survive, walked down along the beach, you can walk for miles, stop where ever and put your feet in, the water was very warm! The weather was perfect - 80-85 every day, a few clouds, no stucky stuff like we get in Ontario! Now the only thing that was a little weird for me, keep in mind I am a 51 year old woman, have seen better days, two kids, my husband 53, great guy, we are normal everyday hard working, average and I mean average people, the topless thing going on was again weird.By the end of the holiday, we were accustom to the sites! The grounds were well kept, people cleaning, trimming all the time. I can't say enough, I loved it, I go back tomorrow if I could! My husband and I are not travellers of the world, but I would recommend this spot to anyone!

<Content>I wouldn't stay here.... Well after being bumped from our hotel to this place, we were very disappointed. We spent a month researching where we wanted to stay and we definitely didn't want this one. But low and behold, we were here and not by choice. Our room was not made when we got there. The bed wasn't made. The shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were half full. The a/c didn't work. The tv was maybe 13 with a broken remote. We mentioned these things to front desk, but they looked disinterested. Then every day, we would never have enough towels. Speaking of the towels, most of the beach towels were stained. Some even smelled as if they weren't washed. We hoped the food was decent. But it wasn't. I didn't know that you could screw up breakfast, but this place did. When trying to explain eggs over easy, they didn't understand. Thank goodness for cereal. The lunch was really awful. I don't think there was one thing I can say was actually good. Dinner, make a reservation at the Italian restaurant. But be prepared, what it says on the menu does not mean that is what you will get. So glad to be back in the states and just get a slice of pizza, which tasted better than anything they served. As for the service, if you like having ice thrown into your cleavage and then they talk about your boobs by a bartender. Or a cleaning woman banging on the bathroom door as your trying to go to the bathroom. Or being called a -------- by a shop (the ones by the front desk) owner cause I wouldn't go in. And the list goes on. Did I mention, no one seems to use the disco, casino, theater or piano bar. Don't stay here!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Loved it! My husband and I stayed at Globalia PCG in November for 3 nights. We loved it. We got upgraded upon check in because my husband new one of the guys working at the front desk which always helps i guess. So we got to stay in an incredible suite. Pools: We liked that fact that there were a few different pools to choose from. We spent a little bit of time at the main pool and enjoyed the swim up bar and music they had on constantly. But it was nice that if you wanted to go to have a more quieter, priviate time you could do that too. One of the pools is no kids aloud which is sometimes nice if you don't have kids. Another one of the pools off to the side (was right infront of our building) and was nice and quiet. Just depends on what your looking for. Entertainment: We thought that the animators did a very good job. We only saw two shows, one was a funny auidence participation and another was a domincan or tropical show. The dancers weren't very good, but it was nice to watch just the same. On the dominican night they had a small live domincan band playing the drums and accordian infront of the bar near the pool at night. We really enjoyed sitting and listening and dancing to their music. There is a lot to do at this resort. We are not really into gambling but went and checked out the new casino and thought it was beautiful. Restuarants: We ate at the main buffet for breakfast and enjoyed their selection and fresh juices every morning. We normally had lunch at the restaurant on the beach. Not too much to choose from but a nice change of atmosphere. We went one night to the American Grill i think it was called. It was kind of what i thought of a western place boarder line Mexican. they served Fajaitas and things of that sort. But it was quite good also. The buffet also had lots to choose from for dinner.We really really enjoyed this hotel and would reccommend it to anyone and everyone. Lots to do there for every age group.

<Content>Punta Cana Grand is not that grand.... This was to be a special trip because we were bringing our nieces with us (11, 14 and 16 years old). So it had to be prepared in advance. So we booked with Sunwing with a travel agent in August for a Dec 30th departure for 1 week vacation. Because we have no kids, we never book at that time of the year or during the high season, so we were prepared for it to be very busy. On the day of departure at the airport, we went trough the VIP line (no wait) because we had booked the priviledge package for an additional cost and that was appreciated. Before we left, we had asked for 2 rooms attached to each other with a specific request for certain type of beds and that is what we got. It also went pretty fast. We arrived at the hotel at around noon and got one of the room at 12:30. The second room was available only later that day, but that was not a problem, at least we had the first one. This complex is very small compare to many hotels I've been in Punta Cana. So for a couple with kids, it was perfect. We always knew pretty much where the kids where at all time. If we did not, it would take us only a couple of minutes to find them. Also, the builing we where in was no 4. We where 2 minutes from anywhere, the beach, the pools (2 for all, 1 for adults), the buffet, the restaurants and the lobby. And that part was great. In general, even if this was a very busy time, we never really waited for anything, and never felt that we were packed like sardines and that was a relief.But lets talk about what was not: Yes this place is small (about 400 rooms very close to each other), so great for famillies, but if you like to walk around for more than 15 minutes, forget it. Also, the way the builings are made, very long corridors with all the doors to your room inside, there is a lot of echo. So if somebody pass by, or snores, or just talk somewhere in that corridor you hear it. Also because our rooms were very close to one of the retaurant, all the carts (made of metal) coming and going, where very noisy at all time, very early in the morning and very late at night. Because we were there for the Dec 31st celebration a lot of partying was also going on and that is understandable, but we had the misfortune to be close to a private party offered by the hotel owners' Globalia' to its directors. During that special party(Dec 31st), the very loud music was played till 4 am. We did call to complain many time to a least lower the music a bit, so we could sleep, but nothing really happened. The 3rd time I called at 3 oclock in the morning, the poor guy taking the calls told me that he could not do anything because it was his bosses having the party! I did make an official complaint the morning after, and got 2 baskets of fruits with their appologies, that we did accept. But again 2 days after the party, twice we had problems with noise at night. But this time It was fixed within the hour.As for the food, it was very average. and many time in the morning, there was no more glasses, orange juice or plates left. This was a very slow buffet. The kids where very fussy and ate pretty much the same thing every day. No big adventurers here. I on the other hand ate pretty much anything and it was not too bad. But nobody got sick or burned and the girls had a blast. It was their first trip to the Carribbean and they loved it. I on the other hand been here too often and have seen better hotels. But one thing cannot be beaten, the white beautiful beaches with the palm trees. This is one of the reason we came here. It is safe, beautiful and not too far from home (less than a 4 hour flight), and the people at the hotel pretty friendly.All and all, this was pretty much an very average trip for us. Only the kids really made it special. Globalia Punta Cana Grand is not the best but not the worst hotel we have been. If you are a couple with kids, go for it , if you are a couple with no kids, go but ask to have a room far from building no 4, if you want a little peace and quiet. If you do have a little more money to splurge go for builing no 7 which are masters suites and much more intimate and private. The construction of that building seem to be a little different from the others and of better quality. Maybe this would have been a better vacation if not for Building no 4.....

<Content>do not accept free stay voucher we booked a group trip of 9 thru signature vacations.when we landed in punta cana we were told the punta cana grand had over booked. it could not take us. There was 70 of us all together. They had made arrangements for the Catalonia to take us. The catalonia was wonderful...but the Punta Cana Grand offered us all a voucher for a free stay with them that was good until may 2007. ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS VOUCHER....IT IS WORTHLESS. THE PUNTA CANA GRAND HAS BEEN PHONED LONG DISTANCE 4 TIMES TRYING TO BOOK THIS FREE WEEK. EVERY TIME THEY TELL US ..THEY ARE BOOKED. DO NOT ACCEPT A FREE STAY VOUCHER FROM THE PUNTA CANA GRAND AS COMPENSATION. IT IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT WAS PRINTED ON.

<Content>Punta Cana Grand by Globalia First off, when you take a cab, make sure you use the brand Globalia, the Allegro Punta Cana Grand is right next door, and by mistake was taken there, if it wasn't for a quick look at TripAdvsior.com before my flight, I would not have remember the name Globalia. Anyways, the entrance is very nice, marble floor with two spiral staircases that lead up to a nice piano bar. The room is what i expected, simple. TV, coffee maker, balcony with garden view, etc. No problems at all with the room, but I have been to DR before so I know not to expect gradois rooms. There were three seperate pools I beleive, one the main pool was very large and very crowded, but their were also two other pools hidden around the resort and it was a nice touch. The beach is covered with palm trees and lounge chairs which was fantastic. The one main observation was that there was a lack of peddlers roaming the beach. There were three small shacks on the beach that sold the usual, shirts and paintings. the resorts also hosted their own small line of shops which was quite different from what I have seen on my previous trips. New movies played every night and of course they had in house entertainment. The food is always good, so I won't elaborate, overall very nice, and would recommend defiently.

<Content>Globalia was a Global Disaster!!!!! This was the absolute worst vacation of my life. Let me start off by saying that it was bad from beginning to end. Our front desk service person was in a hurry to get us out of his way when we first checked in. We entered our room and there were ants all over the bathroom sink. The tub was dingy and the housekeepers were hesitant to clean it again. They acted as if we were bothering them the whole entire weekend. The service at the restaurants was awful. Hardly anyone spoke English so we felt isolated and could never get anyone to understand our needs and requests. The food at all four restaurants was prison slop. Everyday when we went to a buffet, we saw the same leftovers from the previous day. We actually saw hair all over the french toast one morning and the employees had an attitude when we told them about it. The beach was not clean; there was seaweed everywhere and the sand was philthy.The only part of this resort that was nice was the spa and entertainment. They presented a Michael Jackson impersonator who was excellent.

<Content>You need a really good attitude to make this work... I stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from January 11th to the 16th with my husband and was thoroughly disappointed. I don't consider myself a particularly picky traveler but the place was at it's best mediocre and at it's worse just plain bad. Here's the negative: -Housekeeping was spotty. Some days I got a full set of towels, some days not. When I used the coffee maker in the room, it was often not cleaned. As an aside, the water in the shower was rarely hot. Be ready for some cool showers.-Food was bad (other than the desserts). It was nearly impossible to get a hot cup of coffee in the mornings. Usually it was warm or lukewarm. The traditional Dominican dishes served were not made well. The a la carte restaurants were not very good either. I ordered Beef medallions at Da Mario's and was served a big slab of beef. Aren't beef medallions small cuts of beef? It was hit or miss with the beach food as well. I often got a hamburger that was burned on the outside and red on the inside.-The grounds were not well kept. No one came around during the day to pick up cups and plates from the pool and beach. This is probably why I saw cups floating in the adult pool section and styrofoam plates on the beach during a night stroll.-Prepare to fight your way for a spot on the beach or by the main pool. You have to get up very early in the morning if you would like a spot with a shaded cabana. Like before 8AM early since people take them nearly at the crack of dawn. Also, you have to get tickets to receive beach towels by the pool or exchange your towels at the towel stand. There were shortages of towels and my husband and I had our towels stolen twice in one day at the main pool. You're better off by the adult pool by Building 7.-Avoid the spa. My husband and I got massages that were little more than someone rubbing oil on our backs. These were not massages at all.-Don't bother to call the front desk with problems. You have to go down there in person. They rarely answered the phone or the phone rang for a long time before someone answered.-Staff is not really bilingual.The positive:-We were locked out of our rooms because the battery went out on the card lock on the first night there. The staff resolved the issue pretty quickly.-There are no roaches or rodents in the rooms.-Some of the staff was cordial and helpful. -The nightly entertainment (shows) were pretty entertaining. I really enjoyed The Dominican Show.-The desserts were quite good. Overall, I would not reccommend this place and I wouldn't go back.

<Content>College Winter Break Just returned from trip Jan. 4-11. Traveled w/husband and 20-yr. old daughter and her college roommate. Not sure what to expect after reading mixed reviews, but here's what we experienced.Check-in: Arrived about 3:30 and room was not ready. We were greeted with drinks and directed to the buffet. We came back about 1/2 hr. later and room was ready and bellhop took our bags to our rooms.Rooms: We were assigned to 2 rooms in Bldg. 2. Rooms were clean, but sheets were not the new; a little threadbare. After tipping the maid the next day, she put new sheets on the bed, rugs on the tile floors, and flowers in our bathrooms! She was an absolute doll who worked very hard and very long hours. Our Apple rep told us the average wage the workers make is only about $100/month. So sad. Beach: Clean but small. You could walk for miles along the shore though, so no problem. White sand and so beautiful. Resort needs to add more lounge chairs, though. Ran out quickly if you did not claim yours early in the a.m.Staff: Very friendly, never encountered a rude or surly person at all. Our girls quickly made friends with many of the younger staff and had a lot of fun at the disco at night and during the various games during the day. The staff had yoga, aerobics, water aerobics, volleyball, games, etc. scheduled during the day, along with a movie, and a big show every night at 9:30 p.m. The shows were very good....one night it was a magician, dominician dance shows, lip sync dance show, etc. Very entertaining.Food: Not very impressed with the two speciality restaurants; the Da Mario Italian and the Beaches but the American Grill, which was a Tex Mex was very good. the Windows Restaurant was the buffet and you could always find something good. Overall, it was a fun time for the girls during semester break so they could work on their tans and relax before heading back to school. The resort was clean, food was good, staff was fun and pleasant, and we had a nice time.

<Content>Sucks Rooms suck. Broken Beds. Inoperative lights in rooms. Bad Front Desk help. Extra charges not explained. Such as 2.50 charge each time you make credit card call home. If you slip on the WET MARBLE STEPS when rains. you are responsable for all medical cost. NOT THEM! The resterants you need to make resavations for at dinner are very slow. Average 1.5 hr to order and recieve your food. Lot of pepople got mad and left after waiting 1 hour. Buffet is best place to eat and get out in reasonasble time. food is OK. But could be better. Beache is beautil, But lot of seaweed. they do rake in up every couple of hours off sand. Most staff is very frendly, But language concerns is still a set back

<Content>Not exactly as illustrated The two main problems:1. Food - I was sick from the food Dec 26 through 29th, 2006;2. Beach - Too small and crowded for the number of people. Approximately 200 meters wide - which sounds big until you see how many people they cram onto this area. There were fights on the beach over the lounge chairs. Have a look at the beach photos supplied here in TripAdvisor - You don't see the small roped-off swimming area, outside of which you risk being run over by power boats pulling tubes etc. The stink of the gas exhaust from all the power boats wafts over the beach all day long. Everyone had to sit within 4 feet of the next group of tourists on the beach - Kinda like being at a mall just before Xmas. The beach is not as depicted in the photos at all.I'm careful about the food I consume especially when travelling - I'm a vegetarian for starters. That means when travelling I eat vegetables, rice, eggs, bread. I never consume anything new and I don't eat spicy food. If I get sick, there's a problem with the food. (What can they do to boiled potatoes, eggs?) By the way, I was not the only person sick during that period. Two kids in Building 3 were sick too.The room and associated amenties were not deluxe. I paid for what is described as a deluxe room in a 4plus star hotel. The view from the room of the building next door was not inpiring. The electrical shock I received from the table lamp kept me alert. The 6 small jets coming out of the clogged shower head made me glad I was not in a hurry to shower. No tissue in the room etc. Not all of this concerning the room is really serious (except the lamp) because I don't go down south to spend time in a hotel room, so as long as the place is clean, I'm usually OK. However, the building I was in (Building 3) was extremely noisy all night. Not just because of the other guests - they were doing some work on the plumbing or whatever (one half day there was no water in the building).Conquest Tours misrepresented this hotel.

<Content>The worst vacation ever!!! First let me state that this is my 8th. vacation in the Caribbean, but 1st time in Dominican Rep. with Apple vacation. I traveled with my wife and two kids 12 and 11. We all had high expectations for a relaxing week and decent weather.On arrival at the hotel I asked for a quiet area since my kids were tired 3:00 am. wake up for the flight. We were placed in a room literally next to a beach party with the band playing a max vol. past midnight. The room was small, old furniture, shower did not work, and water leaked from the ceiling in the bathroom. I asked to be moved to another room in am. The room was only marginally better next to a bar with music playing past midnight alternating with rowdy screaming in variety of different languages. THIS IS NOT A RESORT FOR FAMILIES LOOKING TO RELAX! It is more suited for couples and singles. None of us could sleep and my kids could not wait to leave. The final straw was when my daughter got sick either from water or the food. We were booked for 8 day stay, we left 4 days after arrival on the only flight that day into St Louis and paid for the additional flight into Chicago.The food was abundant but mediocre in quality except for the fresh fruit. There was constant shortage of utensils, clean plates, service was OK. Most memorable was the seafood dinner serving what was clearly rancid shrimp. Cleanliness also an issue at some of the outdoor buffets.The grounds were nice and generally well maintained, beach was clean but crowded, towels were in short supply at certain times of day. European topless attire at the pool and beach may be an issue for you.Staff tried to be helpful but because of the max capacity (winter vacation) could not be very accomodating. Prices were another nuisance, phone calls locally were outrageously expensive 27.00 dol.for 30 min. Sunscreen lotion 25.00 dollars for small tube etc. Needless to say I will never go near this resort again, this may have been an exception to the generally positive experience expressed by others but I am glad that there is a forum such as this one to tell others what to expect. We are not spoiled travelers who expect only the best, I do understand this is a 3rd. world country with a different standard of living but we have traveled extensively in central Amer.and Asia and this trip was a huge disapointment.

<Content>Get With It Globalia!!! Review for Punta Cana GrandTHE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLYWe traveled with the author of the true review and I may have more to add but basically dido her review!!!! My husband and I are frequent travelers - Mexico, Cuba, Panama, Europe and now Dominican!!! So please don't think I'm a first time traveler dissing an all-inclusive resort! Before traveling to Punta Cana we read the reviews and laughed at those that nitpicked minor details 鈥?until we experienced the same minor details 鈥?the fact is several small things start to add up and definitely cause frustration.We traveled with SUNWING鈥on鈥檛 BOOK WITH THEM EVER. They have terrible security 鈥?a couple fighting as we landed were disrupting the entire plane, the lady pulled her top up, tried jumping over seats, and mouthed profanities with children aboard 鈥?FLIGHT ATTENDANTS DIDN鈥橳 DO A THING. They barely tried to stop her from lighting a cigarette on the steps of the plane鈥ello jet fuel!!! Once off the steps she began beating her mate 鈥?no one did a thing!! Security actually found it to be quite amusing 鈥?now that鈥檚 safety for you!!The return flight was safer 鈥?no crazy domestics 鈥?but they didn鈥檛 have enough pillows or blankets and were very inconsistent in offering drinks. The airline also BUSTED the wheel off my luggage and didn鈥檛 bother returning ANY phone calls or emails in regards to this!! The rep at our resort was a SUNWING employee (Luis) 鈥?so it pretty much explained why you could never find him!! They obviously hire whoever walks in the door and provide little to no training! FOOD: While evening meals were definitely edible and sometimes enjoyable the wrath of the after effects makes me ill just thinking about it. Buffet sucks for breakfast and lunch鈥sually left overs from the night before鈥akes me gag thinking about it!!!! ROOM SERVICE: What a joke鈥ou call and if they understand you 鈥?your order may be delivered in 2 鈥?3 hours!!! THAT IS NOT AN OVEREXAGGERATION!!!PLEASE KEEP IN MIND...this is a review about the Punta Cana Grand not PUNTA CANA!!! I absolutely love the beach, weather and people (bar, waitstaff and housekeeping ONLY). RESORT: gorgeous - great pools - adult pool was way too boring, no music and the water was extremely warm. The main pool was enjoyable but I wouldn't stay near the pool bar for too long - at times it was warmer there than in the Jacuzzi - GROSS!!!The restaurants were also very nice 鈥?food wasn鈥檛 great, but to be expected I guess.The resort is REALLY clean, beautiful grounds and spotless!! HOUSEKEEPING: Angela was the BEST!!! Our room was spotless, she even checked in on our ill friend to see how she was feeling 鈥?WE LOVE HER!!!CIGAR LOUNGE: awesome spot to relax with great staff and drinks!! We love Rudy  Benjamin 鈥?YOU GUYS ROCK!! Karaoke was also fun, however, it was supposed to run Saturday  Wednesday 鈥?Saturday was a no go because the machine didn鈥檛 work 鈥?go figure!! The Wednesday Karaoke was a ton of fun but didn鈥檛 last long enough :o)DISCO: Was what you made it to be!! We had a blast, as the DJ was quick to play any tune you requested. Out of all the resorts we鈥檝e traveled to we had the most fun at this Disco!! Benjamin even tried to teach me his moves..LOLSWIM UP BAR: Nice feature but as mentioned earlier 鈥?try not to stick around that area, I didn鈥檛 see one person make a move to use a restroom :o( Juan the bartender always has a smile and he was super sweet!WATERSPORTS: available, free of charge and my cousin enjoyed the kayaking. We missed the catamaran lessons because they were only once a day at 9:30 am - I guess they had to spend the rest of the day hitting on every single woman with a heartbeat.SHOPPING: Don't be fooled by all the scammers on the beach, don't listen to their sob stories and definitely don't pay their asking price they punch crazy figures into their STUPID calculators and promise it is a deal - whatever. We paid $60 from the original price of $170!!! BARGAIN, BARGAIN, BARGAIN because it's all useless junk they swear is genuine to the Dominican - half of the junk broke when we got home!TOURS/DAY TRIPS: There are a ton of excursions available, although quite pricey in comparison to other holidays and as mentioned before LUIS our Sunwing rep was NEVER available to book or discuss these day trips!! I only saw him once when he was able to locate our friends (hospital) 鈥?which we were thankful for, but still he really should be MORE visible and AVAILABLE for all the problems we had to work through 鈥?especially since he told each of us his schedule and that he was always available.NIGHTLY ENTERTAINMENT: We went to two shows 鈥?they were fun 鈥?Saturday is Michael Jackson night 鈥?great job!!! Check this show out! And for those who love to get involved check out the 鈥淎nything Can Happen Night鈥?I participated in the 鈥淢s. Punta Cana Grand鈥?contest 鈥?absolutely hilarious!!We also took a bus (supposed to have a shuttle every 20 minutes 鈥?yeah right) to Catalonia Resort to visit their Casino!! STAY HERE IF YOU ARE GOING!!! This place was so beautiful!!! The Casino took our $50 quick, no big deal 鈥?we had fun :o)ACTIVITIES = BUST!!! What was the purpose of having an entertainment team if they can't even get an activity going!!! Thank God for my cousin who rallied at the microphone to get the guests involved 鈥?they were all waiting for Entertainment, they would have still been sitting waiting if he hadn鈥檛 been proactive in organizing some games!! And what鈥檚 with the idle trampoline lying face down on the beach!!!?? I was excited to see it on the beach although it was never used and when you asked about it they shrugged you off. I was also disappointed one afternoon when my husband jumped in the pool and lost his sunglasses. I searched the whole pool, filters and all. Two lovely ladies sitting poolside informed me that they were placed at the side of the pool and Entertainment Staff picked them up. Only when I asked nobody had a clue 鈥?until the one staff member 鈥淛ason鈥?pulled them out of his fanny pack 鈥?QUICK FINGERS!!! FRONT DESK STAFF: DON鈥橳 GO TO FRONT DESK, DON鈥橳 CALL FRONT DESK 鈥?THEY DON鈥橳 CARE!!!!! They are truly the most ignorant, unorganized, carefree (not in a good way) staff I have ever seen!!! We had charges to our room that didn鈥檛 even make sense 鈥?I didn鈥檛 pay either because it was a total SCAM!! They charged me $5 for the Internet for one hour and they charged my cousin $5 for 20 minutes??? Front desk couldn鈥檛 even program our room key correctly, or send maintenance to have our toilet fixed 鈥?VERY DISAPPOINTING. The toilet and room key issue sound so minor but let me tell you it was EXTREMELY frustrating and a true nuisance! We had to enter through our friend鈥檚 room because NOONE came to fix this issue after at least SIX 鈥?TEN REQUESTS 鈥?both in person and over the phone!! The woman concierge even walked up to our room to witness that it was not working 鈥?AND STILL NOTHING!!! The toilet 鈥?URGH!!!!CONCIERGE: To the TALL DARK MAN working 鈥渃oncierge鈥?鈥?what a joke 鈥?I hope you were happy making me cry in the lobby!!!! VERY shocked at the way you treated people...what a disappointment! GLOBALIA GET WITH IT!!! Looks like you鈥檙e running this resort into the ground!! IN CLOSING, please treat the wait staff, housekeeping and bartenders well 鈥?TIP!!! They earn very minimal for the hours they put in!!! They treat you like Gold and are very appreciative :o) HOWEVER, your best bet is to stay elsewhere!!! Don鈥檛 let the price fool you! You get what you pay for鈥nd we got too good of deal 鈥?it jaded us!!!

It was everything perfect: people ,room, food,sports, beach, weather, etc.We were in Building 7, big room with jacuzzi and we had fruit and a bottle of champagne in the room!Everyone was wonderful, friendly, and always going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. The food and drinks are good, great taste and selection. I love banana mama and mamajuana. The shows were very good. I love the sports (free): Kayak, Catamar茫, windsurf, snorkeling( we saw corals and a lot of the fish, we give them bread and banana!).Thursday was the best day,with a beach party, everything(food and drinks) and everyone were in the beach!!!I will return....!!!

<Content>Punta Cana Grand - Excellente!!!!!!!!!! November 29 - December 9, 2006My girlfriend, Cyndie and I, (The Maineacs), just returned from another super fantastic vacation to the Dominican Republic, this time at Globalia Punta Cana Grand, Nov. 29 - Dec. 9. This was our seventh trip to the DR. First year at the Iberostar Costa Dorado in Puerta Plata, second year at Bavarro Princess in Punta Cana, third year at the Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus in Bayahibe, fourth year at the Iberostar Punta Cana. Fifth year at Casa del Mar. Sixth year at Sunscape the Beach. Read on to get some pointers on the resort.Flight/AirportWe are from Maine, and our trip departed from Boston on American Airlines. Our vacation was booked through Vacation Travel Mart, and Beth Miller again found us the best deal anywhere, for the seventh straight year!!!! No one has come close to their prices, plus you accumulate mileage, which we will use next year for our 2nd free trip!!!!!!! We drove down to Boston the night before, spent the night at a Park  Fly motel (cheaper than parking at Logan), and then left at 7:00 AM for San Juan, and then on to Punta Cana. Only took 45 minutes to check in and go through security. Flight was great and on timeArrival in DRArrived in Punta Cana, got our picture taken, and we were met by our tour representative from Turinter. Loaded up into a van and off to the Punta Cana Grand. About a 20 minute drive. Roads were no worse, actually better, than La Romana or Puerto Plata. They are building a highway from Punta Cana up along the coast towards Secrets, and it is supposed to cut the travel time in half. We鈥檒l see. Always an exciting car ride. Check-inWe were the only ones in the van, plus no large tour (Apple, etc.) was checking in. Greeted with drink - nice touch. Room wasn't quite ready so went to bar and had a drink. We were upgraded to the new Bldg. 7 with a jacuzzi in the room!!! Thanks go to Beth Miller, Anna, and Karen. No charge for room safe - yeah!!! We were on 3rd floor of Bldg. 7 facing the resort next door. Mainly garden and palm trees. Fantastic room and view. After only 10 minutes wait at the bar, our luggage and us were whisked away to our room.RoomRoom was fantastic. Fruit and a bottle of champagne greeted us in the room. AC worked great, always on - no card in the switch hassle. Hot water and water pressure fluctuated from good to bad throughout our trip. Really no problem. They are working on the problem. Coffee pot in room. Iron. Bath robe. Everything was perfect. No bugs.  BBeachYou can walk for miles to the left and about a mile to the right. Not as calm and clear as CDM, but always kept clean. First few days the wind was wild so the water was murky and somewhat grassy for a few days. Then the wind died down and the water was nice. You can also walk north (left) and find some great deserted and clear beaches to swim at also. Did miss the snorkeling somewhat, but again we became 鈥減ool Maineacs鈥?for this trip at the adult pool.PoolThree pools: A lazy river type between Bldg. 7 and 2, mainly for swim out room. Main pool with swim-up bar. Adult pool. Small but intimate with its own bar. Fantastic bartender (Nicholas!!!!!!!). After the first few days, as soon as Nicholas opened the bar at 10:00 AM he would bring me over a Bloody Caesar!!! Brought our own floats. Only used them a few times this year. FoodThe best food overall that we have had to date. Buffet was the best we have had. Great taste and selection. The ala carte restaurants: American Grill - Good. Mainly Mexican. You can have tequila shots. We did.. Beach Grill - Good - Had great seafood platter!!!!--At lunch they had a small buffet at the Beach Grill and also a place with burgers  dogs.DaMarios: Great. Had steak. Cooked perfectly. Nice relaxing mealHad a great beach party on Thursday.. Vegetable sushi at buffet on Wed.!!!!!  DrinkWhat can I say. Anything and everything you want - just ask. Caiprinha鈥檚 and Bloody Caesars!!!!!! Had any drink or liquor that you could think of. If you thought the drinks were too weak, just ask for more 鈥渞on鈥? They will give it to you with a smile.We spent most of our evenings at the piano bar with the fantastic bartender Rudy Dias!!!!! We can't say enough good things about Rudy.Beach bar made fantastic Manhattans!!! Sadly or luckily ;-) we didn't find this out till our last night. Bar by pool was also great.Casino was fun. Went in and did some slots. This year we didn't do any shows, but heard that they were good.StaffEveryone was wonderful, friendly, and always going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. Maids were great. Fridge always restocked each day. Sorry I didn't get to meet Anna and Karen. They are the best, and see to every guest needs. Hope to meet up next time we are there. Maybe next year.Hola to all the people we met from Canada, Michigan, and Virginia.Flight backNo problem at the airport. So sad to leave.Overall it was another fantastic trip to the DR. We highly recommend that you go to Punta Cana Grand!!!! Next year we can go for 2 weeks, and we were tentatively thinking of 1 week CDM and 1 week Iberostar Hac. Dom. Now we have Punta Cana Grand on our list so maybe one week there. We may change our minds. As usual, please e-mail or PM us if you have any questions. Photos will be up in a couple of weeks on Webshots. fike@yahoo.comMike  Cyndie - The Mainiacs

<Content>Had a nice time, but might have gone elsewhere My husband and 2.5 year old daughter just came back from the Punta Cana Grand (Dec. 15-19). We had a nice vacation, but I had some problems with the hotel. I did plenty of online searching before I booked it, and based on all the reviews, decided to go with the Punta Cana Grand. We got a good deal, and overall, had a great vacation. But I would not go back.Pulling up to the hotel, I had a great feeling. The grounds looked nice and I was anxious to hit the pool and beach...and start relaxing. I was told that Building 7 was the best, so when I asked to be placed there they said it was an extra $50/night. For that amount I knew I could have booked the whole trip at a different higher class resort, so I didn't upgrade. We were placed in bldg 3. I was NOT happy with the room. I didn't mind the furniture being older, but the room had a dank smell, and the bathroom was terribly below avergae. The tub plug wasn't working, not that I would have given my daughter a bath in it anyway, and the fixtures were all rusty. The fridge and TV weren't working. So I went to the front desk and tried to get us changed. No luck.I decided to be a sport, and just enjoy the other elements of the resort. The grounds were great and we loved the pool, beach, and facilities on the sand for the kids (trampoline, playgrounds...) By day 2, I was getting more frustrated with our room and couldn't relax. They fixed our fridge, but replaced the TV with a tiny one. The pillow cases were too small for the pillows and I couldn't shake the feeling that the sheets were not properly clean. The second night we awoke to some craziness at 2:30 in the morning. Two doors down, a French man was beating his girlfriend up!!! We got up to see what we could do, and after the whole issue was sorted out with security, and all the guests on the floor had gone back to their rooms, we decided it was all too much. Granted, the hotel is not responsible for the very unfortunate domestic violence, but it was the last straw for me. (PS: the hotel wouldn't call the police and the woman just wanted to go back to the room with her boyfirend. The next day, they were as in love as ever, holding hands with her head wound covered by a strategically placed scarf).The next morning, my husband went back to the front desk with our laundry list of complaints, and got us upgraded to Building 7. Alas, our vacation began. Bldg 7 is like being in a different hotel. The room was beautiful, and everything brand new. We were on the ground floor, so our porch was right off the second pool. It was gorgeous, and very relaxing. It honestly felt like we were in a different resort. I loved everything about it. We were even able to put our daughter down for a nap, and still enjoy the day by sitting on our porch and jumping into the pool while she was sleeping. I think if I would have seen the room in Bldg 7 when we first checked in, I would have paid the $50/night without hesitation. As for some other elements of the resort: the staff was very nice and accomodating. However, the shopkeepers in the resort shops were very harassing, and turned rude as soon as you indicated that you weren't going to buy anything. The entertainment staff was great- they worked so hard and really seemed to want you to have a good time. I was very surprised by the quality of the nightly shows. The theater area is beautiful and the shows were entertaining. We didn't love the food, but didn't so long as we had a drink in hand, we were good to go. In summary- we had a great time on vacation and found the resort OK. For the extra $50/night for Building 7, I would have selected a different resort, but it turned out OK for us.

<Content>Beautiful grounds and good service at the Punta Cana Grand As a travel agent who has been to the Dominican Republic once before and who loved it, I was very excited to be returning to a new area of the country, Punta Cana.My family and good friends just returned from a too short four night stay (Dec. 9-13) and must say that we were all thrilled at what we got for the money. For less than $750 per person (including insurance) we found a wonderful resort which I would not hesitate to return to. As a travel agent, I will also recommend it to clients.We were in Building 3 which is one of the older parts of the resort but it is very centrally located. We were just steps from the beach in one direction, to the pool and bar in another direction and to all the restaurants.The only problem we encountered was with the water pressure in our shower, or lack thereof. The sink had plenty of pressure as did the toilet but the shower was iffy, at best. One of the girls in our party who has unbelieveably thick hair, carried her shampoo to the beach showers and washed her hair there! It got the job done and besides a few strange looks, worked fine!The furniture was old in our rooms but the place was clean and the maids were very accomodating. I took little $1 gifts like razors, toothpaste, makeup, crayons, coloring books and stuffed Christmas animals/Santas which we gave out each day. My husband took two of the stuffed animals to the bartender at the adult pool . The adult pool is very small and the hot tub didn't appear to be hot but the bar was never too busy and the bartenders were very nice. We saw him walking around hugging those two animals for an hour after we gave them to him!The adult pool is supposed to be for topless bathers but there were topless women in the family pool, and on the beach so it really just provided a nice area for those who didn't want to be around kids. That wasn't a problem either while we were there since there were very few kids at the resort and the ones who were there were very well behaved. The third pool is between building 3 and 4 and is more like a swim out pool for those rooms which face it. There were few people using it while we were there.Those who have written about Americans being pushed to the back of the line at the bars, etc. must have had different staff than we had. We carried our own insulated glasses and a tray to carry drinks on and everytime we got refills for the eight of us, we tipped a dollar. The staff seemed to really appreciate it and, for heavens sake, $1.00 is a good deal for eight drinks!The food was generally good. Like most all inclusives, breakfast was the best but we got reservations the first night for the three specialty restaurants and found the food in all three outstanding. We had no problem getting reservations for all three nights. The American Grill served TexMex food which was good and we even had tequila shots included. The Da Mario restaurante had very good food but it seemed more like average dishes written in Italian; not Italian food per se. The last night we at in the Beach Garden restaurant and it was a seafood dinner. Very nice but nothing great. There were couples on the beach having anniversary/honeymoon dinners which was very romantic.Lunch was good at both restaurants, Windows and the Beach Garden which served a buffet as well as burgers, chicken and hot dogs.We only encountered three American couples at the resort and found most of the Europeans to be standoffish. It was not a friendly group there when we were there but the eight of us managed to have a ball.The casino was new and the staff was new at the job. It is not the place for a professional gambler but we loved it because the staff helped us and each other when mistakes were made. It was a fun place to visit for an hour or so at night.We didn't go to the nightly shows but just became beach bums. We spent our time between the pool which was clean and comfortable, and the ocean which did have a lot of floating seaweed (not like Ambergris Caye in Belize which has the stuff growing on the bottom so that you have to walk through it) The staff raked it away several times a day but it still would clump up on the beach. No big deal. No smell, you didn't have to walk in it and the worst part was that it floated into your bathing suit so that the shower floor became littered with it. Again, no big deal.Our trip did not include transfers and I found them onlline for $50-$60 per person each way. I decided to wait and was glad I did. We asked for a taxi at the airport, got a new bus just for us and paid $15 per person. The hotel arranged the return transfer and we had an older van with a really BAD driver but we made it with no problems and paid the same fare. Feel free to contact me if you plan on visiting this resort and I will gladly answer your questions.Betty Woodard

<Content>Loved it! Just returned from Punta Cana Grand on 12/13/06. This was our 5th trip to DR. My friend  I go on vacation just to RELAX! Nothing more but to relax. This hotel was our favorite  we will return. Check in was a breeze. We stayed in Bldng 4 and would request #5 next time. Bldng 4 was fine but right in the main line of people walking by or bringing food to beach bar/rest. Not a big deal but a little more quiet would make this perfect vs just about perfect. The room was fine. Spacious  well attended every day. Beach was great  had no problem getting a hut every day but could be the time of year since there were not many people staying at the hotel. There is a seaweed issue I've read about, but honestly, it was not a big deal. There is an army of people removing this all day, everyday. It appeared to me that there was a lot more seaweed further up the beach to the left because of the prevailing wind and prob current. Punta Cana Grand had the least amount  it was never a problem to us. Food was really the best we've had in the DR or Punta Cana. We found the staff to be very gracious and knowing at least a bit of Spanish helps a lot. I know a little, (muy poco), but enough to converse w/limits. I would give this resort very high marks  we have been very happy w/other resort hotels as well.

<Content>Amazing facilities, OK food An overall amazing trip- its purpose was well needed relaxation from jobs  a family member鈥檚 illness. We (DH  I, late 20鈥檚) wanted to do nothing but have tropical cocktails, stare at blue water, and be away from all contact from the 鈥榬eal world鈥? This is a huge change for us, we are usually the people that have to see everything in a destination we visit. For me not to have a guidebook or any maps 鈥?well, I didn鈥檛 think I would know what to do with myself. But oh how the Caribbean seduced me quickly鈥?Our room on the third floor in building 7 was so amazing I don't even want to tell the general public about it - it was seriously that good. Beautiful marble floors, HUGE shower room, and TWO jacuzzi's- one on baclony, on in room! Our first meal... Room Service... We were starving and ate every bit of it, but I can鈥檛 actually say it was good. This was the food theme across the trip, nice presentation, nothing wrong with it, but nothing outstanding. DH and I decided that we are 鈥榝ood snobs鈥?and that it wasn鈥檛 the resort鈥檚 fault we were underwhelmed. The good report is that I never heard of anyone being sick while we were there, and everyone I know who has been to the DR has seen sick vacationers. Overall: if you鈥檙e a serious foodie, don鈥檛 vacation here, if you鈥檙e not SO worried that every meal be perfect, everything else about the PCG is fantastic. Our only complaint is the dinner reservation system, you could only make reservations for the 3 restaurants for two hours in the morning, and for 2 hrs in the afternoon. One very friendly (read, took forever with everyone!) man did all the reservations and you had to wait forever to see him! We ate in all 4 restaurants across four nights, so it worked out for us, but it was a PITA and we never got to pick what time we ate. We enjoyed the piano bar 2 out of 4 nights, the Michael Jackson show the first night, and the disco one night - perfect resort for our duration. An overall fantastic vacation - 5* facilities, clean, vast drink/eating choices, well kept, great staff, amazing weather  scenery. If I wanted this type of relaxing vacation - I wouldn't hesitate to book here again! Say hi to Ruddy (Rudy) in the piano bar for us!

<Content>Great Place, Clean, Nice Staff, Well Tended Grounds, Food...Ok... My Boyfriend (36) and I (33) satyed at PCG Nov. 30 to Dec. 4 2006. We loved it. It was our first trip to Dominican and our first all inclusive. I am completely aware that we could have stayed in a more luxurious place with gourmet food....for $300+ per night. We feel that we got a great deal for $130 a night! First of all, the grounds are so well tended, always people cleaning and sweeping....while they sing! The beach is kept nice and free of seaweed. ROOMS: The rooms are big, clean, and in pretty darn good shape (loved the balcony). We were in Bldg. 5, floor 2, away from kiddies. We didn't have a washcloth or water in our room upon arrival, but one call and 5 minutes later...Poof! The water and washcloths appear. BARS: The bars were all nice and the bartenders are friendly. (Get a Banana Mama! YUM!) We broght lots of dollars and tipped here and there. It goes miles...as it should, I never waited for a drink, never...soo worth a few bucks a day. They bartender also knew me by name and my three most favorite drinks. Again, pull out a buck, these guys work hard. One bar drawback..only local Presidente beer. No beer selection. Sorry fellas! Again, try a banana mama...wow! Oh, bring an insulated mug with a lid. Wind+Sand+Sun=warm gritty drink. LANGUAGE: Most of the staff speaks Spanish, Duh! This is a Spanish speaking country. Learn a few words of Spanish, they appreciate the effort. Even if a staff member didn't understand my English they would try. What more can you ask for? I tried to recall all of my high school Spanish, and when you add lots of hand gestures and a big smile you see Americans are treated just fine. FOOD: Lots of selection in Windows (main restaurant) and great presentation. The food is OK. Will you write home about it? No. Will you starve? No. There are gems to be found. Try a few things and go get more of the one you like best. Pretty simple. The Tex Mex is actually really good, the beef medallions were yummy. The food at the Italian place is ok, it's a very pretty restaurant, kinda fancy. Fried chicken at the beach is yummy. As for people who have reviewed this place and said they got sick...same rules apply here for Americans traveling to any LDC (lesser developed country). Don't drink the water, no salads, no uncooked fruit or veggies. The fruit is great, but just know that eating it may give you the runs. I had a little here and there and was fine. Do make your reservations for the restaurants that need them when you arrive, and make them for your whole stay. Makes life easy. ENTERTAINMENT: Honestly we were just looking to enjoy the beauty of D.R. and have time together. So we could care less about this part, but...the casino was nice, and the Michael Jackson was good. Really, really good. Seriously. They had dance lessons, and cooking lessons (we had a good laugh about that, given the food we had so far) I found the topless europeans entertainment enough. Old men in speedo suits...yuck. But funny! If you have kids, they may see boobies. I doubt it will scar them for life (the Speedo suited old men may scar them however!). Take them to the kids pool if you are worried. All in all, what a deal, what a nice place, what a way to spend a long, romanitc weekend.

<Content>Globalia Punta Cana Grand (formerly Sunscape owned) Before I begin my detail review of the Globalia Punta Cana Grand (herein I am referring to as PCG) I just wanted to let people who are simply skimming reviews to know up front that this experience was very positive one and that you have no need to fear that PCG is a bad place. Six people in my party experienced all that PCG has to offer and are walking away convinced they would stay there again. If you want to read alot of detail please read on. I will give you as many helpful tidbits as I can. If I can answer any deatiled questions, please feel to email me anytime with your questions to: tahewitt at comcast dot com.Our stay was from October 28 through November 2, 2006. We are 3 adult couples (ages 48 - 52) from New Jersey, USA. We booked this vacation back in July on Orbitz.When we read the prior reviews by other members, my wife and I became a little nervous on what to expect since we were the ones that chose the resort for the other couples. We had stayed at Sunscape the Beach (STB) last October and rated it a perfect 5 stars in everything. Our friends experience with Punta Cana or an even an all-inclusive was nil as this was their first time for both. We chose PCG because money was a little tight for everyone this year and it was several hundred dollars cheaper than STB. However, my wife  I kept comparing everything during this stay at the PCG to last years STB.Result: While not as luxurious as STB, the PCG was not as bad as some people made it to be. You can trust me on this, while the 6 of us do have high standards as to what quality really means, we are not prudes about realizing that we are in a poor third world country and you have to relax your standards just a bit. However, we will not except poor quality when we know high quality may be sitting right next door.THE DEATAILS:Airport Arrival: We left Philadelphia airport 6 am and had a lay over in Miami until reaching Punta Cana at 2:20 pm. The airport is a thatched roof open-aired airport with no connectors from the plane to the gate like everywhere else. Your plane will park on the tarmac and you will get off on on by those old fashioned step ramps. The walk outside to the entry point in the airport. (Pray it is not raining when you arrive or leave or else you are getting wet.There is the typical photo taking welcome as you enter the airport with two preety girls in full Dominican costume. You buy them on your way home if you want them. The first desk you MUST stop at is the Travel Desk where you must pay $10 per person for a visitor visa that you hand in further down the line before you get to your luggage.O Then you go to the desk where your Passport is stamped. Then hand in your tourist visa to the man at the third desk. Then you get your luggage. After the luggage, you stop one more time to show your Passport and that is where the airport bell boys try to take your luggage from you and to your taxi ir prepaid travel tour. Either hold on tight to your luggage and say no thanks, or let them take it and be prerpared to tip $1.Our pre-arranged limo service was Viator Limo and cost us $15 per person (each way) for a total of $60 per couple round trip. I had paid for it before we left home on my Master Card. They emailed me two vouchers to print out and hand to the driver each way. The only money I needed was for a tip. They were standing there right after baggage claim with a sign with my name on it. The man spoke english that greeted us and introduced us to our driver who handed us all iced water bottles. The van was fairly new and air conditioned worked great. Compare this to the taxi we took last year, well the taxi was old, bald tires, very unsafe and cost us $50 each way to the hotel for only my wife and I. No way could 6 people use a taxi as they are too small.HOTEL CHECK IN: Arrived at the hotel at 2:50 pm and the bell captain took our luggage and spoke great english and was very friendly. We went to check in and again, all help behind the desk was super friendlyand our rooms were ready. A girl came around with welcoming drinks in a cham[agne fluted glass and it was great. No problems at all with check in and everyone spoke english, some better than others, but you would have no problems communicating. The bell captain had someone take the luggage for all 6 of us. and showed us around the complex, explaining everything we would need to know as we went to Building 4. Our rooms were all together on the third floor. They do not have an elevator (except in the new building 7 which I will get into later) and the bell boy had to walk the heavy luggage up to the third floor for each of us. Well worth the $5 tip per couple that we gave him.THE ROOM:Not as nice as the Sunscape Beach rooms but then again, the STB rooms are only 2 years old! This building was refurbished but it was not like the rooms we would have received had we been able to get into Building 7. We requested it at the time of booking but like everything you request at any resort, they cannot guarantee you will get it since I did not book and pay for the more expensive building 7 swim out rooms which are only available on the first floor, obviously.Just as in other reviews, the tird floor has very high vaulted wood ceilings. All rooms have ceiling fans, mini bars, Cable TV, in room safe and seperate bath tube  toliet combo room and sink  make up room. Pretty standard the world over. One of your room keys must be inserted into the little slot on the wall to make the air conditioner work. If you open either the room door or the slider at all, it kills the air conditioning until all doors are closed again. Now my room (4317) I did not need to insert the room key into the slot. It worked tyhe airconditioning without the need of the key. I will be posting some pictures of room 4317 so you can see the room.Next to building 4 is building 5 which sits next to the Adult pool. Expect it to be open much later than the main pool and expect to see topless bathers. Not a place for kiddies at all. It has a little bar with limited alcohol selections.ROOM TVThe TV in the room is cable. There are 62 stations on their cable system and there are 21 English speaking channels. The rest are spanish. Not too bad when you consider that 80% of ther guests are spanish and only get 66% of the stations!!In english will be these TV station highlights:Nick CartooensThe WBFilm Zone Movie TVMGM ClassicsTBSSuperstation WGNHBOE-NewsAXNAEMTVTHE MAIN POOL The depth of the pool is 3.5 feet by the swim up bar and 3 feet at the opposit end where the activities take place.Everyday starting around 10 am the activity crew (5 or 6 people strong) get people around the pool to get involved in the mroning water arobics program. They speak english, too. They had strong participation the entire time we were there. Then they have dancing classes on the area right by the pool. The Dominican music has a fast tempo and great beat, and again, a lot of people participated. They organize water volleyball, and other pool games all day long. The music does not stop even when the activity people go to lunch or breaks.Your main bartender at the swim up bar is JUAN. He can make any drink you can think of although the selection of liguor is only the house label brand called NORMANDY. If you want top shelf liquor like Stolichnaya Vodka, Dewars Scotch, etc you must go to the 24 hour bar located near the beach entryway.Pool is always clean, and thatched palapas are plentiful. Never had a problem getting on around the pool. And there are so many on the beach, you will never have a problem getting one, it just might be furhter back from the water, that's all.BEWARE: TOPLESS BATHER ALERT!!. The Spanish speaking tourists have no problems with baring their tops on the beach or at the main pool. I would think Globalia Management would better control where they can be since they do have small children there. But then again, the spanish tourist at Globalia is 80 % at least and their culture allows it and considers that behavior normal. Obviously the Canadian friends I made and the few other Americans were somewhat shocked. THE BEACH: Beach sand is easy to walk. And if you walk along the part of sand where the waves roll onto, the sand is very compacted which means, you dont have a sinking problem as you walk. Very nice. The sand itself is not a super plush sinking sand like Cancun Mexico has, either. In Cancun, it is actually hard to walk on the beach because each step you take, you sink! In Punta Cana, the sand is not as white as Cancun, but it is soft and easily walkable.Water sports that are included in the all inclusive is standard for A-I's. yellow sea kayaks, Hobie Cats, wind boards. Pretty standard.THE SEAWEED Yes, there is a seaweed problem around all the beaches of Punta Cana. But you cant help it because that is what Mother nature gave them. But as it washes ashore during high tides, it leaves a small little line of seaweed along the beach. It is not a big deal. Is it spotless like Cancun? NO. Cancun is the worlds best beach for a reason. Is Punta Cana bad? NO it just has some seaweed, thats all. The water is very clear all the way to the bottom. It has a slight greenish tint to the water, so it is not a crystal clear as Cancun water. The reason for the slight greenish tint is because Punta Cana is situated where the Atlantic Ocean and the Carribean come together. So depending on storms in the Atlantic or the Carribean and the tides of course, that magic line between unclear green Atlantic Ocean Water and clear Carribean water will meet somewhere up the beach from the PCG. I know last year at STB the water was not clear at all. STB is about 45 minutes north of the PCG. So you guess where the line will be on any given day.NIGHTLIFEThe new Casino is open at 8pm until ??? There are about 50 slot machines at 5 and 25 cents. The roulette table and Blackjack table were $5 minimum bets. Can't get that in Atlantic City or Las Vegas no more!The Shows on the big stage are really pretty decent. Hey, they are not Broadway shows, but they are very entertaining and they try so hard to deliver. I give them a big congrats on all their shows. The MIchael Jackson show should not be missed.The piano bar opens at 9:30 and join in the fun for Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday nights. You will have both english and spanish karaoke people performing and the large crowd will cheer you on even if they dont know the language! A lot of fun. trust me, And be brave and daring and get up there and do a song. You will be so glad you did.The Disco is not much to write about. Pretty bad. The younger people go there, but three times this week I looked in on it and no one was dancing at all. Just standing around drinking.OTHER ACTIVITIESYes, for a fee with different travel groups, you can go snorkeling, visit a Manati=park, 4 wheel ATV's are for rent, dolphin swimming, helicopter Tours of the island, James Bond spead boats, Horses on the beach. I didnt use any of these, but they are available. I almost did the spead boat. It was 4 hours at $78 for the 4 hours.THE SHOPS AT PCGHere is where PCG gets low marks in my book. The shops are nothing more than a repeat of the same native beach shacks you will see between the PCG and the next hotel The Occidental Allegro. The salemen are hucksters who will try to gang up on you and pull you into their store and try to sell you anything at any price. Save your negotiations for the beach shacks becaus eyou expect to haggle with them for a deal, not the resorts shops.The Restaurants  Food (I am posting some pix of the menus at the ala carte restauarants to look at)WINDOWS BUFFET: Very nice indeed. much better than I had imagined. They changed the food every night except for a few staple items. They always had a big pasta bar. Pasta was always cooked al dente and the choice of sauces or gravies were very tasty. On Wednesday, they offered a freash sushi chef that rolled the shrimp, articoke, carrot, or raw salmon rolls in front of you. AMERICAN GRILL. Tex-Mex food offered here. The steak fajitas were very good. Yet the hot wings were not for real hot wings as I know hot wings. These are small chicken wings in barbeque sauce. They aint hot, crunchy or that meaty.THE BEACH GRILL (or what ever it was called) is an open air retaurant under a big thatched palapa. The ambiance is great and very typical of a carribean sinner with the beach in back of you and the breeze keeping you comfortable. The food was EXCELLENT!!! The onion soup was true gourmet and the steak was cooked to perfection and tender as can be. The Cardon bleu was okay but if you like steak, get it here.DA MARCI Italian restaurant. Typical gourmet Italian food. Excellent. and the ambiance was extremely nice. Very gourmet.That is you only dinner choices here at PCG. There was much more at the STB so I was a little dissapointed in amount of restaurants offered. But the resort is only half the size of STB.BREAKFAST  LUNCHBoth are offered at the Windows Buffet and the area by the beach behind the 24 hour bar. You can use the umbrella tables to have you lunch or breakfast if you take from the smaller buffet at the 24 hr bar. The Windows Buffet you cannt take the food out, and the selection is and vasriety is larger. Both are good.WARNINGThe ceramic tile floors are constantly being mopped up which makes for a very clean look. HOWEVER, if you are barefoot or wearing certain types of shoes, you will slide and fall. I did and cracked my head against the wall going into the bathroom. Well, the wall didnt stand a chance but my head still has a lump on it.Be careful for wet tile floors. The main pool has painted brick that is not slippery when wet, so you dont have anything to worry about there. Just the ceramic tile floors.Well, thats about it. And remember, communicating with any of the help other than the gardener or maid was no problem at all. All of them spoke english. And to rectify the maid problem, we had pre-printed english to spanish sentences made up on little pieces of paper to leave out for the maid everyday along with a $5 tip. Such as asking for extra hand towels  bath towels. Never a problem. I would even have a paper for the mini bar saying in spanish to leave extra water and beer, no soda. Just Google on a english to spanish free dictionary and a whole bunch of sites pop up to use. It's great and free to use to prepare yourself.I am available to help if you need it.

<Content>Not much to write home about My husband and I chose this resort based on location and price.Well ya get what ya pay for! Arrival was simple,off the plane smile for a picture with the ladies that don't say welcome or anything.Proceed down the line to paying your tourist fee.10.00 per person.Baggage and getting to your transportation was very easy.We used Prieto Tours to get back and fourth to our resort.Check -in was very simple.they did bring us the fruity drink.Oh the drive to the resort was very simple.They are building a new Highway,if you were wondering where your 10 bucks go that's what there doing with it.We where taken to our 1st room.Horrible it was in building 3 on the 1st fl.We choose the deluxe suite,which is pretty much the standard room.The first room was sooo tiny and moldy and damp.We called front desk and asked for another room.They took us in 5min to a new room.3rd floor,look out to the main pool and grounds.We were very happy.I looked out and say a bunch of men walking around this huge empty pool w/ swim up bar chipping tiles and re cementing.Just our freaking luck!Well we stayed for 5 days,they got the pool open on our last day there,water was very cloudy and dirty.There is no way cement sets that quick and chlorine is at the proper levels .We made the best of it.We met some nice people that spoke english.They were hard to come by so anytime you would hear someone speak english you would strike up a conversation just to hear the english lang.Here's the rundown-Drinks-anyone that says the drinks were weak I'd hate to see what your liver looks like.SOO strongFood-Im not a picky eater but the food was not so good,what was suppose to be hot was cold and vice versa.Thank god for the fried chicken stand.Windows was good for lunch and dinner,we ate at the american grill nice setting,was nice to hear shania on the radio,Italian was good but not too much Italian food on the menu.Room-Was soso clean,we tried to have the maid come once the second day we where out of the room until 4;30 and maid servicenext day she came and just remade the bed and gave new towels.Yes I did tip 3.00 each day.No towels designs or anything special.Oh yeah our air never worked!!! we didnt want to complainb/c we already changed rooms.It wasnt that bad at nite.Entertainment- was horrible,catered to spanish and french.Had to listen very closely for the english translation when they bothered.I feel the place was not as bad as some reviewed but it was what I expected from the reviews.Staff was very friendly,beach was beautiful,seaweed that people complain about was so barely seen.Just don't answer when someone says 'Heh Lady,we did attempt the 'stores' on the beach,we payed 35 us when at first the wanted 115.The casion was nice,we only played 10 bucks in the slots and left.There was noone in there.The layout of the resort is very nice and they are doing updating on the facilities.Take bug spray,lots of bugs I did not get too many I wore bug spray every nite.I would not return to this resort,but I would go back to the D.R.

<Content>Wonderful vacation at the beautiful Punta Cana Grand! Hi, we just got back from the Punta Cana Grand and I must say that after reading other reviews, I was a little nervous but was soon put to ease. The hospitality is unbelievable and they do a very good job at accomodating you. They are very happy and friendly...a day doesn't go by where atleast 20 staff members say Hola with a smile! They are constantly cleaning, landscaping and preparing to make the place top notch. I had also heard bad things about the food, not so. The restaurants which require reservations but are still included as free are really on top of their game, especially the Tex-mex and Italian ones. The Seafood restaurant atmosphere is a little more casual outside overlooking the beach, but still very nice. The breakfast buffets could use a little help keeping things fresh and maybe covered so the bread/pancakes doesn't get hard, but still has a great variety and is good. I do agree that washclothes weren't immediately available, but I brought some just incase. As soon as the maid saw ours out, she brought some and continued to bring them daily. She also had sweet little touches like folding towels into animals and leaving them around the room as well as fresh flowers and petals. The spa is really nice (very modern)...and well priced (cheaper than home). There are 3 pools and none of them were crowded, just perfect. The music they play around the resort is great combination of American and Spanish and is tasteful, with a little caribbean hip hop upbeat thrown in to get the body moving! Being a international destination, ladies do take their tops off on the beach and it doesn't seem to be a big deal to anyone. The sun is very strong (obviously), and there is usually a constant breeze so you don't feel the burn so wear sunscreen to prevent burning. They have shady huts on the beach but you have to grab them early because they go fast. Also, there are small mosquitos that come out at dusk, so bring your bug spray to ensure comfort. I had to buy some at the convenient shop there and it was $15 for a small bottle of OFF. The sun lotions there are also very expensive ($15-33), so bring it with you. The best way to barter there while shopping is the tell them the price you think is fair right off the bat and stick to it...they will try to negotiate up, but stick to the price you think is fair and walk away if you need to...they have many stores and huts along the beach with the identical stuff. They can definitely be overbearing with trying to get you in their shop...just say 'NO' firmly and ignore their questions, where are you from?, etc. I made the mistake of trying to be nice and answered their questions and looked in their shops and you get very tired quickly! Brushing up on your Spanish or taking a translation book can be fun to look through and helpful. Most of them know enough English, but sometimes it can be challenging (fun though using body language and pointing to things). =) Just about everything is all inclusive, but take some $1's for the people who really make your stay enjoyable. I hope this review has helped, and if you chose to stay there...enjoy! We are definitely going back! =)Kim H.,30, Virginia, USA

<Content>Amazing Hotel Myself and 3 friends (23-32 yrs of age) stayed at this resort from Oct. 8-15. We booked last minute and got an amazing deal. Because of the price we paid we weren't expecting to stay in the lap of luxery. Well let me tell you when we got there we were thrown for a loop. Check In was fast and simple. Luggage was brought to our rooms quickly. No waiting around for a room to become available even though the hotel was fully booked. The grounds were beautiful, nicely manicured. The pools were big and clean. A separate pool for kids and adults. A great activities team that constantly had something for guests to do. (Although not everyone participated). Now the food. Oh my. I travel quite often and can honestly say that the food at this resort is the best I've had. I gained 5 pounds by the end of my trip. There are 3 a la carte restaurants to chose from. Plus the buffet has a great selection and they are constantly bringing out fresh hot food. The rooms in the hotel were big and clean and not once did I even see a bug.After reading previous reviews of people that went at the same time as me I must agree yes there were a lot of people from Spain that spoke Spanish. This time of year is when they take their holidays. Hence the vast majority of people in the resorts being Spanish. There was a bit of a language barrier but if you're patient you'll find that you can communicate with the little Spanish you know and the little English they know. I found then to be quite fun people. I will definatly go back :)

<Content>Can you speak Spanish? If so, you will have a wonderful time! My husband and I stayed at this resort Sep 17-24/06 and found it to be the worst of the 5 all-inclusives in the Caribbean we have stayed at. First for the bad, tips tips tips=excellent service for those of you not speaking spanish (we have never been made to feel like outsiders, the hotel property owners need to address this with the staff). The beach was so-so, the white sand was nice but the extra seaweed washing up on shore and in the shallow water was terrible....walk down the beach or take a water taxi where the beach is much much nicer and cleaner. Upon arrival, we had to wait for 3 1/2 hours before our room was ready. Our flight did leave Toronto on time and arrived at the hotel just before noon......then they tell us that check in is not until 3:00ish. After a flight and a very early morning people were cranky and just wanted to go for a short nap.As for the good, the food was the best that we have had in the Caribbean.Overall, we will never stay at this resort again....we will look for the resorts were there are more North Americans.

<Content>Going Back 2007 Surprised by the bad reviews I've seen on this site. We had a fantastic time. The help was very friendly and helpful. All employees went out of their way to see that we had a good time. The food was super. The beach with pure white sands, palm trees almost to the water's edge, and numerous palm shelters was the highlight on the resort! Sailing cats, scobba, drinks on the beach...I could go on and on. On a Sunday, we asked about going to church and they brought in a priest to say Mass just for us. My wife and I and the general maager along with the local priest the only ones present in a make-shift small chapel at the resort. What can I say. They just bent over backwards to take care of a couple of American Tourists. We are going back with family next time.

<Content>If you don't speak spanish expect to fork over the money! Beach- Atlantic side- not very apealing for a beach lover.Service- Resort Staff DOES NOT favour english speaking guests. Guests being brought in from Spain seemed to be favoured. It may have something to do with the GM being from Spain. English speaking guests are served last at the bar regardless of how long they had been waiting. You would have to actually show money at the bar in order to be served. Food/ was good. Lots of variety. Rooms-be very careful in ground room floors. Sliding glass doors open from both sides. Not like in North America. Ensure both sides are locked and check every night before you leave your room. Although your representative may ask you to check out the night before your flight...this does not mean you have to give back the key to your safe. Take extra precausion on this night. Our room was robbed as was the room next to ours. We had a digital camera stolen and a bottle of perfume stolen. The room next to ours had 400.00$ USD stolen. Another passenger also had a camera stolen. We filled in reports but have yet to hear anything. The problem is that they make us pay 15$USD for a safe which should be manditory if there is so much theft going on in this hotel. I believe this hotel has gone down hill considerably since the change in ownsership. It was much better as the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. All the pools with exception of the one located by Block #7 were dirty and warm. There was a frothy foam in the adult pool. Check in/front desk staff should be able to speak more then one language considering the diversity of guests. I'm not racing to go back here anytime soon. If I do I wil lhave to learn how to speak spanish.

<Content>punta cana grand was so-so Me and my wife just arrived back from the punta cana grand Sept.18th. I pretty well knew what to expect since i read the reviews about this resort before we arrived. The reviews were pretty accurate. First thing i would like to say is we are seasoned travellers, we travel 8-9 weeks a year all through the Carribbean. We only enjoyed our stay at this resort because of the Canadian people we met from the Toronto area and 3 very nice ladies from Austria.Good points- Resort- Very well layed out with well groomed grounds and several pools. The pool by building #7 was the best. Always refreshing and quiet. Rooms- We looked at the room in building #2, it was big enough with cathedral ceiling, nice furniture and clean. But we decided to upgrade to building #7 which had all suites with jacuzzi. They were large and beautiful. Well worth the money. Staff- Most of the staff were courtious and polite. Restaurants- All the a-la-carte restaurants were very good. We enjoyed the Italian the most, and our waiter Robinson was fantastic.Bad points- Main pool- Hot like a hot bath and filthy. Beach- Not very good , too much seaweed. If you walk to the left of the resort for about 10 minutes you will find a beautiful beach that runs for miles. This is where we swam. Entertainment- Not very exciting. The Micheal Jackson show on saturday was the only good show. This is a very quiet resort in the evening with not much to do. They have no band playing in the evenings for dancing. It is a long wait till 11:30p.m. for the disco to start getting action. Tourists- 80% Spanish and very rude so if you are from anywhere else be prepared because nobody speaks English. This resort caters to the Spanish tourists mostly.Overall this was not a bad resort but i think poorly run since they changed ownership in Jan.06. Would i return? NO.

<Content>Not A Diamond, but a definately a Gem in the Rough My wife and I just returned last night, and I must say reading some of the reviews we almost did not go. First of all this is not the Ritz Carlton, so don't expect to get that kind of treatment.We got there Tuesday around 1:30pm, check in is usually 5:00pm but our room was ready and were allowed to check in early. The bellhops brought our bags to our rooms within 15 minutes.Ok, the room was clean an efficient, no molds or bugs, stayed in building 5 on the third floor, not really bothered by any construction. The place could use a bit of a cosmetic make over but the entire place served its purpose - somewhere to rest.The maid service was very good, they were there in the morning usually when we go to breakfast, they take the used towels daily have them washed and returned in the afternoon. Wash cloths are rare so yes bring your own if you can. They also have turn down service at nights, we would go to dinner leaving the room not in shambles but not neat, only to find everything put back together bathroom cleaned and fresh washed towels in place.My wife broke a bottle of rum, and we called them for a mop and they were there within minutes, the mopped and disinfect the floor to get rid of thr smell of the rum.Food, well not so good, but we came prepare with Pepto Mismo and Alka Seltzer, and that did the trick. The upset stomach could have come from all the drinking we did the night before. The rum is very weak, so just ask for extra rum. The buffet at Windows is ok if you get there right at 6:30 when they open; if you get there late the food is sitting out too long and gets too dried out or too cold. Had dinner at DaMario, did not like it even though the ambience and the service was excellent. We did like Sea Garden, the seafood dishes they served was excellent and they we very attentive to our needs. We did not eat at the American Grill since we ran out of time, but have heard mixed reviews about them; I did hear though that they make a nice piece of steak. The food beach fiesta, was the absolutely best, I think they should serve the food like this instead of just one night.To get reservations for dinner, you can't make it for the day of, the best way to do it, is on the day you check in, make the reservations for the length of your stay, you can always cancel if you don't need it. They stagger the schedules at the specialty restaurants so they aren鈥檛 usually full at one time so to give you that individual service and attention.I鈥檝e walked the full length of the beach, looking at the adjoining properties; a PC Grand was the cleanest. They were the only one that had a full time staff dedicating to cleaning the sea weeds. There is nothing that you can do to stop nature from dumping weeds on the beach, the only thing you can do is to clean it up, and this they have done through out the day.We had no problems getting beach towels, the young lady or the young gentleman was always courteous. Obviously with very limited english/spanish, it is very difficult to have a conversation, but service was fast and proficient.Discrimination? I did not see it, did I mention, that I am a Jamaican, who has been living in the Sates for sometime now.The highlight of the trip was the night life. Every night there was a movie, a sing along for the little kids and then each nit a different show at 9:30 for the grown ups. They include, a magic show, acrobatic, lip sync show, and those were the one we saw while we were there. After that there was the piano bar, one night we had karaoke and then you we finished the night off at the disco which goes until 2:00am. The amazing thing was with especially the disco, there was young and old working up a sweat. You hear the same music every night, but that's just a part of the club atmosphere. The Animation teams goes all out to make sure that we are entertained and that we all have a good time, especially Mike, who did a duet with me at the Karaoke, he was Lionel Richie and I was Diana Ross, we did end less love, Rosa and I danced every night and Vlade and I did Bob Marley no woman no cry.Over all is this the nicest resort I've ever been to? No but it's the bet vacation I've ever had Thanks P.C Grand

<Content>Go With Friends! If you are staying at this hotel please don't worry about the really bad reviews - the local people do not hate Americans but I will say most of the staff were indifferent. It is true about the wash cloths and about the maid service having no real schedule. Most days our room was just gotten around to around 5:00. No bug problems at all either. Also, we stayed in Bldg. 5 and it was actually fantastic - first floor, literally steps to the beach. We were not bothered by any construction. Overall the room was fine.FOOD: Average - skip the American Grill/Tex Mex. The Italian was pretty good as was the Beach Garden. Windows was also okay. Service at the restaurants was always very professional but unfortunately really slow.DRINKS: Always lots to choose from - never had to wait very long either. The drinks are very weak though so you can pretty much drink all day. Also, they serve everyone - Get the Banana Mama, very tasty! Ask for extra rum if you're a real drinker.POOLS: Clean and well maintained. Very warm, however. Cool off by standing under the cool showers nearby.BEACH: Beautiful - cooler and breezier than by the pool. No trouble getting lounge chairs at all - You get to know who puts towels down and never show up - we just moved them to another spot.TIP: Bring your own wash cloth - brings singles and fives. Bargain with the vendors. Try to vacation with another family - it is very true about this particular resort. Very few Americans so it is hard to find new friends.Have Fun!!!!

<Content>Terrible I stayed in this hotel with my husband and 8 more friends from USA for 5 days 4 nights. We had a bad time in this place. there was discrimination against non-white clients. they mistreat their own domincans guest that travel from another country. The group that went to this hotel with me was from diferent nationalities:, dominicans, puerto rican, african american and caucasian. There was never reservations available for us, at the restaurants, but as soon a caucasian family or group ask for reservation, there was always space for them..Including guest from Spain. the Food was always the same and cold and terrible at the bufet restaurants. night entertainment was also bad...front desk staff was unfriendly due to all the complaints people was making during our stay. AHHH, before i forget, BEACH TOWELS... you never found beach towels in the morning.. we have to waited for 4-5 hrs and the girl from the beach towel dept was very racist.. she took care of the white guest first and to the rest was very rude.. I said that because I am dominican and she did it to me and other non-white guest, and my husband is caucasian and he was not treated the same way i was. If you try to complain with supervisors on duty, they always make excuses for their racist employees.I do not have any thing positive to say about this hotel while i stayed there. I wanted to leave the place however the hotel do not give your money back...so we stayed. most of the beach was dirty with sea weed. MOST OF THE GROUP AND OTHER GUEST HaD STOMACK PROBLEMS.If you support this behavior I guest you dont care about the way they treat other guest that are paying money to be there too and have the right to be treated with respect and dignity. God bless you and have a safe trip where ever you travel.

<Content>*** Please Promise Me You Don't Go Here *** They hate Americans, and I'm an aussie, terrible treatment to U.S. Citizens, terrible! PLEASE Promise me you don't go here! They lied so many times about so many things, including their food poisoning problems they have had for 8 months now, DO NOT EAT ANY SALAD!...I proved to them I got food poisoning and they didn't refund anything at all!....They said to me I should have known and DR !!........also had to move room three times due to things broken or bad mold and smells.....took 6 HOURS to check in as they didn't have a room ready and the place was nearly empty. Talked to the local bar staff who worked there, and they all agreed with the above, but they need work so they stay, they are sad about the place but they pay them about $1.75 which is a lot so they stay. Its owned by the Dutch, and the senior managers there are Dutch also, never complain to anyone else but them, even though they don't care at all, at least they listen, but no refund after food poisoning with absolute proof! You鈥檝e got to be kidding me! This hotel just wants money, please save yours and go somewhere else, PLEASE!

<Content>Mediocre  Our stay at the Punta Cana Grand started out confusing; the front desk did not give us any detailed information about the place, but instead just rushed us through check-in and got us to our room. In the room there was no booklet that described hotel amenities, restaurants, or local activities.The food in the restaurants was mediocre. We never knew how it was going to be. The chef just did not cook international food well. The food had either the wrong spices or the wrong consistency or both. It was very dissapointing!The rooms were very stripped down and the beds were very hard. The housekeeping staff was not on any particular schedule so we never knew when the room would be made up or when towels would arrive. The staff themselves seemed as if they were instructed to be friendly but it was not genuine.The best part of the vacation was the beach and the pool. My only complaint is that they did not have a large enough supply of towels so at times we would have to wait 1/2 hour or longer to get beach towels. While the main pool area needs updating, it was pleasant and the beach was very nice.I would not go back!

<Content>Good value for the money but some problems We are from Cherry Hill, NJ and just returned from Punta Cana Grand Sun- Fri Aug 20-25.  A mixed experience, mostly good except my husband and I both had upset stomachs. We have visited other island all-inclusives and never had this problem before.   Highlights of the trip: Our 14 and 16yr old teens had a free 1hr scuba diving lesson in the pool and of course we booked a beginner's dive for them afterwards for $75 each. It was about 20'-25' deep and saw coral and many fish. A great first experience. My husband and I (certified divers) accompanied our 14 yr old son, for $55 each including equipment (my first time in 5 yrs and I enjoyed it too). The resort is beautiful and clean and staff worked very hard, providing activities and cleaning up and serving.  There were three pools, spent most of our time at the main pool where the activities were. My son had a great time playing water polo and volleyball and beach volleyball and getting sodas from the swim-up bar. My 16yr old daughter and I enjoyed the water aerobics and I liked the brief meringue and samba dance lessons at the pool. The lazy river pool (coolest water and refreshing) was outside our building (#2 second floor 2201 and 2203). Went to the adult pool once which was very warm, but quiet and there is a bar there. We usually managed to get at least one lounge in the shade, by the main pool, but that can be a problem because people reserve them with their towels and don't show for a while.  We enjoyed the beach, too which was cooler due to the breeze, than the pool area, and we all snorkeled in the green ocean (but not much to see right by the resort). I was told that for $18, guests can go out with staff in a small speedboat to snorkel at a reef a few minutes from the resort. The snorkel equipment is free for an hour at a time. The sea grass is no big deal- cleaned up constantly by staff. The guys also enjoyed glancing nonchalantly at the few topless bathers that scattered the beach and occasionally the pool (altho they were supposed to contain that to the adult pool). The resort does have many european tourists.  Our 16yr old daughter's biggest thrill was being handed drinks with alcohol at every meal. She realized quickly that she would have to specify without alcohol for any drink she requested and we could trust her to do that. I wasn't crazy about them just handing her drinks without asking but that may not be uncommon at all-inclusives... The activity staff there were very good and there were lots of activities available all day if desired. Also there were security guards patrolling frequently and we never felt unsafe anywhere on the resort. We let the teens come and go easily. I will add, however, that my $30 watch did disappear which I thought I put into my pool bag, but since my money and other possessions were intact, my watch may have just fallen out at some point.  Our rooms, altho in the older bldg, were adequate. Some problems with the maid not leaving enough towels, but if we called for them, we did get them. Washclothes seem to be available only upon request! Also there were annoying little ants by the bathroom sink. Once I removed the plant from the bathroom, and sprayed a bug repellant, they mostly disappeared. I did not notice any other insects-not even one mosquito! The downside was that I was a bit disappointed that there were few English speaking tourists there. I usually like to meet people and socialize. It was also a little challenging to speak with some staff who knew only a little English. Others were better. For example when I asked for bottled water at breakfast and it was poured over ice, the server seemed to be insulted or annoyed or didn't understand, when I asked if I could have another glass without ice. She disappeared and never returned.  There seemed to be mostly adults and few families, so our teens were a bit bored at night. There was no teen disco altho listed at one site. However, that meant the resort was less noisy and more relaxing too! I am sure that varies at any given time, of course. The food was only fair, very bland and as noted, my husband and I both had stomach problems. After this, I tried to drink mostly the bottled water, but since it was from a spring in D.R., I wasn't sure how helpful that was. Also, since it was so hot there, it would be tepid immediately without ice, but using ice kind of defeats the purpose of drinking only bottled water! However, I did feel better after my one 4 hr episode.  The Italian restaurant had nice atmosphere and service and better quality food than the Windows buffet. The Beach garden restaurant and american grill were just ok. They did make efforts to present the food nicely and refilled drinks quickly, but the fish was usually overcooked. We did not eat shellfish or meat at the resort.. Grouper was the main fish available. Make reservations when you arrive because there is limited seating at the 3 restaurants. The Windows buffet has a large variety of food, and is nicely displayed and no reservation is needed. Also, food is available at almost any hour. There are cookies and coffee by the pool and a server brought skewers of cut-up fruit to the beach one day.  Another negative which we don't know if we can blame on the resort is that our 16yr old daughter woke up with some slight (?) version of pink-eye which is why she did not go on the beginner's dive as planned. She then spent most of that day and the next in the room watching tv and reading! We were given a hard time about a refund and finally received $25 of the $75 back. My husband was too disappointed in the certified dive he took earlier, in addition to not feeling well, to consider using her credit for himself and disliked the mode of transportation to the dive shop and then to the dive site- a small motor boat that was a very bouncy ride. This was the most minimal dive operation we ever utilized. Since there was no ladder on the small boat, you have to hoist yourself over the side after the dive. Not an easy exit for a 47 yr old diver.  The other weakness here was the entertainment. They mostly used the audience to have them come up on stage and do silly things. Since the banter was all in Spanish we missed any humor there, other than the silly event.   Other helpful hints-bring $1's and $5's to make additional purchases and for tips, since it is difficult to get change in dollars. The resort takes pictures of guests if desired with iguanas, monkeys, and parrots and charge $8 each if you like the picture. They take pictures at the pool and on the beach and at the beach barbecue dinner on thurs night. Vendors were slightly annoying by handing us gifts which of course, made us feel obligated to politely look at their wares. There were a few on the premises and others on the beach, but there was no contact there unless you walk over to their huts. They were doing some renovations on building 5 so you may want to avoid that building until completed (we could smell fresh paint) .  An insulated big mug might be helpful even just for keeping water and sodas cold and of course to limit trips to the bar.  We will probably never go back to this resort (but we have not repeated any of our vacations) and would only consider Punta Cana if we stayed on the Caribbean side where the water is probably bluer and we may be able to snorkel right from the shore and see some more plentiful fish.  It was a very inexpensive vacation $2600 including trip insurance and airfare and airport transfer (about 20 mins from airport) for 4 from Vacation mart online, so we felt that we probably got exactly what we paid for! If we had not gotten sick we would have thought it was a great week.

<Content>DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!! THIS HOTEL IS TERRIBLE!!!!!! If you are American, do not stay here. They do not like Americans, but LOVE the US dollar. We spoke spanish most of the time, but still were treated with complete disrespect. Everyone is rude, with the entertainment staff. We had no hot water, broken hair dryers and a leaky roof. It took sometimes a half an hour to get a drink at the bar, if we got served at all. They just skipped right over us. When we asked the waiters for things, they just ignored us. Forget about eating at any of the restaurants...you need reservations in which the lady working is a [------]. It took two hours to check in. Check in time is at 3PM, but did not get a room until 5PM; however the day of checkout they are quick to call your room to let you know. NONE of the info on any of the travel sites is true about this place. The kids club they offer is 5 and up and it only runs from 9AM - 12PM and again from 3PM to 5PM. The discoteque [---]There is nowhere to go off of the resort. We booked a Swim and Snorkel with the Dolphins trip in which the guest services man said it was three hours and it was swimming and snorkeling with the dolphins. It turned out to be about 20 minutes of going into a pen with two dolphins in which we could look and get a little feel of them. At the end of the trip, we asked to speak to a manager in which the front desk staff would not tell us who one was. Finally, one of the staff lied and told us some guest services guy was a manager. Make sure to bring plenty of dollars, euros or pesos because for a large hotel, they NEVER had any money to change out traveler's checks. The only relatively nice part was the entertainment staff....but I only think they were nice because the guys wanted to hook up with my sister and I. I have been to over 15 countries and have never experienced anything like this. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO A PIG!!!!!

<Content>Just relax and enjoy the view!! We just arrived home after three nights and four days at the Punta Cana Grand. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews on this website. Now after our brief stay, all I can say is that for what we paid, the hotel exceeded our expectations. Was it perfect? No. The food wasn't the greatest. Reservations are needed for all of the restaurants except Windows, the buffet. We checked into dinner reservations on our first day and were told that there was nothing available for the next three nights!! We managed to get into the Beach Garden on our first night due to a cancellation, and into The American Grill on our last night because the hostess took pity on us. Imagine our surprise when each time we went into these booked restaurants, there were only 5-8 full tables. I'm not sure why they do this, but they do. If food is very important to you, don't go here. The sit down restaurants were disappointments, and the buffet had a great selection but the food was below average. I decided on the first day that if I had to survive on mangoes and bread for four days, that was cool because of the fantastic view. We ate breakfast each day at the Beach Garden. I could have been eating sticks and rocks and I wouldn't have cared. I had my coffee and a beautiful view of the sun rising over the blue waters of the Carribean. As for the rooms, the beds were hard, the blankets and towels were far from plush, and our air-conditioning rattled and hummed all night. Again, if I had paid a lot for the room, I would have grounds to complain. As it was, the room served it's purpose, plus it was very clean. They mopped the tile floors daily in the rooms and continuously in the common areas. The grounds were lovely and the beachfront was gorgeous. However, probably my favorite part of the whole trip was the wonderful staff at the hotel. Everyone was so polite and kind. They were genuinely happy to have you as a guest!! (This is something that is lacking in most US hotels.) Even if there was a language barrier, the staff went above and beyond to help. They were all so wonderful!! This trip was for me and my family, a brief respite from our busy lives.The atomosphere and service at the Punta Cana Grand were all we could hope for. I hope to return again someday soon!

<Content>It was okay We spent a week at the Punta Grand. We only paid $1650 for the week including airfare so I must say the week was definitely worth the money. Airport: The majority of the airport is not air conditioned so standing in lines can be somewhat hot. There is a $10 charge per person to enter the country. Have your money ready. Punta Cana Grand does not provide transportation so we had to take a taxi. We paid $25 plus a tip and the drive was about 20-25 minutes long. Room: We were in building 1. We had a third floor room with the high ceilings. The room was okay. The walls are very thin and we could hear everything going on around our building throughout the night. The theatre and casino were right next to us and could become very loud at times. If you like to turn in early building 1 is not for you. The water pressure trickled out some days and was sufficient other days. We had no hot water only one day. Our sink area had an ant problem. Luckily I brought some mosquito repellant and that seemed to work alright. We always had plenty of towels in the bathroom and the fridge was always stocked. The electricity including the AC runs off of your key card. We liked to leave to the AC on while we were out to keep the room cooler. This was fine for the first few days. However, by the middle of the week the key card was taken out and gone. I went to the front desk and got a new one and was told that the maid will take it if you leave it. I did not like that. I kind of understand that they might not want you running up the electricity while you are out, but I didn't understand confiscating the key card. I would reccommend to anyone that is goingt o Punta Cana Grand to upgrade to Building 7. They are much nicer/newer than the other buildings and only a few hundred dollars more. Pools: The adult pool was very warm and not refreshing. The main pool was very crowded and had tons of kids running around it. People also left their used cups all around it. The best pool was by Building 7. It was calm, peaceful and the water was cool and refreshing. Food: It was okay. Nothing to brag about. More european catered than american. Don't drink the water! Trust me!!!!! Carry bottled water with you to meals. Also, at the buffet, if you prefer a soda it will be easier and quicker if you just bring it with you from your fridge in the room. We went whole meals at the buffet with never receiving a drink. Beach: There was a lot of sea grass, but it wasn't bothersome. The Grand had people cleaning the beaches constantly. Bring a raft with you if you would like to float around. There are none at the resort and you will pay about 3x more if you buy one at the gift shop. Nonetheless, the beach was very nice. We brought our own towels from home and it was worth it. We went snorkling one day and it was beautiful. The fish ate from our hands.The resort itself is beautiful and for the money we paid I can't complain. I think though, that the next time I plan a vacation I will spend an extra $1000 and go somewhere else. I would like better service, better food, and a room without ants.

<Content>A great expirrience at Punta Cana Grand!! Our Family's excellent experience began when we arrived at Punta Cana Grand Hotel on July 12th to stay for a week.We arrived at the hotel early that afternoon and the two connecting rooms that we had reserved were ready.The rooms were beautifly decorated, and clean. We were guided around the hotel, had lunch and our vacation was off to a good start. We had been to Dominican Republic, and nothing was this smooth. The grounds of this 7 year old hotel are excellently kept.Three pools with plenty of lounging chairs. The Palapas are scouted early in t he morning. It has three restaurants with great service and good food, if you don't want to eat at the buffet. The personel is very polite, friendly and eager to please. The Spa was very relaxing and reasonably priced. The shows every night were also very well done with the exception of one; where the audience is enticed to remove personal items of clothing. Over all we had a wonderful time! Great service, great place and great People!!! We will return to Punta Cana Grand to have another Grand vacation in the near future. Atlanta Ga.

<Content>Been There...Done That I stayed at the Punta Cana Grand for 6 days. Upon arrival, I was given a room in Building 2. I asked to be moved to Building 5. I was told it was being painted. I asked Sandy,, at the desk, if I did not like my room could it be changed. He said if I had any problems feel free to contant him. Unfortunately, I had to contact him.ROOMS: The first room was in building 2, second floor. It had a king sized bed as I requsted. When I entered the room, it had a moldy and musty smell. The tiled floor were not attractive. They needed work. There weren't any towels in the room. I called Sandy, at thr front desk, and told him that I was not pleased. He said he would send someone over with a key to another room. He said because I requested a king sized bed, this is all he had. I told him forget about the king sized bed, just get me a room I could be happy with. While waiting for the new room, I called for some towels. I was brought two towels. The next room I was given was in Building 1, third floor. This room did not have a foul odor and the ceiling was high. It was a much better room. It's a good thing I took the towels from the previous room, because there weren't any towels. The room was clean, the ac was on and there were some beverages in the fridge (no water). It was adequate. Tip #1: Bring your own washcloth. I forgot to pack washclothes and the resort did not have any. One day, I had to wash my body with a hand towel. A couple of vacationers told me that they did not have any washcloths either. It seems there was a shortage because previous guests stole them. After numerous calls to the front desk, two washcloths were left in the bathroom when I went to dinner the second night there.Tip #2: Learn basic Spanish because most of the staff do not understand English and most of the vacationers are Spanish speaking as well. I speak enough Spanish to get by, however, I could see someone having difficulty if they did not know any Spanish.POOLS: There are 3 pools. None of them are deeper than four feet. The adult pool by Building 5, is quiet at night. It has it's own bar until 5 pm. However, the water was always warm. It was the same temparture as the hot tub. Although, it was supposed to be for adults, no one enforced it. The main poool had all the going ons and the swim up bar. I went in there once. I was not impressed. The best pool is by building 7, the new bulding. It was beautiful. The water was always cool and refreshing. There isn't a bar over there. It was calm and quiet most of the time. I spent most of my time here. This is also the only pool where you can walk down stairs to enter and exit the pool. The other two pools you have to use the ladder.FOOD: I have had better and I have had worse. At Windows, the buffet, you could always find something that you liked. Dominican night was the best. I ate at Beach Garden, twice for lunch. The food was okay. Most times for lunch, I had a hamburger from the grill on the beach. Make sure they cook it well done. This is where your basic spanish could be of help. I also ate at The american Grill once. I had the beef medallions because other reviewers recommended it. It was good.BEACH: It was nice. There was sea weed but they tried to clean it constantly. Yes, rude people left their towels in cabanas even though they were not there. Usually, I could get a cabana about 1 or 2 pm on the beach. If not, I would move a chair under a palm tree until the sun moved and the shade shifted. The cabanas closest to the Water Sport building were the ones to become available in the afternoon. I had great naps at the beach. Yes, there are fish swimming in the water. The water was a nice green and the sand white.Service: I left a note for the maid in spanish requsting washclothes and water for the fridge. She brought at least 5 bottles of water. She did a great job. Thanks Isabel! Sandy, at the front desk, was very helpful. The service at Beach Garden was mediocore. When the waiter came and took our orders, he never returned to ask if we needed anything else. This happen the 2 times I dined at Beach Garden. The workers at the American Grill, worked hard. Beach Papi, the bartebder, was always so much fun. Tip #3: Tip the staff. I know it is all inclusive but this is a poor country and the staff works hard. The waiter at the American Grill which is only open for dinner, is also a waitstaff at Windows during breakfast and lunch. Most people there worked throughout the resort during the day. You don't have to tip everyone all of the time but there were some outstanding workers who I felt deserved a tip. I ordered room service one morning, the waiter was so suprised and appreciative when I gave him a tip. He deserved it since he walked with a tray from Windows, up three flights of stairs and arranged the plates on the little table.All in all, I had a good time. The hotel needs some work. The casino is nice but no one goes in. I will not stay here again. However, if you are on a budget, it's an okay place to stay.

<Content>Good time for the money we spent My husband and I just got back from the Punta Cana Grand Resort.脗 It was ourfirst trip to the D.R. and we didn't really know what to expect.脗 We arrived atthe resort about 4pm -didn't get greeted with drinks as promised- and got sentto the bar until our room was ready.脗 About 30 min. later we were able to checkin our room and Given, from the front desk actually took us to our room to makesure we would be happy with it.脗 It was OK, seemed very warm but he promised itwould cool down after awhile.脗 Unfortunately after about 3 hrs we realized theA/C was not working, just sounded (very loudly) like it was so we decided to askfor an upgraded room and were told none were available that night but Givenwould call us at 10:00am and have us moved to an oceanfront master suite for anextra $80 per night.脗 After being woken up at 9:00am to the sound of workerssawing into concrete and hammering non-stop in what sounded like the room nextdoor we headed down to the front desk anxious to move rooms.脗 We were told Givendidn't come in until 3:00 so we explained to this person what Given had told usand that we were ready for our new room and he said nothing would be availablelike that until mid-July.脗 We walked away disappointed but decided to make thebest of it anyway.We hung out on the beach - which actually is probably the best on that strip, asthey are always cleaning up the seaweed. While standing at the beach bar waitingto get a refill on our drinks, who shows up but Given!脗 He told us our new roomwas ready, although not oceanfront, but at least in Builiding 7 (the renovatedbuiliding).脗 We were so surprised and it was wonderful and very much worth theextra $50 per night!脗 Thje A/C was COLD and did not require a key card to be putin...it was on all the time!脗 We got a king bed, vs the 2 doubles in the firstroom, as well as a HUGE shower with great water pressure, a jacuzzi tub, doublesinks and overall just much nicer!脗 I would highly recommend upgrading if it'savailable.脗 For the maid we bought items like makeup, scented lotions and hairgoods that we left for her in a little gift back and a note that I made up aheadof time in spanish, thanking her for taking good care of us and our room.脗 Inreturn, we always had lots of cold drinks on our mini-bar and fresh flowers onour towels.We mostly hung out on the beach and figured out that in order to get a good spotwith shade you needed to be on the beach no later than 6:30 to save your chairs. We brought a couple old beach towels from home that we used to do this that weended up leaving.脗 We never had trouble with anyone moving our towels or gettinginto our stuff while we weren't there.脗 We never went to the pool, it was tooloud for us, much quieter on the beach and again, it seemed a little cooler aswell, with a breeze coming off the water.脗 We saw people snorkeling, kayakingand sailing, but we opted just to chill out and do nothing...after all we wereon vacation to relax!See Pedro at the Beach Bar. We brought our Bubba Mugs (32oz) and were the onlyones there that had them.脗 I would HIGHLY recommend getting these (at Walmartfor less than $6) They keep your drinks cold for a long time.脗 The first time wegave them to Pedro we also gave him a dollar and he would always wait on usbefore anyone else.脗 We never say anyone else tip him, so we usually gave him$2-$3 each per day depending on how many times we had to go refill.脗 He wasalways very friendly and helpful.脗 Didn't find that at the main bar and theymade the drinks weak.脗 Pedro would keep pouring until you had to tell him tostop!Water-never had a problem.脗 They had plenty of bottled water at the bars and inthe room and didn't even worry about rinsing our toothbrushes after brushinglike other people have said they have done.Food was OK.脗 We found things we liked better than others, but nothing really towrite home about except in the American Grill - get the Beef Medallions - theyare incredible!We tried the Itailian restaurant one night for dinner and it was pretty good,but not spectacular.脗 We ate twice at the American Grill and the rest of thetime at Windows, which is buffet style and also we had lunch at the Beach Cafe. The service there was terrible unless you speak spanish which brings me to mynext comment.If you don't speak Spanish you will have脗 trouble communicating with some peopleat this resort.脗 Other than Given and one other guy at the front desk, everyoneelse was rude and ignored us unless we got loud.脗 None of the maids speakEnglish, nor the grounds keepers.脗 The majority of tourists there are ofHIspanic origin and non-English speaking.脗 The few (and I mean FEW) people wedid run into that spoke english were from Canada and they all had the samefeeling we did about this.脗 We felt that because we didn't speak the language wewere being slighted and they would go out of their way to make sure the spanishspeaking folks were taken care of first, even if they arrived to lunch/dinnerafter we did.脗 It's very unfortunate that this goes on and because of it wewould not stay at this resort again.脗 I think the Dominican Republic is abeautiful place, and I think for what we paid for staying here it was fine, butI would rather try one of the other resorts next time.

<Content>A Perfect Week!!! My wife and I went to the Grand on our honeymoon from June 4th through 10th and loved every minute. We read some reviews beforehand and were a little cautious but as soon as we got there our worries turned to delight. Some people will always find things to complain about no matter how good their situation might be. We were given a room with an ocean view (4223), which was always kept clean and well stocked with beer and water by the cleaning staff. The A/C was great, the water pressure was just like home - no complaints about the room at all. The food was just wonderful. There was no way to hungry at the Grand. The buffet was well stocked at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the theme restaurants were cozy with nice menus. There were three outdoor bars including one swim-up, and an outdoor patio which served lunch and dinner as well. The beer was good and the drinks were made well (if you know what I mean). There's more I could write about. We took two tours off the resort including a countryside tour which we recommend to everyone. Additionally we met some really nice people from here in Canada and abroad. If you choose this resort you'll have a great time. We're going back next year again.

<Content>Great Resort We went to the Punta Cana Grand at the end of May this year. I was a little worried because the price was so cheap! The hotel and staff were awsome. We had a great time. The hotel was Beautiful with plenty to do. The food was pretty good with lots of selection. The italian resaurant was our favourite. The Thursday night beach party was so so nice, they really go to alot of work to put it together! The shows were funny , just expect to end up in your underwear during one of them! The drinks were great and they topped them up nicely if you ask them to! I loved having the fridge in our room with bottled water and pop as a few beer at your diposal, replenished daily! I have no complaints about this resort except next time we will be bringing our kids along! I recomend this hotel and would return in the future!

<Content>Punta cana Grand definatly a great Hotel I鈥檝e just returned from my visit to the Punta Cana grand, so I thought id write my review for all you travellers who are planning a visit in the near future. We were slightly delayed, lost a couple of Hours on our first day which was annoying, but when we arrived at the Hotel the check in was quick and trouble free. The only small complaint which i have is, I had requested a room in Block 7, (these are the suites that feature a Jacuzzi and marble flooring) the guy at reception , Osiris, wouldn鈥檛 acknowledge my request but said if wasn鈥檛 happy with my room , they would change it. We didn鈥檛 bother as we had no intention of spending our holiday the Hotel room.Rooms: The rooms are decorated in traditional Dominican d茅cor, and at first appear quite dark. In my honest opinion I think the rooms serve the purpose it should; they provide a comfortable retreat from The Hot sun. The rooms are kept clean and were always cool. The Water pressure was as should be and the air conditioning was great. Our room was 3206 and had a view of the main evening bar鈥?There was minimal noise after midnight and throughout the day there were no noise heard from the pool. I would suggest that you should try to get the Upgraded Block 7 rooms; they come with extra features, like a Jacuzzi and marble floor.Grounds: Kept very tidy by the Gardeners, who worked everyday from very early till late, trying to keep it looking beautiful, and at the same time were always very friendly to everyone. , The hotel is smaller than some hotels in the Dom rep; however they utilize the space by creating walkways and seating areas, designed Bridges over ponds with ducks in and fountains. The Hotel grounds were beautiful and I wouldn鈥檛 fault them in anyway.Food: There are 4 restaurants in the Punta Cana grand, and also room service, 24 hours a day. The Main restaurant ,Windows buffet restaurant is the serve yourself , breakfast , lunch and dinner, standard restaurant you get in most hotels, However they did make each night a theme Night and serve on you adequately, the next a Italian styled restaurant , serving Italian dishes . The American grill served western American dishes and Mexican style food. And also the beach garden restaurant which serves fast food type foods and sandwiches or salads, again they serve on you, always with a smile.The food in general in all the above restaurants was of a High standard for the Dominican Republic. However some people may struggle to adapt to some foods and ways that they cook and prepare foods, our stomachs can鈥檛 take it鈥? this is not a criticism in anyway, more like an expectation you come to realise when you travel and eat the local cuisines, anywhere in the world. Also I would like to mention the Beach party which they prepare on Thursdays for you, the bar and waiter staff start early , clearing the beach they put out tables and chairs , build stands which later acts as a bar or a food stall. They entire evening revolves around this beach party, with live singing and dancing, the evening show and the night movie all taking place on the beach, this is an excellent evening and very enjoyable. The next day it鈥檚 all gone as though you had dreamt it, this is how hard these people work for youBeach: The beach is stunning; with white sands and palm trees you really get the idea of the Caribbean. The sea is clear with lots of fish to look at; if you feel adventurous you have the option to participate e in numerous water sports and activities.Pools: There are three pools one which is an adult only pool the main family pool with a swim up pool bar and last but not least a beautiful secluded pool situated near block 7. This pool is open till 11pm where as the main pool closes at 7pm. In general the Punta Cana Grand is a great hotel. It accommodates to every need possible weather it鈥檚 making great drinks and constantly refilling your glass in the restaurants or trying to involve you all in the activities. With this hotel under new management , Globia, some huge operators don鈥檛 feature it yet and as soon as they do this will become one of the more popular hotels due to its excellent standards offered by everyone working there and all the facilities on offerThe holiday was truly enjoyable and I hope everyone whose considering this hotel chooses to go. .

<Content>Very pleasant stay at the punta cana grand Me and my husband stayed at the punta cana grand in april 2006. We were having a break without the chidren which was nerve racking but thoroughly enjoyable. We had a few teething problems with the room we were initially given and the concierge swapped our room the following day. This room was much nicer as it was better maintained. The reception staff were not particularly helpful and seemed as though they had too much work on to deal with us. We seemed to get a different answer for the same query from each member of staff. The cleaning staff however were fantastic. It was very warm and they carried on working away very hard, regardless of the heat. Our room was cleaned and mini bar restocked every day.We weren't very far from the thatre where the entertainment is on an evening but everything quietened down at around 11 every night. We only tried the entertainment towards the end of the week, as we were happy enjoying the lovely food on the evening and having a quiet drink. We had quite low expectations of holiday entertainment but have to give the punta cana gran 110% for this. We went to the Michael Jackson show on the Saturday evenng because we had read so many reviews saying we shouldn't miss it. It was way beyond anything we were expecting. Definitely the best show we've seen!!The food at this hotel on a whole was very good. My husband's mother is an extremely good cook as she is Italian so he is very hard to please. He enjoyed the restaurant on the beachside the best and rated the Italian as the worst, for obvious reasons! It just wasn't authentic at all so we only visited here once. The seafood at the beach though was to die for. They also have a beach party on a Thursday evening where they spend the whole day preparing, making bar areas with palm leaves and carving pineapples etc. They really do put a lot of effort in to this evening and there are different types of food for everyone. There are things to do all the time. We tried snorkelling, kayaking, wind surfing all for free. There are also some excursions you can buy through the hotel. We made the mistake of buying from one of the locals on the beach which we wouldn't advise. We went horseriding in the neighbouring village which was very scary! They brought us two very under nourished horses and rode us down a dirt track with a man at the end with a shotgun. He was the security guard for that stretch of uninhabited beach which I'm sure we shouldn't have really been on. The man smiled though but we still felt very uneasy. If I was to go anywhere like this again we would definitely stay inside the complex as sometimes ignorance is bliss. We had taken some of our girls shoes for the children there as we were told they were very poor but we didn't dare give them to anybody in case they took it offensivley.To finish off we will say that for our first time in the Dominican the Punta cana grand was very nice and relaxing and would definitely reccomend it.

<Content>Best holiday in D.R. yet I read alot of bad reviews and I have traveled extensively. There is no need to insult a country and it's people. My advice is that preparation is everything. Take the time when you are at home to plan what you need and you will much better in the end. In fact, you may be able to help others less prepared.My holiday exceeded my expectations. The people were fantastic, happy, friendly, and genuine. They worked very long hours and yet were always accomodating. The hotel was great, the rooms were average so I upgraded to a spa suite in building #9. Usually very stressed out by the time I get a holiday, I needed the extra comfort (back injury) and quiet. Don't cheap out...treat yourself, it's your holiday. Make it the best you can.The grounds are beautifully manicured. There are natural sea grass beds growing in the water at the beach (not sea weed), but have you seen the hotel efforts to keep the beach clean? It is being trucked out constantly. There were always plenty of food choices. It was about 30 C and I didn't have much appetite anyway. I always enjoy the fruit and salads and lose about 10 pounds when I go to DR. There is so much to do, I don't focus on food. The water was amazing warm and I cannot wait to return, I would go in a heartbeat to this resort again. My third trip to DR and first visit to PUJ. DR is still the best deal out there, one of the reasons I keep going back, mostly the value, the people and the beauty. Incredibly clean all the time, I gave my maid some days off plus I tipped her in addition to the little gifts from home I brought. I also tipped other staff for good service, and I noticed quite a few other Canadians doing the same. It made me so proud to see the Canadians really care about the local people. Sometimes they didn't want to even take the money. We tip at home so why not there. A tip of $1 here and there makes a huge difference in their lifestyle. They cannot afford the basic things we take for granted and so many are single parent families. Sneakers or jeans for their children are luxuries they cannot afford.I suggest that you take in one of the fabulous spa treatments to help you relax early in your visit. There were just as many men coming into the hotel spa as women. Or there is a wonderful little spot for an outdoor massage that is private near the beach. Just remember paradise in a 3rd world country means it is not the same as home. Prepare yourself for your travels, research your destination and hotel, bring bug spray, medicines, etc. and you will have a better trip. If you go off site the standards are very poor, so be prepared, take some tissue from your room before you leave. (I have seen worse facilities in Italy that they call bathrooms..just a hole in the floor.) Antiseptic gel for disinfecting your hands is good to have too for travel in general. I did get sand flea bites on my legs when I forgot to spray before an evening walk, and they are nasty but they are not bed bugs. Tropical climates are great for bugs too. You can take traps for bugs to keep them away too. Take a small flashlight..power can go off in the DR. Polysporin cream and drops and a well equiped medical kit are a good idea. I always ask my doctor for antibiotics for my trip in case I need them. Sometimes getting sick on holiday can be prevented and it's just good to have this insurance as well as purchased travel insurance.Don't be too quick to complain, ask for what you want or need. Stay away from the complainers, it taints your outlook. There are plenty of small Spanish/English traveller books that allow you to learn the very basic words..it's not hard to try to communicate in their language. It can be a laugh. They are learning English at a rapid rate and as always their English is better than my Spanish. It is our responsibility to be understood not theirs. Be kind and thoughtful, they work hard, and are paid dirt wages to make our holiday a good one. This should be a joint effort. Be appreciative, patient and polite. If their world was the fast paced one that we live in we likely would not want to holiday there. Most of all, they are people and deserve respect, they are not our slaves as I've seen some tourists treat the staff (not Canadians though!) And they know the difference too, so be proud if you are a Canadian traveler because we are welcomed around the globe. Usually, I account for one morning or even one day to get a comfortable room. Priority #1. Evening arrivals seem to be the worst for getting stuck in a room you're not happy with. Next morning, be persistent but polite and you will be moved even if you have to wait for the room to be cleaned. I checked in during the day and I was taken to two different rooms but both were near the pool, so I opted for the quiet building #9. The rest comes pretty easy, deal with it right away if something comes up..and there are often small inconveniences. My balcony door didn't lock so I called front desk and it was fixed within minutes. For first time travelers, you have alot to learn anyway about traveling and being away from home so it doesn't really matter that much where you go. Most of all be happy you are on holidays and enjoy yourself. Soon enough you will be back to the rat-race.

<Content>Great relaxing time at the Grand Check-in: after our short 20 minute shuttle bus ride we were greeted by a friendly employee with drinks. The process was friendly and quick. The busboy took our luggage to our spacious and very clean room (#2210). The staff at the front desk were very helpful and patient, in particularly Melvin. We were there from May13th to the 20th, 2006. Room: Initially we had requested a room on the second or third floor with a view on the main pool. Instead we were given a room on the second floor in building 2 overlooking the gardens with a partial ocean view. We were given the option to change to a room with a view of the lazy river, but we opted to keep our room. I guess you can not please everyone, but this room was very adequate, spacious, clean and well decorated by our hard working maid. The water temperature and pressure was great, even at 05:15 am.The grounds: Well they are just fantastic, everywhere you look there is flowers, cactus of all types, palm trees, flowering bushes, narrow pathways leading to quieter shaded areas. The gardeners work very hard to keep everything looking so manicured and lush.The beach: One of the best beach I鈥檝e seen, palm trees and huts everywhere which provided decent shade. The quality of the sand is comparable to Cancun. The water is clear with some plant form growing away from the shore, which provided habitat to a variety of fish. There are a few small reefs close to the booay line. Seaweed or seagrass, only very little, and SO WHAT, the hard working crew picked it up around 07:00hrs. The food: 鈥淲indows鈥?provides service for all meals and was the very best with theme diners every night except closed for the Thursday night BBQ on the beach, which was memorable.鈥淒a Marios鈥?is an Italian restaurant with a romantic atmosphere, professional service and great food.鈥淭ex Mex鈥?is a south western type restaurant with a ranch style ambiance. They start you up with excellent nachos accompanied with their homemade salsa sauce. The beef medallion plate was done to perfection.鈥淭he Bar Grill鈥?outdoor covered patio restaurant, served great burgers, pizza, clubhouse sandwichesThe entertainment: Let me tell you, the members of the entertainment team are just the most friendly and hard working crew on the resort. They are up by 09:00hrs and still going at it with the evening show. They go around the pool/beach and take the time to chat and inquire if you want to participate with their various fun activities. I would like to thank Anthony who made our vacation that much more enjoyable. There are family oriented movies at 19:30hrs, and the very entertaining evening shows which starts at 21:30hrs and last one hour.The resort staff: everyone there, from the gardener, maids, restaurant and bar employees, front desk, busboys, entertainment staff, maintenance to the managers are the most friendly hard working people we have ever met in all the resorts we visited. All we can say is keep up the good work and we鈥檒l be back with our two teenagers next year.

<Content>There is better out there..... Flight- loved sunwing, 1st time flying with them as unfortunately we always get stuck with sardine service, er I mean skyservice...... Nice meal with wine, champagne to start.Hotel- quite nice, really no problems here. Pools and grounds are well kept. Entertainment is the usual dominican fare. Would really be nice to see some authentic local dancing, instead of too loud lip singing. The karoke bar upsrairs in the main lobby was fun, go early to get a seat. The drinks here were more premium that at the outdoor bars.Food- this is where we part ways. I would not return here because of the substandard quality. This was my 3rd trip to the D.R., so I've definately had better. To those who say, well there's always burgers, if I wanted that, I would of never left home and headed to the local McDonald's for dinner. Shopping- went to the mall in Bavaro thinking it was an indoor enclosed shopping mall as we were told at the front desk that it was. It is all open air . And ladies there's a real treat for us in the banos. No toilet paper and better yet, no toilet seats!. Also no soap or towels, enter at tyour own risk! Don't waste the cab fare. They basically have the same stuff as you can get on the beach out front.Beach- there is a lot of seaweed on this beach, and weeds in the water. Though the saving grace is about a ten minute walk up the beach to beautiful clear water where if you bring a bun the fish will almost eat out of your hands. On the down side- the motor boats come very close to you as this is their pathway between the coral, so be very careful especially is you are snorkelling. Summary- Nice hotel and grounds, but needs huge improvements in food quality.

<Content>Great Time Punta Cana Grand by Globalia former known as Sunscape Punta Cana GrandCheck in: No problems from airport to hotel it's about 20 minutes away when we arrived we were treated with drinks as we waited to check in. The bell boys brought our stuff up to our rooms.Hotel: The Hotel is a smaller resort (about 8 buildings 3 floors) but I found this to be nice everything was close, there are some renovations taking place as older building are getting a face lift and a casino is being completed, there were no problems with the construction and it's close to being finished but it was not disturbing at all. We were in Building 1 on the second floor. I would not suggest this building as it was the furthest from the beach and the entertainment stage/theatre was very close the shows started at 9:30 and went until about 10:30-11:00pm it was very very loud at this building if your at the shows it doesn't matter but if your trying to rest it can be annoying. Pools/Beach:There are 3 swimming pools the main pool with a swim up bar and two adult pools. The adult pool by building 7 was really nice the water was always nice and cool and it was very quiet and relaxing over there. The Beach was good can't understand what the seaweed problem was that i had seen complaints about it was more like a few blades of grass and the beach was not covered in it as said by others the hotel staff was always cleaning up the beachfront. The marina was very close to this hotel and when we were there a fishing tournament was taking place so there were more boats that usual, but I found the beach to be great, there was lots of chairs out and you can walk down the beach for a good way. There were some vendors selling stuff, and hotel staff going around asking if you wanted to participate in activites, some paid (parasailing, bananna boat) and others were free. They had beach volleyball everyday (team Canada was robbed, that ball did not hit the tree) Horsehoes, bacci ball, shuffleboard right on the beach, snorkeling, windsurfing, sailboats and kayaks all for free.Activities by the main pool, areobics, dancing etc. Lots of fish to be seen they swim by you in at the beach take swimming goggles if you have them, tehy also like bananas and breadRooms:If you want a really nice room ask for building 7 those rooms are new and really really nice with a jacuzzi on the balcony and swim out rooms right to the adult pool also very close to the beach, also building 4 was close to the beach. Our room at building 1 was nothing to write home about standard hotel room 2 dbl beds furthest from the beach but we were not there for the rooms so we didn't care as long as we had a place to sleep. They had free room service and a fridge in every room filled with water beer and pop everyday this was also free. You cannot drink the tap water only bottled water. There is a safe in each room for 15$ US for the week also you can request late check out the day before you leave, we did not leave for the airport until late afternoon and wanted to keep the room past noon, They say there is a fee of 35$ US for late check out but they never charged us for it.Staff:  Wow what can I say, I have never seen such happy people, and I have never seen such happy people who work so many hours. We would go for Breakfast at about 8am and the same host would still be there when we went back for dinner at 8pm still smiling really really great people. It was also nice that alot of the staff speak great english I always attempted to speak spanish to them but when I got stuck there were no problems as their English is better than my Spanish. They were always smiling and singing. I have read other reviews about leaving treats and gum and whatever, this is not necessary just leave them a tip for their hard work, a couple dollars goes a long way, how would you like to be rewarded with a pack of gum for cleaning a room everyday?...they can take a few dollars further than we can. They are also big big baseball fans down there if you have old baseball caps that you don't want take them with you they love the Red Sox but we did see some toronto maple leaf hats on the tour guides Trips: We went out on the snokeling tour which is right beside the hotel and we went on the Island tour to Sonora. The snorkeling tour right besid ethe hotel was great it was about 4 hours and you went out on a large two level glass bottom boat you went snorkeling with giant rays and sharks, Nurse sharks so they are not dangerous it was amazing to see them so close, then they took you over to an amazing beach to swim and drink then back to the hotel it was about a 4 hour tripSonora Island about an hour bus drive, then you went on a speed boat out to a natural Ocean swimming pool to swim, drink and see star fish, you then were taken out to the island for swimming drinking and bbq lunch which was amazing food, you relaxed and did some swimming then you took a catamaran back to the bus it was about 1 hour on the boat more drinks were served along with fresh fruit absolutely beautiful take your sun screen!! This trip was 85$ US per person, take a banana or piece of bread with you the fish go nuts for it and will eat it right out of your hand.Weather:Not a drop of rain all week it was about 30 average all week just perfect perfect weather not a cloud in the sky on any day beware of the sun take lots of sun screen or tanning lotion with you I ran out and they charge 20$ US in the gift shop for it.Food:The food was great every night the buffet Windows had a different theme, Japaneese, Italian, Mexican ect. there were a few other a la carte resturants you do not need reservations to eat there just go. On Thursdays they have a beach party it was really nice the buffet and everything is set up right down on the beach it was just beautiful. Entertainment:Everynight there is a different show the shows are pretty good dancing singing, magicians, they also have a piano bar thurday nights is karokee and they have a disco, they also show a movie on a big screen outside everynight, they have tennis courts that are open in the day and evening and the adult pool is open until 11pm.Overall it was a great place had a wonderful time this resort was worth the money spent. It was a great vacation. Anything else you can send me an email

<Content>Punta Cana Grand - A Grand Place to Stay Finally getting around to writing a review of our latest trip to the DR. We had been to Bahia Principe Tulum in February for a couple of weeks and had found the place too big and impersonal. This time around we decided to try a smaller hotel to see if this was a factor.Flight: We flew Sunwing from Ottawa, a new player in this area, and boy were we pleasantly surprised. More leg room, better food and free headphones (compared to Skyservice or cattle service as I refer to them). Will definitely fly with Sunwing again.Beach: Very nice and to be expected in PC. Plenty of chairs but people do play the towel game. Activities and equipment easy to access and plentiful. Little shops are located right next to the hotel and the prices there are reasonable if you know how to haggle. Towels are plentiful and can be exchanged by the main pool near the beach.Food: Very good and plenty of choice. The Italian restaurant was sublime but be warned its first come first served as there are no advance reservations. Don鈥檛 even try to buy your way in as someone tried it and ended up looking really dumb (this was great for the people already in line 飦?. The drinks were good and you can ask they to double up on the alcool. Rooms: The Deluxe Master Junior suites are great for couples and for those with 1 small child but are not good for 3 adults. We were switched to a deluxe ocean view with two queen sized beds and these were fantastic. Try and get a room on the third floor of the buildings as these have the roof as ceiling and the height gives you the feeling of a lot of extra space. Maid service was fantastic and they will try to accommodate any requests.Grounds: Well manicured and they were building extra amenities such as a Casino and places for more little shops. The shows at night are very good and are given in a new facility they have built. The shows were among the best we have seen and the Michael Jackson spectacle is not to be missed. All in all we really enjoyed this hotel, the concierge was very, very helpful in retrieving shoes we had misplaced and he went out of his way to ensure we had a great time in the hotel. We met a lot of new friends and are now convinced that the size of the hotel does matter鈥?smaller is warmer and encourages social interaction a lot more.

<Content>Fun trip, but manage your hotel expectations... We had a great time on our vacation, but there are some things about this hotel that you will want to know. The hotel is old. It has everything that you need to have a great time, but the wear and tear is evident in almost everything.Rooms- The rooms are very spacious with four poster beds. However, our linens were old and this was evident in the lint balls all over the sheets/pillowcases. Additionally, the flooring throughout is tile. Not a problem, except that it almost has a cave effect in terms of sounds from the hallway or wherever echoing. If you are traveling with children or are a light sleeper, I would try to get up on a higher floor to avoid the late night hall traffic.Food- Manage your expectations. If you are envisioning a plethora of fresh seafood, you will be disappointed. The only fish we saw, and the catch of the day everyday, was grouper (heavily buttered or sauced), despite fishermen carrying around 4 foot long mai mai on the beach. There are plenty of options for food, and the a la carte places were good, but everything kind of blends together. It was fine, but if I would have ordered any of the items at a real restaurant where I was paying, I wouldn't return.Gym/Spa- You will not need to use the sauna at the spa, just go to the gym and try running in there. The gym was lacking: one treadmill, one stairstepper, one spinning bike, old weights. It was very uncomfortable to be in there with the heat and humidity. We never used the spa. The facility was decent, but the prices were the same as a nice place at home so there wasn't much of a point ($65-80 for massage, $75-125 for facial). The tennis courts and equipment were very nice and up to date. Staff- I cannot say enough about the staff. They were fantastic and did everything that they could to make you comfortable. Great, friendly people. I almost feel bad writing bad things about their hotel since I enjoyed them so much.Bars- There are plenty and getting drinks is not a problem. The drinks are great, also. The disco, piano bar, kareoke are all the same room, rotating themes depending on the night. They were fun. There is an outdoor bar/patio in the center of the action, right near the pool, that is very comfortable to sit at in the evenings.Overall, we would probably not go back to this hotel. However, it was a great deal for the money.

<Content>Amazing:) This resort was absolutly amazing!!The beach was VERY clean, many chairs for everyone ( meaning you did not have to wake up at crack of dawn to get one) haha, lots of huts.The pool was also very clean, swimming to the bar was GREAT:), there were always aerobic exercises in the pool, volleyball and entertainment rite beside the pool. which was fun, the music was awesome!Hotel rooms were very nice and well kept! always fresh drinks braught to us and clean towels! (flower pedals spread throughout the washroom/sink) that was very cute:) Always got hot water- no complaint with that. thank god! hahaStaff was very friendly except a few at the front desk in the lobby. But thats ok, we were a bit cranky because our flight kept getting delayed without any notice :s .. FOOD - i cant even begin to tell you the variety of food provided. The windows buffet is incredible! none of us got sick. The food was fresh and very good. Service was great!Nightly entertainment was great! Anthing Can Happen nights are hilarious! and very enjoyable haha. Aswell as the Michael Jackson show. All the shows in general were very entertaining. Also the night club was good. Good music. I didn't enjoy the piano bar to much. but thats ok!The entertainers were a pleasure to be around and chat with.ANTHONY and SPAGHETTI (jason) were hilarious. Very nice guys! i miss them:(Shopping was great. Of course get expected to get hounded, but hey they got to make their money somehow! just remember. BARGAIN BARGAIN BARGAIN! :) lol.. (DANNY's shop was great!)Overall I would recomend this resort to anyone. The people are very friendly, the atmosphere is great and very intimate. Its good for familes, couples and friends. Definitly staying longer than 1 week next time! Anyone deciding to go.. Enjoy. U'll have a blast!

<Content>Interesting experience The resort itself was really nice. Do do most of the really fun activities like quading you had to pay on average 100us per couple and most actitivites were a 15 minute drive away or more. Take lots of cash! We found it almost impossible to get any. ATM's wouldnt take our cards and we finally had to pay 10 % to take out from front desk in pesos and then we paid more to get it in US from the shops on the beach. Be prepared to be harrassed at the shops too, they will try to rip you off so badly and they push push and push. I know all about being ripped off becuase ive been to other countries but never this pushy. I would definatly go back to the dominican just not this particular resort. Our room was less that impressive, for our honeymoon is was not the kind of room you looked forward to coming back to.

<Content>The Gospel on the Punta Cana Grand scale 1-10 1= useless 5= average 10 = excellent the grounds- 7 lots of plants and trees. very tropical looking. showing some were on concrete around the pool area. nice looking buildings all one color-cream color, not that multi color Jamaican crap like some others resort up the beach.the pool - 6 OF 10 not deep enough for diving, paint chipping in some areas, size good temperature good, swim up bar pretty basic,the drinks 9 out of 10 could be a 10 if they were more consistent, at least 15 different drinks that they have on a list and different feature every day. the only place that i can say i can feel the alcohol in the all inclusive drinks at any resort so far. the food 5 out of 10 some days better than others, do not waste your time standing in line to get into any of these restaurants not worth it. you want to try, just walk in at the right time otherwise go to windows buffet. mexican night was the best for me at windows buffet. watch closely for problems with cross contamination with the bbq grill serving raw meat at the windows buffet. they just don't understand how people could get sick from this. we paid attention to this, avoided lunch meats and salad and never had any problem at all. highly advise to pay close attention to the utensils they use to serve from the bbq grill in windows. American grill you can have better food at taco bell or your local pet store. Italian restaurant get the stuff polo it's actually good. beach restaurant or grill stick with the cheeseburgers pizza is the worst i seen anywere. overall other have said that this resort is better than others in Dominican. i believe them, but i have had way better variety at the rui resorts in mexico the beach  7 out of 10 awesome area for sun hogs because of the constant breeze with this region comes from the north atlantic. the sand is white powder never gets hot. for swimming 5 out of 10 simply put too much seaweed for my standards, in fact some days worst than others but constant. if your looking for pristine perfect beaches this punta cana area is not your place. but lots of shade from trees and great sandy area for beach people very clean and lots of chairs and huts. the rooms 5 of 10 . as this hotel is only 8 years old the rooms are getting worn a little some more than others. i stayed in building 4 3rd fl recommend this or building 7 more money, but totally different class of rooms mable and jacuzzi tub, with there own swim out pool around the building. no good ocean view from this building though. tile on floors and bathroom walls looked like the person was just practising how to install tile very pooorrr quality work and equal to a super 8 motel in decor not the marble and granite like in mexico. clean and sufficient with no problems with a/c, smells or hot water in my building. mini bar is usless not much other than beer or pop and they don;t keep very cold at all.room service 24 hrs had great experience ready in 10 minutes only tried it once though could be a fluke, but it's nice to have for sure. Entertainment 3 of 10 not even close to the entertainment that i am used to yes the Jackson is the highlight but again i seen a better one.daytime pool area entertainment is there but not enough variety. beach area has better than average for games and sports and kids area.the check in and staff 8 of 10 checked in around 2 pm had great service and quickly to the room. dont'; expect this all the time if you arrive at 12 to 3 am forget it you will not get the same level of service at that time of the morning. overall i found no problem with the staff only the maids have a problem with English but who cares, all you need is the servers bartenders and they are better with English than most places ive seen in Mexico. trip excursions 8 of 10 - lots to do on this island if you don鈥檛 like to sit around bring a pocket full of money. only took one trip to sanona $85 us island highly recommend it for fun not for snorkeling. for that see sonya at the beach house and for diving. you really don't need any peso's just bring us $$ and that all you need forget that Canadian money they don't want it.OVERALL RATING7 out of 10 if your looking for great value and can get 7days for $1100 to $1250 then this is your type of place FOR PUNTA CANA nothing wrong overall, other than things i mentioned. if your looking for 4.5 to 5.5 star resort move on and pay more. recommend the Iberostar down past barvaro beach.this resort is 8 years old and currently under new ownership and now being upgraded with new casino and gift shops and spa area. on a average day it is a 3.5 star resort and a good day a 4 star. in the future with some maintenance and a few tweaks and upgrades it could be a 4.25 start resort.would i go back not right now other places want to check out on other islands. but definitely in the future years would like to explore more of the Dominican area.shopping go to barvaro beach area take taxi $15 each way. rainy day activity go to manatee park $25 like good shows.flew sunwing out of London ont best airline ever flown on.. any other questions jeffc@porchlight.ca

<Content>Blame yourself if you didn't enjoy your stay! Just got back last Friday night (May 5th) from our week long stay and the Grand Flamenco. My wife and I went for both RR as well as some exciting experiences as well. We got both without any problems. We read all of the reviews, even back to 04 and became very nervous about what to expect. We even upgraded to the Royal Club 2 weeks out in fear of a bad experience(See below Royal Club). I have one thing to say if you heading here or anywhere else for that matter, the issues/problems you're reading in these review primarily stem from the vacationesr themselves. Too picky, absurd expectations, FAILURE TO PLAN, poor attitude, and so on will easily destroy a vacation. Don't listen to the negative. Just do your due diligence, KNOW where you are going, and KNOW what you're purchasing. It's that easy. Enough of my preface.....Without getting into details, I'd like to mention some of the things I wish I knew prior to arriving in Punta Cana as well as the resort itself. I'll also mention things we did that made a world of difference in making our trip SMOOTH! See above: FAILURE TO PLAN!1. You will need $14.00/USD/person to get through the airport; it is a DR entry fee.2. We booked through Expedia and arranged our Airport - Resort Taxi fair for $20.00/person. Screw trying to wheel with the locals or pray they'll be on time. Our boys were polite, on time, drove fine, and even sang us some tunes! 3. ROYAL CLUB: If you're cheap, don't complain about anything when it is not up to your liking. I'm sure you've hear the old saying... You get what...... yada yada. We freaked out and paid an extra $500.00 total for our Royal Upgrade. In hindsight, I would've done without question knowing what I know now. Why? Private buildings with thier own water heaters, great rooms with nice bathrooms. Ours even had 2 showers! Private check-in with champagne. Private conceirge service to make your a la carte reservations, room needs, or whatever. The resort is so big, the front desk can't give you that kind of service. Private restaurant!!! This really made it worth it for us. The main eatery/commons is more or less a massive feeding lot and nothing less. An earlier review said it best, the food is there to keep you alive while you're on vacation. Someone who critiques a massive buffet common isn't being realistic about it. The Royal restaurant was perfect. There was never more than 6-10 people there and there were about 3 waiters! Mimosas, Smoked Salmon Scrambled Egg Tower, Shrimp Omeletes, Nutella!, Tons of Awesome pastries! Lunch and dinner were great although we tried to get out to the a la carte's and empanadas stand. Shrimp skewers, Tenderloin, Duck, and lots more. Food was never an issue! The club also has a private area on the beach. I could hit the beach at anytime and ALWAYS get a shade hut or chairs. The Royal Club gives you a way to escape the madness of people when you need it! ... Oh yeah, free internet in the cigar room and unlimited towels all day long. No checking in and returning towels! ... and there is also a saftey deposit box included in your room, very handy and a necessity!4. Dinners: The a la cartes are fun and a way to change things up. We only did Mexican and Chinese so I can't speak for the others. I'm from Iowa and don't need to know what Dominican cattle tastes like, I'm sure it's fine though! Both Chinese and Mexican were great. We preferrd Mexican because of the salsas (nice and hot). Food was great as well, not sure if the Fajitas are all they're cracked up to be, but it is all opinion. I really enjoy the Rock Bass. One weird thing is that they kept serving everyone wine at the Mexican which doesn't really work out. Get on with the Margarita and tell them you don't want wine!Three of the nights we ate empanadas for an appetizer and then walked over and shared a pizza. Both are really good. Empanadas are great! Plenty of food too!5. Excursions: If you are looking for great day with food and cocktail (plenty of them!), go to Saona Island! Unbelievable day that we are still talking about. Get ready though, it really is a long day. Bring plenty of snacks and water for the bus ride in the morning, we didn't and suffered a bit. When you stop at the ancient city around 9:30am, eat some pizza if you plan on drinking. We didn't and paid for it later! You'll get on speed boats, party in the blue lagoon, relax and eat lunch on a private  georgeous beach, and then sail  dance on a catamaran all the way home. Great chance to meet different people too! Got home around 8:00pm and my wife put me to bed early that night. Had a little to much fun and wore myself out! Get the pizza!We did the VIP fishing trip too! We nailed a Mahi Mahi, a couple of Tuna, and our partner boat caught a massive Blue Marlin! We were back on the beach at the Flamenco by1:00pm All of the excursions are around $50-$100 USD/person. Get out of the resort and have some fun!6. The market outside the resort is rediculous. Bad. It is about 20-30 stores, all with the same crap and the same salesman saying, Let me ask you one question? Waste of time and very annoying. 7. Tipping: I didn't see where tipping would get you much more of anything except for a few employees and with room service. I left $5.00/day for room service and never needed anything. She left me more Rum than I could drink and even left me a bottle of Dewar's one day! Outstanding! You'll know the employees around the resort who deserve the tips. They're the ones who smile, make you feel welcome, and converse with you! They are very enjoyable! 8. Seaweed is not a problem: For crying out loud, it is the ocean and guess what?, there is sea-weed in there! ... and guess what happens to some of it? Yup, it washes up on the beach. I can't believe what some people complain about! FYI: There is a lot in the morning, at about 9:00am. It is cleaned by 10:00pm and slowly builds up the rest of the day. There is not much at all. It's natural. Some complaint make it seem like there are piles of it. Nothing but BS from those whiners! Personally I thought the beaches were absolutely beautiful and relaxing. Breezy, sunny, great sand, and warm waters.9. Cigars: If you really like cigars, as you probably know, buy off of an authorized vendor and not the market folk. I've never seen so many fake cigars of all brands in my life. Bring your own if you want to be safe. I even tried a few out fron the resort store and I didn't think they were anything to write home about! Very overpriced too! There is a great store in the airport on the departure side that is authorized and had some great sticks! I bought my keepers there! If your going to pay a premium price, be positive you're getting the premium product!Things to bring with you(or not too bring): Plenty of sunscreen! 15, 30, 60! , leave jewelry and valuables at home(wear a fake wedding ring, watch, etc.), camera, snacks, crackers, mouthwash!!!, hand soap/wipes, we crought CIPRO just in case, goggles/snorkling set up, plenty of $1.00  some $5.00 bills, othe cash for personal spending we brought ($400 total and brought $210 home). A great place for families and couples and not really a singles or party resort! Many different nationalites, but that is part of what is fun about it! Have fun with it and relax! I'd be happy to go back although I would like to see other places! Who knows, I probably will be back because I know things will be fine!Enjoy yourself, relax, and watch out for the amounts of rum they pour in drinks! You'll be looking at 3 Atlantic Oceans instead of one! If you ask me, that's just more bang for your buck! Salut and try the Mama Juana! Kind of like the Dominican Jaeger! BZZZZZZ!Out!

<Content>Great time at Punta Cana Grand, nice resort, just relax! It truly amazes me the vast differences of opinion from one review to the next about the same place. Personally, I believe the holiday that you end up with is what you make of it. I have travelled to many resorts, both all inclusive, and non, and I found the Punta Cana Grand to be just fine. First of all you must bear in mind, you get what you pay for. The resort is according to the travel magazines a 4+ star resort. It's really probably more like a 3+ star. We paid $878 + $275 tax, and for that price, the resort is fine. I did see other travel deals to PCG earlier for approx $700 plus tax, that would have been a great deal. For that price however, we did fly into LaRomana airport, which is about an hour and a half by bus to the resort. (not an unpleasant ride however, a real eye opener to what Domincan life is really like. Just be thankful you are from whereever you are from, and just visiting a nice all inclusive resort).Resort; Lovely grounds, beautiful lobby, nice pools, (shallow however, all 3 feet deep, therefore by late in the afternoon, the water in the pools are not very refreshing, and get a bit skanky with drinks spilled, sun tan oils, and whatever other fluids might have found there way in there!). The power did go off about 5 times throughout the week, but only briefly for the most part. Thursday evening, just prior to the beach party, the power was out for about 15 minutes, and then there was no water for a shower for about an hour. Oh well, have another drink and wait! Rooms; stayed in room 4311. Large room, high vaulted ceiling. Bathroom was adequate, small shower with lower than average water pressure, and some hit and miss hot water. No question, when you look at the pictures of the rooms, and compare buiding 4, to the new building 7, there is a vast difference. I have read that you can upgrade to the new building for $350US for the week? I'm not sure of that, it was never offered to me, and I would have refused.As I mentioned, this resort was budget priced, and to pay an additional 50% for a nicer looking room, just wasn't that important to me. Food; Overall the food was fine. No question, some meals/dishes were better than others. Everyone has different tastes. We enjoyed DaMario's restaurant the best, and went to dinner there 3 times. You can NOT make reservations, it's showand go. Some good pasta/seafood dishes, and a couple of good appetizers, (and yet, one nite really enjoyed the ceasar salad, the next nite, way over powering taste of anchovies, with a whole anchovie on the side). Same restaurant, same salad ordered, completely different taste. But overall, you know what? No big deal! The American grill, Tex/Mex restaurant was our least favorite, but again, maybe just what we ordered that nite. The ribs were terrible, very fatty, with little meat. Oh well. Enjoyed lunch at the beach garden daily, fine burgers, pizza, fries, sandwiches, etc...no problems at all. I will take issue with the wine however. Red wine is usually my evening drink of choice, and it really was barely drinkable. I'll admint I'm a bit of a wine snob, but usually I can drink swill with the best of them, once I get a few glasses down. Again, even though it was the same wine every nite, I did manage to drink it better some nites than others. Oh well. They do have a reserve wine list, but I'm not going to pay $30-$40 US for a $12 bottle of wine, when I'm at an all-inclusive resort. If that were the case, I should have paid $500 more, and gone to a truly 5 star resort with better wine! Oh well, no problems! Staff/Service; The staff were just fine. I don't know how people could have a problem with the staff, unless they themselves are walking/lying around with a sour face, and then I'm sure the staff can read that from their face, and return the expression. A few noteable top notch staff were, Paco, at the front desk, Jacqueline from the entertainment team, Pedro at the beach bar, (excellent breakfast Ceasars!) and Beachpapi at the main bar, YA Man! We spend most days at the main pool, sunning, drinking, just relaxing, and it was great. You do however have to get up off your butt, and get your own drinks, no big deal. We tipped the housekeeping staff, $5 the first day, then $2 or $3 per day, but I don't think it really mattered, they did an adequate job. Same with the bartenders, tipped sometimes, $1 or $2 for the round, then not, didn't really matter. They appreciated the tips for sure, but it did not seem to affect the service/drink quality. If you wanted more booze in your drinks, then just say mucho rum or vodka or whatever, and you get it. No problems!Beach; the beach was nice, and no question, there was a lot of sea grass washing up on shore, right in front of this resort, but they were cleaning it up all the time. And I say sea grass, instead of sea weed, as it wasn't the slimy, stinky stuff like in Ontario. If you were inclined, you could just walk up the beach about 15-20 minutes, and there were places with no sea grass at all, and the water was clearer. Plus, it was a nice walk.Overall, the resort is just fine. There are nicer, but for the price it was completely satifactory,and I would not hesitate to reccomend the resort, or go there again, provided the price was right. Relax, have fun, that's what you should be there for, Austa Luego!

<Content>Great Resort!!!!! I have travelled to Cuba, Mexico (twice), Punta Cana (last year), Florida, Portugal, and Spain. This trip by far has been the best trip in a long time for me. I was in Punta Cana last year and stayed at one of the Riu resorts and got robbed, the year before that I went to Mexico and came back with shigella which is a strand of e-coli. My boyfirend and i decided to give Punta Cana another try because i absolutely fell in love with the beaches when I was there last, and I am glad we did. Punta Cana Grand was a breath of fresh air. I know that some of you have written some bad reviews about being sick, bad maintenance, or whatever and I totally understand what that feels like to have something crappy like this happen to you on vacation, but I have come to see that you can have good and bad everywhere and anywhere you go, even if it's a five star!! My boyfriend and I stayed in building one which is right across from building seven. I was quite impressed with our view of one of the pools. Our chamber maid cleaned our room immaculately everyday, we also left her a dollar every day along with a small treat of some sort once in a while (granola bar, hard candy, whatever). Remember these people work hard everyday and unlike you or us the vacationers, they have to work all day in the heat. Therefore I highly recommend that you tip here and there for your services, whether at the buffet, a la carte restaurants, or the bars. These people do not have the money or means to live like we do and they could use the cash.Some reviews that I have read have said that the people at this resort were not very friendly or accomodating. First of all, you are on vacation and a different country (which means the culture is different) what's the hurry anyway, also don't expect the RITZ, YOU DIDN'T PAY FOR THE RITZ!!!!The service at times may not be what we the fast food mcdonaldization society are used to but don't forget this is a third world country and these people work long hours everyday and sometimes don't get paid for all the hours they have put in, they watch us have fun and lye around with our drinks all day--HOW HAPPY WOULD YOU BE!!!! I found the service to be good for a place like this and the people were always friendly and you know why???-because no matter what I was always super frienldy to them and got to know them so that there was more of a personal relationship with them. Do not go there with the attitude that you are above them and do greet them with smiles and kindness everyday and you will get the same in return.The food was great, just what I wanted. My boyfriend and I didn't eat dinner at the buffet, so I can't comment about their dinners, but the a la carte restaurants were very good. If you are not picky then you will enjoy what this resort has to offer. Drinks are great!! Don't forget your themos mugs though, the slushy drinks do melt fast if you don't have one. The pools and beach were nice. If you go at a time where there happens to be more seaweed than normal, a five minute walk down the beach and you will find a public beach with less seaweeed and gorgeous water. The shows were really good, and funny, but a little short.Must see the Michael Jackson show, the costumes and choreography were excellecent.Disco was good, closes a little early, but they play awesome music!!!My boyfirend and I did go on a excursion, not with sunwing though, it was with the other rep at the hotel, which even though you flew with sunwing you can go with the other rep company if your travel rep isn't around when you want to book. I highly recommend taking the country (Jurassic tour). You get to visit typical Dominican home, schools, drive through country and learn about their economy, see city centres, go to a country ranch and ride horses, they also have other animals that you can take pictures (parrots, monkey, snakes, etc. ), visit a shopping district, where they also show you how to make cigars, and finally you visit a beautiful beach on the caribbean side and go boogie boarding. Well worth the all day trip. Very informative, and nice and at the same time you can drink the whole time.Maybe some of you with all these nitpicky complaints about this resort should have taken this excursion and maybe you could appreciate the people and their culture a lot more!!!!All in all, a good resort with lots to offer, or not if you're like me and the type to read a book while sipping on a pina coloada in the sun, enjoying the breathtaking view of the beach. Just so you know I am 28 yrs old, and my boyfirend is 33 yrs old, and we found the resort to be good mix in age groups, as well as most of the vacationers at this resort during our stay were Canadian--EH!! Therefore we had a great time!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Real paradise! First of all, thanks to Megan, Michelle and Brianna for their advise on this hotel.We stayed at Punta cana Grand from april 23 til 30. Hotel:The hotel was very clean and the check in was fast for us. We arrived at 1h00 pm and it tooks us 15 min to get our room. We were about 20 couples arrived at the same time. The satff at the reception were very nice, they gave us a nice room as our request. In fact, we reserve the building 4 ont the 3rd floor because you have hot water and a beautiful view on the resort and on the beach. The guy at the reception tried to sell us the VIP room, which cost 35$ US a night. It's not worth it because you spend only a little time in the room. Room:The room is ok. I mean, it's really clean and big. We had the 3rd floor so the ceiling was high which is nice. We tip the maid everyday, so we had our mini bar full load and new towel. And perhaps because we tipped she did our room first around 10h00 in the morning... some people had their room done only at 4h00. We also paid for the safe. It's 15$ US but it's worth it. We kept our passport, camera and money inside all the time. Restaurant:There is 3 a la carte restaurant on the resort. Beach garden is the one on the beach were you can have lunch and dinner. The american grill was one of our best! A western atmosphere were the steak is awesome! The Da Mario's restaurant is an italian speciallity. We had a beef medallion, which melt in the mouth! Excellent! And the window restaurant is a buffet were the food is also excellent and has a different food every night. The food in general is a 5 stars! We went to cuba last year, and the food at punta cana is way better than what we had!Beach:The beach is nice, but not very large. there is 2 other resort next to ours. The water is clear, and there's not a lot of waves. If you go to the deep blues side of the sea, it's a little dangerous because we heard that some water snakes with poison was living down the water. So be careful if you do some snorkling. there's also a lot of little gray and yellow fish. They are cute and you can bring banana or bread for them. People reserve the hut and the chairs in the morning, but we never did. They were plenty chairs available. Animation:The shows were excellent! We enjoyed all shows and especially the one on saturday which is the Micheal Jackson presentation. On thursday, they was a beach party. all restaurant are close and there's a huge barbecue party directly on the beach. After the dinner, there a nice show on the beach. We had fun that night! Drinks:the drinks are delicious! There's a drink of the day, so if you don't know what to drink beside pina colada and sex on the beach, the barman will have the pleasure to offer you an exotic mix! You'll like it! You don't need to bring a mug, because the drinks are enough for one person. And at the restaurant a la carte, they don't wait to give you a refill... they are not cheap on that. So we will go back for sure in a few years. For now, we have other place to visit.Feel free to email me if you have any questions on this resort.

<Content>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly!!! This was our second visit to the Punta Cana Grand. Last year this resort was under other management and we had a great time. The new management seems more concerned with construction than customer service. Additionally, the new management seems more concerned with their bottom line ($) than the happiness of their guests!The Good- The Spa staff is excellent. The housekeeping staff is excellent. The View from our room (4324) was excellent.The Bad- The food has taken a turn for the worse at DaMarios, (we loved it last year, but really nothing special this year). The food at other resturants was rarely hot when it should have been, especially breakfast. The room was still the same old run down room with the added bonus of ANTS, we requested an upgrade to building 6 or 7 (offering to pay much more) but were told they had nothing available, that was hard to believe since the resort was no where near as busy as last year and there are now 2 additional buildings. The staff (other than spa and housekeeping) have very poor attitudes. Last year there was a great resturant host, Johnathan who made every guest feel special, always remembering names, etc. Sadly, Johnathan is no longer there, and the familiar faces were ones that were miserable last year and seemed to be worse this year. The rooms electricity is now run with your room card/key, so when you are not in the room your a/c and minibar is turned off, so your beverages are never cold. The all night bar, (11pm-6am) was right below our room and the more the bar crowd had to drink the louder they got and the less we slept. The new management did away with the fresh fruit cart on the beach, that was something that we really enjoyed last year. The Ugly- If the first person you were to meet was Elismo, at the conciere desk, you would have a very bad opinion of the Dominican people. Lucky for us we already knew what wonderful people the Dominicans are and we did not have to deal with Elismo until the last day of our trip. Elismo is the most disrespectful person we have ever met, he would not even look at us when he was talking to us, and he was lying about a situation we had with him to his manager. Between Elismo and the man working at the gift shop you would get the impression that the resort is a bit shady, asking for money for things that were not required to pay for and not returning money that was due to be refunded. This raises some RED FLAGS about who you can trust at the resort. Be aware that if you do an excursion and they make a DVD of your day, and tell you that you can watch it before paying the balance to make your decision, and if you don't want it you get your deposit back, you may not get your deposit back without a fight and the gift shop/public relations desk may try to get you to pay more money just to watch it. Vacations are for unwinding and refreshing and when it ends with Elismo all that is erased!!! After all that did we ever even get an apology, NO!!!! So STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!! This is the way we were treated and the resort knew that we were returning guests.

<Content>Great Hotel- Amazing spot! I would have to agree.... I do not understand the bad reviews. I went down to Punta Cana for the second time with another couple, the first being a horrible experience at the Occidental Grand Flamingo where I swore never to return thus this time around I was very sceptical about what I was going to get and to my amazement, the GLOBALIA PUNTA CANA GRAND was one of the best vacations I have been on thus far. The weather was cooperative to boot! not one day of Rain!The look of the hotel for starters was very pleasant and the rooms we stayed in were very nice and kept fairly clean. The in room bar fridge was always kept full and we were never without supplies.The food at the resort proved to be excellent and we all agreed that we could not complain about it as we were always stuffed and wanting more.The beef medallions at the Tex-Mex restaurant proved to be the best dish at the resort, second to the fajitas!! For lunch the chicken sandwich was so good I had it every day!The 24hour bar and snack bar were also very good, the lunch menu and 24 snacks where always very tasty and there was plenty of variety to choose from. You would have to be super super picky not to find something you liked.The staff was super nice, mostly the Activity Team, which always kept us laughing, smiling and with plenty of things to participate in. Sexy Spaghetti, Mr Mike and Jacqueline definitely go out of their way to make you feel at home and also ensure you are having a good time,,the best entertainment staff in all the resorts i have ever been too, and i have been to many.The only thing was that the beach was not the greatest, but this was due to alot of seaweed being washed ashore the first few days but the last 2 days the water was beautiful.All in all I Highly recommend this resort to anyone... all ages. I will definitely being going back to this place the next time we plan our vacation.SR,MC, JR, JG ~ from 4 very happy travelers!

<Content>A True Review First off let me say that I am very well travelled, I have been to Alcapulco twice, Cozumel, Mayan Riviera, Panama (central America not Florida), Greece, Italy, and now Punta Cana. I am 26 years old female and my fiancee and I decided to go to the Punta Cana Grand along with another couple from April 21 to 28th. I'll start off with the positives,The weather was awesome, not a drop of rain until night time and even then only lasted a few minutes. The resort itself is very pleasing to the eye and kept relatively clean. The beach and ocean are beautiful and you can walk quite a ways down for even clearer water. Our maid was great and the room we had was very nice and we had a huge balcony.Ok now onto the negatives.....We chose Sunwing (canada) for the first time, the only good thing I found about this was the movies in the plane and then constant T.V. shows afterward to pass the time away. We had our rep Luis at the resort who was NEVER AROUND even though he claimed his only day off was Thursday!!! So we could never book any excursions through him as he mentioned at the orientation. The FOOD was horrible, I am not a picky eater in the least and the second day of vacation i ended up being rushed by ambulance to the hospital for 2 days. They said it was a tropical virus but the hospital was jammed full of canadian/americans with the same problem as I. Later that week after finally being able to leave my room I spoke to others at the resort and every single person had been sick as well for at least 1 day. Out of all the places I have been (even Mexico) I have never been sick ever or have seen so many people from one resort get sick!!!The ACTIVITIES suck, my fiancee is not like me, he is not content to sit around on the beach all day, he likes to play volleyball/soccer any sort of game outside to keep him occupied, there are beach volleyball nets and a soccer area on the beach but NONE of these were EVER USED!!! As well as a trampoline that never even got flipped over to use. Finally on our second to last day, my fiancee took it upon himself to go on the microphone and organize his own games!!! And everyone responded and were so happy to see some sort of activity. He did it on the last day too and everyone was sad to see him go because now who is going to get the games together???The couple we were with, thank goodness we had adjoining ROOMS, because for the whole trip their toilet DIDN'T FLUSH!! It wasn't clogged, it was just not working. After calling numerous times FOR DAYS no one came to fix it!! They used ours the whole time...but what would of they done if we weren't with them?? WHo ever checks into the room next will unfortunately have a nasty surprise...SORRY!! Their key also after 2 days didn't work to get them into their room...after taking it down to reprogramme it they were told there is nothing we can do....and to go through our room to get theirs...WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID THE WHOLE VACATION!! After being sick i wasn't allowed to have any meat or anything like that just toast...and they wouldn't accomodate me they kept bringing my hamburgers and fries saying just pick off the meat and eat the bun!!!! Isn't toast easier to make?? The last thing i wanted to see when sick was a hamburger!! My fiancee finally flipped out downstairs and they brought me toast...once! Upon checking out, they tried to charge us for phonecalls that were never made! We bought an internet card....and the funny part is i was in the hospital when the phonecalls were made!!!! haha must of been a ghost. One lady on our bus with her 2 boys said she had been travelling to Punta Cana for 10 years and her husband was so upset over this resort he left 2 days early!! She would never be back either.The nightlife is what you make of it...the disco was fun and the DJ will play anything you request...the kareoke was fun...and the beach party was nothing to write home about, they will tell you it's all night but it's over by 9:30pm. The waitstaff are polite and funny if you take the time to get to know them and are polite to them...no need for rudeness they work 15 hours a day for 25 days a month!!! So please have patience. The drinks were yummy...even though I wasn't allowed to drink after getting ill...the one day i had them they were good. There is much more I can say...but I'll leave that to my friends the other couple we were with.......please if you want good food...a fun time...and not to get ill don't go here!!!!All in all...I definitely WON'T BE BACK TO THE PUNTA CANA GRAND!!! Too bad I couldn't have seen it when it was Sunscape..now another company Globalia owns it..and the stuff you see in the pics are not there!! Friends of mine stayed at the Bahia Principe Punta Cana at the same time and loved it!!! I will not be back to Punta Cana for a long time....but if I decided to go...I would spend an extra few hundred bucks for a 5 star resort...like the Bahia!! I never complain ever!!! I n fact before going on this vacation I made fun of all the people with their little complaints saying they were high maitenence....but now I understand.....it's not one little thing it's all the little things every single day that add up to a major thing by the end of the vacation!!!!! Well at least if nothing else....I have a great tan to show for it!!

<Content>Loved Punta Cana Grand My wife and I just returned from a week's stay at the Punta Cana Grand hotel. It was great! In reading some of the negative reviews of this place, I find it hard to believe those people are talking about the same resort. We have been to five other hotels in the Dominican Republic, a couple in Cuba, and one each in Mexico and Barbados. Punta Cana Grand was the nicest by far. The staff are quiet but friendly and our room overlooking the ocean was to die for. A big four poster bed and no need to use the air conditioning with a lovely soothing breeze blowing through the patio doors. Fantastic food was offered in 3 a la carte restaurants and a wonderfully varied buffet. The beach barbecue offered yummy burgers and some days a huge paella. Emi kept our coffee cups full in the morning and Antonio kept our wine glasses full in the evenings. There are three lovely pools but our favorite spot was the beach where a steady sea breeze kept the temperature just right for Canadians. The water sports were a lot of fun and you can walk forever up a powdery beach with turquoise water.There is a small market for crafts and souvenirs but the vendors are not pushy at all. I even learned to dance a little meringue, salsa and bachata which isn't bad for a gringo with no hip action. The price was quite reasonable and we highly recommend Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>Punta Cana Grand -- loved it!!! I don't understand the negative reviews of this hotel. I travel quite a bit, and the staff at the Punta Cana Grand was the friendliest of ANY property I have stayed in the Caribbean. They were wonderful and continually went out of their way to please us. All I can say is when we visited, there were MANY guests (I won't say from where but they were NOT from the US or Canada) who were extremely rude to the staff. If you treat the staff like that...how on earth do you expect to be treated in return?? We had EXCELLENT service 鈥he people were always helpful.Our room was beautiful (we stayed in building 7 -- the newest one) and the maids did an impeccable job. We didn鈥檛 even tip until the end and they took excellent care of us. The bartenders were great, and the staff at the Italian restaurant was wonderful.The beach was nice and clean, the pools were extremely well-maintained and the food quite good for an all inclusive. Excellent value!!!!Sonya at the dive shop sold me on my first dive and I absolutely loved it. The dance instructors were friendly and funny.Absolutely no complaints. If you can't have an enjoyable vacation at the Punta Cana Grand...it's your own fault.

<Content>relaxing and friendly we went to the punta cana grand for our anniversary. it was very romantic and friendly and beautiful. we will definitely be going back! the food was great, the drinks are top shelf and plentiful, the resort was clean and the staff was sooo friendly and helpful. there was a stocked mini-bar in our room with sodas and local beer--included in the price--bonus! the a/c in our room was not working to capacity, and we reported it, but never had any resolution. beware of the guys at the beach shops--they are like vultures once u visit them, and they will try to befriend u and ask u to bring them food and drinks from the resort. we took a trip in to the town of Higuey--we hired a local guy to drive us and show us around--definitely a good look in to the culture of urban dominica. there was a great mix of ppl at the resort--ppl from europe, us and canada, and all ages young and old. enjoy!

<Content>You will be dissappointed...don't ruin your vacation by staying at this hotel. My boyfriend and I have been down south several times for the last couple of yrs and as always we did our research about this particular hotel....and we were both kicking ourself as soon as we got to Punta Cana Grand (formerly known as Globalia Sunscape).It started with a very arrogant Orisis front desk rep at check in and it went down hill from there. Only few staff could speak English and actually had a smile. We booked a deluxe room with ocean view - and yes we got a room with a view of a wall..fantastic!!!Service and Food at 24 hrs snack bar were terrible. We waited for about 45 mins to actually get our order in and had to leave empty stomach because food was so horrible. Buffe at Window restaurant was alright some days but a most of the week we stuck with bread and fruits. We had to rush out one morning to catch a bus to the Saona tour and forgot to leave tips for the maid - we came back and our room was half cleaned. We didn't have any kneenex and my boyfriend called down the lobby - of course noone answered. So we went down to the front desk and ask for a box of kneenex. Their response was: can we get it for you tomorrow? And we still haven't got our kneenex deliver to our room as promised. Oh well...there isn't much to expect from this hotel. Not only it's a small hotel, service and food were terrible, they also got very arrogant and rude employees. Be careful with the guys at front desk because they quote prices for safety deposit box and late checkout fees as much as they like. We asked 3 different guys about late checkout charge and they all told us different prices. Things kept getting better in the week...Hotel didn't have any hot/warm water for a couple of days - yes no shower a day or two. We asked front desk and they said : it should be fixed today - dominican time. That's means just wait because we take our sweet time.Overall, we are extremely dissappointed with this hotel and perhaps would never return to Punta Cana.

<Content>value priced vacation Ola;We have been to Cuba the last 4 years in a row since getting married, my wife wanted to try something different.The beach is nice but as others said get there early if you want a decent spot to sit. The beach to the left of the resort, past the vendors, is even nicer.The hotel and grounds are well kept. Even though our room was clean, the decor was weathered. The bathroom and furnishings felt like I had rented a 200.00 cottage in Northern Ontario.Being a picky eater, i found the food to be good.We toured during the day and hung out at the adult pool in the late afternoon, we found the most normal people there and the servize great.Two Gripes: Too many rude french canadians. I was one of the few guys on the beach without a speedo. Pushy Dominican vendors/tour guys on the beach.We heard Punta Cana was The Place to Go, I wouldn't go back. On a budget sure..but we would spend more to go elseware.

<Content>It was gross! My family, 2 adults and 2 kids, stayed 3 nights of our 8 nights in Punta Cana at Puna Cana Grand. We stayed the first 5 nights at Sunscape the Beach, and we realized we made a mistake coming to the Grand upon driving through the entrance. The only reason we stayed at the Grand was because we met some friends there who were too cheap to pay for Sunscape. Anyway, just to let you know, we all think Punta Cana Grand was a dump--even my 3 year old wanted to go back to the other hotel! The main problem is the rooms. They are old, smell musty and have had no updates in FOREVER! I was afraid to walk barefoot and would not think of touching the bedcovers because they had stains and holes. The food was so-so tasting but both my husband and 3 year old had diarrhea and vomiting the 2nd day. The pool's okay, the beach is so-so. We stayed in building 1, so maybe some of the other buildings are newer--i'm not sure. But I am sure that I was ready to GO HOME when the time came. We will never return. P.S. My husband is a Dominican living in the U.S., so we are VERY well traveled in the Carribean and are not snobs nor do we not know how to have fun, as some people may say to try to make this place sound better.

<Content>Average with some disappointments!!!! Stayed at Punta Cana Grant from April 2 to 9th. We really enjoyed our week but there were a couple of things that i was disappointed in. I didnt feel the animation team or staff were as friendly as other resorts in Punta Cana we have stayed at. They were totally different from our experience at two other resorts. Not friendly at all except for bartender called BeachPappi.....He was a riot. The entertainment (except for Michael Jackson show) was not as good either. I also found the swimming at beach not as nice as up the coast at Bavaro Beach. The food was good (better than both other resorts) and the rooms were really nice (third floor with high ceilings). Water pressure extremely poor and no hot water, but it is a beautiful place to spend a week. The palm trees were to die for. Could use more palpalas on beach for shade. Flew with Sunwing and were delayed both ways.....Kind of tiresome.

<Content>Great Resort My daughter and I just returned and loved every minute. The suites are beautiful, clean and spacious. The a la carte restaurants were excellent. The seafood restaurant service was a little slow. Celebrated my birthday at the Italian Restaurant. They brought chilled champagne and the beeeest chocolate cake ever. If you have a problem be sure to see the concierge and will get done immediately. Weather was great and so was the Safari Tour. Be sure to do this one. I have been in Punta Cana twice and still love it.

<Content>Great vacation at the Punta Cana Grand Punta Cana Grand April 9th to the 16thMy boyfriend and I had an awesome experience at Punta Cana Grand. The service was excellent, the facility was immaculate and the grounds were beautiful. The atmosphere was relaxing, and this even extended to the staff who at the same time maintained organization and grace as they served (we really liked their tasteful uniforms at the 脿 la cartes). The different drinks were spectacular (and strong) and we suggest you do as we did and bring an insulated cup to keep them cool. The pool was large and clean and the swim up bar was a neat treat. The adult pool however was less impressive, we would have liked it if the hot tub was a few degrees hotter than the pool! Nonetheless we liked the idea of an adult only bar and we appreciated the thought.There was a pond designated to some beautiful flamingos that were left to frolic freely. You could get your picture taken with a couple of toucans, an iguana or by yourself with a lay, so that was neat. The pictures are then posted in a glass bulletin board by the 鈥榃indows鈥?restaurant, and you can choose which ones to purchase (7 dollars each, and they are of great quality).The food was excellent and we were impressed with the selection of restaurants and the selection of food within each one. There were 4 restaurants in total: Windows (buffet style, open for every meal), Da Marios (脿 la carte, open for supper only), The Beach Club (restaurant overlooking the beach, open every meal) or Tex Mex American Grill (脿 la carte, open for supper only). We liked the seafood and the steak (especially at Tex Mex). Breakfast, lunch and the dessert table at Windows provided a delicious spread of both North American and traditional food. Good eating was one of the most enjoyable aspects of this resort鈥ust watch the milk- it鈥檚 really watery looking and just doesn鈥檛 taste right. We loved how the buildings (like the lobby) were all open without doors. Our room was pleasing and roomy for two, with 2 queen-sized beds, a dresser and armoire that housed the TV and mini fridge (with beer, pop and water). There is a phone in the room and an optional safebox (costs 15 dollars when you check out). We were on the bottom floor of building 4 and we had a small ground balcony. We never experienced any issue with lack of hot water. Our room was well air conditioned and we were about a 30 second walk from the beach.The two night clubs, Sneakers and the Cigar bar, were cozy but the d茅cor and atmosphere seemed a bit fake and americanized. We also got the same feel for the nightly entertainment (especially the Michael Jackson show) though there鈥檚 still a lot of talent to behold and it鈥檚 still worth attending.  The beach was where we spent the most of our time. It was beautiful white sand and not too much seaweed (our resort was crazy about raking up the seaweed in the early morning, and u could definitely notice the difference when compared to the neighboring resorts). The water is clear blue and relatively warm (though my boyfriend says it鈥檚 warmer in Cuba). We had fun snorkeling and kayaking, but most of all we sunbathed. Getting a hut for shade after 7h30 am is an impossible task so get out there early and lay your towel down on a corresponding lounge chair. Don鈥檛 fret if you can鈥檛 get one though, the palm trees provide adequate shade if needed. The beach has a topless option so beware. We were also a little freaked out by a couple of old men in thongs- yikes! lolThere are people advertising for tours and water sports that will approach you while you鈥檙e lying on the beach, so if you鈥檙e not interested, have a good story ready. You can also get harassed while walking down the beach by the vendors of the souvenir markets. They are however friendly and will insist on shaking your hand so you will stop to talk. You must negotiate prices since they start with an astronomical cost. For example, I got a set of wooden dominoes that started at $65 for $18. We paid around $7 for a quart of Brugal rum, $4-5 for earrings, $4 for a small package of coffee, $7 dollars for t-shirts. All in all we really loved this experience and we would definitely visit again.

<Content>Good all-round vacation General Comments************************************My wife and I are regular caribbean travellers, and generally fairly easy to please. However, in some ways we were pleasantly surprised by this resort. Entertainment was so-so, and the rooms weren't great, but face it; if the room is clean (and they were), who cares about the room? You're in the Caribbean to be outside and enjoy the beach and the weather.We were there with Sunwing, and I have to say that the Sunwing reps were good; service was good (we flew out of Halifax), and the Sunwing rep in DR was at the hotel every day. We didn't run into any problems, but I definitely got the feeling that they were ready to help.Food************************************I thought the food was good. I definitely preferred Da Marios, and we ate there 4 times in our 7 days there. The buffet (Windows) had theme nights, and several times we ate dinner at the buffet. They put on a lot of effort, and the Mexican Night at the buffet beat the Tex-Mex grill hands down.The Tex-Mex was so-so. People have different likes and dislikes, but as a fan of mexican food I wasn't impressed with the offerings. Oddly, there was no guacamole the night we were there, although there was lots of it at the buffet Mexican night a couple of evenings later.The Beach Cafe was standard convenience food, pizzas, sandwiches, hamburgers and the like. They usually set up some kind of bbq next to the cafe for lunch, and sometimes they had pasta, rice, etc. I didn't really try it, but friends who did said it was good.Breakfasts were good, lots of variety, and (for those who like it) the standard north american breakfast fare. Good selection of fruit.I've beein in Cuba three times, and the food definitely beat Cuba. Probably not as good as I've had in Mexico, but close.Rooms************************************The rooms were clean, but a little dated. I think you have to be careful with the patio doors, since they don't seem to close very well, but that would be more of an issue on the ground floor. Service was good, and we left a little something for the maid every day. I noticed that the maids used to come in the evening and turn down the beds, which was nice. Lots of towels, and the room bar was stocked every day. I noticed that as the week went on, the maid was leaving more and more beer in the fridge!A/C is a little weak, but once I figured out that your patio door needs to be firmly closed in order for it to work, no problems.We used the room safe (a $15 charge), but had no problems with other things left around the room (watches, cameras, etc).We saw the rooms in building 7 (the new buliding), and they are very nice, jacuzzis, nice walk-in showers, larger, etc. Friends we met moved over there at extra cost. Someone mentioned that you could pay abou $100 pp and stay there, and depending on how important the room is to you it might be worth it. We considered moving once we saw them, but ended up staying where we were.Beaches************************************The beaches were nice. As other people have mentioned, there is a lot of seaweed around; staff at the hotel told us that this was unusual, and is probably a reflection of the hurricanes and windstorms that have happened this year. I was usually down on the beach at 6 or 7 am, and could see the teams of workers who raked up the seaweed and hauled it away every morning (and during the day). Not much they can do about Mother Nature, but they definitely worked at it.No bar service on the beach. Closest is the beach cafe, just up from the beach. Good service.Lots of kayaks, windsurfers, sailboats etc on the beach. We were told that you had to do a $25 course in order to be allowed to take the catamarans out, but the guys at the aquatic centre just asked me if I knew how to sail, and let me take the Hobies out without any course. I noticed several people who didn't seem to have a clue about sailing (including one guy who kept trying to point the boat directly into the wind to get off the beach), but they seemed to graciously get those people back on shore and out of the boat. Only allowed one time a day, but several times other people booked boats and I went out with them since they didn't know how to sail. The Hobies are in good condition, and usually a good breeze. One day they took the boats off the water because it was too windy, but they usually let people go even in a stiff breeze. I gave a tip here and there, and although the service was good anyway, they definitely seemed to remember me a little more after a tip or two.Some snorkelling right off the beach, and I could usually see a few fish by the rock outcrops out along the ropes. I was a bit nervous about going farther out, since the powerboats sometimes come in close to the roped-in area, but I noticed several people did venture out further.Pools************************************Three pools; the main pool, an adult pool, and another pool over by building 7. We didn't really spend much time at the pools, with the exception of one afternoon at the main pool. Usually a bunch of drinkers around the swim-up bar, who seemed to get louder and more obnoxious as the afternoon wore on. Pools are very clean and well-maintained.Entertainment************************************The entertainment was hit and miss. Due to weather we didn't have the weekly beach party, so they seemed to put something together on the fly. Several of the shows were a little racy, and I noticed some parents taking their kids out at some of the shows. The Michael Jackson show was very entertaining.Not bad, but I've seen better, although perhaps at larger resorts. This was the tail end of the season, and things might have been winding down.Excursions************************************Didn't do any. Friends we met were trying to go on the catamaran trip, but after being cancelled three days in a row they gave up. They said it was cancelled due to weather, but I think it was numbers. Would have gone on the snorkelling trip, but the water was kind of churned up while we were there so decided not to.Service************************************Service was generally good. I tipped (usually $1) and the servers appreciated it, but service was pretty good regardless. Some of the bars get very busy, especially the theater bar during a show, but they are pretty efficient.Drinks are good, and they will try and mix anything you like. If you ask for it they usually have premium liquor at most of the bars, especially the poolside bar. My wife isn't a fan of the local vodka, so I used to ask for the good vodka when ordering a drink for her, but once the guys got to know me they used to do it automatically. No extra charge, but I used to tip a little bit to whoever was pouring the drinks. I drank the local liquors and found them to be fine. Drinks are a little strong sometimes, but they will tone them down if you ask.Overall************************************We liked the place. I would go again. If anyone has any specific questions, feel free to email me.

<Content>Best service ever My wife and I travel very often and had the pleasure of staying at the Punta Cana Grand. The sevice at this resort was the best we have received in many years.Although we did encounter a few minor problems they were soon over come by the condition and service.The first problem was a very slow check-in about 1 hour. The only other issue was that we had to get our room moved due to the construction noise, they are doing some new buildings not far from the lobby.As I said previously the service was great, windows( the buffett restaurant) the food was fantastic, say Hi to Pedro the best waiter I have ever seen, he could not speak very much english but had the universal language a great smile. The beach restaurant was a little slow but not too bad.The resort was beautiful and very well kept. The beach was great.My wife and I are in the Hotel industry and are usually very picky, But there were not many things to be picky about. If you decide on going there I don't think you will have any complaints.

<Content>Fabulous Vacation My husband and I just came back from a week at Punta Cana Grand (April 9-16, 2006).We departed from Halifax and our flight was delayed by 3-hours (not a good start - we were scheduled to leave at 7:15 pm and didn't leave until 10:15 which meant it was 3:30 a.m. (4:30 our time) before we got to our room). Check-in at the hotel was fast and smooth. Our room was in Building 4 on the third floor, king size bed, nice room. Only complaint about the room was we had no hot water on a couple of occasions which I wasn't impressed with; but overall very pleased with the room.Property - this is a nice property, it is kept very clean and their staff are always working to make the place clean. The grounds are so green with lots of flowers. You'll even see live flamingo's in the pond. The lighting in the public washrooms is dim, but otherwise there is always a maid tidying up.Beach - the beach is beautiful and you can always find a lounger.... sometimes it was 10/10:30 before we got to the beach and had no problems finding a lounger, but if you want a hut, you have to get out earlier. We always took plenty of walks on the beach, lots of beachfront and you can walk a long ways. Though you should be aware when you leave the secure area, as there will be no security pass those lines.Food - we always found something we liked with lots of variety. There are 3 a-la-carte restaurants, beach BBQ daily and a buffet. One day they had seafood jambalaya at the beach BBQ and it was delicious. The steak medallion at the American Grill was amazing.We have been to a few resorts and this is one that we would definitely recommend.One thing people got to remember that you are in a third-world country and if you go with an open mind and not expect to much, then you should have a great time.

<Content>Only OK I used this site to read reviews on the Punta Cana Grand so felt I should add my own two cents.Bottom line: if your main reason for going to DR is to enjoy some beach time, this resort is fine. However, if you're looking for good food and nice accomodations, this resort is probably not for you.Pros: 1) excellent beach - and the seaweed wasn't bad! 2) nice adult pool with afternoon shade 3) beautiful grounds - well landscaped. 4) friendly maid serviceCons: 1) rooms smelled damp/musty, ants in the bathroom. low water pressure, only warm water 2) noisy - forget an afternoon nap unless you were in building 7 - lots of construction. 3) unfriendly staff (except maids) - the tall thin girl who worked in the giftshop was perhaps the rudest person I have ever met!!! (and i'm pretty easy going) 4) food was only ok - not much variety and service was terrible - took over an hour one night to get a menu in the beach hut. 5) dull night life. shows were ok, but the disco and piano bar didn't liven up until quite late.I wouldn't recommend this resort to anyone, although I would return to Punta Cana.

<Content>Good for the price, but go to Cuba or Mexico instead for much better service My boyfriend and I just returned from a 7 day holiday at Punta Cana Grand. I have found this site to be very helpful and as such have decided to post my experience as well. Here it is:**Food: Average. About two years ago we stayed at Grand Flamenco in Punta Cana and if you want to visit Punta Cana I definately recommend this one as the food was amazing there..**Service: Below average. I found staff to be very disconected from the people and they often took too long to clear the tables and to take your order. Even when they were serving you, I found that they would engage in conversations with other employees which often made us feel neglected. I am only saying this because I have been both in Cuba and MExico and I have never experienced anything like this before. **Beach: Very nice however the water was full of sea weed. I am not a picky person at all and one of the main reasons that I go down south is for the beach. I found water too dirty. However there is shade and the sand is white which was beautiful..Please note that you have to wake up at 5:30am to get shade...**Pool: Nice, however I do not go to an exotic country to swim in the pool, therefore I cannot comment on this one..**Entertainemnt: Average. Compared to Cuba and Mexico, I found very difficult to understand Dominicans. They spoke in Spanish most of the time. The entertainment is pretty much standard at all these resorts and the shows are almost the same. **Rooms: They smelled and they had aunts. We also did not have water pressure nor hot water for few days.Personally it is well worth adding another $100 and going to Mexico or to Cuba (4* and up). I have been to Cuba 7 times and even thought some resorts were better than the others, service was excellent each time and the beaches are beautiful. Overall for the amount we paid it was expected what we got and at the end we still had a great time. I do not mean to be so negative but I think it is important that people know what to expect. Good luck !!

<Content>Excellent value but..... Do not expect luxury, there were many excellent aspects to our 12 day stay; food, bar service, entertainment, the Jurassic Safari is a must {Monchie and Damian are a brilliant double act} and the cleaners and bell boys were brilliant and deserving of a generous tip.Front desk were unhelpful, made excuses to the extent of deliberately lying and completely failed to take any responsibility regarding any problems; Block 5 had no hot water, assured it was a one day 篓thing篓 on each of the first three days, assured that someone would be along in 30 minutes or so...yeah right! Had other little problems with the room but after 8 visits to front desk everything was resolved. Beach had lots of seaweed on the shore and in the shallows, but nearby Bavaro beach was absolutely stunning but not really within walking distance.The brochures do not mention the ongoing building work but the progress made during our stay would suggest the workmen could build a completely new hotel in just a few weeks, the noise was not a problem but the spa and casino were certainly not finished.....Overall excellent value, but we felt a few hundred dollars more would get you a much more luxurious stay.

<Content>Best Week Of My Life It was a wonderful vaction mostly cause i didnt have to do ANYTHING! I went with my family (mom and sister). We stayed in room #3311 and it was very nice! The only thing wrong with it was that in the shower there was hardly any water presure and the water was cold. But apperently if you ask the frount desk 3 or 4 times they would come and fix it,we however did not know that.  The food was VERY good at every meal we were always full! Their lemonda is the BEST i highly recomened it! And their chocolate chip cookies! There are 4 restaurants on the resort. One on the beach open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Another one called Windows also open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and then there are two only open for dinner an Italien and an American Grill. All very good! We went on one of the trips and I highly recomend it! We went out and saw the contrey side and see how they live. WOW very different it makes you really think!

<Content>Great Family Vacation Our family has just returned from a week in Punta Cana and we loved every minute except the Punta Cana Airport( or a few huts with planes).The Punta Cana Grand was about a 20 minute drive from the airport.Once we arrive we had a drink served to us within a few minutes at the reception desk.Check-in was friendly and prompt and we were in our rooms within 15 minutes of arrival.The rooms,which were adjoining for our teenage daughters were quite spacious with balconies with a view of the ocean.The resort was clean with friendly staff.The restaurants offered a variety of food from buffet to fine dining ala carte.(Say hi to Victor in the Italian fine dining.)We had to get up every morning at 6:30 to save some lounge chairs by the pool for some shade.There were lots of lounge chairs, but not many under shade.It is worth getting up to save some.Everyday the poolside staff had games to play or dances to learn and there was always something to do at the pool or by the beach.The beach was beautiful with a market right on it(Say hi to Simon and bring him a beer and you will get a great deal.)If you get a chance go into the Bavaro Market.It is 20 minutes by taxi which is arranged right at the resort.You get a chance to see some of the countryside and the local vegatation such as banana trees.You will get some good deals in the market if you barter well and walk away from them if they won't. There is always someone who will.It was everything we wanted for a family holiday and more.There are lots of tours to go on if you want , or there is lots to do if you stay on the resort.We felt very safe letting our teenage daughters move about the resort on their own.We would and have recommended the Grand to anyone.We would definately go back.

<Content>great week Just returned from the Punta Cana Grand. I was there with my husband from April 2 to April 9. We had a great time and the weather was perfect! The resort is beautiful and the staff was very frendly. On the Friday afternoon a Canadian man was hurt diving into the pool. It was an organized game put on by the fun club guys. He was taken to the hospital and I never heard anything about his condition after that. If anyone knows anything please let me know. I hope he is ok. Other than that our vacation was great! We were in building 3 and the construction never botherd us at all. The only downside is the people who put their towels on chairs at 6 in the morning and you never see them use the chairs.

<Content>Above average (with some problems) April 2006We recently visited the Punta Cana Grand Resort (April 1 鈥?April 8, 2006), this was our first trip to the DR but not our first trip down south. I will tell you a little about the flight, resort, atmosphere, staff, food and entertainment.Flight (Pearson Airport): We traveled with (Nolitours) Air Transit, may I just say something to the passenger of flight TS560 who missed his flight and to the rest of us who waited. Thank you dear sir who left the rest of the passengers on that flight waiting and delaying our vacation by 陆 hr. May I suggest for the next person who decides to do the same thing to let the flight attendant know you will not be coming on board so that people will not be looking for you. Other then that the flight was pretty good, seats were a little to small even for someone like me who is 5鈥? and med built. I personally do not understand how my poor husband sat there not complaining for 3.5 hrs he is 6鈥? The meal on the flight was a sub 6鈥?sandwich veggie or turkey and a cookie. Check-in: The check-in was very comfortable and was a breeze; we arrived at the resort at the resort just before 10pm which was great. Building: We stayed in building 5 third floor which had a beautiful view of the adult pool and the beach. We were pleased with the overall look in the room it had 12鈥?ceilings full body mirror in the bathroom. However, the first night there was NO HOT WATER, so we complained and the problem was fixed for the rest of the week. Just a quick note about the buildings, you might know from reading the other reviews that they are expanding their resort by adding a casino and a spa, these people work from morning to night pass 10pm. So if you are in building 4, 5, 6,  7 you are far enough from the construction that you will not here the construction. Buildings 1  3 are right beside the construction so good luck sleeping there. Also building 7 is the up dating building, it cost $60 or $70 extra a night it also has a Jacuzzi in the middle of the room, however you should note that the room may have a Jacuzzi but it doesn鈥檛 have a clock and some people who we met that stayed in that room didn鈥檛 know what time it was, which can be a good or bad thing. You can bring your alarm from home because they use 110 volts just like in Canada and/or the USA. Hotel Service: The people here are very friendly, and happy to help you, however I asked for a wake-up call the first morning, and I am still waiting on that call. Also if you have fare skin and burn easily and require shade, I suggest you get up between 6-6:45a if you want to get a good bed, and canopy, or else you will be left out in the sun. This is a good tip if you are going to the beach or pool area. We also found that the workers spoke pretty good English, and kind of laughed at you when trying to speak Spanish. Restaurants: Windows: Is their main restaurant where they serve breakfast, lunch  dinner. The food there was edible, I am a very picky eater and I could always find something to eat. DaMarios: is their Italian restaurant which says on their door that they are open for dinner at 6:30p however, if you arrive their pass 6:05pm you will not be able to get a table. I suggest you go here at least once good, food great atmosphere. This is also the only restaurant where men are required to wear pants. (i.e. Jeans are ok).The American Grill: This one my husband and I disagreed on. My husband loved it, he had the stake and according to him it was really good. (I just think he was really hungry). I had the chicken fajita and didn鈥檛 like it at all. Thank g-d they gave chips with salsa when you arrived or I would have been hungry. However, the atmosphere was terrific, expect for the people sitting next to us who were smoking like a chimney. The Beach: This was great the atmosphere was terrific, the food was great; however the service here was very, very slow. However, you are on holidays relax, enjoy the great view you are in no rush to get anywhere.BBQ Stand: The BBQ stand was quite good; we had it almost everyday for lunch. The Beach Party: This was probably one of the best nights; the trouble these people go through for that one night is unbelievable; I can鈥檛 believe they do that every single week. The food and atmosphere were incredible. Beach: The beach was nice, however, there was lot of see weed, which both my husband and I didn鈥檛 like. However, I was told that apparently this is the season for see weed in DR. There is also a private beach which is to the left of the resort about 5-10 walk, where there is a beautiful white sandy beach with the bluest water I have ever seen. One thing you should note that when you go to this private beach you should not bring anything with you or if you do keep an eye on it. Pool: We stayed mainly at the beach, but around 3:30 -4p it usually got cold for me so I moved to the pool area. There are 3 pools and we only went to 2 of them. The main pool area had lots of kids, and people drinking, playing volley ball, and working out in the pool; we went there twice for about 陆 hr. However, we usually stayed at the Adult pool which had a Jacuzzi which was the same temperature as the pool, and it was usually laid back. It also had a bar, with the guy walking up to the pool and bringing you drinks, try the Banana Mama it鈥檚 really good. The adult pool is behind building 5. Entertainment: The entertainment staff really does work hard they work from morning to night. The shows are all right, I hear that the Michael Jackson show is the best; this show is Saturday night, so unfortunately we missed it. The other shows were all right, the Tropical show was also good, and the audience participation shows were a hoot. Check-out: If you have a late check out like we did, you can go to the front desk the night before around 9pm (not earlier) to find out if you can keep your room and get a late check out. This will cost an extra $25-$40 depending what time your departure is. However, you can also get a complimentary room for 陆 hr only this is for free. We did this because they had our room assigned to someone else for 3pm. They provide you with the towels, and room, you just have to make sure you are out in 陆 hr because someone else will have the room after you. I have to say that I never got ready so fast in my life, and I don鈥檛 think it will ever happen again.Punta Cana Airport Departure: I have never seen so much kayos in my life. Even Cuba was better organized. All I have to say is Thank G-D we were not flying to the states, because the check-in counter were going through all of their luggage per person. Back to us for a sec, we got to the airport just after 7p, and our flight was at 9:40p. It took us until 8:45 to go get our flight tickets, and go through customs. This left us with 20 minutes before they started boarding the plane.Would we stay at the Punta Cana Grand again? Absolutely, but not for a while, because we like to travel a lot, and there is so much more of the world to see. Also remember when you are bargaining with the beach venders the price is usually 1/3 of what they are asking for. Shirts you can get for $6-$7 and don鈥檛 be afraid to walk away. Also if you are going to braid your hair bring your own brush, because you don鈥檛 know who used the brush before prior to you and what they have in their hair.

<Content>Best deal in Punta Cana I just got back from a five-day stay at Punta Cana Grand and I can verify all of the positive comments that were published on this board. I definitely was not expecting all of the perks that came along with this vacation--somehow it seemed to good to be true--but in fact, everything was totally included in the price and worked out as I had hoped.Positives:* Activity staff - a crew of people dedicated solely to making sure you have a good time. They work non-stop from early morning until late at night entertaining all of the people at the hotel with games, exercises, activities, entertainment, and everything else inbetween. They also play great music by the pool all day.* Price - this hotel was in good condition and provided all food, drinks (all the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks you can ingest!), non-motorized water activities (boating, kayaking, windsurfing), beach, pool (with bar in the pool, too), disco at night, four restaurants to choose from, a piano bar, beach games (shuffle board, bacci, etc), nightly dance performances (really fun!), large screen movies every night as well, and a staff of multi-lingual people to provide you whatever you want during your vacation at an incredibly affordable price.* Beach - well-groomed in front of our hotel (much better than in front of the others down the beach), plenty of chairs, and several umbrellas for shade.* Pool - also great! Only, if you like a deep-end, you won't find one here. The whole pool is about 3-5 ft. deep, probably to protect all the drunk people from drowning.* Good for kids - I didn't have any kids with me, but there were lots of activities specifically for kids all throughout the day and night. The activity staff really made it a point to have fun with them. * Didn't get sick from food - I had heard that some people got sick from the food here. We were careful (didn't brush our teeth with the tap water, didn't eat lettuce, etc.) and we were fine throughout our trip.Food/drink favorites: Banana Monkey (alcoholic drink), chicken fajita from the American cafeNegatives:* Food wasn't good - the food choices, while various, were really not good. Even the pizza was bad. They cooked everything in oil or deep-fried it, even the fish, and this is definitely an area they could improve on. They would have done better to offer more local food fare and more seafood, that was not drowned in oil.* Waitstaff was out to lunch - this is an all-inclusive deal, so obviously you shouldn't be looking for great service, but the waitstaff often moved really slowly to take your order, were sometimes kind of rude, and sometimes messed up the orders they did take. Just don't expect anything grand in this area.* Great for couples or families, not for singles - if you're looking for love here, you're looking in all the wrong places.I would recommend this place and would potentially go again because the value was good. Good weather guaranteed for a good price and a short plane flight.

<Content>Beautiful Beach...awful food! My husband  I (in our late 30's) just got back, we were there from 4/3 -4/7. We went to the Punta Cana Grand because it was cheap and most of the reviews were favorable. We just wanted to be able to spend some time together, get some sun and RELAX. Mission accomplished, we had a lovely time. I'll just make mention of a few things: The food is AWFUL. No seriously, it's not good. Breakfast was really the only acceptable meal of the day. You can get yogurt, fresh fruit, croissant, boiled egg  there are lots of different kinds of breads. Lunch  Dinner were tough and if it wasn't for the frozen Banana Mama's that filled me up I'd of been really hungry. Don't eat from the grill, the burgers don't look like burgers and aren't cooked through. We were pleased that we were only there for the 5 days because we were really starting to get hungry!Because of the reviews I read here I got alot of helpful hints like: You must get to the beach early to save a hut or else you will not get one. Each morning I went down to the beach at 6:15 and was able to get the same hut. Don't turn in your towels at the end of the day or else you won't have anything to save a chair with. The activity center was opened before 8:00 each morning so I was always able to exchange our towels for fresh ones. I requested a non-smoking room, 3rd floor in bldg 5-7. We got a non-smoking room, 3rd floor in bldg 5. The room was ok, the location was perfect because you're away from the construction which we heard during the day  night when we walked around. I wasn't too concerned about the room because we were only there to shower and sleep. (Oh yeah, don't expect a hot shower you'll only get a warm one with little water pressure). Bldg 5 is close to the beach and the adult pool. We asked for the key to the safe and we got one without paying extra, it was a standard key that probably worked on all of the safes so during the day we carried our passports, camera  ipod with us. Only at night AFTER our room had been cleaned did we leave our stuff in the safe. We didn't bring mugs for our drinks but we sure saw lots of people with the biggest mugs I've ever seen. We left $2.00 each day for our maid. Our fridge was always stocked but since there isn't electricity in your room when you're not there (your room key needs to be in the slot on the wall to get power) the drinks are only cold in the morning, oh well. One more thing: this resort is filled with lots of Canadians so get ready to hear EH morning, noon  night :) Well, we really enjoyed the beach and the perfect weather we had. Don't forget your sunblock because the sun is very hot even though the gentle breeze makes you think you're not getting a sunburn. The resort grounds are well kept and you can always find a nice quiet place for a drink or a morning tea. The people who work at the resort are very friendly and they work very hard. A little hola goes a long way.Good Luck

<Content>Loved the Punta Cana Grand A great resort. Excellent hard working staff. A lot of great times to be had. Room was excellent. Food was great with a lot of choices. Great service, no problems at all. Many extras being added, i.e. a casino, and more on site stores.

<Content>Relaxing Vacation We booked last minute on-line and were happy with the choice. Only draw back was the fact that we flew into the La Romana airport instead of the Punta Cana. This was a 2.5hrs drive to the hotel instead of the .5hrs drive that was advertised. The other draw back to the drive was that we were in a van with a total of nine people plus luggage. Which would not have been too bad except we had two gentlemen that were very drunk and very obnoxious. It made me ashamed to be a Canadian. Our trip was bookended by these two individuals... had to be in the van with them to the hotel and on the return trip to the airport. We have been to the Dominican before and found ourselves better prepared to evaluate our vacation. We liked the food, the American Grill has great Fajitias and Windows has plenty of variety (great desserts). The rooms were nice and we had a view of the beach. Weather was ok... rained at 3pm every day but at least it was warm and we didn't have to shovel. Santa Domingo was Fabulous... If you like history and meeting the people of the island. Great Hotel to relax in, there are many places to go and read, relax and plain get away from the stress of work back home. Like the Adult pool and beach chairs (get one early). All and all it was a good vacation, I would recommend this resort to anyone on a budget but look where your flight arrives. Make sure you fly in to the Punta Cana airport!

<Content>OOOOOOLA! Ughhh..I'm so depressed. Back to reality...Just returned from the Grande and let me tell you, it was an amazing vacation! I went with 5 of my best girlfriends ( all in our 30's and 40's )and we had a wonderful time. The resort is awesome. Our room was perfect, third floor, bldg. 3. The view of the flamingo's, pool and bar was awesome! No complaints here, the food was great, the drinks plentiful and the staff was fabulous. The waiters and bartenders went out of their way to make us feel welcome and special. The beach is gorgeous, what up with all the seaweed talk? They work hard to keep it pristine, and if yer from Nova Scotia, just wade thru it Ladies! LOLThe staff work constantly, trying to make your vacation perfect. Everyone is very, very friendly. Remember, it IS Dominican time, have a drink, relax, it will all get done. The Michael Jackson show was wicked good, really these guys could be in Vegas! Don't miss it. Book your horseback riding tour thru Andrei on the beach ( in the red shirt )with the Dominican Ranch, just an awesome experience of the real culture. Visit Simon in the flea market on the beach, first hut you come to, a very interesting person that can give you Canadian's a great deal!. Certainly visit the Italian restaurant and enjoy the experience. It's delicious food and wonderful service. It's all in what you make it, People. The disco is small but rocking and they play a nice mix of hip-hop/dance and local music. Ladies....make sure you try a merenge with a staff member that can show you how. It's hot, hot, hot and I felt like I needed a cigarette afterwards! Thanks Felix, I'll never forget that dance! LOLSo, all in all, my vacation was just what I wanted it to be...good friends, good spot and good fun. This resort is wonderful, go and relax and enjoy! Please, feel free to email me ( Michelle ) for any info you might need. PS...Mike from Barry..I owe you 5 bucks, Buddy..can't believe you were still standing at 11:00!

<Content>OK Just got back yesterday.I want to stress to all of you this is not owned by sunscape anymore, although it is in all the books. We paid for an upgrade to delux only to find out that we never got it. There is not such thing as a standard room anymore. Since Globalia has bought this company they made the delux room the standered room. I'm now caught between my travel agent and signature to get maoney back. As far as I'm concered if that is what is advertise that is what I should hgave recieved. I never found this under anything but sunscape on all the web sights, so be very careful with this. You also do not want to be anywhere near the fist half of units23 as there is plenty of construcxtion going on. That also was something I found out on my own from my sister who was there the week befor. My travel agent looked into it and said there was none. So another disaagreement between agaent and signature.This hotel is not a 4.5 star. More like a 3.5 or 4.can't decide.The food was great.Weather not so great. 4 days of rain on and off last day all day and cold.They can't help that though.What ever you do, do not buy anything from anyone other than your vacation rep.We bought from someone from the pool area and when Pedro called us (Signature vacations) to see if we were still going he told us they could not ensure that nothing would happen were as if we went with them would be. They said not to worry they would get them to refun our money next day and they would rebook with thiers. Didn't happen. I spent most of my vacation waiting up stairs to get my money back on our visa. Finally got it on the 4th. day. Way to much worry about that. Not to mention all the mornings we waited to go on our planned trips to hear that they were cancelled. They called us on the 6th day to say try the mediteranian it never gets canceled. Half Hour later we got a call. So sorry cancelled. My husband and I were very lucky to go on the safari trip. I highly recomend this it was a great way to see the country and the way they live. Our guide Little Willy was great we had a ball.

<Content>Loved it  My stay @ the resort was in Aug 2003, but I  my husband absolutely loved it! We took a day trip away from resort, which was very nice. We also visited the closest casino (not on on site). Comparing this resort to the one with the casino, I would pick this one over  over again. We had an end room with a wonderful view of the beach. There was seaweed on the beach, but only at night  the workers would clean up the beach very early every morning. There are little vendors on the beach daily  the resort also had vendors that came in selling different items. These vendors set up on the sidewalks around the main building. I do not recommend this resort if you don't like children. There are alot of families that stay here  there are alot of European guests also so you are constantly hearing other languages. Quite nice.

<Content>Needs work! No respect! There was a group of disrespectful drunks that woke alot of people up every night and the hotel did nothing about it! Even after complaints, they did nothing. The resort had construction going on and when asked to be put away from the noise becouse our 18 month old son, the front desk staff said that there was no construction!! they lied to us!! noise starting at 7:30am to dark! The place is getting tired, The washrooms had a bad smell and where moldy. The staff seemed tired and only smiled when given a tip. Not horrible but we won't be going back, the icing on the cake was the guy throwing up in the pool on our second last day. Yes, yes, if your 20 or so and want to party your brains out go for it...

<Content>Beautiful Hotel...Had a Blast The Punta Cana Grand is beautiful, nicer than I expected. The landscaping is immaculate and they are always cleaning and fixing things up on the grounds. They really do care about this place. I enjoyed the food very much. The restaurant service is slow for the most part, but I did expect that here. The bars had great service and the drinks were great. The room I stayed in was nice, but could have used a little bit of updating. Of course, I was barely in the room as there is so much to do and see outside. I have been told that Building 7 is newer so you should try to get in there if you can. The construction is limited to one area near the lobby and theater so it doesn't affect most of the resort. I enjoyed the nightlife as you have a few different options. For loud music and dancing they have the Sneakers Diso. For a more relaxed bar and music they have the Umbrella Bar. Also, the outside bars remain open until midnight I believe so you can socialize outside as well. I definitely recommend the Punta Cana Grand as a beautiful resort and an excellent value.

<Content>great hotel, customer service is lacking at front desk The hotel and the people were great. However, the front desk staff lacks speed and common sense. We were put in a room that was on a second floor walk up. Hard to do with twins on a double stroller that weigh about 50 lbs. Our anniversary dinner and breakfast never showed when it was supposed to . They made it up to us but it was not our anniversary then. If you make arragenements, double check.

<Content>Mixed Reviews My boyfriend and I just returned from a weeks stay at the Punta Cana Grand (today!) Although, we had a fabulous time with the weather and such, we were a little disapointed when it came to the actual resort. First thing, we thought when we pulled up to the resort was it looked awful because it was under construction. When we did check in and look around a bit though, it didnt seem so bad. We were put in room 3218 and we HATED IT. We had two queen beds when we requested one king or something like that. We got past that though. But what I didnt get past was the awful smell from the shower. It smelled like dirty feet. It was beyond awful and I complained everyday for a week and no one did anything for me. I also requested fresh towels at 7am a couple mornings and nothing came all day. I think its awful that at 7 in the morning no one can grab me a fresh towel.I do have to mention one thing though. If you want good food, order room service. It was awesome fresh good and it didnt take long to get to your room. We just found alot of the staff took advantage of serving us to the fullest because we were young and on our own on. I would only return to this resort again if I saw it on a cheap last minute and it was reasonably priced.

<Content>Viva La Punta Cana! WOW! ----- That is what you will be saying when you come back!I went to Punta Cana Grand on my March Break with my dad and my little brother. Im 18, so it was no difficulty finding people to hang around with. At the end of the week i was friends with people ages 16 to 65 - believe it or not. Food:Im a picky eater so i think to tell you the food was terrible would be wrong. But it is nothing that will sotp you from having a good time. The breakfast runs till about 12 at the latest and is usually fully stocked. At lunch you can go to the basically 24 hour resauraunt - if you can call it that. You can get great pizza, big hamburgers or hot dogs, tons of fries and club sandwidges as well. For Dinner you have the choice of the buffet which comes wiht a slow but amazing pasta cook. You can also go to the fancy italian restaurant or the Steak house on top of the lunch place, its kind of hard to find so jsut ask.Room service is available, i never got it but when my friends did - well, i wen tto go eat and when i came back - it still was not there.Hotel (Look, Quality, Staff, Service):The hotel is beautiful... trust me it looks better then the pictures. The lobby is enormous and filled with a disco club which is good if you are completely intoxicated and if alot of poeple decide to go. It also had a cigar bar where kareoke and some live music take place (more for the older crowd)The hotel has 7 enormous buildings (i suggest buildings 4-7 as they are the newest, nicest, and away from casino construciton)Try to get a room where the ocea is in site, its magnificent waking to the swishing of the water...thats what makes vacation.The doors in the hotel have rust, the buildings have not been painted in some time, but nothing is to expressive in its fatigue in color, you will only notice these imperfections from a close look.The gardens and trees are well cut and the entire resort is always cleen, with staff always available.The staff are AMAZING! Tip-tip-tip, and you will have faster service, dollars get it done. Even packs of gum do the trick. My dad and I tipped out maids every other day, sometimes wiht cash sometimes with a box of stuff they can us. (remember these people make around 100 dollars a month, anything they get extra is greatly appreciated) They are all good people... ladies, the men CAN get touchy but its nothing to ponder on.The TV is okay, depending on your room, everyone gets the same channels, majority of them spanish, but if you need a beach break, there is some TNT and TBS for you.The beds are pretty comfertable and the rooms are in good shape from what i saw. Thankfully i got the 3rd flore which i most definitely recomend, because you get the high ceilings which makes the room look large and lovely.Activities/Night Life:You wake up - eat - then jsut chill pool side at the splash bar or stroll along the beach for a few hours, catch some tan, read your book, blast your i-pod. If you need more you can go banana boating,- kayaking-sailing-parasailing (really cool)- volley ball, tennis, large chest-board- if you go in the town, get a cab to take you to the go-karts which is fun or you can rent ATV's and even go horse back rideing.-Snorkeling, Scuba Diving, Swim beside gated-off sharks and sting-raysAt night time really there is not much to do other then get wasted, meet people, skinny dip, disco club, and piano bar. But if you are one of those lucky people going after April the Casino will be ready. And if you are not lucky, there is the Flamingo and a coupple other resorts with casinos and large nightclubs.DONT WORRY PEOPLE, HAVE ALOT OF MAI TAI'S,77'S AND BANANA MAMA'S AND YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST AT NIGHT!Also they put on shows, there most recognized one which was really good is there Michael Jackson inpersonations.The beach can get packed, this doesent mean you wont have room to walk, it jsut means there is not many long-chairs to sit. Especially if you want some shade and a cabanna, you need to wake for around 6 30 to reserve one with your towel. Its quite annoying there, people leave there stuff from morning to night time giveing others no chances to have a decent spot.I had an amazing time, i knew only my family but left with many friends whome i am going to party with soon. Teens, you will have a blast, jsut be open, confident, share where you are from and you will beaccepted, EVERYONES IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU!Punta Cana Grand is gorgeous so there are many couples who are just there together having a wacky good time.Many families go with their children and they all say they have a great time as well.It's truly ana amazing place, no rain, no excessive heat, perfect weather, palm trees with endless shadows and water which matches the sky.--VIVA LA DOMINICANA!P.S THERE IS A 24 HOUR BARP.P.S GET READY FOR BEACH PAPI

<Content>Never going back again! The hotel is totaly out of fashion. I found the rooms with a strang smell and everything seamed to be durty!The food was ok!The pools were old too and need to be rebuilt! Everything needs a big clean up to gain a new look. At night the parties were not that good too but it was also due to the weather.(even thought I think the hotel should think aboit indoor activities when this happens).Staff was nice and the beach too.I dont recommend this hotel for now!

<Content>Would have been a five if it weren't for one incident.... I wasn't going to write this review as I didn't want to give the hotel a bad name but I thought that it was necessary to warn other people. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from Feb 26th to about March 5th. The hotel itself was amazing. The food was excellent (Iespecially reccommend the omlettes in the morning, the staff was friendly and the weather was beautiful all week long. I have stayed at too other all inclusives (one in Panama and one in Cuba) and this was by far the best one. NOw for the bad part.On our second night at the hotel we were partying till about 12:30am and when we arrived back in our room we relaized that we had been robbed.We were in building one on the first floor. We figure that they got in the back door because the lock was not very secure. They stole things such as an IPod, running shoes, 2 pairs of sunglasses etc. Luckily the camera, money and passports were in the safe. Now, I don't really blame anyone for what happened (although the hotel didn't really seem to care to much that it happened.. we had to actually fight them for a room change, it is something to keep in mind. When you get to the hotel (or any hotel) fiighting for a room that is not ground level is well worth it and if you do have ground level make sure the lock is secure. But as I saiid before other then this our vacation was FANTASTIC and highly reccommend the resort!If anyone has any questions feel free to email me!

<Content>Awesome resort We are just back from the Grand on March 15th. Very Nice resort, nice size, able to walk anywhere within three to four minutes. Rooms very nice, grounds kept very nice, the staff were very pleasant. Bathrooms nice, even the common baths were kept immaculate. Food was very good. Water pressure in the showers was a little below what we are used to. Drinks are domestic only, but quite a variety and very good. Don't plan on single malt scotches or JW black. The casino is currently under construction, but will undoubtedly make this resort even better. We did not have a single problem the entire time there. While talking with other guests, as well as overhearing others at the resort, all were very impressed. I would return to this resort in a minute. Simply put, we had a blast. If you leave this resort unhappy, perhaps you need a doctors review:)

<Content>Not Bad Just got back from on week at the Punta Cana Grand.  Like to say the people that work there are the best ever.They work very hard and always try to please you. As far as our room, I was not happy. we were in building number 3 close to bar and lobby, the room was too dark for me and could hear the music at night. We upgraded on the our third day to building number 7, wow they are beautiful.Didnt have hot water most days though and power did go out at least 3 times while we were there.But moving to this building for me was worth the 50 dollars a day extra, They will show you the rooms if you would like to see them.  Food is ok nothing special, the main buffet is a dark place to eat and is not a open air, We ate most days at the beach garden close to the ocean.My favorite was the Italian. Beach is real nice, you can walk forever, but like mose places you do need to get a hut early in the morning, not a problem up early anyways.  Its a nice resort, we enjoyed our vacation. The Michael Jackson is excellent, you cant miss it. The new casino that is being built is going to be unreal. Grounds are clean and pools are nice too. So have fun.

<Content>Absolutly Amazing Punta Cana Grand was the best resort I have ever stayed at. The only complaint I have is the food was too good and I spent too much money for tips, because the service was too friendly and excellent. The shopping along the beach was good, and most prices were good if you knew how to barter well. For those of you who are going to go shopping bring soaps and toiletries to trade, as the people here have limited supplies. The beaches, and pool were amazing. The beaches had cozy huts to sit under, and it was always clean. The pool's swim up bar was a lot of fun and the service was very friendly.The beaches were a bit windy, although it was nice to get a breeze, for the weather was scorching and gorgeous.As for the weather we had amazing weather. It rained once in the morning, before everyone was up and it was almost a misty rain that lasted 5-10 minutes max. Overall, I don't understand why this resort isn't a 5*. If there is something better out there I'd be shocked. We were spoiled rotten, and the food and drinks were to die for.

<Content>A few problems... We just got back March 12th from the Punta Cana Grand. Overall, I would rate it a 3+, not higher. The biggest aggravation was the noise, and I noticed several other reviews that mentioned the Spanish kids. They checked in at 3:30 am, and the rest of the duration they were noisy and rude, and late at night all week long. The first night we had a lengthy checkin at 11:00 pm, and then could not sleep because our room in building 4 was closest to the disco. We moved to the other side of building 5 the next day, and that's when the Spaniards moved in. That and incessant barking from the dog kennel just outside the resort prevented us from getting much sleep all week long. There was no hot water for showers, and frequent power outages, a nuisance for sure. The food was okay, but we both got sick one day from who knows what. But you have to watch what you eat, they are not always as vigilant at keeping foods chilled or adequately heated as we are here.The rooms were very nice, but little things broken; the first room had something stuffed down the sink drain, and the second had a broken side mirror. The housekeeping was pretty good, we did tip regularly, the fridge was minimally stocked, but there was water and beer in there every day. Beach was very nice, weather was great, staff were very nice too. We didn't do any excursions, not into that, but we took out a catamaran and that was fun. The disco did not play a variety of music, so we didn't go back. The Italian restaurant was very good, well worth the wait. The Tex Mex was a waste of time, my food was cold, not a good experience. Our flight time out was late: 10:20, and the tour company was picking us up at 6:40 pm, but check out time was 12:00 pm. You have to pay for the extended use of the room, which considering our check in was after 11:00 pm didn't seem quite right. We did get 7 nights, but not 7 days, included.A few pitfalls, an okay holiday, but we wouldn't go back to that resort. The Bahia Prinicipe in Pueto Plata was a better resort, better layout.

<Content>What a Disappointment!: We (4 of us) were very late arriving (3am) and were shown to rooms with broken lamps, one towel, a very dingy bathroom with all sorts of broken tiles and a tub which may have been clean but was grey and scratched.All night young people partied which echoed through the halls like a megaphone. The next morning we went to the front desk and paid to upgrade to Bldg.#7. It is very beautiful and much newer. The a la carte restauants were good but the buffet did not offer the selection we experienced in 2005 at the Barcelo Bravara Beach Resort. By the end of the week there was no WOW factor to the buffet at all. The last night we were there, at 3am a young couple decided to use our patio hot tub. When they turned on the motor the noise in our room was very loud. We called security three times over the next hour and a half. They never did come. As there were a lot of young folks partying, drinking and whatever, we were reluctant to confront this nude couple. Finally we banged on the patio door and yelled at them to leave.I wondered if this drunk couple had drown in our hot tub if security would have shown up. When we were calling for security, the front desk basically laughed it off saying it was just kids. Well these kids didn't pay for our hot tub - we did.We would return to Punta Cana without thought, but you could not pay us to stay here again. It is a shame that we work so hard to be able to take a vacation and that the negative things overshadowed the whole holiday. Punta Cana has beautiful beaches and the weather was perfect.

<Content>AMAZING!!!! This resort was totally amazing! The resort itself is pretty small in comparison to other DR Punta cana resorts. The food was soooo good! The Italian restaurant was our fav! The lunch at Windows was fab as well. The beach in front of the hotel is nice but a short walk down is so gorgeous! we have been to many other places in the carribean and this resort defintley left a smile on our faces. The rooms were big, spacious and very clean. The hotel was very well maintained. All ages would find this resort fun. The shows were really good as well...the Michael jackson show was so good! The staff at the resort work really hard! I recommend doing day trips as well. We loved it!!!!

<Content>Great realxing holiday! We just returned from Punta Cana Grand on March 10th. We had read many of the trip advisor reviews over and over before deciding where to go and we got exactly what we expected at this resort. We went with Sunwing. The aircraft itself was quite cramped but it was one of the best flights I have had in terms of staff and what they offer free of charge(beverage, snack, meal with wine, headphones). There was a movie and they also showed a couple of sitcoms. The time passed very quickly.We arrived at night. Our check-in was quick as we had booked a junior master suite ahead of time. You got to check-in off to the side from where everyone else was. We got everything we requested (king size bed, 3rd floor-high ceilings). Whatever you do, stay in building 7. It is well worth the few extra bucks per person. It is brand new and gorgeous. The safe uses a code (costs $15 for the week)..I heard that other buildings had to use keys and carry them around all the time. Maid service was great and friendly. Mini bar was always stocked and many clean towels. I asked the maid for extra water one day only and I had 4 to 5 bottles in the room every day. Our air conditioning did not work a couple of nights but we went to talk to guest services one morning and we we got back later in the afternoon it was working again. If you depart late in the day you can either book a hospitality suite to shower and change or you can extend your room until 6pm the day of your departure for $30 US. On the day of our departure there was a power outage and the water was off. It power finally came back on at 5pm and the water at 5:30pm. No hot water though...we ended up having a cold shower very quickly then went and caught our bus to the airport. We had a heated discussion with the desk clerk about not wanting to pay the $30 since nothing in the room was working. He finally agreed to taking 50% off.There is construction that is actually near building 7 and 1. We were in about the middle of the building and it didn't really bother us but I think if your room was the farthest away from the beach (near the theatre) it could have been a problem. Beach was really nice. Well maintained, water was warm. You can walk a long way down the beach past other resorts to an natural park. Something nice to do on a cloudy morning. We were gone for 2 hours.There are 3 pools. A lazy river type pool between building 1 and 7. This pool is very clean but very cold. We didn't venture into the large pool with the swim-up bar. Our favourite and where we spent most of our time was the adult only pool. It was quiet (expect for the Spanish kids a couple of days that you will read about in other reviews) and very protected from the wind. Meet lots of friendly people (80% are Canadian and you feel right at home). The bartender Nickolas was great. Get to know him and he'll serve you right at your chair! Ask for the Nickolas special!!!Food was great! We liked the Italian restaurant the best. We also went to the American Grill. It was ok, if I had more time I would have gave it another try. The nice thing was that you didn't have to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants. It was first come first serve and you can go as many times as you want to each one. We heard that the beach party on Thursday night was amazing but unfortunately we arrived and left on Thursday so we didn't get a chance to go. The basically shut everything down and you have dinner and a party right on the beach. We were so tired from drink, food, and sun everyday that we only made it to one show, Michael Jackson. It was really entertaining. We also did one day excursion to Saona Island. You go to the Carribean side and take a speed boat to this natural swimming pool in the middle of the ocean where there are starfish. Pretty cool. Then they take you to Saona Island. This place was gorgeous. The water was shallow, warm and so aqua blue!! You spend the afternoon and have a BBQ. Then you take a 2 hour catamaran ride back. It was a nice day.I don't really have anything bad to say about this resort. We got what we expected!

<Content>Great time at the Punta Cana Grande Just returned from the Punta Cana Grand and we had a great holiday. Have been to several other areas-Mexico-Bahamas-Cuba, but this was by far one of the best. The weather was great the whole week. The food was the best I have ever had in an all inclusive (would suggest losing a bit of weight before heading there) both quality and quantity. Windows restaurant (buffets) unbelievable selections and the staff great--amazing service. The Beach Party was a blast.Beach was great (a few seaweeds) but very well maintained! If you want a hut you should be down by 8:00 a.m. Although there was plenty of lounge chairs available they went very quickly.Our room was cleaned every day and well stocked. Hint - bring a few gifts or leave a tip for your housekeeper and you will get the little extra service! But hey this happens in Canada!There were plenty of activities all day long by the pool. Horsebacking riding, bike tour and parasailing nearby. Great walks along the beach! Little disappointed in the gym however. About 11 vendors are set up next to the hotel. Great little gifts to be found. They start high but will go down in price -- fun negotiating with them. Everything is CHEAPY CHEAPY and JUST FOR YOU. We were their during college Spring Break so the place was a bit noisy students partying! But what do you expect during spring break anywhere! There was a group of spanish students from Spain there for a few days and I would say they were the nuisance! Very inconsiderate - loud, left their garbage on the beach. Apprantly there was a holiday for students in Spain as well. I would not hesitate to return to this resort --however perhaps at a different time period. ENJOY!!

<Content>Nice Just returned from Punta Cana on Tuesday. Had a great time. Weather was great...a bit windy but nice. Only suggestion for the hotel would be --- having more organized activites. Otherwise you end up sitting in the sun and drinking all day...I think it was just the timing with spring break and all...but alot of arrogant kids from Spain were there...budding lines (because they knew the language) and even pushing elderly out of the way! Very rude. But I guess that has nothing to do with the resort itself. The beach was nice - alot of seaweed though. Maybe its the time of year??? Yes I would go back but not anywhere near march break..

<Content>Loved it If you want friendly service, beautiful atmoshpere, and not very big then this is your place. There are about 450 rooms, and they just built 64 new suites. The area on the beach in front of the hotel is the cleanist of all the surrounding resorts. We loved is so much that we went twice this year.

<Content>Noisy Noisy Nights We just returned, we were there from Feb 25 to March 4 - great vacation - good food, excellent choice and presentation - excellent service - clean rooms, nice pools, good beach, some seaweed. We always got a chair and some shade. However....... the noisy nights - the students did not sleep at night, the students partied all day and the loud party got louder at 11 pm and went to 4 am every night - no sleeping during those hours - they partied in the common areas, in the rooms, on the balconies, they had absolutely no respect for anyone who wanted to sleep - they were obnoxious - sad to say - some of them were Canadians - in the satisfaction survey we indicated we would not be back as a result of the noise at night. Neither security or management did anything about the noise, they did not try to contain any of it. Great resort, great people, little sleep.

<Content>Greatest holiday yet What can we say? Its the nicest place yet! I have travelled to a number of places within the Caribbean and have yet to stay at a place this nice. Granted there is plenty of construction going on, but its throughout the day at the front of the resort. So unless you sleep through the day, it shouldnt bother you. Afternoon siestas went a problem either. The resort is immaculately kept. The third floor rooms are the nicest, so make sure you request one. The food is top shelf! Niether one of us got the typical illnesses that you would normally get from tropical food. And there is no limit on A La Carte dinners! The beach and pool are busy, so if you want a hut make sure you get down there before 8am to reserve it. Not to worry if you are a late sleeper, just run down there early in the morning, leave a towel or two, and no one will bother it. This is the most beautiful beach I have seen yet. The water is crystal blue, and goes for miles and miles. There are numerous water activities as well as inland activities. The Parasailing was phenominal! Talk the locals down in price, and you should get a great deal. There is a market beside the resort for gifts. Buy there, and not at the resort (way over priced at the resort). The locals at the market are pretty good. They will start really high in price, cut that price in half if not more and they will more than likely take it. A good tip for all you drinkers, bring travel mugs along on your trip. The drinks are great, but because of the hot, hot days they get warm way too fast. And the bartenders will fill up any cup with booze, no matter the size. It keeps those frosty drinks cold, cold, cold! What more can we say? Fabulous trip, great people (not as friendly as most caribbean destinations, but oh well) oh and getting engaged on the beach was great too....:)Have fun, we certainly did!

<Content>Awesome resort!!! ... Skyservice sucks This was my fourth time to the Domincican Republic. I am 23, I travelled with my girlfriend(21), and my friend(23) and his girlfriend(23). We stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from Feb 19-26. This resort was really enjoyable and there was very little to complain about (Besides the 9.5 hour delay on the way down as well as an unexpected stop over in the Bahamas becuase of the worst airline ever... SKYSERVICE!!The positives; Resort- the grounds are kept very clean and there is lots of vegatation and palm trees. Buildings are very nice. The resort is the perfect size. Its a 2 minute walk to go anywhere. The employees work incredibly long hours for incredibly low pay. For those people who complained about service or wait times at the bars, courtesy goes a very long way. It made me sick when I saw people treat the employees badly becuase they had to wait 2 minutes for a drink or food, you are there all week, relax the whole resort does not revolve around you. Juan Cruz at the pool bar was very hard working and this guy does not stop all day. We never waited for drinks from the pool bar even when it was packed, like I said, common courtesy goes a very long way.Lenin at the Theatre Bar was a blast and really made our evenings at the theatre fun. There is some construction going on that i did not find too loud or disruptive. When the renovations are finished this resort will be even more AMAZING! They are adding a casino and a few other things.Food-Best food out of any of the previous resorts I have been too (Riu Merengue (Peurto Plata), Occidental Grande Flamenco(Punta Cana)and the LTI (Punta Cana)). There were Unlimited A la Cartes (3 of them, American Grill, Italian, Steak House), what more could you ask for?Food was amazing and service was excellent.Beach Party was unbelievable!!Rooms-Very spacious and clean, the maids cleaned our room everyday and our fridge was always stocked. For those people who complained about the construction I dont know what your problem is. Our room ( Room #1112 in building #1) was right next to the construction and you could hear it, but that was only between 8 am and 5pm and it didnt bother us becuase we were never in our rooms between those times. These rooms basically the same as any other resort.Beach- Very nice, not as nice as the Bavaro section that is a little further north. However, there was always lots of activities going on and it was still absolutly gorgeous. I cant believe people would actually complain about the seaweed on the beach, except for some that washed up on shore it was basically non-existent. Remember people, the OCEAN as amazing as this sounds, is not a pool. You are bound to get some weeds wherever you go. Entertainment- Very good, we did not make it to all of the shows due to excess alcohal consumption, however the Michael Jackson Show was awesome and the other shows we saw were also very good, similar to the other resorts I have been too. - The disco was a decent size and fun as well as the piano bar.Now for the Negatives;- The only negatives i can think of from our stay has absolutly nothing to do with our resort. There was a group of students from Spain (I think...)that showed up the frist night we were there. They had no respect for anyone and they were incredibly rude and disruptive the whole time. Dont get me wrong, I am 23 years old and I love to booze it up and party hard, but not at the expense everyone else at the resort who are trying to enjoy their vacation. These guys should have had the maturity and courtesy to know their boundries.If you are in the process of planning a vacation, I highly reccommend this resort!!! However, DO NOT FLY WITH SKYSERVICE!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT FLY WITH SKYSERVICE!!!! We had a mechanical problem with the plane on the way down which in turn, delayed us 9.5 hours and added a stop over in the bahamas. During our 9.5 hour delay skyservice told us absolutly nothing and kept telling us 20 mins, 20 Mins over and over again. After 9.5 hours of no answers people got pretty angry. On the way back it took us almost 3 hours to get our luggage off the plane becuase of another mechanical problem with the plane. The Skyservice reps were rude and never had any clue about what was going on. My friend who was on a different flight back home from Punta Cana still has not recieved his luggage. There was another skyservice flight that were delayed 19 hours which caused our delay as well. This airline is very unreliable and seem to have a a ton of mechanical problems with the planes. I dont know about you, but I like flying in planes that dont have alot of mechanical problems.... but thats just me. I never really felt safe on the plane and I love to fly.DO NOT FLY WITH SKYSERVICE!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT FLY WITH SKYSERVICE!!!! But besides the terrible experiences with Skyservice our vacation was still amazing and i highly reccommend the Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>mostly good but.....Feb 19-26 Ok lets start, check in went well, until we found out we had two double beds instead of the king we asked for when we booked the trip back in nov.Not a big deal.The room was clean, lots of towels ,a/c worked all good there, though it would have been nice to have a newly renovated room like some were, but for the time we spent in the room it wasn't a big deal either. The restaurants were all good. The pools were very clean, but you had to get up at 5am to put your towel on a loung chair or you wouldn't get one by the pool or under an umbrella. There was some construction going on while we were there it was a little distracting to the eyes.They are building a new casino on site looks like it will be nice and when everthing is done it will look awsome.Only one complaint, and that it was very disturbing was there was a large group of students that arrived the day after we did and they had just completly took over everything in the resort the pools, the restaurants the pool mats the bars they were loud and roudy up all thhrough the night singing banging on peoples doors in the wee hours of the night wasting the drinks by throwing them on each other just a lack of respect for everyone around them including the staff and other guests. When complaints were put in about this absolutly nothing was done!!!! therefore pretty much ruining our vacation along with many other peoples.Bottom line is I will never return to this resort simply because management did nothing to correct this problem. A t-shirt and a bottle just dont cut it when you spent so much to come and relax!!! Hi everyone by the adult pool! All you good people.

<Content>The good the bad and the construction.... Ok so my boyfriend and I just got back from a week at the Punta Cana Grand. (Feb 19-26th) We had a wonderful trip although not everything was as we thought it would be. I thought it best to do the basic pro and con list as everyone looks for different things on vacation.Pro:- Food was great! Seriously, best I have ever had on vacation. Definitely gained a few pounds. Love the 鈥淎merican grill鈥?br/>- Very clean. Our rooms and the rest of the resort was spotless. We had no problems with bugs of any kind. Beach was also well kept, no seaweed.- Hotel staff was very friendly and even though we spoke almost 0 Spanish, there were no communication barriers.- Lots of shade by the pool and beach. I did not have to get up early to find a spot. At any given time ppl were leaving for trips or going for food and they generally took their stuff with them so other ppl could enjoy the shade. Not everyone was an umbrella hog.-Also, there were great floating beds (6 of them) in the pool to lie on and float around (favorite thing to do) ppl were great for sharing those as well. With the exception of one rude family who would take 2 or 3 of them at a time out of the pool and put them beside their lounge chairs or lay on them on the deck so they could use them again when they felt like it. THIS IS INCREDIBLY RUDE. If your not using the 鈥渇loaty鈥?please give it to a kid or someone else who could use it. If we all share we can all enjoy.- Lot鈥檚 of activities. Both included and not. The kayaks, wind surfing and catamarans were always available and you could take lessons (9am) if you have had never done it before. Try the catamarans鈥ot鈥檚 of fun! We took one day trip. Snorkeling with the sharks (70 USD per person) this was a wonderful trip and I would definitely do it again. The staff was fun and informative. It was not just a party boat so the kids will have fun too. We took one night trip to the casino, that was great too.- Beach party on Thursday was good, the staff spent all day setting up and the food was amazing. Nothing like having a candle lit dinner on the beach followed by a movie (yes on the beach) Don鈥檛 miss it.Now for the con list鈥?.- Yes this hotel is under construction鈥?not a little鈥?a lot. We were in building #1which was beside the construction and it does disturb you. Large CAT machines tearing down the old theater. They are building some shops and a casino. We did have our power and water go off from time to time but only for short periods of time. But it is still a little annoying. On our 3rd day they gutted out the spa so if you plan on using any spa facilities you have to go to the hotel next door. This did not ruin our trip but it was disturbing. I talked to the contractor while we were watching them tear down the theater and he said they are scheduled to finish in approximately 2 months. I have pictures, if you would like to see the construction and decide for yourself I would be happy to send them to you. See email address at the bottom.- Room was not up to par on what we were expecting. I鈥檓 pretty sure we paid for an upgrade but we got the very basic room and the bathroom door would not close鈥t all.The hotel was overbooked so we could not switch rooms (apparently they had to send several ppl to other hotels because they could not accommodate them) - There is no internet connection available at this hotel. If you want to use the internet you have to walk to the next hotel. It鈥檚 not far but definitely inconvenient. Cost of the internet at that hotel is 3USD for 15 minutes or 5USD for 30 minutes. -This is a very small hotel, only 300 rooms. This might appeal to a lot of people, however I like larger hotels with more space to walk around and explore. Depends on your preference.- There was one large group of kids running around at 4am every night yelling and waking everyone up. I know this is not a direct complaint about the hotel however hotel security did not seem to do anything to stop them which would have been nice.That鈥檚 it. If you had any questions about this hotel or the Grand Palladium Bavaro Resort  Spa (I stayed there in June *amazing*) please feel free to email me. I am always happy to help. jennstar2@gmail(-)

<Content>Agree with Glass Half Full I have to agree with Glass Half Full Although the resort was beautiful there were definate things that just should have been better.The food quality, taste and presentation was great. I must say the best food I have in DR yet. The Al La carte dinners were even better. I noticed Felix the Food and Beverage Manager around at all times. And the waiters in the buffet were always quick.The Pool/Beach were both great. We too could never get beach towels and we sat next to the hut everyday starting at 7:30... when you did see them come out you had to run! Pool was good tempature and was cleaned every day. The same Spanish students (as we were there on the same week I would think) threw all the lawn chairs and giant chess peices in it one day at 6am and then saved 20 lawn chairs and went to bed. I was up getting the lawn chairs and saw it happen! I felt bad for the cleaner that day. (yes u have to get up early to grab those chairs, but I think that is the same every where)The evening entertainment was ok. They have a beautiful new theatre built that was opened our first night there. I think though (or I hope) due to management changes the animation crew is going through some changes because it seemed to lack compared to other places I have stayed. They hired many outside entertainment companies for the theatre presentations instead of performing thier own. Again not awlful just not A+.Rooms were clean, and maid service was fine. Always had clean towels and stuff... (but we tipped well)The rooms are looking old but I think that will improve as much improvements are going on. But with these ongoing improvements we too had no hot water/shower while we were there. When you pay for a 4* resort (I know it is a different standard then Canada) but I do expect Hot water. All the stuff in mini bar was replenished daily and was included.Drinks and Bars were good and plentiful. Liked the option of the piano/Karaoke bar or Disco at night. If you wanted a quiet night the pool and Beach bar are available.The best part of this resort is thier beach party on Thursday nights. Not to be missed. They work all day to set up so you can eat Buffet on the beach. On thurs only one ala carte is open and so most attend. It was one of the highlights.Checking in was ok. We we delayed by one day. Sunwing did nothing for us. Not even a taxi voucher to get home when they cancelled our flight. On top of this they gave the rooms we paid for that day to the others that were stranded, so like glass half Full said when we finally did arrive our rooms were not even ready for another 4 hours. Unacceptable. So Loved Punta Cana Grand below... I hope you enjoyed your extra night in building 7 cause I paid for it and got nothing in return. I blame sun wing for that not the hotel or the stranded visitors. If I was stranded I would hoped my tour operator would have helped or compensated me. But I do believe the ones stranded in Ottawa should have been compensated as well.In the end, we had a great vacation and did not let the little things ruin it, but would I go back... probably not until the renovations are complete and definatly not on spring break when young rude students are hollaring and screaming until 6am.

<Content>Glass was half full... OK, before I get hate mail about being unreasonable... the 3 stars has some reason to it. The weather here was AMAZING. Just what the Dr. ordered. From an aethetic perspective, this is a 4 or 4.5 star spot. The resort is beautiful. Stunning. Extremely nicely kept-up. Flowers are everywhere, the grounds are impeccably groomed. The beach is manicured each morning, and the ocean is gorgeous. The pool is huge and there's a wicked swim up bar. The food is very good - there is a great variety and everyone should be able to find something very tasty every nights. I mean with options as extravagant as roasted boar, chuchuro, spicy local fish to options as simple as pasta, pizza, coldcuts and salads, there should be no complaints about going hungry. The rooms themselves are spacious, clean and have new modern furntiture. So from a visual perspective, this place rocks.But... despite some very nice employees, the attitude of too many staff members was completely uncaring and inhospitable. We tipped over $15 a day in total to various employees and really didn't think they cared.But there were never any beach towels - even at 8am!! No biggie, but this became really annoying after the 4th day of being told that the laundry facility is broken. But no biggie...But there wasn't hot water (none for us 5 of 6 nights) ... ah, who cares right? Afterall, with too much sun, a nice cold shower may feel pretty good, right?But the Check in people were beyond rude and unhelpful... our flight was delayed from getting in at 1am until noon the next day (which is why we only had 6 nights) and our room STILL wasn't ready until 17:00/5pm!!! So we had to watch all our things all day. But your vacation is what you make of it, so we moved on...But this was reading week, but there were Spanish Students everywhere causing havoc, at the enjoyment of other guests. These kids partied until 6am everynight and kept eveyone up, hollering. When complaints came it, the resort did nothing!! Why weren't they told to respect the resort rules or else get tossed? Trust me, this was way over the iop. Where was security?But the smoke shop tried to charge my wife 6,500 dominican pesos for a pack of smokes. When she realized that this was apporox CAD200 she inisisted on cancelling the transaction... when I complained to the front desk and concierge they just asked my room number and looked down. Nothing!But the first hospitality room I had booked 2 days into our vacation wasn't booked according to a real piece of work at the desk. Then, I was issued a key for a room that actually had guests in it!!! Imagine, 2 hours before you leave for you flight and want a shower, you open a door for a room with guests in it!! They were as confused as we were. After being invited into someone's room by a chambermaid to speak with the front desk we finally received a key to a grungy room for freshening up... this place was filthy! My wife didn't even want to use the shower, and thankfully we had brought our own towels from home or would have had none.Too many buts...Overall, this place has sooo much potential. They are constructing new facilities and this place will keep getting nicer. It's too bad that the beauty of this spot couldn't be remotely challenged by the attitudes of key employees who constanly challenged us to see the glass half full.We totally recommend Punta Cana, but overall, can't recommend this place. My folks stayed at the Barcello and loved it...

<Content>Great Holiday We just came back from a week at the Punta Cana Grand.Feb 17-Feb 23. What a great time !!! Staff is excellent. If you go look for Lenin the bartender or Daniel the bartender, both work nights and are a lot of fun. Resort is a good size with everything close by. If you couldn't find anything you liked at the buffet or the other two restaurants then you had a problem. The nightly shows were really well done and the dancers were very talented. The new stage opened up the second day we were there, so we were the first to experience it. Sure the place is under construction, but it is not intrusive and from what i can see they are continually improving the resort. The new wing Building 7 is the place to be. Rooms are huge with Jacuzzi tubs and marble and ceramic throughout. Third floor have vaulted ceilings with an overhead fan. Loss of power and hot water was an occasional disruption,but then again you are in D.R. Cleaning staff very good and tips go along way to getting those little extras in your room.The beaches are great and walks along the beach early in the morning were very nice. I rate the resort very good, but I did hear some complaints from the people we met. I guess it depended on which building you were in.Phil Maggie

<Content>Loved the Punta Cana Grand We went Feb. 10-18th and had a great time. Staff are excellent and vendors don't bother you on the beach. There is a little flea market on the beach so you can go shopping if you feel like it. Pink flamingos reside on the property...cool!Bartender Beachpapi is the best; always happy and singing and he does cool things with bananas!! We got to stay an extra night because of the storm in Ottawa and they put us in Bldg. 7..WOW! What a treat! The only complaint I have is that security did not respond to our 3 phone calls during the night when our immature neighbours were partying and fighting at 4:00 a.m. Other than that, great place, great food. Don't worry about the construction, it does not affect you at all. They are building a casino at the front of the resort - the beach and bars are at the back of the resort near the beach. We never heard a saw, hammer or drill the whole time. The entertainment is good but the Michael Jackson show was the best. The beach party is awesome; what a memorable event. I recommend this resort and if you can afford the extra $50/day, get a deluxe room in Bldg. 7, it's well worth it.Warning: don't take the Country Safari excursion. We spent most of the day on the truck driving through and into pot holes and by 3 p.m., I thought I was going to puke! Our tour guide fell asleep and our driver took 3 wrong turns. They gave us a partial refund because other people complained. Advice: bring a can of Lysol Linen spray to get rid of the smell in the rooms and bedding; this is normal there. Also, when the cleaning lady puts fresh flowers around your sink and on your bed, it carries little black bugs so a quick spray always killed them on the spot - no big deal!I would love to go back next year to see all the improvements made to this resort.

<Content>Had it's ups and downs Just got back last night.In general it was good. I asked for bldg 4 upon check in and was ignored so we got bldg 1. No air conditioning. By Friday (arrived on Tuesday we managed to get moved) again there was no air but it was close to the beach so we had a breeze at least.I also got sick from the food and was down for 24 hours.The Michael Jackson show is amazing. I found the resort was very crowded and felt like a sardine on the beach along with listening to the continuous hammering from the construction outside the beach restaurant.Food was good and service was excellent. Really liked the staff (except reception)All in all it was worth the last minute price I paid.

<Content>Great resort My husband and I stayed here from Feb 3 to 10 2005.Nice intimate resort, very clean and food was good, always something to eat. The beach bbq was really nice. There is construction on the property. The hotel was sold and the new owners were all over the place the week we were there, so service was great as all the staff were being watched. Beautiful beach for long walks. Would definitely go back.

<Content>Great Holiday, lots of fun. Stayed from Feb.10 to Feb. 17/06: We travelled 2 couples with Sunwing. A last minute deal came up for us to stay in Suites which was bldg. #7.The room: WOW!!! the room was fantastic: King size bed, Jacuzzi tub, very very big bathroom, the room decor was beautiful but the floors are ceramic titles (a bit cold on the feet). If you take a regular room we will be dispointed because the are terrible, we saw them. So make sure to get a suite. Sunwing also gave us Golf-shirts and bottle of rum in our room. We paid $1450.00 tax Included each, it was worth every dollars.The Food: The food was all good, no complaints for the quality. But the portion at A la Carte restaurants are a bit too small, even for me. My husband had to order double portions to satisfy him.The Night shows at 9:30 every night were good, do not miss the Micheal Jackson Show it's fantastics.They are 8 bars at this resorts. As far as food, if you go beside the pool bar there is food there from 5:00 to 6:30, all the other restaurants are close during that time. To get ready for supper. No you will not be out of food like people stated.The Vendors: Do not pay the price they tell you. Cut down the price from 2/3 or 1/2. We got lots of t-shirts they wanted $18 US, so we got them for $6.USThe Constructions: Is beside the bldg. #1 and #7, why do people complaint it's not that bad. They are building a Casino and it will be finished in 3 months. The Service: No complaints, the staff are very good and pleasant.My husband and I have travelled a lot, yes we do recommend this resorts. We never go back to the same one.

<Content>Good Vacation! I just got back from this resort and overall, I had a pretty good time. I went with just one girlfriend, both of us in our early 20's, and that did cause a few problems. We found that basically all the male staff would ogle us, make comments or lewd remarks, often in Spanish too so we couldn't really understand. At first it may have been flattering and funny, but by the end of the trip we were getting very frustrated and kind of disgusted.But anyway, that didn't ruin our vacation! The first five days or so were perfect! The weather was beautiful, we went parasailing on Valentines Day (definitely worth it), and we met lots of friends, many from the GTA like us. The Disco was pretty fun most nights, a lot of people went to Mangu, this huge all night club on another resort, but we didn't want to have to go somewhere where we would need to pay for drinks.The food was decent. I'm super picky and I didn't starve. Windows was good, if a little repetitive. The chicken fajitas at the Tex Mex Grill were very good and the Three Cheese lasagna from Da Marios was amazing, it's under appetizers but they bring you twice the size if it's your main course. The Beach Garden was good for pizza, we ordered burgers there one day and they were kind of pinkish/greyish, I didn't even bite into it.We were in building 1 on the third floor which was nice, but we were also right beside the construction which was not so great. We liked being by the entertainment stage though because if we didnt feel like watching we'd just hang out on our balcony and listen, they only run until about 10:30 anyway. Antony, an entertainer, is the coolest guy ever. My friend and I became really close with him while we were there, he's tons of fun! Luis is a very nice bartender as well. It seems as though the staff never stops working, we'd see them at night, and then again first thing in the morning.The last couple of days we ran into a few problems. Friday the power kept going out and we had no electricity from about 3-10 and no running water for a large portion of the day. It was kind of annoying when we got back from the beach and wanted to get ready. It went out again a couple of times on Saturday. We had to check out at 12 but we didn't leave the resort until 7 so we booked a hospitality suite. We didn't know, however, that it was some guys office and him and another man would be in there the whole time we were showering and getting ready, that was a little creepy!Overall though, it was pretty fun. I didn't get sick at all which was my biggest fear, I brushed my teeth with bottled water but had ice in my drinks (they asured us it was purified). I don't know if I'd go back to this resort, maybe after visiting some other areas first.

<Content>Nice Time-helpful hints We stayed at the Punta Cana Grand Feb 5-12, 2006.The resort is very beautiful but small, which we didn't mind.Some Tips:I called the hotel directly to book our rooms. We reserved 4 in total.Our room was 4313 which is adjoining to 4315. The rooms on the top floors are much nicer because they have vaulted ceilings, however, when it rains it is quite noisy. I recommend earplugs.Buildings 1,2 and 3 are near the theatre and can be loud until around 11pm. Building 7 is all suites. They have been newly built and some even have bathtubs outside on the balcony, but they cost extra.The food was quite good. The American Grill wasn't that great but we really enjoyed the Italian Restaurant. The shrimp and Steak was great.Bring lots of bug spray just for the evenings.Get your towels in the morning because they tend to run out before noon.I found the DR to be more expensive for souvenirs than Mexico or Cuba.Bring lots of small bills because it's hard to find change. Don't bother with travellers chq's.My husband went on dune buggies one day. He had an amazing time. The only thing to keep in mind is that the 4 hour trip only consists of 1 1/2 hours of actual riding. It takes about an hour to reach the site and then stops part way for a brief tour of a sugar cane field and coffee field. He highly recommends it. Just be careful. Some of the vehicles lost wheels or broke down.Because our bus was leaving at 6pm on our last day, we had a hard time finding food for dinner. The restaurants are open most of the time but they all seem to close for an hour at 5pm for cleaning. We couldn't call room service because checkout was 12pm. I went over to the Windows buffet restaurant, although closed, for some help and they arranged for food to be brought to us. Overall we had a nice time. The resort needs a bit of updating and TLC but the grounds are lovely. It lived up to our expectations. We probably wouldn't go back simply because we would like to try out different resorts.We have been to the Xcaret in Mexico and to Cuba twice. I think Mexico is your best bet, but for the price we paid for the Punta Cana Grand, it was worth it.Hope this helps.

<Content>Loved the Punta Cana Grand!!!! We just got back from the Punta Cana Grand. We were there from Feb 4 -10th. It was amazing! The hotel and the grounds are beautiful. The staff never stop working and are the most wonderful people. The beach was beautiful - the men were out at 6:30am raking the seaweed every morning. All the people we met were mostly Canadian! There is always something going on, we took our 3 daughters with us aged 12, 14 and 18. They had a great time. They are building a casino but you would never know it as there was no noise due to the construction. We read some reviews before we left and were hesitant to book but went with our gut instincts and am so glad we did. I would highly recommend this resort and would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>fantastic resort We stayed at this resort during the week of jan 29,2006 for 7 days.Bad PointsYou couldnt drink the water from the tap so it was a little worrying just washing your hands or showering but we knew about it before going.Some construction going on during the day but we were on the beach so who cares.1 couple went deep sea fishing with a guarantee to catch something-180US later and no fish.You had to buy a lock for the safe which meant you had to carry your key around-an extra 10US as well.That was all that was badThe good pointsThe buffet was excellent. Everyday there was a different selection and plenty of it. There was even ice cream during one lunch.Plenty of bottled water was available to bring to your room. Bar fridge with 2 beers and 2 bottled pop everydayThe housekeeping staff was great and the room was very clean. we lucked out in getting a 3rd floor so we had the high ceilings.The ac always worked!!The outback safari was worth the whole trip. By lunchtime most were feeling quite happy as the host was serving dominican champagne from the back of the truck.We tipped the right waiters and they always smiled when we arrived. The airport was very comfortable and spacious on departure and we waited for just an hour.Mostly Europeans and canadians on site-a very friendly crowd for a small resort.Nightly entertainment was great as each night had something different.Would we go back-without a doubt.Please have the idea in mind that this is a 3rd world country and they did a fabulous job!

<Content>Fantastic vacation!! I vacationed at the Punta Cana Grand from Feb. 5 - 12, 2006 and loved every minute of it! Our party consisted of 3 couples (6 people) and we all enjoyed our stay very much and would all return in a heartbeat! The food was very good (no one got sick --except for a small case of dehydration so please remember to drink lots of water!!) The best restaurant was the Italian place, the dinner menu at American Grill was excellent also (although we thought that portion sizes were a bit too small -- but just order seconds!) You can get pizza/fries/hamburgers/hotdogs at all hours of the night -- which is also pretty tasty -- we took full advantage of that. The beach is beautiful, but go early because it's difficult to get a hut/beach chairs by 11:00 am. The water has a little seaweed -- but it's the ocean so itsn't that to be expected? The pool is nice also -- the water aroebics is fun. The rooms are also nice -- always kept clean. The king size bed is very comfy. We found a few small ants in our sink one day but it's nothing a little water could not get rid of -- no biggie. The grounds are beautiful -- be sure to cross the bridge of love. The nightly entertainment is excellent too. The shows are fun to watch. Although so many things made this trip great, the one thig that stands out above all others is the staff. The staff are so friendly and really make you feel at home. They are very helpful and kind. Their level of service is amazing and they will do anything in their power to accomodate you. I have been to a few other places in the Carribean and I have never encountered staff that are as friendly as the staff at Punta Cana Grand. There are only 3 negative things that i will tell you about this resort. One is that sometimes you had to wait 10-20 minutes for beach towels -- this is not a huge deal but its enoying when you swim and dont have a towel to dry off on. Second is that i felt they could have more staff working at front desk -- especially at check-out hours. We were waiting quite long to check-out and this was enoying since we wanted to spend our last minutes on the beach. Lastly is that we had no idea that hospitality rooms must be booked ahead of time. We were never told this and therefore, did not have a room to freshen up in before our flight. Word of advice -- book your hospitality room right when you get there so that you dont have to shower at the pool like we did. Other than that stuff, great place, great vacataion and would definatley go back!!!

<Content>WOW You must go!!! This resort was just simply amazing! I stayed @ the Grand between Feb. 5th and 12th with 5 other friends (aged 26-34). We all enjoyed the food, activities, disco, but most especially the staff made our vacation incredible! Anything you need, these people will go out of their way to provide. So, please award them by tipping.A special thank you to: Gilberto and Beachpapi, Juan, Gloria, Kelvin 1 and 2, Vlaidimir, Angel, and employee of the month in my books: Alberto Mejia!I did extensive research on this resort before going, and must say that the negativities in some other reviews were simply unwarranted.I will definitely return...Luigi: You rock!

<Content>Good time We stayed at the Grand from January 22 - 29. Overall, we had a very relaxing week and enjoyed the resort. The rooms were clean and well stocked with drinks. There was some construction near building 5 which you could hear during the daytime. The food and service from the staff very good. Juan from the swim-up bar was excellent. The Waglers from New Hamburg, ON were the life of the party and made the week extra special for my wife and myself. Overall, a four star experience well worth the money we spent.

<Content>Overall great vacations 8 of us including 2 kids at 12 just got back from this hotel (2/6/06). We have been in Punta Cana 2 years ago but at different resort.Overall we did have a very great week of vacations: nice weather was in rendez-vous (few scattered showers in late night) and we will definitely recommend this hotel despite a bit windy locationGood things:Food is very good with large variety and theme nights, beef is so tender comparable to Angus AAA, besides Windows restaurant the main buffet, make sure to try The Italian and American Grill (beef medallions and shrimps camparis), build your own shakes with fresh tropical fruit at breakfast.Beach is spacious and clean, enough shades via coconut trees. Pools are clean and fed with constant fresh jets (lazy river is my favorite). Accomodations, stay away from building 5 due to mosquitoes. Try to ask for 3rd floor for high ceiling = spacious room but no elevator (good for exercise and digestion). For deluxe lovers, try building 7, the newest all suites with double jacuzzis (indoor and outdoor)and marble tiles in bathrooms but try to book through your travel agent or get the upgrade at purchase time online or expect to pay extra $US 90/night at destination. In-room safe is extra for all rooms $US 15/week.Excursions: beside the ones offered by tour operators, if you like to discover the local life style and do some city sightseeings, try to catch the public bus Sitrabapu to visit Higuey (45mns) with fare @ 60 pesos/person ($US 2.00). Points of interests: Basilica, Calle de La Libertad close to Bus station (moped taxi from Basilica @ 20 pesos/person) with variety of stores for local handcrafts (cut asking price to 50% and settle to max at 75%. Don't be shy to haggle back and forth, the locals get used to it and love to make you feel bad), at 500m behind the Basilica, you can shop at IBERIA, their local Wal-Mart style (Santo Domingo coffee and Brugal Anejo or Extra Anejo rums are good price).Merchants on the beach within the hotels resorts will ask you double for same items. Rule of thumb, always bargain to 1/2 asking price first or try to shop out of resorts facilities and at day light it is pretty safe.Staff members are so friendly: Guillermo, grilled fresh fish cook, Julio the bartender and juice shakes man, Steven and Victor the restaurants greeters, Angel the nautical club man, Paco the front desk clerk.Bad things:At reception, especially during the week, there is only 1 clerk at your service so don't be in a hurry and they always try to buy time and will ask you to come back a few hours later.Check-in is at 3PM, rooms are not always ready at your arrival (before 3PM). We had issues with our first given room (strong humidity smell, no hot water, tabs not working properly, bathrooms ceiling leaking and dripping, air conditioner malfunctioning. The next morning we had to wait and insist to talk to the hotel manager Milton, he was very courteous and with an almost full capacity, he managed to move us to another room in the afternoon.Tips: request in advance a courtesy room on your departure day (you have 1 hour to shower and get changed). Lock your luggage before leaving them at frontdesk on departure day, we read some previous reviews stating there were some reports on lost/stolen items or money. Luckily we did not have these bad experiences. To avoid the headaches, you may want to arrange a late check-out instead of 12PM(they ask $US 45/room but you can try to bargain at 11AM for $US 20 or 30).Hope this will help. Happy vacations!

<Content>Great time at the Grand We stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from January 29 - February 5, and had a fabulous time. Before heading there, I was a little worried based on some of the reviews I had read. Don't listen to the people who complain about trivial things! Remember, you are travelling to a third-world country, you shouldn't go there expecting all the comforts and amenities as home.We had no problems with the room (second floor, Building 3). It was clean and very spacious. We left little presents and tips for the maid every day and we always had the amenities we needed in our room, including lots of bottled water.The beach was great, the seaweed is not that big of a deal! Pool was great too. It was always busy, but never felt crowded. If you like it to be a little quieter, sit on the opposite side from the Actiities Hut. And reserving chairs with your towel is a fact of life. We just did it in the morning on the way to breakfast and always had chairs.The food was what you would expect at an all-inclusive in this price-range. The buffet had lots of variety, although things were a little bland. For lunch, go to the beach restaurant (the ham and cheese croissant is really good) and the a la carte restaurants for dinner.I will admit that this resort doesn't have the best nightlife, but that's true for all of Punta Cana because it is isolated. That said, my friend and I, both 25, managed to have fun at night. We would either take in the entertainment or sit at the main bar before heading to the disco. We met lots of fun people this way, which really made the trip a lot more fun.We also took two day trips, both of which I would highly recommend. We went to Saona Island, which is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in my life. We also went on the Outback Safari which is the best way to see the real Dominican and how the people really live.Overall, this was a great trip. Punta Cana is gorgeous and it's growing extremely fast. Don't be put off by all the construction going on -- they're just trying to make it better for us! By far, this hotel (and Punta Cana in general) has the friendliest, most helpful staff. They always have a smile and an Hola for you, and if you're friendly in return, you're guaranteed good service. I found I tipped less here than I have in Cuba and other parts of the Dominican.If you're looking for a safe, clean and enjoyable hotel to relax and soak up the sun, go to the Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>Great Place To Go The Grand is a great place to go. This was my fifth time to Punta Cana, Grand being my 4th different place.(and I have been to Cuba). The Grand was fantastic. They are expanding, did not hear any construction noise, was in building 3 on the third floor facing the pool. They do everything in their power to make your vaction the best ever. The rooms are clean, no bugs, but one Gecco :), They now have a building 7 that has jacuzzi's in the rooms and they are more like suites. I was happy with my room. The food is very good. The main buffet had lots of selections to choose from, if you are going to the Italian get a group, even people you dont know. If you have 6 or more you usually get seated right away instead of the 30-60 minute wait. The American Grill over the beach resturant is good, the ribs are fatty, but the chicken is great. Daniel is up there, great guy. The best bartender in the resort is CASTRO, and the best entertainment is FERNANDO, he runs the activities, he was so great we gave him our portable DVD player when we left. The burgers are great that they cook on the beach, but they tend to under cook them but just ask and they will keep it on until you are ready. They all work so hard so please, just be really nice to them, and they will give you the world, unlike what other people say that they only work hard for tips, this is not true, we tip after we get to know them. If you are tipping, dont forget the lawn and beach maintainance people, they make the least amount of money and are always forgotten. Trips: The Dolphin Island is $85 american. Cheaper than other places, but still a lot of money. We were told that we would snorkel after, but did not. They take you by bus, 15 minutes, boat ride, 2 minutes to the pen that they are in. They have the dolphins kiss you then shake your hand. They sell the pics for $8 each. Have them record your time on disk, you can buy it for $45 after. I would have paid but did not pre-request it. When they put you in the middle of the pen with the dolphins dont stand back and watch, pet them, they keep moving so you need to also. DONT touch their heads for fins! Rub their belly softly, they will roll over and sing for you. We thought when we got there we were ripped off (even our boys 13 and 16), but after we left we had a perma grin for hours. There is a snorkling trip offered for $18 and it is worth it because there is no snorkling off the resort beach. This is the only thing that disappointed us because we like to do this everyday after breakfast so we misssed this alot.The only complaint is that water is not available when you want. They can actually get in trouble giving you bottled water, you get 2 bottles a day in your room and they will give it to you by the glass only. I like my bottled water, espically after a LOOOONNNNNGGGGG night. Go to the beach bar and have CASTRO make you the OLIVES, they are SOOOOOOOOOOOO good. Have a great time and your holiday is what you make it.Canada

<Content>Fun! I stayed at Punta Cana Grand the last week of January 2006. Although the hotel is small and still under construction, I had a fantastic time. The Good:- food was excellent- staff was friendly- beach was beautiful- room was clean - club was funThe Bad:- gym was under renovation- air conditioner broke- constructionWe had a room in the 4th building so we were far from the construction. Those is building 5 had no hot water and had the sounds of construction.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Alright but I probably wouldn't go back We stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from January 28 to February 4th. When we first arrived checking in was a little slow, but nonetheless we got our room. Immediately I was not happy, we were on the first floor in building two, the sliding doors did not have locks on them (remember we are on the first floor here), there was a gecko on the floor, the bathroom had water on the floor and the handle to flush the toilet was hanging off the toilet. I called front desk and they sent maintenance. He was able to fix the sliding door and installed a new lock for the door. I did not want to stay in this room for all the other problems and requested to move. Milton at the front desk moved us the next morning to the third floor, much better. The rooms on the third floor are much nicer and have higer ceilings so they feel more spacious. After getting our new room I was happier. The food was good, buffet had several options, the a la carte restaurants were better. If you are going to the Italian restaurant go early or expect to wait a while, the food is good. I preferred the Tex-Mex a la carte restaurant, it was much more relaxed. If you go to the tex-mex Osvaldo is the best server there, a lot of fun and great service. The beach was fine, water a little cloudy but there is a lot of seaweed which gets annoying, it was also very breezy so we tended to stay at the pool more. There is an adult pool and if you want to relax and read a book that is where you should go. The main pool is filled with daily entertainment, but it also tends to get loud and crowded. In general the resort was fine, nothing to write home about. They are renovating, and adding a casino so I imagine it will be much nicer in time. If you are staying there ask to stay in building 7, it is the newest building and much nicer than the rest. My main complaint was that there is no night life, if you want to watch the shows, which are pretty uneventful that will keep you busy for an hour or so, but other than that nothing else is really going on. Probably a nicer place for families as it is casual and nothing fancy. Like I said in the title, alright, but I probably wont go back.

<Content>Not a 5 star or a 4 star On Arrival:- You were greeted by a cocktail - nice - but they ran out of rum.- I asked our agent for second floor away from the construction, and was put on the first floor next to the construction. It is noisy and totally wrong for a guest to be placed there. They did move us to a room with an ocean front view (Thank you) after we phoned our agent and talked to the front desk about 3 times.- The bell boys were very nice and expediant.Food and Drink:- There is no substantial food to eat between 4:00pm and 6:30pm other than room service. Other resorts I have visted, usually have snacks, fruit bars to visit and eat through out the day. Punta Cana Grand (PCG) had some stale looking Pizza by the bar. This is not a 5 star feature.- The dinner buffet is ok, there is a lot to choose from, but some hot food items were cold when the should be hot. The breakfast buffet had standard stuff - not bad, and lunch was the same as dinner.- The Tex Mex Place - the portions were small, the meat was cold, the service was very slow.- The italian place was very nice - good food, good service- The grill on the beach served hamburgers and hot dogs - the hamburger I ate was still red.- The beach front cafe - the pizza I ate was stale (sitting out for a long time), and the salad I ate was small and wilted.- Beverages - good selection- room service - expect to wait 1 hour for basic food (burgers, salad) - not good.- Overall - the food was well below par for a 5 star or even a 4 star.Rooms:- As noted we were in 2 different rooms. For the first 2 nights we were by the construction, on the first floor. The construction starts at 7:00am. the TV in this room, was 13 and had no remote. This is not even 2 star as far as I am concerned.- the second room had a 27 TV (Much better) and was on the ocean - a very nice room.- Both rooms were spartan in terms of amenities, they had hair dryers, and ironing boards, but they did not offer a lot of hand towels, they offered one bar of soap. The tiles had some black mold in the seems, and the joints to the doors had rust - this makes the place look run down - again 3 star.- the worst thing was the water pressure - often no hot water, or low pressure. Again - I have been to resorts all over the world, and have not had this problem day in and day out.Activities:- the beach - was fantastic - water was warm, and sand was great. Seaweed was a daily issue - but never a big one in terms of my enjoyment.- the pool - the water was a bit cool - but a very nice looking pool.- the hot tub - well it was under repairs.- water sports, they had boats and the usual fare.- tennis - very good - clay courts - good pros.- shows/movies - very good variety.Service:- The people were very nice - no complaints. The people of the Dominican - are some of the nicest people in the world.- I had a lot of $1 bills - it does make a difference in the service level.- I asked for extended check out - and we were able to get it till 6:00pm - they charged $30 USD.Overall:- this is not a 5 star or a 4 star resort, this is a 3.5 star resort. There were to many basic things that were not working to make the grade to even a 4 star resort.I would not go back for the 5 star prices I paid, if you paid 3 star prices - it would be worth it.

<Content>The resort was way above our expectations ! We went to the Grand on Jan 22 and returned on jan 29. Having done a ton of reserach in advance you are always a bit skeptical about how accurate everyones comments are. This resort which is rated by most tour companies as a 4 or 41/2, was exactly that. From the moment we arrived we were overwhelmed by the experience. Naturally there will always be small things here and there that may not meet your expecations, but overall they were almost non existent at the Grand. I have reviewed each section below.Check-inNo problems. Arrived mid-day, they had 3 or 4 behind the desk and we were the only bus at the resort. Check in less than 10 minutes.ARoomsStayed in building 2. Away from construction zones, centrally located with balcony on 2nd floor.Hight reccomend paying $ 15 for the room safe. It gives you added peace of mind in respects to your money and travel docs.Room was clean, standard. 2 Queen beds. The a/c worked excellent. All other ammenities would find at home where present. Stocked mini bar - you may have to keep on the maid service about keeping beer in it. Also bottled water doesnt get passed out a freely as it does here. And my travelling partner who is a diabetic, had a devil ofa time getting diet coke or coke lite. We tipped the maid at the end of the trip personally, and whenever they did a little extra ( leave beer as we asked ) we flipped them a single.AGroundsAbsolutely beautiful. Around the clock working non stop. The staff that work on this are the unsung heroes as each day when you wake up, everything is clean, tidy and ready to go. Great place to take pics, clean. The great thing about Grand is the size of the resort. It is not overly big so you can access everything with ease from your room and never have far to go. But you never find it crowded. You definitely have a chance to run into people you have met all week. Please alos dont be put off by the entrance on arrival as the casino is under construction and our bus had to back into the resort. Once you went into the lobby,any fears were gone. A+WeatherWhat ever you think about the forecasts calling for showers each day, ignire it. We had a shower on arrival day briefly, and on the Monday AM, but that was it for the whole week. The sun was out by mid morning, some days a bit of cloud cover, always a breeze. Likely around 88 each day - would be well over 90 with no breeze, evenings nice - 70-75 or so. What was funny is they post the forecast at the resort each day - always chance of showers 30% rain - it was hilarious, Dont worry about it all - it'll be perfect..A+PoolNo problems here at all. Plenty big enough to accomodate all guests. It kind of wraps around the middle of the resort and leads up to the swim up bar. As usual, pool chairs are at a premium, so if you want a prime spot, get don there early. I noticed on the sheet in our room about all services that chairs can only be reserved for a max 3 hrs - however this is un-enforeable. So dont stress out and get an early start each day and youll be fine. Temp is a bit chilly, but once the sun is out by mid-day, its comfortable. Take a look at the lazy floating pool behind bldg 2, no one uses it and its a bit missed by everyone.ABeachThe beach provided alot of shade and sufficent space to lay your chair without crowding. I must say things got a bit windy. Apparently a bit more than usual. The beach was clean, the resort beside us (allegro punta cana ) was always filthy. Again seaweed wont kill us people. The put the big iceburg back in the water by Thurs or so and i gave it a go. Lets just say its not as easy as it looks and hen u do get up, thats a long way up. But enjoy. The thing about the beach is that if you turn left and walk 15 minutes or so you will find a bout a 2mile stretch of uninhabited beach - no resorts, a few vendors, but awesome clean, turquoise waters. Absolutely a post card setting. If youre also bold enough you can walk an hr further to the bavaro stretch of resorts and check out that beach. Worth the walk...Grand Beach B+Uninhabited beach A+FoodNo complaints here at all. Great variety at buffet. Food always hot. Quick service. It amazes me at how many bad reviews this place got about food. But some people will complain about anything and do forget that thisis the DR, not Manhattan. Never had any stomach battles all week. The tex Mex a la carte was freat - never made it to the Italian- here service was a bit slow. The beauty thing at this resort is that no reservations are required. The beach restaurant was great- good north american selection, fast service except 1 day. The do a buffet on the beach each day ie - seafood paella - but the crowning meal is the weekly Thurs beach party - unbelievable, all food you can imagine, all decorated up with live music. They go to a ton of work and effort to pull this off and the resort and staff deserve high marks as this is a once in a lifetime type of nite. Enjoy !Also snacks during the day are a bit meagre - beach restaurant is open, but mainly youll find pizza and sandwiches at the main bar. Another a la carte restaurant would add much more variety also. Keep in mind that the resort has 24 hr room service, included with package.Overall- food service, quality, and presentation. Excellent.AEntertainemntAgain, Punta Cana doesnt rock at nite. But mind you after a day in the sun drinking and eating, most of us dont have much left to give. There is an adequate number of bars, there is a sports bar/disco ( not bad ). A piano/Cigar bar - apparently Karoke some nites. They have a 730 movie for the kids at stage, and 930 live show for all else. The team does a pretty good job at entertaining you.Otherwise we found after a good dinner, a walk, and a drink, that it was time to turn it in and prep for the next day.BTW - be sure to visit the adult pool tucked away at front of resort, small, with great bar service - Domingo - here is the only place you get cahir drink service. He was a awesome..BExcursionsDid 1 full day jeep excursion. Was a blast. Its a long day and we pretty much caned out the cooler, but our guide Santos was very gracious. We saw a lot of the countryside, had a great lunch, rode horseback, swam at a great beach. Note - if you thought you've seen a pothole at home- yur're in for a treat- ashphalt and road maint apparently isnt an issue here. Giant crater on most of teh roads on our safari trip. No complaints, but its hilarious.Did the 1/2 day Marinarium - great thing about this is that it departs next door to the resort. Its a 1/2 day/. Was great - snorkelled with sjharks, mata rays, had a nice cruise uo the coast, few drinks, got out for a drink in a shallow pool. Highly recomend it. Its nice and relaxing and only a 1/2 day.ASunwingKudos to Lynn who met us at the airport, very friendly, and to Franklin - who was our rep at hotel. Only think i didnt like was that if Sunwing is going to include bonus features in brochure - do it - as guests we shouldnt have to cahse and follow uo for what we we supposed to get. Never got our welcome drink, turn down service, beach towel in room, welcome letter - i didnt need this anyway - but it look bad on sunwing for not delivering. We did get our botlle of rum on day 5 or so but only after a bit of hunding to get it.Anyways, in anut shell. Read all the reviews you want, at teh end of the day its up to you to decide if the resort me your expectations. I think Punta Cana grand does, and if you stack it up against other resorts for the amount you pay - its well worth it.Enjoy your trip..

<Content>Punta Cana....GRAND?????? We are a family of 4 with 2 children, this review will be aimed at young families. This resort was clean. A lot of the food tasted different than Canadian or American food. Milk is pretty thick and not like at home, not bad just not like ours. No one got sick in anyway. The pop is good and the juice fresh squeezed and very yummy. The sun is VERY VERY strong so grease up young ones with block. The beach is really nice and not too hot under a palm. The water was a little cloudy but you could still see bottom. Parents, there is a weak undertow, nothing that would bother an adult but may cause a problem for a young child. Keep them close and wear a floaty. There were a few european women who went topless (not that I am complaining). They covered up when they walked around. My kids didn't even notice. ONE BIG NOTE TO PARENTS...there are no laws to prohibit smoking anywhere. Several times we were seated having dinner and everyone was around us with cancer sticks lit and fuming. Very unpleasant. Very ignorant. Windows is a great place to eat smoke free. DADS...everything depends on tips, if you don't tip, don't expect to get service. It gets a little annoying after a few days. Keep a lot of U.S ones in your pockets and your wallet in the safe. Keep your eye on the house keeping staff. Little things tend to grow legs. I understand they are poor and really need what we take for granted but be aware of what you leave out. If you don't leave a tip everyday for the house keeping staff don't expect much. They are however very friendly. If you want extra pop or water just ask them and give them a few dollars. They will keep you topped up. Same goes anywhere, tips = service. Simple. MOMS...we met some friends at the resort. 2 females in their mid to late 20's. They told us that some feminine hygiene products went missing and some razors were used. Maybe leave out some razors and women stuff as a tip, they need it. Front desk personnel were not the most helpful but still not bad by any means. DO NOT stay in the buildings closest to the entertainment area. VERY VERY loud for kids. We were moved to building 4 and it was quiet. Construction noise is really not an issue. If any people with young families are going here you will have fun and it is safe. Security everywhere. Please email me with questions. rhilljmac2@mountaincable.net

<Content>Lovely vacation! We stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from January 23-30, 2006. We were a group of 2 couples and some girlfriends all in 20s.We had read a lot of the reviews beforehand so we felt fairly prepared as far as what to expect on the bad side.We were served 2 drinks while waiting in line to check in- and the line was substantial. Patience is a virtue anywhere in Latin America and it is no different in the DR, no matter what star resort you are dealing with.Speaking spanish is also enormously helpful and since I speak Spanish fluently, my experiences may be a little bit different than those who do not speak any at all. While it wasn't a huge advantage, I did receive some preferential treatment from time to time. You will get the same if you are pretty blonde though too!We requested a room on the third floor and it is true- they are quite nice. We stayed in building 5. Unfortunately the construction continues on both sides of the resort- building 1 and building 5 and 4 on the sides closest to the lobby are affected the worst. I only heard faint bits of the construction starting around 9 am. And they definitely continued untill 11 pm or later. We noticed it little because we spend the vast majority of our day outside of our room. I was very happy with the cleanliness of the rooms and didn't see any bugs or cockroaches which was great for me (though most people wouldn't expect that). The maids generally came around as we were leaving in the morning (between 9-10) so if we needed something like extra water or towels, they were happy to accommodate after we asked them personally. There was three of us in the room and we tipped $5 US every other day and had a pristine room. One day, the maid even carefully lined up all of our shoes for us! The disco is kind of loud so expect to hear it from most places at the resort.The beach was great. Don't quite understand about the seaweed complaints. Depending on the weather, there is some but staff is cleaning it up all day long. Check out the resorts next door where there is ZERO seaweed clean up and it is quite horrendous! If you want a quieter, even more pristine area to swim, just walk left down the beach past 2 resorts and the vendors to the point. You can go out further into the water and the water is GORGEOUS!We rented kayaks one day and had a great time. There was never a shortage of water craft- no need to book in advance (we weren't allowed anyway).Beach chairs were often a challenge! I blame this more on silly stupid resort-goers than the resort itself. At any time, there is at least 50% of the chairs unoccupied but saved by people's towels. I am not talking about people who went for a dip in the sea/pool but people who are gone ALL DAY and save these chairs for whatever fleeting moment they feel like returning. This is really agitating! Don't do it. In any case, we often had to hike to other parts of the resort (adult pool etc) and drag our chairs down to the beach. Some people were not as kind and simply removed towels from these chairs and went on their way with the chairs! The main pool was nice- never too crowded and the water (pool and sea) was very refreshing, not tooo warm at all. Adult pool was mellow and a nice lagoon like pool next to building 2.I brought 20-$1 bills for tipping and that was more than enough. We were a group of 7 so we took turns going to the bar and fetching drinks and left a dollar or so each time and that helped. Beach Papi is GREAT! Since bottled water was hard to come by, we often greased a bar tender at night to get a giant bottle for the next day. Greasing goes a LONG way at this resort.Food: I found the quality was good but there are some tips. There is nowhere to eat between 10-12:30 in the morning and between 5-6:30 pm. Room service was not very good during the day and evening hours and so-so late at night. We tried to get it one day and were hung up on several times. Our friends ordered one night and they never came... Snacks are NOT 24 hours though during the day you can usually come by pizza at the bar and there is hamburger/hot dog/fries area near the beach.You cannot reserve at the a la carte but that would be helpful. IF you plan on eating after 7:30-8pm, you will wait an HOUR to get a seat in one of the restaurants. We didn't always understand the wait as there were always empty tables but oh well. Be nice to Carlos at Da Marios! So eat early or grab a bit beforehand so you can enjoy your a la carte. The portions at the American Grill were quite small (not really any vegetarian options) and the service at both restos was quite atrocious (as in slow, inconsistent, people running around not quite sure what to do). Da Mario's food was a lot better but again the vegetarian options were limited. The buffet varied. Breakfast was usually pretty good. Lunch at the garden restaurant is good and the service generally excellent and quick.Entertainment: Some of the night time shows were actually quite good! We really liked the Michael Jackson show and the Tropicana dance show was also quite good. Karaoke at the piano (actually a Keyboard) bar on a regular basis which can be fun but can also be really annoying depending on the crowd. You can get quality alcohol at this bar. The disco is open until 2 am and it appeared that they had one single arrangement of the same songs at the same time every night! We enjoyed ourselves when there were a lot of people around. We went to Mangu at another resort which is about 20 minutes away. The taxi price goes from $18-30 US each way depending on how many people are in (takes a max of 10 people). It costs $5/couple to get into the club and it includes one free drink. Thereafter drinks are about $4-5 each (ie. pre-drink at the resort). The place has 2 levels- one with more traditional latin music and upstairs is more euro-style (house, techno etc.). Fun animators and a good mixed crowd of locals and tourists. I went on a Thursday and it was enough people but not too crowded. A lot more crowded on weekends and a gross foam party upstairs with unhygienic water all over the place. Open until 6 am. Worth it if you are a group and are younger.Excursions: We went to Isla Saona and enjoyed it once we got on the water. We had to stand around at the beach waiting for a speed boat for a long time and it seemed really unorganized. We went with Hotel Beds through the hotel. You can get it about $10 cheaper a person if you book with another agency but do it in advance of arriving in the DR (can be done over internet) because making calls is expensive ($2 to make each collect call and like $3 a minute or more to call). I didn't find the motor boat to be rough at all and the Island was nice but not that much more extraordinary than the water 1 mile down the beach from the Sunscape. The natural swimming pool was cool but SO many people were touching the star fish and taking them out of the water. No one warned or asked people not to do that so I was being a ball breaker and going around telling people how bad it is to touch wildlife as if it weren't obvious how damaging that can be (not that the gas from the boats etc. is better but still, lets TRY to preserve the ecosystem as much as possible). The buffet on the island was okay and endless drinks simply means as much rum and beer as you can get. I really liked the catamaran. It was animated by a very nice, high-energy, young group of dominicans who kept our drinks topped up and danced merengue with us.I would definitely advise AGAINST doing the horseback riding, at least from the agency that sells tours from the resort (by the pool). They told us we would get 2 and a half hours of horseback riding alongside virgin beaches and time to swim etc. We got way less than 2 hours and the beaches were fairly unkempt and undesireable and the scenery not so great. We went through a damaged, half built hotel. Not so great. The one good thing was that my girlfriend and I went on the 10am ride and it was just us. I know how to ride and she trains race horses so we were allowed to go at our own pace (better than being stuck in a group of non-riders). My girlfriend was unimpressed with the health of the horses though she said they still had some energy and said the bits used for the horses were very cruel and unnecessary. The riding is not included at the hotel- it is simply a lesson which is a 10 minute loop around some bush area. Perhaps there is a better agency but this one was not good.Cigars: don't buy them at the hotel shop. You can bargain with them but you can get them at very reasonable, less expensive prices at the duty free shop at the Punta Cana airport! I was also very surprised how few Americans were at this resort. We are Canadians and I would say the 2 biggest nationalities at this resort are Canadian and Spanish (from Spain). After that, there is a sprinkling of Germans and Italians. A lot of older groups, younger couples and some younger groups of people. OVerall a nice mix of people.Overall we really enjoyed our time at the resort and in the DR. It is not a Cancun so don't expect it but I enjoyed the fact that we could have a mellow time and also go out to a club outside the resort if we wanted (at way cheaper than you would pay in Cancun). The beach was great, weather was great and the resort was very nice. Service can be so so but it is a different country and different culture and you have to understand that. If you want Americanized service then Florida or Hawaii are probably better options.

<Content>Great LOW BUDGET Resort I must justify my review (and title) by saying that my wife  I have travelled extensively and usually stay at 5 star Riu resorts or Palaces.If this is the standard YOU are used to, this resort will disappoint you in many ways.This resort just changed hands from Sunscape to Globalia and you can tell Sunscape let it run down until they finally sold it off.In General, the grounds are clean and maintained. The building are showing their age, but you can see the attempts being made to do repairs.In one corner of the resort the Casino is STILL being built, and on the other side of the resort another building for more rooms is being finished. You will NOT escape the sound of saws or hammering, but you can keep it to a minimum with the right rooms.Courtyard rooms are best if you don't want the noise from the 24 hour restaurant  bar during the night, and closer to the beach keeps you away from the construction. As mentioned by another reviewer the 3rd floor has very high ceilings and makes the room look larger. Thank to that review, our request made the holiday tolerable.Food was take a chance. In the Italian restaurant we found quality and service acceptable on the Tuesday, however on the Friday the service was hurried. Seafood soup was the vegetable soup with a couple shrimp thrown in. My lucky wife even had a centipede swim to the surface and bob around before swimming to the edge to climb onto the bowl rim and check out the room. The waiter called the manager who calmly took the soup away with out saying a word and disappeared. Guess its normal for them, but I prefer my soup to stay in the bowl. The angel hair pasta was normal spaghetti and the Ceasar Salad was made with greenberg lettuce even though the menu stated romaine.All is not lost though. Windows (the main buffet) offers a reasonable selection and there is something for everyones taste. Do not expect 5 star quality. Expect the same quality you would get at a company barbeque at a local park.Chairs were plentiful. Some people are saving chairs by leaving their towels and going off to eat or sleep. I usually gave 30 minutes grace, if they didn't return the chair was available. But staff would bring out more chairs if asked.Bar service was good. The people make the difference.They make em weak, they make em strong, they make em however you want, just ask.My complaint would be the absence of the International brand drinks as advertised. I could find no Canadian or American brands at any of the bars (and I asked). Maybe the International Brands are from Spain.English is the THIRD language here. The Entertainment manager is Spanish as is the General Manager and the country is primarily Spanish. Most announcemnets are in Spanish first and if they remember, English. Most of the maids, maintenance, waiters, and some of the bartenders do NOT speak english. I can see why Americans do not come here.One final item about food. It is billed as 24 hour, yet between 10  11 pm and 10:30  11 am none of the eateries are open.Pools are great, as is beach and most of the activities crew will keep you entertained.If you want a LOW BUDGET resort with all the trimmings this will be great for you. If you are used to 5 star resorts, you will be disappointed. The country cannot be used as an excuse, since we have stayed down the beach at the Riu as well.

<Content>great time...sorry to leave!! we stayed at the Punta Cana Grand from jan 13-20 and had a fabulous time. anyone who has a neagative review is either too picky, or too opinionated. this was a great place and i would not hesitate to go back. The food was pretty good, not all things were great but there was enough variety for even the picky eaters. The italian restaurant was great, we had dinner there 3 nights, and the beach party was amazing. the entertainment staff (men in black) were very good at getting everyone involved in activities (especially Fernando....two thumbs up for him).The nightly shows were very well put together and entertaining. The Disco rocked until 2am every night and it was busy every night we were there. the piano bar was a fun place to hang out after the stage show for Karaoke and singing. Jairo the bartender was great, it was a pleasure to chat with him almost every night.Tipping - although i believe tipping was important, i found we received better service from the staff we actually got to know and showed an interest in there lives rather than treat them as our servants. Thumbs up to Pena, Jairo, Joran, Domingo and Fernando. we liked the fact this was a smaller resort and met lots of nice people who felt the same way we did about the place. Please do not hesitate to book this place, and if you do......bring Eyore an apple (during the day he hangs out by the new casino tied to a tree. he would appreciate it)

<Content>Very nice but under construction, great food! We Stayed at the Punta Cana Grand Jan 19th to 26th 2006, which is still building a casino... yes the resort is under construction... i.e. no water for one day and no hot water for two days...and is now operated by Global Hotels. If you are going here, do not stay close to the constructionsite near buildings #1 and 2. I was in building 4 and this is the place to be close to everything!!!!! Steps from the beach, pool, bar, food... shall i go on. This is an older resort and could stand with a few minor repairs but the place is kept very clean and this place has the BEST food that I have ever had at an all inclusive. I would go back... when the construction is done in about 2-3 months time.This is a place that you can really be alone or with the party. 4.0 stars from me Feel free to Email me should you have any questions! PS Get to the Thursday nite beach party...its worth it!!!

<Content>It was wonderful From begining to end this was a great trip. I was not dissapointed in any way. I was very worried after reading the reviews, but after the first day I feared no more.My plane was delayed a little bit, but after that it was smooth sailing. From the food and the drinks to the beautiful weather. The staff is the best there is. It was a perfect size and we never had to wait for anything. The shows were great and the beach beautiful. All those who complained about this resort should be ashamed. This was one of the best resorts I have been to in a while. I will be back!

<Content>good vacation jan 16/06 took family of 5 to punta cana grand.flew out of kitchener-was great. rooms were good, food was very good, beach was well taken care of, staff were very good, took great day trip on outback safari was pricey but really great time, resort evening entertainment was impressive, dinner beach bar b q was great.great lots for kids 8 and up to do and lots of others to play with. negatives were some construction and securing a beach towel and chair- you have to save your towel and get up early to save good spot. we got this at a great sell off price so were happy with the value, although i think its rated a little too high at 4 1/2 star, i may be upset if i had paid the broshure price.we have been to D.R. 3 times now, no major complaints tho...

<Content>4 star but barely Just came back,nice resort with excellent service ,but there is a couple of points to consider.We found it noisy at night,even when we moved.Our first room was shabby,second much better but they not happy to move you.Cleaning stuff very noisy in the mornings,lots of yelling and calls,noisy carts.I mean like 7.30 am.Beach plesant ,but boats have priority over swimmers.They plucked me out of the water 2 for my safety(so i dont get a free shot at the reef).Last but not the least-there are mosquitos-in the rooms,at the pool,on the beach.Be sure to spray yourself.I never saw hotel grounds sprayed.Nothing to see outside of the resort.For the good points-exellent service in bars and restaurants.Nice ,well taken care of grounds.Lot of lounge chairs and beach very nice if you dont care to swim.Not as good as Sunscape in La Romana

<Content>Very Nice Resort You will not be disappointed with this resort.The grounds are very nice. Although the resort was full it was not crowded. No lineups for any of the restaurants including the a la cartes. Food was good. Service was good. Try and get a room on the 3rd floor of the buildings. They are the best (nice high ceilings). Only the pool bar and the piano room had the premium drinks.I would rate this as a 4 star. Although I am listing some bad points for your information the good far outweighed the bad.A Couple of Bad PointsI would not say that the beach was the best. 4 out of the 7 days there was seaweed coming on shore. If they did not get it all cleaned up in the morning you could smell it in the heat.Get a safe. 3 rooms which did not opt for the safe had their money stolen.We were to depart the hotel at 6:30pm and for some reason we could not find a place to get food from 5-6:30pm. Not sure why as it is supposed to have 24 hr snacks.It was the only day I was not impressed with the service from a couple of the restaurant staff. We had to eat at the airport.Some constuction going on beside buildings 1 and 2.You could hear power saws until after midnight.

<Content>Fantastic Family Vacation All in all this was the perfect all inclusive resort for our family. The staff was absolutely wonderful to our daughters (aged 21 months and 4 years). Our thoughts on each of the restaurants:1. The buffet was nice and quick - The omelette bar for breakfast, and the grilled steak tasted great for dinner. You could also get creative with the grilled seafood/pasta bar2. The italian restaurant had fantastic service and a great atmosphere. Food was not exceptional as far as Italian foods go, but was good.3. The Tex Mex Restaurant was nice. The beef medallions were great, and the music was entertaining.4. The beach restaurant offered a different food each day. Each was done well. We ate lunce there 4 of the 6 days we were there.5. The beach a la carte restaurant was nice and had things like burgers/hotdogs and pizza. It was open a little later than the beach pavillion.6. The beach party was out of this world. The best of everything with a lot of very nice touches. There was a cauldren of stew over a bed of coals - a cigar rolling man selling cigars - pasta buffet, a side of beef, seafood, and more. Since we were great to all the staff all week, they gave us the best seats in the house to see the show also.There were family movies each night at 7:30 that were appropriote for kids, with a show at 9:30. The shows were entertaining and again, perfect for families.We had originally planned a 4 night trip, and the hotel was very accomodating (and reasonably priced) in extending our trip/helping change our return flight. We originally had a Friday AM flight, and changed it to a Saturday PM flight to get two full days for about $300 US. The hotel manager also was helpful in sending to us via Fex Ex a picture fame our daughter had painted by the pool.Tipping the staff a few bucks went a very long way - we never had an empty drink, always got the best seats in the a la carte restaurants, always had a clean room with a well stocked mini bar and plenty of towels. We received first class service every minute of every day. Our kids were absolutely spoiled as well, and treated like princesses. A lot of Europeans dont seem to understand the benefits of tipping and I heard several complaining about slow service, ect. Bring a pocketful of $1's - I think i tipped out about $100 total, and it was well worth it.I did bring larger, insulated cups to drink from that were about 3X the size of those provided by the resort - drinks stayed cool longer and didnt have to make nearly so many trips to the bar. If you like cigars - do NOT buy any from the beach venders - they are pathetic fakes. Buy from the Tobaco Shop by the lobby. I especially liked the freshly rolled cigars they sell for about $4 US. I would watch him roll my cigar before I smoked it.The snorkel trip was nothing special if you've snorkled elsewhere. Maybe St. John USVI and the BVI's have spoiled me, but I wasnt over impressed with this trip. We did have a great time on the horseback riding trip. Jose looked a little 'rough around the edges', but was a great guide. He took pictures of us as we went along, and cracked open coconuts for us to eat/drink. I wanted to take the safari trip, but we ran out of time. I heard that was loads of fun.The unspoiled beach about 1 mile walk north was a great place to watch the sun rise if you like that sort of thing. In summary, it is a great family resort, and we can't wait to return. I did not get to the Disco or cigar/piano bar, so cant say anything about them. We will not hesitate to come back to the same resort on our next trip to Punta Cana. We've been on at least a dozen Carribean vacations, and this one ranks very near the top of our list.

<Content>Good time...(New Years Eve to Jan. 6th) New Years Eve:My wife and I just returned from the Sunscape. We arrived on New Years Eve, which was pretty cool. The main dining area (Windows) was decorated according to the holiday and had special food spread including lobster, filet mignon, etc. At midnight, champagne was served and they had a fireworks display. We were both impressed.(Below are some things from the rest of the week)Staff:As mentioned before on this board, they were all very nice and courteous. Most spoke English very well and if they didn鈥檛 they still tried their best to help you. Grade: B+Room:I've seen some pretty negative reviews regarding the rooms and I'm a bit perplexed by it. The room was nice enough and very clean. The bed was large (king size), but a little stiff. Satellite TV (in English and a few other languages) and mini-bar was supplied w/ a few cervezas and soda. Grade: B+ Construction:We were aware of the construction before arriving but they just so happened to put us in the room closest to the construction (5301)...and our balcony faced the renovations. To be honest, it was pretty loud and they started working around 8:30am. If you are a late sleeper or were hungover, you'd be hating life. We were able to get out of the room for most of the day so it didn't impact us too bad, but I could see how it could. Grade: C-Food:Obviously, the food on New Years was great. However, we weren't overly impressed with it the rest of the week. The Italian restaurant was below average. I actually liked making my own pasta dish at the buffet better than eating the chef Boyardee version at the Italian place. The American Grill was very good, unfortunately, we only ate there once. It was opened sporadically...prob due to the hotel running at less than maximum capacity following the holiday. My wife enjoyed the make your own burrito bar at the beach and the fresh ceviche in the buffet. Grade: C+Drinks:One review said the drinks were watered down. Not true at all. If you watch the bartender, at least one shot of alcohol was in each of our drinks. My main complaint was they didn't make the drinks very well. Mojito's were hit and miss (along w/ the other tropical drinks) so I mostly stuck to vodka/tonic, rum/coke, and beer. My wife enjoyed the Chi Chi Kakapuca- a coconut/orange juice/rum drink, but again- it was always made differently by each bartender. Grade: CPools:We really enjoyed the adult pool. My wife and I do not have children so we ventured to the adult pool (18+ yrs of age only) to relax. For the most part, it was excellent and Domingo (the bartender) was very friendly. The only negative was that on our last full day there, the pool had a really fishy, sewer-like smell. We ended up going to the main pool and enjoyed ourselves. Overall, very nice. Grade: A-Beach:The beach was okay, but we were a little put off by the seaweed on the beach and in the water. We knew it was coming (from many posted reviews here), but still preferred not to deal with it. But, the sand was nice and the water was pretty clear so that was cool. Grade: C**Beach sidenote: One guest was complaining to an attendant about the seaweed. The attendant told him the Caribbean side of DR didn't have as much.Beach Activities:The free rental equipment is pretty neat...just make sure you reserve the boat, windsail, etc. at least one day before you want to go. Also, verify the reservations the next morning. If possible, make the reservation for the morning/early afternoon hours. It seemed that the water got much more crowded in the afternoon (speedboats racing by you), which did make me a little nervous on the paddle boat. We also did the two hour snorkel excursion. Basically, there is an area marked about a mile out where they drop you off. It was a little crowded, but many a fish to see! Just make sure you bring a slice of bread from Windows to feed the fish. Also- you probably won鈥檛 see the nurse sharks and manta rays they tell you you could see, so be prepared for that. My wife was a little disappointed there. You'll be swarmed by the fish though! Pretty neat. Grade: BNight Life:The shows are pretty lame, but they do their best. Don't expect Vegas style entertainment (though they all are said to be from there). We went to the Piano Bar one night and Dave was excellent. Very adult humor in some of his songs so if that type of thing offends you, you may want to pass when he is playing. The best night was our last night there when they had dinner and a movie (Batman Begins) out on the beach. That was excellent.Grade: B-Spa:My wife went to the spa for a massage on our last full day there and really enjoyed it. The prices were 鈥渧ery reasonable鈥?according to her- $75 includes a $10 tip for a 65 minute lymphatic massage. She said the massage technician seemed to be an expert at what she was doing. The only annoying part was that there was also construction going on near the spa, so when she was in the room she still heard lots of hammering and things like that- not very relaxing. Otherwise though, she said it was great. Grade: B+Overall:For the most part, we relaxed by the pool, read and had a few drinks. I'd go back again, probably for less time, though not sure my wife would. She was a bit bored, but she has more of an active personality. Just remember, this is a 3rd world country so don't expect it to be like the US. If that's what you want, go to Key West or something like that. Grade: B-*feel free to email me if you have any questions*

<Content>Good time but will stay at The Beach next time! In Aug. 2005, I stayed at The Grand with three other people. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves. I cannot say enough about the staff! Out of every place I've been to in the caribbean, the staff at The Grand went above and beyond to make sure we all had a great time. The food wasn't too bad compared to some all-inclusive deals I've had. We did run into some problems though! The room was kinda run down. We literally fell onto the bed from being exhausted one night, and the bed fell to the floor! It took two days to finally be fixed. My boyfriend and I went to the beach and took off our outerware to go swimming. This included a dress, his shorts, and our shoes. We also had our digital camera rolled up in our towel and two drinks sitting there. After ten minutes tops of swimming, we went back and ALL OUR THINGS were stolen! Shoes, drinks, camera, everything. To make matters worse, we were CHARGED for our towels (you are given 2 towels with your towel card)! My advice to anyone is to guard your towels and leave all cameras in your room. We had no pictures of our trip! Other than that, had a great time. Going back in march but to The Beach.

<Content>It was definitely not a 5A as Apple said it was! We stayed here from 12/17 to 12/24THE GOOD:Beautiful beaches and pools. Wonderful staff.THE BAD:Rooms are small compared to other 5 Apple rated resorts we've stayed in, even other Sunscape Resorts we have stayed in. The Resort is 'Under Construction'. The first room they gave us was constant hammering, circular saws, and construction workers yelling at each other. We were moved and that did get us away from the construction but there was no hot water for the first three days. The hot water started and then there was NONE. Hot and cold water was OFF for hours at a time more times than I can count.The food was good, well presented, but you had to be careful of what you ate. The hot food was not kept hot and the cold food was not kept cold. Even though my wife and I were careful we both got travelers sickness. Imagine defecating and vomiting in a toilet a dozen time and not being able to flush it. This was not uncommon, of about a dozen families we spoke to at least one of the family members in more than half of the groups were sick with the same intestional problems we had.My advise would be to avoid this resort until they finish with their construction.

<Content>great trip My wife and I went the last minute. Greatest trip we ever took, especially for the price.The good:--good and friendly staff--nice grounds--excellent weather--food was unbelievable, especially the buffet--room was good but not a 5-star in U.S. standards, but it was clean and confortable.--family orientedThe bad: --they had the water on and off (due to new construction) without notice. Some --not us-- were very upset about it.--even though you did not have to tip, it was almost impossible to find small bills ($1.00) to give an excellent staff a tip.Recommendations:--go with the attitude that it is a third world country that does not parallel the U.S. Everything is in slow motion and the ammenities do NOT match that of ours.--take $1.00 bills with you to tip. The staff needs and, more importantly, deserve a little extra.If you go with the right attitude, relax, go with the flow, you will love it.Also, we would highly recommend the Outback Safari. It was very educational and well done. A very rough ride on some of the roads but well worth every penny.If you go, we certainly hope you can enjoy it as much as we did.

<Content>I Would Stay Here Again We stayed at this All inclusive resort from 12/13 to 12/20.--------------------------THE GOOD:The resort was very clean and it seemed at times there was more staff than there was guests...let's say the staff was highly visible. They took great care to make sure their grounds were clear of litter, kind of like Disneyland. The resort beach was also very clean, despite the fact they had beach food service.The food was very good, but not gourmet or what I would call outstanding. Let's say this...I gained 5 pounds during the week. The buffets have a nice variety of food, from fish to red meat to veggies to a nice salad buffet and dessert buffet (great chocolate mousse, almond pastry and mini custard filled donuts/eclairs). They had different themes every night with different decorations, alcoholic beverages and food.The a la carte restaurants had nice decor, great service and a higher quality of food. No reservations required and the wait was less than 10 minutes at the worst. The a la carte restaurants have many courses so it is expected that dining is leisurely, but one night we came late and wanted to catch that night's show and asked them to hurry...unbelievably they served us and we ate 4 or 5 courses in 45 minutes...so they are very accomodating.There were birds on the grounds (we saw a Green Heron, an egret, a duck, some Flamingos, and various other smaller tropical birds). There were fountains as well.The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and very accommodating. They have maid service both in the morning and at night.This resort had a whole bunch of activities during the day as well as a nightly movie and entertainment following. The entertainment ranged from fair to good, depending on the night. The majority of the movies were fairly recent releases to DVD.They had a caribbean market with local goods two of the seven nights with different vendors. The quality seemed higher than the stores they had on the beach.The beach is endless and it is a quick walk to two other resorts (the Allegro  Natura Park).The rooms were large.Check-out was very quick.------------------------------------------THE BAD: - Power went out three times during the stay, although not for long.- They left moldy bread in the baskets that was intended to feed the birds.- My balcony door would not lock, but we were on the second floor, so it was okay.- Somewhat limited menus at the a la carte restaurants. They weren't as expansive as you would get eating at a restaurant back home.- Mosquitos (large bites and very itchy)- December is one of their rainy months. January is the other. It was cloudy about half the time.

<Content>Nice Little Resort We just returned from a week at the Sunscape and I must say after reading some of the reviews we were pleasantly surprised. I titled this a Nice Little Resort because that's exactly what it is. It's not spread out like some where you walk long distances to get anywhere or take golf carts like some other resorts in Punta Cana. But small doesn't mean that it is not nice because it was. Check in was very smooth and we were greeted with drinks and in our room in only about 15-20 minutes. The room itself was nothing spectacular but we didn't expect that it would be. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. If you want spectacular then go to an upscale resort and spend the extra money. The beach was very nice and yes there was some seaweed as others have mentioned but it was never a problem and was being cleaned continually. Perhaps we were fortunate but unlike others we never had a problem getting beach chairs regardless of what time we went down to the beach. The same for the watersports, whenever we signed up for a catamaran we were able to get one without a long delay.  There were many complaints about the food in other reviews however we had no problems, no one got sick and we never had any trouble finding something we liked to eat. We ate at all the restuarants at the resort during our stay and enjoyed them all.  If you are looking for a resort that is non-stop activities then you will probably be disappointed in the Sunscape. There activities going on but not to the extent that some other resorts offer. This was fine with us as we were mainly there to relax on the beach. We can't speak about the entertainment at night as we did not go to any shows during our stay. We preferred to go to the casino at another resort. Sunscape is in the process of building a casino and a disco so in the future going off site will not be necessary.  We did go on a couple of tours and would highly recommend the Jungle Safari. Alex the tour guide was absolutely great and educated us about the history, culture, economy, and people of the Dominican. On top of that he kept the drinks flowing the whole day.  All in all we enjoyed our stay and would have no trouble recommending the Sunscape to others.

<Content>A Wonderful Place, A Terrific Time My wife and I returned on November 26, after spending Thanksgiving week at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. We vacationed with 2 other couples and we all had a great time. The grounds are beautiful, the staff very friendly, the food was surprisingly good for an all-inclusive resort and the weather was warm and sunny.Yes, there is seaweed in the water but it is an ocean, so anyone who is put off by this probably doesn't like that type of water anyway.I give a rousing endorsement to this resort and only hope it doesn't change too much when the new company takes over ownership in January. If you go, eat at the American Grill and say hello to Edison and Pena. They are the best.

<Content>3rd times a charm!!! i really get aggrivated when i see horrible reviews about the Sunscape...I returned with my boyfriend and a few couples we met there back in January...We went in June and were there for a wedding which was absolutely gorgeous...this was my 3rd time back to the Sunscape and it was just as good if not better than the first two times i went...the only thing i would not reccommend is going in June...i have gone 2 other times in January and found the weather was a bit cooler and the pool was refreshing and didnt feel like bath water...our room was great!! when we arrived they had assigned us a 1st floor room in building 5...after being on the 3rd floor the past two times, we asked to be moved to the third floor and it was done without question...the 3rd floor rooms have an awesome cathedral ceiling and some of them have huge wraparound balconys....the rooms were very clean and comfortable...the pools were clean as well...we stayed by the adult pool to be away from the little kids and relax...the swim up bar is a great feature at the main pool though...the iceburg in the ocean was soo much fun (for all ages)...the ocean and beach were gorgeous...there was always someone cleaning up the seaweed on the beach every morning...never had a problem finding a place to sit...there were always enough chairs and shade...the food was great as well...we loooved the breadfast buffet at windwos and da marios was our favorite for dinner...the staff is always willing to do whatever they can for you, with or without being tipped....i found it particularly amazing that 2 of our favorite bartenders remembered us from being their 6 months before we arrived again...we love Andres and Ignasio!!...we did a snorkling booze cruise which was also amazing...they take you on a boat waaay out to the really nice coral and snorkel with you...then they take you to a shark pen where you swim literally a few feet above nurse sharks and sting ray...it was definitely an experience ill never forget!!...the shows are funny and i think you just have to have an open mind to enjoy them...the staff works really hard to make sure everything is perfect...if you have any questions feel free to email me @ mazda6gurrl@hotmail.com...i would stay at Sunscape again in a heartbeat but am very upset to hear that there are new owners...hopefully they will keep up the good work!!!

<Content>Grand was all that and more! My husband and I just returned from Sunscape Grand yesterday. WOW! We were thrilled! From the minute we entered the beautiful open-air lobby we were treated wonderfully! We were immediately checked in, given our rum punch and lead to what I believe had to be the best possible room we could have imagined. We were in room 3330. A third floor, end room with a wrap around balcony overlooking the pool AND a perfect ocean view. We did no excursions or even left the resort(except for walks on the beach). We thought there was a great selection of food at each restaurant. Sure, it wasn't exactly what you might find in the US, but we loved trying the new things and always found something delicious. DeMarios's was even nicer than I had imagined. The American Grill was good and the Beach Cafe was great for poolside/beachside lunches in our swimsuits. Windows had a really good breakfast every day. The drinks were bottomless and great! I think I tried every tropical drink they had. My hubby who is a diehard Budweiser man, loved the ElPresidente! The staff was constantly working to keep things spic and span, which it was. We thought everything was very nicely kept. Clean and beautiful. No bugs, rodents, etc as I had read about. Had a great hour long massage on the beach-very relaxing, almost like I was in a dream!I can't imagine anyone giving this place bad reviews. It was a smaller, cozy resort which is one thing we were looking for. We had a memorable time and would love to return, but were told Sunscape Grand will be no more after December 2005. I just hope the new management company keeps us the good work.

<Content>I should have listened to these online reviews. Just returned from Sunscape Punta Grand 11/5-11/11. I must say the hotel lobby and grounds are gorgeous. We arrived at the hotel between lunch  dinner and the only available food was chips and salsa and ham and cheese sandwiches that were sitting out. This hotel is no way 5 star, the food alone drops it to 3 star. The night of the beach party, several warmers had died and the food was cold. We couldn't find anything decent to eat.Our room was in bldg 4 and had a nice view of the beach, but the furniture was falling apart and our bathroom ceiling was leaking. After complianing we were moved up a floor and the tub in that room didn't stop up. We had an ant problem in both rooms, by the 6th night, they were on our bed. The hotel lost power several times during the week and the water was constantly being shut off.The staff is great, very friendly. The entertainment could do with some revamping, but we went with 2 small children and enjoyed the nightly movie. My son loved the trampoline, but other than hanging at the pool, not much to do. Beach was full of seagrass. This resort has soured us on the DR, but if we were to return it would not be to a Sunscape Resort.

<Content>Honest review- please read! Would return to country and resort. IF YOU WANT A TRUTHFUL/HONEST REVIEW, READ THIS: This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic. I have previously been to Cancun and the Riviera Maya. We went with another couple and had adjoining rooms. I have read some of the reviews and I think some people forgot where they were staying. On tripadvisor.com this resort was rated #5 of all Punta Cana resorts. The grounds and pool were beautiful and GREAT. The food, I thought, put all-inclusives in mexico to shame. I don't know what people expected, but I was pleased. We had a beautiful balcony- opt for the deluxe room like we did. I will admit the entertainment was cheesy, but this is not America! The staff was friendly and that is even without a tip here or there which is not even expected. The beach was white and very little seaweed when we were there- they clean it also every morning. The water had small calm waves, this resort is in the carribean. If you are looking for larger waves, you need to look at the punta cana resorts that are farther north in the Atlantic. The water was very refreshing and clear. We snorkled at the resort, used the catamaran and ocean kayaks- it was all FREE! There are local shops just next to the resort on the beach which made shopping for souveniers very convenient. They have an outdoor theatre, shuffleboard, bacci ball, etc. The forecast was for scattered storms all week, I dont know how because I had to use 45 spf sunblock to prevent burning due to the wonderful weather. The worst part of our trip was flying with the airline and the problems they caused, not the resort. They have some type of food and bar open 24 hours. My parents were so impressed with the pictures and results that we had, that they are planning a trip there in April 2006. We looked for months at all the resorts on-line and were debating on sunscape grand and secrets excellence (which is a sister luxury hotel). After staying at the Sunscape, I could not see why or what you could need more for an extra $500 to go to Secrets other than bath robes! I recommend this place and suggest booking the airport transport with your package if you can. I hope you found my review helpful and try not to focus on all the negativity that some people spit out. If you look at the reviews- even the most luxurious and expensive resorts have people giving crappy reviews. YOUR VACATION IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT- RELAX AND DRINK PLENTY!

<Content>Not a five star! Not even a four star! I just returned from Dominican Republic (stayed there from 24th to 31st October 2005).I booked Sunscape Punta Cana Grand because I was advised that it was a five star hotel. Well, based on my 30 years traveling experience (and also comparing it with two other hotels I stayed previously in Dominican Republic) I would rate this as a 3 star hotel... Of course, I feel deceived... and I will complain to whoever may be able to do something about this!Maintenance, particularly in the rooms, is lousy. This may have something to do with the ownership change that is taking place. Travelplan (Spanish) bought the hotel from Sunscape 16 months ago but management will only switch over to Travelplan in January 2006. Weird arrangement!Food quality is erratic. Service is friendly but happens when it happens!Entertainment was the worst I ever experienced in an all inclusive hotel.In short: stay away!

<Content>Sunscape Grand (Food Terrible) Our room was ok. We saw rats running around on the sidewalks. There were mice running around in the resturants while we were eating. The food was terrible!! My bacon cheeseburger tasted nothing or looked nothing like beef and it was nasty! The meat doesn't taste anything like meat in the U.S. My wife and I didn't have one good thing to eat while we were there, except for salsa and nachos. The resort's beaches, pool, and buildings are very nice and the people are nice also. I would not return to this resort unless I was on a diet and liked chasing rodents around for fun.

<Content>Grand just ok.... We were at the Grand from October 1st to October 8th. 4 of us ladies without husbands, kids, boyfriends, work, etc....We went to relax and that's what we did. The resort itself is beautiful and the staff are amazing. Jean Allie, Fernando, Andre, Beachpapi, Jean Cruz just to name a few.Unfortunately, our weather while there did not really co-operate with us, so we had about 4 days of rain in total out of the 7 days we were there. It was still very hot when raining, so you could still float around the pool, but once the thunder and lightening started, you had to get out.Our main problem with this hotel was the food. Not that it tasted bad, it was just always cold, even when under heat lamps, and there was not much of a selection. We found that we ended up eating the same thing everyday all week long. If I ever see another pizza, fries and pasta again, I think I'll faint. LOL....None of us were sick and we never heard anyone else complain about being sick.The rooms are really nice and very clean. We had no problems with bugs or anything like that. We used the room safe, but there was a charge of $15 USD for the week for it. We also paid for a late check out, which was an additional $20 USD.Overall, I would have to say that I would not return to this resort. Mainly because of the food situation, but we think that might have been due to the fact that the hotel was only running at about 30% capacity. There is also not much to do at night, and we found the vendors very pushy and too willing to try and rip you off, but that is normal. Make sure you barter with these people.If your looking for a relaxing vacation and food selection is not a major concern to you, then this resort is for you.

<Content>A Wonderful Get Away We just returned from DR (all 30 of us). We were there from 9/24-10/01/05. At least 12 of them were at the Grand 2 yrs ago and persuaded the rest of us to join them again, this year. I have been reading the TripAdivsor for a few months to get feedback on the Grand. As everyone else, I had mixed feelings about going.  The best way to sum of our stay was GREAT! The people in DR can not do enough for you because they appreciate the tourism to improve there counrty. Our dollars go along way there. As for the Grand, bartenders, Beach Papi, Pedro, Gloria...and so many more were excellent. They know you, what you drink and don't even have to ask. Fernando- the activities director is so personable and a fantastic guy! The rooms are immaculate and fridge always stocked. The grounds are clean and well manicured. The people there work very, very hard so we can have a wonderful vacation. To see smiling faces every day and greeted with Hola makes it all worth it.  The food is plentiful and the resturants are good. The food is to each ones taste. You are in a foreign country and not at your hometown resturants so please do not judge there food to your own. The buffet on the beach is Fantastic. They go all out with food, service, entertainment! If you decide to do a tour I do recommment the Outback Safari. I do hope you get Elvis for your guide. And yes, that is his real name! We saw his drivers license. He speaks 5 languages and gives the best tour ever!  The shops along the beach are great and fun to go to. Ulysis, Picasso, Antonio.. No pushy, push and cheapy cheap! As they say they are cheaper than K Mart  Target! You do make deals and it is fun. We had met lots of people at the Grand from Ohio- to the UK and the one word they use alot in the DR is family. When you finally have to leave the resort and waive goodbye to the staff and the new people you have met, Yes it felt like you were saying Goodbye to Family. We all agreed to return to the DR. The Grand is in the process of being bought and adding on a casino. We all hope it does NOT become another run of the mill resort but stays personable and very relaxing and not oversized. If you decide to go Relax, Enjoy and be thankful!

<Content>Best holiday ever We travelled on the 28th July 05 as a group of 24. When we arrived at the resort our eyes lit up. It was everything we imagined and more. From the moment we arrived the staff were more than helpful. Our first night was definatly one to set the scene for the remainder of our holiday. The Beach party really made you feel like like you had just landed in paradise. The food was excellent from day one. Whether you ate on the Beach, at Windows or in one of the restauants you could not fault a thing. The bar staff and waiters were fantastic, friendly and efficient. None of our group are fluent in Spanish but the staff do appreciate it if you try the odd gracias or por favor, for SOME of our American friends manners help as much as a dollar tip here or there.The all inclusive was brilliant, far better than I thought it would be, the food was of a high standard with a great variety. There were some international drinks such as Baileys or JD included and you could not fault the staff. The activities both day and night catered for all so there was never a dull moment during our holiday.I wouldn't recommend the Dolphin Island trip or parasending. Dolphin Island is a waste of money for a glorified bus trip and well, health and safety wasn't a stong point for some of the speed boat drivers when it came to the motorised watersports.Definatley definatley do the jurassic safari, we had a truck to ourselves and amongst 17 drinkers and 3 non-drinkers we beat the all time record for the most bottles of rum drank in one day. It really was a great experience. (And I was a non-drinker). If you decide to do this trip ask for Alex to be your guide for the day, he was great.Finally we had our wedding at this resort and there is no way I would do it anywhere else but here. We had the best day of our lives finished with a candle- lit reception on the beach- perfect.If you have read the bad reports about this place, ignore them. I was so worried before travelling but it proved we had nothing to worry about. A holiday is what you make it.

<Content>Not a let down I just returned from the Sunscape PC Grand. I typically take mini vacations of 4 to 5 days in the Carribean. This is my 5th visit to Dom Rep. and it was much as I expected, lots of sun, food and drinks. The beach was great though there was quite a bit of weed both in and out of the water. The restaurants were great. No complaints at all about the food. The Buffet restaurant (Windows) was awesome, huge selection and everything was delicious--no I did not get sick, not in the least. The grounds were beautiful, the std room quite ample with balcony, the staff friendly. The entertainment was not as good as most other places I have been, but it was better than nothing. Though late September, it was still very humid, but the water cools you off. Found the Sunscape along with neighboring resorts quite low in attendance. Though in years past,I have also booked in hurricane season, crowds have been slightly bigger. With the smaller attendace you do not have to fight for a hut at the beach, at any time of the day, nor wait in lines for drinks or food. Though the atmosphere of the place is not as vibrant. All in all a great place and a great bargain. I would reccommend it to others.

<Content>Great Fun A friend and I travel each year to a new place. The Grand was great, friendly, clean, food was wonderful, staff soooo compassionate and helpful. Take your own US dollars as they are hard to get, it costs alot for any medications or sunscreen so pack it.. The place was wonderful, pools clean, drinks and people great, 24 hour room service with a smile, 2 times daily the maids checked our rooms for the mininbar and towels or WHATEVER we asked of her, we did tip well and had rewards from the entire staff for it, we stayed a week and tipped about $15.00 and loved it. The beach was clean and the shops were fun to shop and dicker the prices, you get what you want in the end or go to the next shop. It was esay from the airport and check in and out was fast, no problems. we drank water and ate without illness, there is bottled water for an army so to speak, it was worth our time, it is on a return list we keep. I recommend it to all.

<Content>Feel at Home Punta Cana Sunscape Grand, Punta Cana, Dominicn RepublicSept 14th, 2005My husband and I spent 3 lovely weeks at this resort. We were well taken care of by the staff. The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Our room was very comfortable; nicely furnished, and well kept. The resort was extremely well-planned so that we were close to everything. It was very well-maintanied; kept very clean. The food at Windows, the buffet restaurant, was tasty and varied from day to day along with the theme. The Dominican Buffet was the best.They outdid themselves with dinner on the Beach every Thurs. night, which included entertainment, and it was terrific.Two of the other three restaurants were pretty good. However, we ate at the Beach Garden Cafe, which was open all night, and were very diasappointed. We had a Club sandwich that was made with stale bread, leftover cheese, and meat, and there was very little inside. We only ate the pizza there.The Beach was clean, and far surpassed the neighboring beach at the Allegro Resort. There was security on our beach at all times.We had no problem being understood by the staff.The water sports were sufficient, but they closed up shop a bit early.The rooms were well air-conditioned, but sometimes there was no hot water.There were plenty of planned activities all day, and a show every night.The explorer's club for kids kept them occupied, and it was well situated not to interfere with other guests without children.I did the bike tour, which was okay, but would have liked to have gone further.The gym was clean, and though small had enough stuff to work out with.I had a massage at the spa, which was not included, and I was very pleased. Unfortunately, my husband stopped in while I was there, and the receptionist was somewhat unpleasant.All in all, we had a great time, felt at home, and would go back to this resort again.

<Content>Just Wonderful! We just returned from a week at the Grand, it was unforgetable!We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, and had never been out of North America.We arrived 3 hours before check in time, but were given a cool drink and a cookie, and asked to return to reception in about an hour, so we wandered around, had a bite to eat and returned to the main lobby. Our room was ready, and we were given our keys, towel cards, and room safe key.( no charge to use safe, but DO NOT LOOSE THE KEY)Our room was in bulding 4, on the third floor. It was large, clean and had all the ammenities. The staff were wonderful, very friendly, helpful, most spoke english (at least enough to get by), many spoke more than two languages.The beach was beautiful, yes there is sea grass, it is the sea...but the staff were up everyday cleaning up the beach. We wandered down the beach past other resorts, and their beaches were not as clean. Some do go topless on the beach, but I was not bothered by this.The activities staff were fun and encouraged you to join in, but if you did not want to, they left you alone. They had something going on ALL day if you felt like joining in. The food was pretty good, you could find just about anything at the buffett, they also had room service and a beach garden rest. open all the time.The food and bar staff were great, they were always around when you needed them. We never waited for a table or a drink.The grounds were incredible, well kept, clean and beautiful. There were 2 pools, one adults only( yes, they go topless), and they were clean and pretty. Yes, the water was warm, the pools were in the sun, and it is HOT in the DR!!!The beach party on Thursday night was fantastic. The staff worked all day to set it up, the best food and fun with entertainment right on the beach! It was a blast!They even set up a big screen on the beach for the NFL game.We got up early each day and saved a place in the shade at the beach, then after breakfast, off to the beach we went. The water was clear most days, one day it was a little cloudy due to a storm off shore. We had no rain, it was overcast 2 days.The only complaint I have is that we didn't always have hot water, but I understand this happens all over and wasn't that big a deal for us.The construction going on near the resort seemed to be all hand tools, we went to see it one day, we really did not hear it at all.We did take advantage of the internet service to e-mail home, it was nice to keep in touch with the kids...The resort let the beach vendors set up around the pool 2 nights. I did not like the bargaining process, I prefer to be told a price...but I did it.I felt the prices in the resort shops were outrageous! $2.00 for a candy bar... and we looked at cigars...A box of a brand we get here in the States for $50.00 for 25, they $20.00 each. (Yes, a Dominican brand). I thought this was a bit much! The beach vendors call out to you as you walk by, one even tried to sell my husband Ganja, but left you alone after a while...

<Content>great deal! I had a great time. check in was easy, and my room was upgraded for free. but since i never spent time in my room, a garden view would do. maid service was great and a tip helps get the mini bar overstocked. rooms were clean and plenty of american tv options. the main pool was very nice and clean and the drinks kept on comming. bring your own mug if you want to make less frequent trips to the bar. the food is fine. the best nights are the outdoor theme buffets. very good! Everyone was friendly and spoke good english or enough english. also ignore the comments about not enough chairs. the security is key here. i walked down the beach past other resorts and their beaches had people trying to sell drugs all over, but sunscape has security on the beach. piano bar and disco looked nice, i was often too tired by then. the best part of this resort is the 24hr bar and food, and in room mini bar. book it you will like it. it is much cheaper than any american vacationwill return

<Content>Sunscape Resorts: The Best There Is....and more. My wife  I stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand in February 2005 and we cannot fail to recommend it to the highest degree in EVERY aspect of what you should expect from an AI 5-star resort. The beach, the drinks the rooms, the restaurants, the wine, the buffet, the entertainment, more wine, the champagne night, the lobster night, the drinks, the staff (**), the management, the cleanliness, the 6-star beach dinner party (unbelievable), the beach BBQ (unbelievable)....just EVERYTHING.** When you get there, ask for Felix (Restraunt Manager); a gentleman, ace and dedicated friend. Say Princess (the name he gave my wife) sends her love.Unfortunately, The Grand changes name  ownership in January 2006.Most of the staff will stay there. But Sunscape will nodoubt take their stars to The Beach (a brand new resort just round the ismus), which is where we'll be in February. JUST CHOOSE SUNSCAPE. See you there !!Alan  Sophia Dumelow

<Content>Beautiful resort, great people, average food I vacationed at The Grand on Aug 22-26. This was my first time out of the US. I thought the whole experience was excellent. I traveled with Apple Vacations and cannot say enough good things about them. The resort was beautiful and super clean. There was always several people roaming the resort cleaning up and others working on the landscape. The rooms were super clean and roomy. I left the maid a note with what I wanted in the fridge and a couple dollars and he loaded it up everyday. The beach was beautiful. The water crystal clear and the sand fine white and easy to walk on. We went snorkeling and took some bread out there and the fish would swarm around us eating it. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Personally I thought the food was ok. We ate at the buffet mostly, plenty of choices and loads of desserts. Didn't like Damario's italian at all. Very small portions and a long wait. They tried but not my cup of tea. The American grill and the Beach garden grill were good. I would give this resort a 5 in everything but the food. A couple upset stomachs and a few squirts but other than that noone was sick. Juan at the splash bar was great and his Juan especial was yummy. The entertainment team works very hard and the shows were great and funny. I would recommend this resort to anyone and would definitely recommenend Apple.

<Content>Great Experience My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary here 8/22 to 8/26. The weather was great each day with lots of sun and any showers were very short and only in the evening while we were dining. Like most other reviewers we found the grounds beautiful and the entire atmosphere very laid back and relaxing. We also encountered tiny ants in the room-seeking something sweet. We used the bug spray that we brought to spray along the edges of the sink and dresser and this eliminated their appearance.  Like most AI's there was a lot of variety with the food and we always found our favorites. We used Pepto tablets everyday to insure against stomach maladies. Any time you change eating habits your body will let you know.  The most impressive part of the Grand had to be the staff especially the work they do with children. Their Explorer's Club takes the children from 10 to late afternoon involving them in games, entertainment, and teaching them about the DR. They are very, very good and all the children really liked the attention. I'm sure the parents appreciated it too. There were also nightly movies (semi-current releases) followed by a show (about an hour). Then the disco and or piano bar would open. During the day there were all kinds of contests -horseshoes, shuffleboard, volleyball, baseball, dance lessons, bartending tips, flower and towel arranging, etc... Would definitely go back.

<Content>Everything Great But the Food I stayed at the Grand from Aug 15-22 with my girlfriend. To give some background, we are both 26-year-old graduate students.Hotel Grounds: The hotel grounds were lovely, they were kept in wonderful condition and staff members constantly worked to keep them clean and tidy. There are lots of palm trees throughout and the main pool is in a good, central location. I would comment however, that the pool water in both the main and adult pools seemed to be extremely warm, more like a hot tub. This could just be the result of the pools being exposed to the powerful sun, rather than being heated to this temperature. We didn't really notice the construction, in any event it was on the other side of the resort near buildings one and two while we were in building four which I would highly recommend. The bars and restaurants are numerous and are easily accessible from all areas of the resort.Rooms: For the most part, I thought the rooms were nice and clean. Maid service was good and our mini bar was refilled every day. Unfortunately, the refrigerator did not work all that well and the beer and water from it were somewhat lukewarm. I know some reviews said the rooms needed updating, and granted I'm no Frank Lloyd Wright, but I thought the rooms were just fine. The television worked well and had about 20 channels, most of which were American and included among others ESPN, Discovery, HBO, Showtime and the networks (New York affiliates). One negative regarding the room is that the hallway outside was tiled and as a result the sounds coming from the hallway really echoed throughout and were fairly loud even inside the room with the door closed. All in all though, the rooms were above average.Beach: The beach was about what I expected. It is true that if you want one of the thatched huts on the beach you have to be there before 8:30 in order to reserve one by placing your towels on the chairs. This was annoying because oftentimes guests would reserve a hut and not actually sit in it at all. The hotel tries to limit the seat saving to three hours, but this guideline seems to be widely disregarded. In any event, I don't think the hotel could really do anything to stop this from occurring. Also, the water wasn't as blue as I expected. I was hoping for the clear, baby blue, transparent water of postcards but it was greenish in color near the shore and darker away from the shore. Not to say that it looked like the East River or something and maybe I'm nitpicking about this, but it was just a little different from my expectations. I thought the mountain and trampoline were fun and the temperature of the ocean water was great. Also the sea was calm while we were there which made for wonderful swimming conditions.Food: The food was the only thing that I had a serious problem with. It actually tasted pretty good for the most part, but the issues started after we had eaten. On the fourth or fifth day of the week long trip we both had stomach issues and this continued in some form or another for the remainder of the trip. Perhaps I have a sensitive stomach, but I have never had this issue before in travelling to Mexico or to numerous destinations in Europe. We ate at all of the restaurants and I never got sick from the food at the American Grill or the Tex Mex restaurant. My stomach gave mixed reviews of the Windows buffet and after eating at DeMario's (Italian) I became violently ill. I don't know if any other guests had issues, and like I said before maybe I just have a sensitive system so one should probably take this part of the review with a grain of salt. Guests: I would estimate the guests were probably 40 percent American 40 percent European (mostly Spainards, Germans) and 20 percent South American. I thought that most people seemed to be respectful of each other and the staff, which was a nice thing to see after reading some of the past reviews about this and other resorts in the area.Staff: In general staff members were friendly and helpful. Yes, they don't all speak English that well, but it is very ethnocentric to expect them to when we are visiting their country. All of the front desk staff had good language skills and we never had any issues at check-in or check-out. We went parasailing and to do that or other sea based excursions, one deals with Scuba Caribe which (I think) is an independent contractor of the hotel. Their staff was helpful and friendly and the outfit seemed to be fairly professional.That is all I can think to write, I have used this site many times to help in my travel decisions and I hope my first review has been helpful to others.

<Content>All-in-All, A Great Vacation! Overall rating: 4.5We stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand from August 12-19. We had an excellent vacation!HOTEL ROOM:The room was comfortable for the most part. Upon arrival, I gasped when I saw so many bugs crawling across the dresser area. I called the front desk and they took care of the problem, for the most part, although there were little tiny bugs crawling around the sink area all week. (I'm not good with bugs, although my husband and daughter had no problem with them.)MAID SERVICE:Maid service was good until the last day. There were not enough towels for all three of us and our pop wasn't restocked. When we called to get more towels, they brought us a few hand towels and a wash cloth after two calls, but never brought our large towels, as promised. FOOD:The food was excellent! We thoroughly enjoyed the meals we had at Sunscape. We most enjoyed the American Grill (Tex Mex) restaurant and also the Beach Garden, although De Mario's and Windows were both good restaurants, as well. The food at the Beach Party was magnificent! There was something there for everyone! The grilled out food was superb and this was a nice way to end our vacation.ENTERTAINMENT:The entertainment was wonderful! We enjoyed all the shows each and every night. We regretted missing the dinner theater. We had no idea they would go all out and set up tables by candlelight in front of the stage aera. The entertainers had a lot of energy and you couldn't help but tap your feet to the music! Fun!POOL:The pool was the largest pool I had ever swam in. We had so much fun swimming and relaxing on our rafts in it. The highlight of the pool was the swim-up splash bar! We enjoyed our virgin CocoLocos, Bahama Mamas and Pina Colatas! Juan worked so hard at getting drinks to everyone as fast as possible. My family and I couldn't help but notice his hard work.OCEAN:The ocean was nice, but there was a little seaweed in it. We didn't care though - we had a lot of fun! We were surprised to see so many topless women getting some sun and even walking the beach! I know many of the men enjoyed this scenery, but I think with all the kids around, topless should have been restricted to the adult pool, which I think Sunscape promotes.TIPPING:We tipped quite often when the service was excellent. We did spend a lot of extra money in tipping although the trip was all-inclusive, because the workers, for the most part, worked very hard. You get special treatment when you tip - they remember! We took a lot of $1 bills with us. My husband even handed out $5 bills.All-in-all, we had a wonderful time! I would have rated this hotel Excellent, but there were a few problems I thought could have been handled faster and could have been prevented. If we go back to Punta Cana, I wouldn't have a problem staying at the Sunscape again, but we would probably try out another resort just so we would feel like we're on a different vacation. Everything would become too familiar.

<Content>Absolutely Loved It We stayed at Sunscape July 24 - June 1 and didn't want to return home. We absolutely loved it. After reading a lot of these reviews, most seemed as though they took little things too seriously. I can say I didn't see any rats or cockroachs. My mom, friend, and myself had the time of our lives. I would go back in a heart beat. The food there wasn't the best, I did get sick a few nights but, the pasta was amazing. Your not in America so it's not going to be American food and its going to be their way. During the day we stayed at the resort and we would swim, play volleyball, play pool or ping-pong, or hang out with friends we had made. The staff was absolutely amazing, it's impossible not to meet anyone there and you really can't say they try because when we first walked in we saw like 5 of them in there bathing suits dancing around getting guests to join them. If it weren't for the staff, I wouldn't have met half the people me and my friend did. I must admit though when we first walked into the resort I thought it was going to be the worst vacation of my life, but after eating lunch I realized I wasn't giving the place a chance and a half hour later I knew I couldn't leave. Also during the day my friend and I (by the way I am 15) went banana boating with kids our age we went and it was so much fun. I would reccomend going for 20 minutes, it goes by so fast. We also went paddle boating, and that was free, it was hard work, but it was worth it to see the resort from the ocean. Everyday the staff also gets together either volleyball matches, or shuffleboard and dart matches. The winners at night are able to claim there prizes going on stage and winning from a variety of rum, t-shirts, or coffee. My favorite night though was when the staff put on the show. Many people said there was a language barrier, but I speak no spanish and I was perfectly fine. If you just talk with the natives a little you will fall in love with them immediately. They love to talk with you. We loved Andre, he always had a smile on his face and was dancing or doing something to make you laugh. I could go on and on but, I am not going to. Of the 20 - 25 people i met there, they would do anything to go back to sunscape. You just got to forget what you're used to and relax. Enjoy yourself and learn to except different cultures and ways of life. If you do this you'll have the time of your life.

<Content>Exceptional Value Dates stayed: July 26-August 2, 2005This was our first time staying at an all-inclusive resort, so how this resort compares to others, we are unable to say. Overall, we felt there was exceptional value at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand.Accommodations: We would recommend, as others, to stay in building 4 or 5. The shows at night were very loud and we could hear them in our room in building 4 across the resort. The room was spacious (king-sized bed) and clean. We were on the first floor, but our balcony still felt separated from the public walk outside. A word of caution about buildings 1, 2, 4 and 5, the upper level rooms are accessed by only one stairway and could make for a limited escape in case of an emergency. The maid was thorough and friendly with her limited English. However, most days our room was not serviced until 5:00, when were trying to get ready for dinner. Our air conditioning worked very well throughout the trip, which was a blessing in the afternoons.Food  Drinks: Despite the advertisements food is not available 24 hours a day. Breaks between meals to switch over the restaurants from one meal to the next caused them to close. These times could have been staggered to allow one restaurant to be open at any time. Each restaurant ran on Dominican time, which translates to not being open at the time posted, 6:00 could mean 6:15. The service was also laid back and in a similar manner, not that you are in a hurry for any reason 鈥?enjoy it! In general, the food was good and the presentation was nice, but if you are looking for gourmet, an all-inclusive cannot provide that for you. A quick synopsis of the restaurants: Windows (the buffet) had breakfast, lunch, and dinner (most nights). It is a typical buffet, lukewarm food, and wide variety of choices to accommodate different cultural tastes. Tex-Mex had dinner 鈥?chips are great, American-style food, order the brownie for dessert! Da鈥橫ario鈥檚 had dinner 鈥?the most upscale dinning of the resort, nice atmosphere, but not authentic Italian food. Beach Grill had breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We enjoyed this most. It was relaxed, open-air, and had views of the beach.Each restaurant could use more variety. It is interesting that some deserts seem to appear at all the restaurants with just a slight twist on them to make them seem different. Most lunches we just ordered pizza and French fries from the grill and ate them at the pool. The pool bar was typically crowded, as expected, with young men never leaving their stools. The backstage bar was less crowded during the day, compared to the night crowd and it offers pizza, chips, and sandwiches during the afternoon. The Beach Grill Bar was open 24 hours and seemed to be staffed by the best bartenders. The alcohol used in most drinks is not top shelf and they seemed to utilize syrups in in lieu of more alcohol. Better liquor was available if requested. Not being big drinkers, this was fine with us. Again, similar to the food, if you are expecting lavish presentation and expense, an all-inclusive resort is not for you. Neither of us got sick, we stayed clear of all foods sitting out for who knows how long and didn鈥檛 touch the water. Bottled water was unlimited and readily available. There were questionable health practices noticed particularly at the beach party when we could see the preparation of the food.Entertainment: This type of thing is not our bag even when we are not on vacation. It seemed like others enjoyed it, but we found the shows to be cheesy and obligatory. We found the best entertainment to be the natural surroundings. The beach was clean, sand white, and water fairly clear. We enjoyed sitting by the pool each day and lounging under the shade of huts. Caution: the shaded seats are taken early, you must play this game, get up at 5:30 and put your towel our, go back to bed and get up for breakfast. We don鈥檛 see a way for the resort to control this; so complaining about it will only ruin your vacation. This was a trip to celebrate our five-year anniversary and was nice for couples and families. The resort appealed to our Midwestern U.S. sensibilities. We have never been so relaxed and overall thoroughly enjoyed this trip. Sunscape Punta Cana Grand excels at providing an exceptional experience for those looking to enjoy the Caribbean with little effort and relative expense.

<Content>nice get away we stayed the week of July 24, 2005 .......let me tell you about the great things.... the staff is very nice. they will go out of their way to please you and entertain you..they are very hard workers, they put in 16 hour day 7 a week. The weather was awesome. It was sunny every day but one and it only rained late at night. the actually hotel was nice also. the grounds were kept very nice. the beach was great clear water. Yes there was sea weed but it was not like the seaweed at the jersey shore it was like straw....and some days there was a lot of it and other there was none at all. The hotel has someone pick up the seaweed everyday. Every night the staff would put on a different show they was all funny. Now let me tell you the not so great things...the weather was soooo hot and i went to go in the pool the first day and it was boiling..the water was too hot to cool off the only relief you got from the heat was the ocean......and yes you do have to wake up and 6:30 every morning to reserve a hut on the beach and if you don't the sun will get to you after a while...but i was worth it...actually the good thing is they were building more huts. and there was the food issue! the food was on the poor side. Breakfast at the ocean garden was doable the windows buffet was a total disappointment to me and the others i went with. Lunch the beach grill was okay only for hot dogs (that had a dominican pinch to them) and ice cream....the fruit stand was awesome and their fruit was not bland as mentioned earlier. The pineapple and mango were out of this world you could every get them here in the states.. The beach gardern did serve pizza at lunch which you could get to go and take on the beach. Dinner: the best restaurant was the american grill(tex mex) but be prepared the food is not like the USA. The italian restaurant was the second best but again be prepared the food is not what you are used to. I think they would have been better off serving traditional dominican food they trying to prepare american food. And of coarse the last night i did get sick. But over all the trip was a nice get away and i would return.

<Content>Real Deal from a Realistic Person Hola All,This was my third trip to this resort, and I had a great time. It is landscaped and kept up extremely well. The resort is very clean. The staff are hard working and pleasant. The food was good, it is an all inclusive and I have never had absolutely fantastic food at any all inclusive and I have been to many in many different islands. The drinks are great and they will make anything you want or add more of something if you ask. The beach was very clean, seaweed? of course not - what do you think your at a natural beach or something. The seaweed was cleaned up everymorning bright in early. The water was clear and very pretty, it was sort of a light green. RESERVING CHAIR ISSUE - well, that's just the way it is. Actually I think it's like that everywhere...I even see it in Ocean City Maryland at the pools....get up - go get your chair and go back to bed - or get some coffee - or take pot luck, it's just the way it is...I don't see that changing, it shouldn't ruin your vacation. I did not see any furry creatures, except for the monkey they take pictures with. I did not see any roaches - which are probably just big waterbugs anyway. The rooms are very clean. Construction - wasn't a issue - did not hear anything, and unless your in building 1 and 2 you probably won't even notice. The pool - the water itself was clean, yes the water was warm, very warm, I love it that way. The tempature in Punta Cana averages about 90 degrees everyday so I think that may play a role.Some Honorable Mentions:Caren De Vries - Room Division ManagerFelix - Supv. of all ResturantsJuan Cruz - Splash BarPrince - Beach Garden/Tex MexEspraranza - Kid's ClubFernando - Kid's Club**They all were key players in making my vacation wonderful** A big Thank you to all of you!Can I tell you some negative things, yes, but I won't because I did not let those things bother me and ruin my trip. I was there to have a good time and that is what I did. If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them!Footnote - Apparently - after the construction is complete which will consist of suites and swim out units, the Sunscape Grand - will no longer be.....as of Jan 2006...No info on who is taking over the resort....and so I am sad to say goodbye....I love the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. ???

<Content>Misleading Reviews After reading the reviews posted specific to this location, my wife and I had the impression that we were going to an all inclusive resort where our comfort would be a priority to the staff. Unfortunately, what we found was quite contrary to this.Let me break our review down into some important categories:1. Language barrier - I know that we are English speaking and admittedly speak no Spanish. The reviews on this site made the staff out to be at least proficient in English. The only English speaking staff that could understand our needs or that we could communicate with were the front desk staff. There English was decent but our needs were difficult to explain to anyone else. When my wife fell at the pool and needed medical assistance, it became a traumatic experience getting anyone that could help us. Just the simple request of a band-aid was nearly impossible. The waiters could not understand enough English to make even the simplest of variations from the menu. Yes, the staff says Ola everytime that you see them, but they are unable to answer ANY questions that you might have.2. Food - the food was barely adequate. If you have ever been on a cruise with any cruise line, you will be VERY dissapointed with the selection, quality, and availability of the food. They basically serve the same food in every restaraunt and it is in extremely small portions. My wife fought an upset stomach for the four days that we were there and even now that we are home.3. Things to do - If you want to go somewhere, lay at the beach, or lay at the pool, then maybe this is okay. Plan on getting up each day before seven to reserve a decent spot by ocean or pool. There were never enough floating mats and the pool is warmer than bath water.4. Drinks - VERY weak and not tastey.5. Excursions - DO NOT leave the resort. Even on a tour the outside world is extremely scary and impoverished. The tours are terrible and do not cater to anyone that does not speak Spanish. Our guide on our jeep tour would speak in Spanish for five minutes and then maybe 30 seconds of very broken English. There seemed to be a lot of inside jokes with the Spanish-speaking guests, possibly at our expense. There was really nothing going on that fun each night either. My friends warned me not to go here. They said to go to Mexico where they relish the USA dollar and cater to your needs. The DR loved our US dollar but they are not savy enough to have seen what true service is yet. Visit this place in about 10 years when the US developers buy the properties and infuse great service in beautiful resorts.One word for anyone thinking of going to Punt Cana and especially the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand - Mexico!!

<Content>Awesome Oh my god Sunscape was awesome. I went with my mom dad and my sister and we all had something to do everyday. The entertainment crew at Sunscape are CRAZY!!!!! THEY ARE AWESOME. First off they stay up from 10 in the morning till 2:00 in the morning pleasing you. Andres is the best if you are going he is the little short guy with a smile on his face 24/7. Then there is Nelly who was a Entertainment Trainee didnt know that much English but she was awesome (THEY CAN DANCE). During the day, they give you a piece of paper eevry morning of daily activities. I am going to tell you now to do all the activities because you can win Bottles of rum and shirts and hats and such. I played Beach Volleyball with my Dad are team won so we got two things of rum and two shirts. Then one day we played basketball....Dont play it is so HOTT!!!! But we won then and got rum. Then we played the activity course and my Dad got 3rd place and got Coffee beans, rum, a hat, and a shirt. So play the activities they are awesome. Oh yeah for the kids in the ocean they have a water trampoline which sometimes ladies go on to lay out because it atracts the sun. There is also a 2 story high ice berg what you climb on and slide down it is awesome. People are trying to make you do things all the time I went parasailing and Scuba Diving and Snorkaling. The Parasailing, we took a boat 20 minutes down the ocean which was good because we saw other resorts and none of them amount to Sunscape. Then we went up in a nice boat and it was beautiful there is a big mountain range you can see it is perfect. I mean it sunscape is the best along that beach and we saw at least twenty resorts even Breezes and it was nothing special, Sunscape is where it is at. The Scuba Diving we went if you look in the ocean where the bar is out in the middle to the right of it there was a place called El Nino where we dove and it was so beautiful. We went under a coral Reef. I only need two more dives to become sertified. The snorkling you can do that any where it was ok but i recommend Scuba Diving only 80 dollars dont go parasailing it was good but i think it is over rated. The rooms, They are clean nice they have a bar but ours was hidden in a cubby hole it was so cool. They refill it everyday. If people complain about the rooms then they need help because we only slept in the room and didnt really care about the room. But it was really nice. The night life is amazing, one night they had a magician he was ok, then they always have contests and entertainers who dance spit out fire it is pretty neet. Then the entertainment outside ends at 10:00 then the Disco and the Piano bar open up. Piano bar has Karaokee some nights and they have this Jamacan come in and he is hilarious. The piano bar end at 12 then everybody goes to the Disco and dances till 2 in the morning. You can still get drinks in the disco. Tips, bring ALOT of sun tan lotion, bring snacks i guess because i was so hungry for like doritos and they were exspensive in the gift shop, bring a water camera because they are 22 dollars there. Also the beach merchants try to get you to get them food and drinks, don't do it unless they give you deals. I got a guy a rum and coke and a pizza and he gave me a T-Shirt. Dont give in to them. They treat you like kings down there. If something is like 30 dollars say i only have five they will probably give it to you. The staff there is amazing always trying to help your needs. Water sports they have catamorans, kayaks, paddle boats, and much much more. Over-all this place is awesome and I do recommend it dont listen to the bad comments because they probably made it a bad time, you gotta bring people who you are going to have a good time with. My family and I are looking forward to go again in April or May of 2006. Oh Yea if you are from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, and Deleware please go because alot of people are from there.

<Content>Ignore the negative reviews My husband and two children (ages 10 and 13) just returned from a five night stay at the hotel. Before I even booked this hotel, I did extensive research using this website and others to ensure we had a safe and enjoyable trip. After extensive research I finally decided on the Sunscape Grand and was encouraged by all the positive feedback most people left on this site for folks to read. Yes, ocassionally there were negative reviews, but the majority were good. Of course after I finally booked the trip (through Vacations to Go -- highly recommend them), I began reading many more negative comments and was worrying myself to death. Decided to put all the negative reviews out of my mind and see for myself, since at this point the trip was already booked. We hoped for the best.We arrived at the hotel around 2:30 in the afternoon. Not only was there NO wait for checking in, it was done within 10 minutes of getting there. We were greeted with a cold drink and received a small carrying case filled with lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc. The bell caps took our luggage right away to our room. We were assigned a room in Building 5 which I had requested prior to arriving, as I had read that it was one of the quietest in the evenings. The request was obviously met without my having to ask again upon checking. The room itself was clean with no musty smell, no bugs, no mold. It was in need of updating, but for the money I paid, I knew I wasn't getting a first class Hilton or Marriott. No bugs, clean sheets, clean towels, etc. was fine with us. We did have no hot water two days around 6:30 pm but we assumed most of the hotel was probably showering at the same time. Two of us had to wait 30 minutes and the hot water was back. Not a problem for us. We did have to ask for extra towels only one day and they were delivered within 15 minutes. The pool water was warm, but it was over 90 degrees every day and it sits mostly in the sun, is there anyone out there that can't figure out the water is going to heat up? Hello? The ocean water was almost just as warm. It did have a lot of seaweed, which isn't my cup of tea, but it was cleaned off the beach every day. I was disturbed to find glass in the sand on the beach. Thought it was a fluke thing, but then kept finding pieces. I finally asked one of the guys who had booked a snorkeling trip for my son and I and he said it was because of folks discarding bottles over the years (not sure what is wrong with people, but nothing surprises me any more). There were many people who couldn't even clean up their own cups and plates from around the pool. I assume they are the same people who wouldn't have a problem throwing bottles on the beach. In any event, the glass was not isolated to just the Sunscape Grand as I walked the entire beach from the Sunscape to the end of the public beach and there were several other hotels who actually had cylinders set up on the beach for putting glass shards in. As for entertainment, you could be there all day and do nothing or you could keep busy every minute of every hour. There is a daily list of activities that varies from day to day. Movie every night followed by a stage show. Twice a week the vendors come and set up and you can buy things with them. Make sure you barter with them. They start high, but trust me, walk away and they'll come down in price, considerably. The food was fine. I wouldn't recommend the hamburgers, they may be shaped like a hamburger, but they don't look or taste like one. Didn't matter to us, we can eat a hamburger at home any time. All the other food was good and plentiful. You could eat all day long if you wanted with a wide variety. Fresh fruit bar on the beach was a nice added touch. As for drinks, they too were plentiful. Our only complaint there was the number of bartenders manning the various locations. Each had only one to a station and for the most part, this wasn't an issue or a problem. It was annoying by 4:30 in the afternoon when everyone had had enough of the beach and decided to start quenching thirsts at the same time. One bartender at the end of the pool where people could sit in the water, just wasn't cutting it. Those sitting in the seats felt they deserved a refill before folks standing in the back could even get their first. We just got out of the pool and went around to the other side where there was another bartending station available. Won't bore you with any more writing. If you are going to Punta Cana, I would recommend this hotel. For the money, you can't beat it. After walking the beach and seeing the other hotels along side it, they all looked the same and I'm pretty sure, you will get the same type of food, service, room, and entertainment at any of them. I would also recommend checking Vacations to Go as they gave me a cheaper price than I got going directly to Sunscape's web site by a few hundred dollars.

<Content>An outstanding resort!!! We had the most wonderful vacation at the Sunscape. Last year, we stayed at the Allegro (next door to Sunscape). As my wife and I walked the beach, we continually commented that it looked as if everyone at Sunscape were really having a great time, and that we should try it sometime. Well, that sometime was this year and believe me, we can't wait to go back next year!! The staff was simply OUTSTANDING. I know most people say the staff was great, and so forth, but I'm here to tell you...I have never been as impressed as I was with this resort. We truly hated to see the end of the week show up!! Some of the staff were near tears when we left.....that's how much we impacted them, and they impacted us. My favorite was the piano bar!!!! Dave on keyboard was so much fun.....we karaoked almost every night until the wee small hours of the morning. We took our daughters (19 and 16) with us this year, and they had a blast, too. We met some folks from St. Louis and North Carolina and spent the better part of the week partying with them. The food was excellent, the service SUPREME. The rooms were great...very comfortable and clean. Trust me....if you want to have a great time, the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand is the place to go....we'll be there again next May!!!!

<Content>Great coming in, bad leaving We had 11 people in our party, my son's wedding party on July 26th. Upon arrival we were treated like royalty, everyone was made to feel welcome. The concierge at the hotel was excellent. She did extremely well with the wedding party. The photographer was excellent, as were his assistants. One lady in particular did a great job handling the small children who were part of the wedding party. The all-inclusive aspect of the vacation was terrific, and Apple Vacations, with whom we booked with, did admirably well helping us with some of the do's and don'ts of local custom. The weather was wonderful, very hot and humid, but you expect that if you go that close to the equator. The food was very good, and the shows and entertainers all worked very hard to provide a great experience. The rooms were just average, one couple in our group had all kinds of trouble with their room, from having no lights to no water when a water line broke. In our room we found these tiny ant or spider type creatures that seemed to be attracted to moisture, if you didn't discard a plastic cup that had something in it, the next day or later the same day you would find these small bugs crawling all over it and the table it was sitting on. The rooms were not very sound proof so we could hear everything that went on all night long, doors slamming, people talking or running up and down the halls, and anything loud outside.. Also, I know you don't go on vacation to watch tv but the tv service in the room was poor at best. They advertise sattelite but there are only like 15 channels, and the main network feeds came from New York, so you couldn't even get weather reports for your area. It should have at least been from the network stations in Miami considering the location. When we arrived, we were advised by the apple vacations rep. not to do certain things or take part in activities that they didn't approve of because if something bad happened, we would not be covered by their travel insurance. However, the excursions and activities apple recomended were very high priced, as was everything you would want to purchase there. When you make a purchase there, you should use USA money, even though the stuff is expensive. On my last visit to the gift shop in the hotel, I used my bank card and I am still trying to figure out what I was charged in US dollars. When I bought the stuff, the charge slip read 2440.2 dominican pesos, and the clerk said it was 78 71 in USD. But my bank hit me for 85 dollars, and an exchange site told me the it should be 83 dollars. So, to avoid the confusion, use your cash, at least you know first hand what you are losing. When we checked in we were told by both the hotel staff and apple to hang on to the room safe key if we took one because if we didn't return it we would have to pay 100 dollars at check out. But they never told us that you have to return the towel card they give you or they will charge you 15 dollars per. They give you a towel card and you take it to a stand for a beach towel, then return it and get your card back. the cards get all wet and wrinkly and the writing on the card, where it says you will be charged if you don't return it, gets all messed up and illegible. Also, the towel booth closes early, before the pool does, so if you stay late you can't return your towel. It seems like a scam to get more of your money, and I had an unpleasant experience on my check out fighting with the clerk about that. He was very rude to us about it.All in all, given my good and bad experiences, I think it was an average vacation. If I go back again, it will be better because I will be more prepared.

<Content>WHAT A VACATION! My family and I(all twenty of us) were on vacation from 7/18/05 to 7/23/05. We had a wonderful time. The rooms were clean, the food was good, the beaches spectacular, the pool a pure joy. There was always something to do, volleyball, horseshoes, bingo, dancing, exercise, Spanish lessons, and much more. If you idea of vacationing was to relax that was available too. The staff at Sunscape Grand were extremely friendly. By week's end they all know your names. My son (17) keeps looking at the website wishing he was back. Resturants were good, drinks plenty. Shows and movies terrific. Great time had by all. We will have memoreis to last a life time.

<Content>Very nice visit! My husband and I were at the Grand from 7/16-7/23. We were in 3130, perfect location, first floor with balcony facing pool and on corner of beach. I, like many of the previous reviewers, was very worried about my trip after reading the several negative reviews, even considered canceling. However, we did not encounter any of these problems. This is a very nice resort. The grounds are very nice and very well kept. The staff is friendly and helpful. Though we speak no Spanish, there really were no communication problems. The food was great at all the restaurants. The person that complained of the buffet not being like it is in the city should probably stay in the city. This is the DR, not the United States! There are drinks and food/snacks available almost anywhere on the resort at anytime of the day (fruit stand on the beach, etc.). They worked regularly to clean this up. There was plenty of entertainment, and plenty for the children (though we don't have children). We went on the Outback Safari which I really liked. This is a great way to see how the people in the DR really live and a fun time. The driver and guide were attentive, knowledgeable, and a lot of fun. Basically, there is as much to do or as little to do as you want each day. We didn't do much in the evenings as we were tired from being in the sun all day, but there was plenty offered. There is a big movie screen and they show a movie nightly before the entertainment. This is a good way to relax. There was a magician show one night that was very good. Though this is all inclusive we tipped and I would suggest so. If you can afford to go on this trip, you can afford to tip. The staff work many hours (most from morning 'til late night) and some for two or four weeks straight until getting a day off, and they work very hard. They really appreciate the extra. Probably the only slightly negative thing I can say is the rooms do need updating. Our sink was clogged so the water took a long time to drain. The water pressure in the shower was bad and on two occasions there was no hot water. Both times we called the desk and that was fixed immediately. We didn't spend much time in the room so none of this was really an issue. Because someone had complained about the rooms being musty, I took a gel odor absorber and this worked wonders. Also, there were tiny bugs on the counter (I don't think this can be prevented because of the location). I sprayed Off on them the first night and hardly saw again. We saw no rats, roaches or any other creatures. Bottom line...the people that complained would probably complain no matter where they were. If you want to go somewhere that is like the US (or your home country), then stay there. Don't go to another country and expect things to be the same and certainly don't complain about things that nobody has control over (seaweed on the beach, which they work to clean up; warm water in the pool, etc.). We haven't been to any other resorts so have nothing to compare to, however, we'd certainly recommend this resort.

<Content>Great Family Vacation We stayed at Sunscape Grand from July 18 to July 25. My entire family, sisters and husbands, son and wife, daughter and husband and my little granddaughter who is 22 months enjoyed a great time together. After reading some of the latest reviews I was a little worried whether we chose the right place or not. We were surprised at how great most of the things were.Room: We had a great room in building 4 on the third floor room 4322. My son and daugher had end rooms which were fantastic with a great terrace facing the ocean and beach these rooms were 4324 and 4224. The rooms were clean as well as the bathrooms. Had no problems with bugs or leaking ceilings. We tipped our maid everyday and received extra towels and extra drinks and coffee which was nice. She was a really sweet person named Maria and truly appreciated our few dollars a day.Beach: Beach was fantastic. There was seaweed on the beach but the staff work very hard to keep the entire grounds immaculate and the seaweed was cleaned constantly all day. We only went to the pool twice because we enjoyed the beach so much. The water was great and the snorkeling was even better right in the area of the beach roped off. We have a lot of snorkelers in our family and everyday they would follow the roped buoys along the small reef within the swim area and had a ball. Luis and Ramon strolled the beach almost all day to serve drinks and we were never thirsty. We also tipped them and they constantly came back to see if we wanted another drink.Food: Food was average. Did not care for the buffet Windows. Went to the Italian Retaurant and food was good but our favorite was the Tex Mex and Beach Garden Grill. Food was very good. We went daily to have breakfast in the Beach Garden Grill and it was great. We got to know all the servers and bartenders there and they treated us like a million dollars. Hats off to all the guys who work Tex Mex and Beach Garden Grill. Excursion: Only went on one excursion. Snorkeling trip with Ms. Sharkey and the Marinarium Crew with sharks and sting rays. Best time ever. Don't miss this, we had a blast.Conclusion: I would definitely go back to Sunscape Grand. Just a few comments that might help someone else. We did take a lot of one dollar bills and tipped bartenders, servers and maids. Even though this is an all inclusive a few extra bucks goes a long way and they really appreciate it. I took $200 in ones and didn't spend all of it. We tried to speak some Spanish whenever we could. They try to help you and by the end of the week we were really communicating pretty good. It's nice to try to speak the language of the country you are visiting at least give it a try but don't make fun. My only criticism out of the entire vacation was the front desk reception. They were very rude when checking in and this was late at night with a 22 month old. Checking out wasn't too bad but I had a manager to check me out so I was taken care of fine. I think some of the people at the front desk should be replaced by the great staff at some of the restaurants, bars and activity centers they could learn a thing or two from them. Lots of activities, shows were good, great kids program and activity staff were awesome. There is something for everyone so you could not get bored. My final comment is this: if you treat the staff with respect you will receive respect. I found some people to be very demanding and rude to the staff and I felt bad for them because they were trying to do their best. My granddaughter had a ball and all the staff were just super to her. She even went on stage at night before the show and danced with the Kids Explorer Club.Thank you Sunscape Grand for a great family vacation and to the people of the Dominican Republic for being so gracious.

<Content>Best we've ever had ! May I congratulate the management and staff! Our stay exceeded our expectations. My wife and I enjoyed the most chilled, relaxing holiday of our middle aged lives.The staff were all pleasant and friendly with smiles never far from their faces.The daily cocktails were an inspiration resulting in the loss of one afternoon due to overindulgence.Our room was both comfortable and clean with plenty of space and the bed was sufficiently large that you could avoid your spouse! (I didn't.)The television caused a dilemma as it was sunny outside and the British Open from St. Andrews was available in English  Spanish.The choice of food was extensive from several on site resteraunts and the qualiy was excellent.Overeating and drinking could be a problem. I've gained 8 pounds and my wife wont admit her weight.The week flew by without us going off the Hotel complex.When we checked out and I went to settle my bill it was nil!What a great value all inclusive! We'll be back!

<Content>Feels like home I have now stayed at Sunscape 4 times and have never had a problem.The people are the most wonderful I have ever encountered at any resort I have ever travelled to.  For the record, in all of my visits, I have NEVER seen any rats on the premises, NEVER seen any cockroaches in my room, NEVER had any reptiles, rhodents or insects of any kind. As for the food, if you go in with an open mind and remember, you are not in North America and the food will not taste the same, you will be fine.Windows has many varieties of food every night. As for the person who could not find any vegetables to eat, you must not have looked too hard because they are at almost every station. Of course there is seaweed on the beach...it is an ocean! The crew tries extremely hard to keep up with the removal, and it is appreciated. When you are going on vacation to a third world country, you must learn not to expect the same quality as in Manhattan. The staff is why I return again and again. Milton at the front desk is the most attentive concierge ever. Gloria and Chocolate at the backstage bar are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. The entire animation crew is awesome! They will go out of their way to make sure you are having a great time (even if that means LOWERING the music down). They are never pushy, if you do not want to participate in the acitivites, they leave you alone.  I will not hesitate to go back to Sunscape, it feels just like going home!

<Content>Sunscape Punta Cana Grand: What a beautiful vacation!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand from June 18th to the 23rd. We had a wonderful time! The resort is a mix of families and couples; it is not a wild, crazy, party place. We are both in our early 20's and had a great time! There was always something for us to do, or a place to just sit and relax if that's what we wanted to do. The reviews worried me about so many things, but I was not disappointed once down there. The restaurants are great, however you are not in America, keep that in mind. Things are not made the same there as they are here. The buffet was really good, as well as Da Mario's. Omelettes every morning, and a steak almost every night! One night they had an outside buffet by the theatre, the food was good there as well. We sadly missed the beach buffet, as we left Thursday afternoon. You never had to get up at crazy hours in the morning to 'reserve a chair.' There were plenty for everyone. We were in building 3, third floor and had no problems with bugs, damp sheets, or funny smells. Sure if you went out on the balcony, there were some ants, but what do you expect being OUTSIDE?! There were certainly no rats anywhere. I don't know what these other people are talking about. The staff was amazing, you saw them early in the morning, and late at night doing something else. They were always there to help you as quickly as possible with anything. Our favorite part of the resort was Juan, the pool bartender. He had new drinks for us before we were halfway through the ones in our hand! The Coco-Loco's were the best!! The little sandwiches by the pool were a nice afternoon snack. The pool was warm sometimes, but you are right next to the equator, it happens. The beach never smelled like gas, and didn't have a lot of seaweed laying around like some have said. It was fun to barter with the people in the huts on the beach. They can get pushy, but all you have to do is say no thank you.One word of advice I would like to pass along is.....do not book through Liberty Travel!!! They were not helpful or accomodating to us AT ALL!!! We ran into so many unnecessary problems because of them. I will never again use that travel agency, and will warn anyone I know not to as well. I cannot wait to return to Punta Cana, and I will definitely go back to the Sunscape Grand!!!

<Content>Go Jamacia Dave! Just sat here and read some of the past reviews - doesn't sound like we were in the same resort! We found no: rats, roaches, mosquitos, mold, mildew and neither of us got ill. What we did find was a beautiful resort with well kept grounds. Our room (building 4) was very clean - we even spied the maid up on the sink cleaning the overhead light fixtures. The fridge was well stocked and when we asked for more diet pepsi - it was delivered to our room. Maids were very friendly. We had a wonderful plane ride in - a little wait at the airport due to a taxi strike but they had it cleared up shortly - some mix up over when the bus would come but it wasn't bad. Friends reported that their tv went out and they got a free bottle of wine for their troubles.We went to the Maya Riveria last year and stayed at sunscape which was a 6 apple. Other than the food wasn't as fancy here - we felt it compared very favorably with Mexico. Service is a little slower but as the local joke goes - you are on Dominican minutes not American! Slow down and enjoy yourself. My husband speaks NO spanish and I very little. We had no problem being understood or understanding them. We met two other couples(from Pa and NJ) and we all had a ball. Met a newly married couple from Germany, some girls from Pa, a family from New Jersey - talk with people and have fun. The couple from NJ had come last year. Since they had come back - they had robes and slippers and other perks for them and their name was in the daily activity sheet as returning.  Gloria the barmaid at the main bar was fantastic. She remembered all our drinks and did so for days. Drinks were very good and we asked for 151 rum which we got (sometimes got even though we didn't ask for it). She is very friendly and did a great job. The waiter at the beach was very good and was around often. The beach was beautiful - could use a few more cabanas but we just parked ourselves by a small palm tree and sat in the shade of it - just wonderful. There was such a nice breeze blowing - it didn't seem horribly hot. When we felt we had enough sun for awhile - we just went into one of the eating establishments. Yes - there was some seaweed - so what - it is the sea. They came and cleaned the beach every day. Not sure if I'd want to take young children as the Europeans at the beach seemed to think it was ok to go topless - in the water, up to the restaurants (not allowed in topless thank heavens) but if you don't have young kids - no problem. The water was beautiful, the sand was great - didn't need beach shoes as very smooth with no rocks, the big kid had a great time climbing on the iceberg. The shows that the workers themselves did were very funny and entertaining. Are they New York quality? Of course not - but very entertaining. But the highlight of the entertainment was Jamaican Dave. Go to the piano bar on the nights he is there for a wonderful time but ONLY IF YOU CAN LAUGH AT YOURSELF! This is definately x-rated. He is a gifted musician and we had a great time the 3 nights we went to his show. The crowd makes the show so the nights that there is a good crowd that wants to have a great time and will participate were great. The last night the crowd was blah so wasn't as good but it wasn't due to Dave. If he asks for 4 guys to go on stage - GO. It's a good laugh and a good time. Never in my wildest dreams would I think that my husband would get up on stage and sing - and sing Bob Marley - but he did - all 3 nights. The bar (Umbrella's) also had Jose Cuervo and top shelf liquor. If you go and see Dave - tell him that the white rastafarian from WV says hey!We found a great variety of food at the buffett. Calamari very frequently, something for everyone. We enjoyed trying the native dishes (pureed green bananas, yucca, name, etc.) Very good salads and wonderful avacado salad. Try the ice cream. Very good - especially the rum raisin and mango. Tex-Mex and Italian very good. The crab and olive pizza and the seafood pizza at Garden's rest. were very, very good. The Banana's flambe was also great. Beautiful deserts and wonderful coffee. Try the Coco Loco, the Miami Vice  Banana Mama. Heaven (espeically when made with 151 rum). The fruit stand at the beach had wonderful coconut, mango, papaya etc and the buffet always had fruit. Try the watermelon juice at breakfast. The shops beside the beach. Don't be intimidated - have fun. We liked number #2 (ask for Mario) and #5 (Danny Boy). Never, ever, ever pay full price. The more you buy - the better discounts you get. You should be able to get t-shirts for $6- $7 (they try getting $18) - even for Xtra large. Children's $3-$4. We got rum for $7.50 a 5th and 1 pound bags of coffee for $5. Nice long wrap for $10 (the guazy kind not the cotton ones) - hand made photo alblums (the large size) for $15. Wish someone would have told us the prices to expect. We did better the longer we were there. If you don't get the price you think you should - walk out - they will generally come down unless you are really out of line. If not - try one of the other stalls. The girls at the first stand do a great job with hair beading and braiding and are very interesting to talk with - take them non alcoholic pina coladas and bottled water - they are very grateful. They ride the bus 1 hour and 50 minutes one way to get to work each morning (around 9:00 a.m. or earlier) and get home 9 or 9:30 each evening - 7 days a week. The one girl has 2 children. Talk with the natives. Jewelry - most of the shops have the cheap stuff but some (shop #1) has better stuff locked in the case. Couldn't get them down past $28 for the larimar bracelet but probably worth it.Although we didn't have kids - they seemed to do a good job with them. Esperanda (I think that was her name) seemed very good. The kids we saw ran to get there in the morning. They had free horseback rides one day, had burro rides, did activities and got on stage each evening. We had a wonderful time. Maybe we were just out to have a great time but we felt the place was GREAT! (p.s. - go to the Managers Cocktail - very nice)

<Content>great little spot... My finacee and I stayed at the Grand and had a great time. Most of the families that were there were busy scheduling day trips set up through the resort while we spent the day at the pool or beach. I had never been to the DR before and I want to go back tommorrow. The Grand is always on the move, from the staff and their organized events to the waiters to the grounds crew and house keeping yet through it all we easily managed to do very little at be waited on for the entire week.We would grade the food as exceptable with our best meal being at the Itailian restaurant Da Marios. Niether of us experienced any discomfort and did more than our share of eating and drinking. There are plenty to keep the kids busy and enough seclusion for the adults. Movies, dance shows and a stand up comedian from the US kept our nights filled until we were just too tired to go on.One caveat would be to bring everything that you need with you as the gift shop is way over priced and beware of the merchants...if you do not put your foot down in the first second of their pitch...they have you, for a lot of pesos.

<Content>Not too bad, but not too great either My boyfriend and I stayed here July 18-22. You get about what you pay for I guess. I didn't have a terrible time, but I wouldn't really recommend it to my friends. I'll try to do this in sections...GROUNDS: The beach was pretty. We never had problems getting chairs mid morning. I'm not about to get up at 7 to resereve a chair. I like to sleep in. Getting chairs in the shade was a tad more difficult. There was a bit of seaweed the 1st day, but Emily had just passed by. Not much you can do about seaweed. They cleaned it up well. We actually walked north on the beach and the other resorts there did not as good of a job cleaning the seaweed. The marina next door wasn't a problem. I never smelled any fumes. The pools were nice. They were on the warm side, but it is July. The area around the swim up bar was a little iffy, It looked like it could use some cleaning. However, Juan makes a mean drink at the swim up bar. Ask for a Juan Special! The adult pool was never crowded and seemed a little cleaner. The Hot tub did not. It also was no hotter than the pool water. It only bubbled. There is also a small bar at the adult bar.FOOD AND DRINKS: I've been to 4 other all inclusives in the Caribbean, and the food here is very mediocre. You aren't going to starve, but the choices are limited. Many of the foods are repeated at different restaurants. For instance, the pasta they served at DR night is the same pasta at the buffet and at windows. The fajitas at the tex mex restaurant are also served at the lunch buffett. They serve the same medallions of beef at every resaurant, just with different sauces. If you find yourself liking any of these, you are in luck. There is always the standard eggs, bacon and waffles at the breakfast buffet. The salsa at the texmex is pretty good, and they also have it self serve at the main bar by the pool during the day. The bars serve local brands of liquor and only one local brand of beer. It's presidente from a keg, and it is cold. My boyfriend liked it, but I didn't. If you look hard you can find some standby liquours. I saw Tanqueray, Jack Daniels, Stoli Vodka, and Bacardi Limon (until they ran out) When you go to Demarios they will give you a wine list for wines you can purchase by the bottle. They do not tell you that there is also a house wine by the glass that is not extra. We heard another couple asking. The red wine was suprisingly good. I can't say the same for the white. Also when you go to Demario's and The Tex Mex, which are the best restaurants, be prepared to be hot! I know you are in the Caribbean, but let me tell you. .. It takes a lot to make me uncomfortable, and I was past that. They don't open the windows in those 2 restaurants for some reason, and there is no breeze. The american grill is always breezy and cool, and the buffet is air conditioned.ROOM: The room was standard. The air worked great and there was a ceiling fan. The bathroom was fairly large. The mini bar has various drinks, and if you leave your empties by the bar, they will restock it. The main problem with my room was the noise factor. I'm a flight attendant, so I've stayed in my share of hotels, and Im used to noisy hallways. This hotel was the worst. I guess it's the layout of the bldg. The halls are open on both sides and are tiled. Every sound is magnified greatly. On the 1st day I was trying to nap, and I got up to check the door because I thought it must have been left open. The 2nd day, I heard what I thought was a small elephant, but it was only a 5 year old. (I know a 5 year old can probably sound like an elephant on occasions, but at this time, she was being good) The maids are on no schedule either, so there always seems to be commotion in the hallways. They aren't exactly quiet in their duties either. AIRPORT FEES: We paid $10 each on arrival for tourist cards, and were told if we lost them we have to pay $10 again on departure. Then we were told it was a $50 fee to replace the card. Luckily we kept up with the cards so we never found out!! We weren't charged any fees to leave. Apparently most tickets to and from the US already have a fee included. Check with your airline if you aren't sure. The Transportation guys that dropped us us off reminded us not to pay anything, so I guess there's a problem with people getting charged when they are not supposed to!SUMMARY: Everyone spoke enough English for anyone to communicate with them. I still tried to talk in Spanish and learned some pronunciation! I never took Spanish either, but I had no problem. Also here things aren't always as advertised. Many restaurants have marked on their door and in your room guide book what nights they are closed. They don't exactly go by this. Also one night we were to have a beach party and they said all but one restaurant would be closed. The beach party never happened and all restaurants were open! It wasn't so much of a problem as it was comical! They blame it on Domican Time. Two things really bugged me. One was that on severeal nights they had vendors set up on by the pool area in the middle of the resort. I felt like I had to go through through an obstacle course of attackers to get to the buffet. I said no politely but the next one would jump out in your path with the offer of a deal. Now if you want to buy something this is fine. I just wanted to relax and not buy anything. There were several people buying like crazy, so I guess it just depends on what you like. You could always walk around the pool to get to the buffet. The other thing that bugged me was the charge I received when I checked out for the use of my phone. In the book in your room they tell you that even if you use a calling card you are charged for minutes and to avoid confusion, use the phone at the front desk. When I went down there they told me I had to use the phone in the room Ok. So I did I made 2 short calls with my calling card to my dad and 2 local calls to a transportation company to arrange pick up from the hotel. I was charged $22 for these calls. I think that's a little much, but when you have to get in touch with someone what are you going to do? Then when our transportation had not shown up 20 min after our scheduled pick up we asked the front desk if we could call them. They told us we had to go back to our room to call because there was a fee. This maDe me laugh since I had just paid a ridiculous fee, and had just checked out!! We told them that our transportation was late, and he laughed and said Dominican Time give them a few more minutes I'm all about Dominican Time, but I don't think my connection in Miami cared what time I was on!! Luckily the van showed up only 30 minutes late and we made home safe and sound with tans and hangovers!! ON A SIDE NOTE: If you like the Domincan Republic, I think you would love Negril, Jamaica also. So far I have like Jamaica the best out of all my Caribbean holidays.

<Content>Did not enjoy!!! A group of friends and I went this month and we would not go back ever! The food was odd and we all ended up sick at one time or another. The facilities were old and run down. We have been to other resorts and this does not compare! Our rooms were dirty. The ceiling leaked and the bugs were bad also. I was so upset and disappointed with the entire package. All activities, etc were closed by 6:30 p.m. The night life was not exciting after the second night there. People saved chairs and you could hardly ever get any shade! The pools were almost uncomfortably warm by mid afternoon. The adult pool was not clean at all. The one positive of the trip was Luis at the adult pool. He was fantastic. Juan at the swim up bar was not impressive at all.

<Content>My experience I could go on and on about the expereinces I had in Punta Cana and at sunscape. But I won't bore anyone with the details....you can only experience it for yourself and have a good time. There seems to be something at teh hotel for everyone. Lots of activities, day and night, kids and grown ups. Theres lots of places for quiet relaxation. Lots of places for gaming and socializing. The staff is outstanding; friendly, helpful, above and beyond. Loved that they deliver a Miami Herald to your door, and love the Sundial, the bulletin they delivered that informed you of the hotel's daily activities. I have my complaints, but i just laugh at the them, because i had such a great time that they dont even bother me. First off, what i feared worst....my boyfreind and i got sick. dont know what from. The fried fish? Brushing our teeth with tap water? Too much sun? The adjustment? I dont know. It doesnt matter. We threw up, got better, and continued to have ourselves a good time. Our phone broke. We told them our last night there, so they never got around to replacing it before we left. Big deal. Our room wasnt ready when we first arrived. We arrived really early; check in wasnt until 3, we were there at 10 30. We got the next room available, in building 5, on the third floor, beautiful ocean view. The beach had sea weed.... but it is the ocean afterall.The adult pool water is warm. It sits outside all day. The sun is hot. My favorite aspect of my vacation was teh Saona island trip. First you drive through Punta Cana, Higuey and arrive in Bayahibe, where you board a speed boat that takes you to your catamaran. You can drink, dance, lay in teh sun, or do wahtever, for the catamaran ride to Saona island, which lasts about, geez i dont even know, a while. Maybe an hour or so. Then you board a speed boat teh takes you to the island. OH MY GOD! BEAUTIFUL! No hotels. Its great. The water is so crystal blue. Theres lots of palm trees, lounge chairs, picnic tables and hammocks. You stay on the island for three hours. You can swim, play volleyball, listen to music, dance, drink as much as you want, and eat. The food we ate on the island was the best food we had while we were on vacation. It was the best barbecue i ever had. They make chicken and pork chops, loster tail, two kinds of spanish rice, green beans and potatoes and they have a delicious fruit spread (pineapple, mango, papaya, cantaloupe). After the three hours are up, you get back in a speed boat and head ff to a spot in the ocean where there are star fish. You can get out of the boat and swim and check out the star fish. After about 20 minutes you get back in the boat and vruise along the coast until you get back to Bayahibe. Then you can buy a bottle of rum with your picture on it, (they took yuor picture before you left) We paid 10 for ours. You can buy all kinds of stuff here. You can go to the bathroom and/or change your clothes here. Give something to the bathroom girl, please. Then you load back on the bus and ride back to Higuey where you can get out and stretch and do some shopping in a pretty successful local business. You get to see some beautiful country side, some intersting town life, and the most idylic coast line. Someone's review said that alot of the time was wasted on the bus. I loved the bus ride. We got out of the resort and got to see Dominican towns from the comfort of our air conditioned bus. It was really interesting. Theres plenty to drink from beer to rum to water. Our tour guide, Raymond, was great. He really made the trip fun and interesting. I really recommend this tour. It was a more pricey excursion, i forget exactly how much, more that 70$, but i think a good value for an all day trip, from 7 40 am to about 6 30 pm, and teh day flew by becasue iw as having a blast. You can hang out the the other tourists youre with and get t know them, or you can break away from the group and find a nice romatic secluded spot. You can ask any questions you have about the DR, and get to see more than the resort. TipsBring a hat. I didnt, but im glad my boyfriend brought an extra one. I never wear hats, and i never thought i would need one, but the sun is so powerful that sunglasses didnt cut it for me. Bring peroxide or some kind of disinfectant for cuts. Bring lots of sunblock. I mean lots. i had to reapply at least every hour. Use the bottled water when brushing your teeth, better safe than sorry.Dont over indulge on anything...food, booze, sun, ocean....Don't be condescending when you speak to the staff in spanish. Dont make up spanish words by adding an o on the end of a word. (Ei: Water-o, or El Beer-o. Arent some people wild?) Do not reserve a chair in the shade with a towel and assume its fine to go off to eat, drink, shower, watch a movie, play shuffleboard, and have a massage. Someone like me is likely to toss your towel aside when you don't come back after three hours. Plus, why contribute to such obnoxious behavior?Tip. They deserve it.Relax, its the caribbean, pretty much nothing is THAT serious.

<Content>Pretty Darn Awesome! OK! So let me start by saying that before we left for our trip, I hounded this website in search of as much info as I could gather. Advice: Don't think about things too much and just go with the flow! Otherwise you'll be analyzing things the whole time you're supposed to be relaxing. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sunscape Grand from July 1st to July 5th. We are both 24 years old and very much in love...Therefore, we pretty much have a blast no matter what we're doing as long as we're together! That said, I will break it down for everyone. THE BEACH: is amazing! I have been to Hawaii, but never the Carribean, so just seeing the water was a treat for me. Crystal blue! We always got a chair on the beach. And if we needed a break from the sun, we moved under one of the many cabannas. The palm trees are picturesque. I bought two beautiful necklaces at the tacky stores on the beach. Yes, they haggle you...but I've traveled all through Europe and it's the same kind of thing. Have some common sense and just ignore them if it bothers you. We actually brought our own towels with us, but did use the hotel ones a few times. No problems at all. EXCURSIONS: We did the Saona Island trip one day. It was cool, but I would not recommend it as it takes all day and half the time you are on a bus. If you crave CRYSTAL CLEAR water, then go on this tour. The buffet they served while on Saona Island was gross though! And there was no bottled water, so I was strugglin with the sun and the acholohol consumption. To be honest, I would have rather saved the $80/person and just chilled on the Sunscape Grande beach. Unless you are there for more than 7 days, I recommend going on the half day trips. The snorkeling trip with Mr Sharkey and the Marinarium crew was awesome! Definitely worth it! And you just have to walk down the beach to get to where the boat leaves from. Amazing time! After we snorkeled, the boat took us for a ride and stopped in the middle of the ocean at a sand bar. AHH! Bob Marley blasting while swimming with my honey in crystal blue water! They even brought around beer and cocktails on floating trays. Amazing! The POOLS: were cool, but the beach is more our thing. The adult pool was nice to wind down with at the end of the day. The FOOD: I am quite picky, as I don't eat red meat and don't eat milk products and am conscious about carbs/fat/calories blah blah blah. I had to let that go though. Basically, I stuck with the pizza and fries at the beach garden. Oh, and the tuna salad wasn't bad. The fruit is amazing either restaurant you go to. Windows was awesome for an omelette and coffee in the morning. Otherwise, I think Windows is nasty-(I hate buffets though.) The Tex Mex was pretty darn good. I stuck with the simple cheese quesadillas. Da Mario's was awesome. We went there twice. The chicken was on par with a typical chicken dish at a resaturant in Manhattan. The pasta is different, so it was a little weird. But it did the trick. Service at Da Mario's is awesome. We tipped constantly throughout our trip. Two bucks here, a five there. The GROUNDS: Fantastic. So cool! Well groomed and clean.I would recommend this resort if you want to just chill out on the beach and enjoy the surf and sun. If you want a lot of nightlife and a lot of people, this is not the place for you. NIGHTLIFE: I was totally into it. My boyfriend was not though. He thought the shows were lame and the disco was cheesy. I thought it was cool though. The thing is, we drank a few beers/mixed drinks throughout the day, so I didn't really want to drink at night. If I had, I would have had a great time at the disco/Cigar Bar. We did go to the casino one night. It was fun! I watched my boyfriend play black jack and roulette.Oh, and the ROOM: was great! I recommend building 5, top floor. I disliked the way that everything felt damp all the time--your clothes, your skin, the sheets. It did not make for a romantic atmosphere when you're always a little damp and smell a little different. But totally no big deal. Oh, and one last thing. And this is a bad note...well, I hate to say it, but we did see a rat while we were there. It totally bugged me out bigtime. It was bigger than any rat I've ever seen in NYC. It was the size of a kitten. And it was wet and looked sick. Ugggh. My boyfriend tried to convince me it was a breed of mongoose, but then we asked one of the staffers walking by. My boyfriend told him in spanish that we wouldn't be mad, but what exactly was this small creature. The staffer responded: Oh...Ratton! Ewwww! But sometimes you just have to let things go. Whatever, there are rats all over the world...especially in island environments. We saw it over by the adult pool in the evening time. If I had seen more I would have really bugged out. But then again, we also saw iguanas and lizards everywhere...it's all about your perception. You know what though? On the plane ride back we heard so many people complaining SO much about the hotels where they stayed. Saying they got food poisoning and that the service was terrible and no one spoke english. We felt like Sunscape was definitely the best choice. Unless of course, you have a lot of $$ to blow...but then you should go to Hawaii or St Lucia or the Greek Isles!BOTTOM LINE: Go to Sunscape. Bring a good book, your sunglasses, a little spending $$$ and some sunscreen. Have a nice, cold Coco Loco while taking in the breathtaking views of the palmtrees and the blue blue water. Then when the alchohol kicks in and you want some munchies...go to the fruit stand on the beach and get some juicy pinapple and bannana. Or stop by the breach garden and get a pepperoni pizza to go and enjoy it on the beach. Overall, RELAX, you're on vacay!!!Questions? Email me.

<Content>Fair not a great as expected We stayed at the Sunscape Grand from July 2 to July 9, 2005 in building 4. The grounds were beautiful. Our room was ok nothing to brag about. I got up each morning about 7a.m to put our towel on the beach under a hut or you would not get one except in the back far end of beach. Beach was beautiful. The ocean water was great. We only spent a couple of hours in the pool one or two days. It was ok but we can swim anytime. The person who braged about Windows Burffet apparently has never been to a buffet in the city. There was no seafood and the service was horrible. I asked for Diet Coke and received it either when I was finished eating or half way thru my meal. They usually forgot and I would asked again. Our room leaked when we had rain, so we put a wastebasket under the leak and went about our way. No water pressure in shower. The shows were ok we really did not care for them. The staff was pretty good friendly and nice. Jackie at the front desk was very nice. The apple vacation representataive named Ceasar was not real helpful. He was great in the presentation but after that you might not want to ask for help. At the beach party the waiter ask if I wanted wine, I said yes. He ended up bringing me a bottle of wine and after the meal he gave us a ticket to sign for $18. So remember everything is not All Inclusive. Some Wines cost. We did not know this and the waiter did not inform me of this. Ceasar said Now you have bought an $18 bottle of wine. I would not recommend this hotel, there might be better ones at Punta Cuna, but we probably will not go back. Different ones we talked to on the plane said the same thing. We did pay an extra $20 to keep our room on the last day till 4:00 p.m. to shower and change in. This was worth it. Other than your room do not expect Air Conditioning anywhere else. Do not go to the free casino. It is a rip. Very small. Table games or 25cent machines. Not much.Cancun is much better. Also take an insulated mug for drinks.

<Content>I had a great time I read some of these negative reviews after having already booked my trip and thought my God what type of dump am I going to? I held my breath waiting to see what was in store for me.I was very pleasantly surprised. the room was lovely, (the mosquitos, liked it too apparently) and the room was very clean. The beds were very comfortable. Often when you go to a place like this you may find stains from visitors past on chairs etc. I found nothing like that at all and after having read the bad reviews I expected that and worse.The food was okay. Now if you're a fussy eater, maybe this isn't the place for you; I am not and I was well fed for five days with no stomach problems. I found the fruit unusally bland ( but I don't think that is the fault of the hotel). The italian restaurant was very good although the portions were somewhat small (but it is an all inclusive so go crazy, order two) the american grill was okay, but it was just a little off the mark. the buffalo wings were actually wings in bbq sauce (very edible, just not buffalo wings) the grouper was excellent. if you're a real tex-mex officianado, this is probably not the place for you. The buffet at windowswas good there is not a large vegetable selection, but you can get all the meat you want. I missed my veggies. there were some, but mostly the focus was not on veggies. overall i found the food to be edible and enjoyable.The service was a little slow, but always courteous and eventually you got what you needed. I had a little problem with not getting back a paper that was mistakenly taken from me at check in, I got it two days later. (but I got it). it took four hours for them to fix my remote (good thing I didnt go there to watch television). I had to ask for a fourth bath towel every time they changed the towels, even though they would take four, they would only leave three. None of it was a deal breaker.The entertainment was good and just that -- entertaining. the spa was lovely -- I had an excellent massage and you could not beat the price. Overall I found this to be a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation.If there was anything at all that was possibly not enjoyable, I would have to say it was the other guests. People can be extremely self-centered and inconsiderate, but you will find that at the very best places too.

<Content>Rats at Sunscape Puntacana Grand The Sunscape Punta Cana Grand has RATS. Read on.... Travel dates June 27-July 4, 2005Monday June 27, 2005We arrived at the Sunscape Punta Cana Bavaro Grand after our 20-25 minute Apple Tour Bus ride from the airport and we had the standard check-in welcome of cocktail  cookies etc, front-desk staff were very friendly in-spite the humidity and heat and the 2 buses that they were trying to check in before us. Check-in did not go as smoothly as we anticipated due to overbooking and rooms not being available on time. Because as we found out much later they were under staff and the rooms were not ready until 5:00 p.m. After waiting 5 hours to get into our rooms we finally got our room keys and headed to our rooms in Building 2 /2308 and 2303.However the rooms had not been cleaned and the bellboys who had brought our luggage up left our bags in the room while we went back down to reception to let them know. Reception apologized and told us to get a bite to eat and the room would be ready in an hour, we said fine, no problems we can live with that. After getting some lunch-dinner (stale Pizza-Tuna, just awful) and exploring the place we went back to the room and it was indeed cleaned as we were promised however the smell of mould/mildew in the room was quite strong (there was mould on the bed covers) and we decided to ask to be moved, as it really was not nice. However we were told that the covers will be changed and that the room would be deodorized due to lack of availability of rooms since they were fully booked. We also encounter remodellers and painters along with a fumigation crew through the week for mosquitoes and rats.After the room was deodorized thankfully there was no smell of mould. Eventually the room was ready and we moved in and unpacked. The rooms were spacious but not half as nice (dated and worn furniture) the bed did not have a mattress and it I only had a box spring and it was very uncomfortable to sleep on. I kept asking the reception desk for a pad for the next three days and no response or any other accommodations were provided it seems that apathy rules in the Grand. We gave our maid a $2.00 and a handful of candy each day, and we found that our room was cleaned first thing in the morning and we usually had our refrigerator stocked (with bottled beer and sodas). You do have to give the staff credit. Thank God for the maid that gave me extra sheets and covers in order to pad my bed.Then it was time to use the restroom and then the toilet leaked and there were ants on the floor. However, these were minor things that could be overlooked after all we thought to be in paradise, lets make the best of it all. Not knowing what was coming and realizing later that we wasted three days of our vacation between waiting lack of sleep and making trips to the desk only to be ignored.We got some dinner later that evening in the Italian restaurant, which was very nice and had a few drinks at the outdoor bar. We went indoor to the Piano bar at about 8.30 p.m. when it opened, however we didn't stay long as the place was small and dingy, the decor was dated and the atmosphere was non-existent. We went back out to the bar outside and took a seat under an umbrella and had a couple of drinks while listening to Elvis, I noticed that most people seemed to be sitting quietly and there was a distinct lack of atmosphere. Even the bartenders seemed to have long faces on them! I also noticed that tipping did not appear to happen as often at this resort as it did at The Beach, perhaps this is why the bartenders didn't look happy. We decided later to visit the night club upstairs in the main building to see what that was like and it was pretty pathetic to be honest. For any English people reading this, I can only compare the nightclub to something out of Butlin鈥檚; it really was a desperate attempt at a nightclub. At this point we decided to go back to the room to see if we could catch a late night movie or something that was at least slightly more entertaining than the nightlife of this resort. As native speakers and even for non-native speakers the experience of going to a different country is to experience the culture, food, people and music. I would have to say that Elvis and Motown along with Gloria Gaynor dominated this resort; Bachata and Merengue were practically non-existent. What a shame. Everywhere you went in the resort it was either Elvis playing at the pool, Motown music at the bar or Rap at the Disco. And this is how it went for the next 4 days and nights we were in the hotel.We decided to go on some tours the Outback Safari and the Santo Domingo Tours they were fantastic and actually made the trip tolerable. Tuesday We decided to do a bit of shopping at Bavaro Plaza and spent the rest of the day at the pool and beach what an experience. The daily entertainment team was virtually non-existent, except when you passed by their building, not like the Iberostar Bavaro where their entertainment team was awesome. I must say that the young man that called himself Minnie- Me was rude and unprofessional as observed by many at the resort constantly flirting excessively with the guest.The beaches were very dirty with trash and plastic bottles washing up from the ocean. The restaurant food in the beach was poor and the drinks were at poor quality I would venture to say that the bottles of rum were watered down before they were served from the bar to the guests. The beach was not what we expected. I have been to Punta Cana Iberostar Bavaro, Riu Palace, Secrets, Barcelo and Casa del Mar en La Romana in the past three years. At Sunscape Punta Cana Grand you have an abundance of seaweed (which yes they are working on cleaning up ALL DAY!) There were boats anchored just off your swimming area and they are servicing their boats and the waste is being dumped as you are expected to use the beach. NICE鈥?Cabanas and beach chairs both at the beach and the pool it just seems like there are not enough at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. All are held by 7am. If you do find enough together you are dragging them to be together and not at your ideal spot. It seems like the staff would discourage this but they do not. The pools were gross. The water was about 90 degrees, it felt like bath water and wasn't refreshing at all. The pools also needed resurfacing, be careful because sitting against the wall will snag your bathing suit. We are divers and found that this was not a good place to dive. The waters are all fished out and the coral is nothing that you can't see off the coast of Florida. BAD if you are looking for crystal clear water, forget it on a scale from 1 to 10 it may be a 6 and please be careful when snorkeling there is too much boat traffic and the owners of these boats are un licensed I came within 1 to 2 feet from being run over. Now there is a reef only minute by boat but when we arrived to snorkel we found the reef to be dead and only a few fish to look at.This is just not the typical Caribbean water we were used to, again, not bad, but definitely not impressive. And you have the seaweed truck driving back and forth, getting stuck in the sand, etc. all day . . . There are also vendors right on the edge of the resort beach, so if you're walking from the resort to the beach you pass them and get harassed. Wednesday We decided to take the Outback Safari Tour. Which I highly recommend to EVERYONE that visits the D.R. Please remember to take some school supplies for the little kids you visit in the school. They are so sweet...Our tour guide was Omar, and except for the old people on the tour, we (with our Los Angeles and Canadian couple) had so much fun. Everyone is so nice and sweet. Omar is so passionate about his country and knew so much. We loved learning about everything, and experiencing everything too. I tried sugar cane! Fresh cocoa and coffee and some kind of really potent wine that is an aphrodisiac!!! The Dominicans are so happy you are visiting them. My favorite part of the trip had to be boogie boarding at Macao Beach -I am sending school supplies to the children come this September. They were so eager to talk with us. On night three upon our return to Building 2, we approached the entrance and heard some loud rustling in the bushes on the left hand side of the entrance. Out of the bushes came about 4-5 RATS and actually blocked our path until they scurried back from where they came. Needless to say, this was not something we expected to see at a resort such as this and to put it mildly, it freaked my friends out completely and one of them was in tears. After the incident was reported to the front desk the person on the phone actually thought it was funny he seemed extremely apathetic to our situation, he told us that the hotel was doing some building work behind our room and that the RATS were probably disturbed. He told us that buildings 1-3 were not normally used because of this building work but because the hotel was exceptionally busy at the time they decided to use those buildings!!! He really didn't seem to give two hoots that we had taken the extreme decision to requests to speak to the night manager or however was in charge in order to make arrangements to leave the hotel early and to incur large costs that we could have done without incurring. He didn't seem to care that most of the guests checking out had complaints. We thought we would have a nice quiet vacation. It turned out to be a vacation filled with slamming doors, kids running up and down the halls, at all hours of the night. Food was good in the restaurants at night but the restaurant by the beach and the continental breakfast were truly a joke. ThursdayThe next day we went on a Santo Domingo Tour and return approximately at 7:30 p.m.  We were not impressed with the food except at the beach party. All of us got sick for a least one-day. We heard this from a number of people on the resort that they also had gotten sick. Not surprising when meat sits in the sun for 3-5 hours before being used.Thursday evening we received a note placed under our door offering us the grand opportunity to move to the Sunscape The Beach on Saturday morning it asked that we be ready by 10:00 a.m. and that on Saturday we would be transported to the new hotel at their expense. We talked it over and went to the desk and decided to move to the other hotel. Yes. Due to rats, roaches, mildew, construction work screaming children because half of the kids that were there were bitten to death by the mosquitoes and were sick from the food they ate. The stench of sewage directly behind our building was horrid instead of waking up to the smell of the ocean one woke up to the smell of human waste.FridayFriday spent at the resort packing and looking forward to a better experience at the Sunscape The Beach. We decided to go to the Spa in order to get a pedicure that turned out to be an unsanitary experience since the employees did not have the proper equipment to do a pedicure such as clean clippers and tools to clean under the toe nails, add to that solutions and disinfectant products used in giving a proper pedicures. Needless to say after the pedicure experience we opted out in having a massage we cancelled it. SaturdayDuring checkout at the Sunscape Grand, I asked to speak to a manager who I was told is the Sales Manager at the hotel and who arranged our return to The Beach. He took about 15 minutes to be located and while we were waiting at the desk for him we were able to overhear other guests checking out making various comments and were extremely upset. They were approximately 35-40 people at check out not one person who checked out appeared happy, some guests were being charged for things they didn't know had charges (collect calls), other guests were being hit with charges for losing their towel cards even though they were never given towel cards at check-in, other guests were being charged for the use of the safe in the room while others in the same group were not. A quick read of the comment book at reception confirmed that other guests had the experience similar things to us regarding their experiences of the resort, although RATS didn't appear to have been mentioned until we wrote our comments! This appears to be the prevailing attitude in this hotel, apathy. It obviously comes from the top management down, as the attitude of staff at The Beach was the opposite, they were proud of their hotel, happy to help you and made sure that you enjoyed yourself. Of course, there were exceptions to this apathy at the Grand and some staff was very nice indeed (the pool guy who does the impressions was hilarious) but it is the overall attitude that I am referring to. I would not go back to this resort ever.I would suggest that anyone thinking of staying at this resort should reconsider and book the Sunscape The Beach resorts instead. Sure its a little further away from the airport (50mins), sure the road out is bumpy, but you'll be glad you did, as you'll have a much better holiday/vacation. It was such a relief to return to The Beach for our final 2 nights.Saturday We arrived at Sunscape the BEACH at 11:30 the rooms were not available until 5:00 p.m. Room 4318Once again we had wasted another day.Since we were told at the Grand that our rooms would be immediately ready upon arrival since we had so many inconveniences while we were there at the Grand. Well that was not the case. Not only there was a huge commotion dealing with the buses coming and going people at checkout and check in and misc. at the busy lobby. We were also worrying about our luggage since the luggage was not properly guarded at all times and we feared since a lot of the pieces of luggage look the same and the personnel does not look after the luggage properly unless you tip them heavily at least that was our impression we decided to speak to the guys and make arrangements for our luggage to be placed in the room outside the luggage area since we saw that pieces of luggage were everywhere and we feared that our luggage would end up at the airport or at another resort. I was told that my room would not be on the third floor and that it would face the pool since it was a deluxe suite that included a Jacuzzi. What a lie it turned out to be. Only to find out that we would not have access to our rooms until 5:00 p.m. because they were not ready and they gave me a room that was not what was promised on paper. I asked at the Grand before leaving what kind of room I would be getting since I had plenty of issues and had wasted a lot of time trying to communicate my concerns for the three of us since I was more fluent in the language as a native speaker. The room I was given at the Beach was located on the third floor and if faced rooms that were occupied by couples that were a bunch of teenagers from Puerto Rico and were extremely loud, drunk and horny as they were having sex right outside my balcony. WHO NEEDS THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL I had it outside my room,The room itself was new and clean but no coffee pot or clock. The beach was beautiful and the food great. The entertainment was nice and we manage to get some descent food after all. But only after much stress and wasted time at the other resort. I feel that my vacation was a stressful and worrisome vacation due to the lack of amenities at the resort and services that should be standard such as a bed with a standard mattress. I feel sorry for the people that wont take the time to write a formal complaint regarding their poor vacation. In my case I work 14 to 16 hour days as a School Administrator and I really look forward to taking my vacations and when I do I feel that I should not go through an ordeal as in this past 5 days spent at The Sunscape Grand at Punta Cana. They were nothing but GRAND. SUNSCAPE GRAND primarily caters to North Americans (ANGLOS) So if you are looking to have a true cultural experience in the Dominican Republic forget this resort because it won鈥檛 happen.The rating of a 5 Gold Apple for this resort is incorrect, I would say it would be more of a 3 Apple rating if that. It should be demolished. Please build a new one or remodeled the existing one.

<Content>A 5* resort ? I don't think so!!! First i would like to say that this was my 3rd visit to Punta Cana. I bought a package for a 5* resort in Punta cana from Travelplan ( Buyers beware ).This hotel is 3* resort.Rooms - Old furniture. Loaded with mosquitos and roaches.Very dirty.Restaurants - Lack of quality and quantity in the buffet. the a la carte restaurants are so so.Swimming pool - Very dirty and needs rebuilding.Beach - Lots of seaweed. Intense smell of diesel ( from the boats parked at the marina wich is nearby.In the day that we have arrived and after checking the hotel conditions my family and a group of 20 portuguese tourists asked Travelplan representative to change to another hotel. They managed to change 3 couples to a 4* resort (punta cana princess i think )with an increase of price of 鈧?60 per couple.I would go back to Punta Cana but only for real 5* resorts like Melia, Paradisus, Catalonia and others.Ps: I kindly ask to the other Portuguese tourists that had the same problem to get in touch with me so that we can make a complaint of Travelpla's behaviour

<Content>No Casino............But Sunscape PC Grand has no casino, but you will be gambling the whole time if you pick this resort! My wife and I just returned 2 hours ago, and I felt like i had been to dining hell and back in the last four days. the resort itself is beautiful and mostly clean, but in no way is 5 stars or 6 Apples like Apple vacations claims. More like a 2-3 if you factor in the food and food service.First, the positives: Close enough to airport (no 1.5 hours over washboard roads like Secrets, which we loved last year), all paved roads. Close to snorkling at the reef, parasailing, beach is awesome, FREE catamarans, windsurfers (which I used) the above people who paid got ripped off by someone. Entertainment, fun, cool piano bar with karaoke wed night. Room nice, clean, great air conditioning (building 4).Negatives: food immediately made me and my wife sick, and I eat sushi, raw shellfish and anything else that hits my plate in the states without a hint of problem. I brushed my teeth with bottled water, and avoided fruits and vegetables , yet still lost two days to the tourista bug. We overheard others with the same maladies, but with the added bonus of vomiting thrown in! Last year at Secrets Excellence, I brought 200 in ones for tipping, and due to the excellent beyond the call service and friendliness, I was totally out by the time the week was over. Here, sadly, I came home with most of it. I did tip the two maids who really did a great job. Everyone else was indifferent or just plain ignored us, especially at the Garden International under the Tex Mex. During the second day there, the roof at the foot of the bed started to leak due to the major storm. I didnt hit the bed, and fell on the tile, so no big deal. The next day, my head got wet while using the bathroom, just to add insult to gastric injury. At this point, we called the front desk,as the leaks were now in two spots, but they never sent anyone over in the next two days. This morning, as we prepared for our flight, the toilet stopped altogether. I tried to turn the water to it on, but we ended up having to use the public bathrooms on our way out. I try to go with the flow, and if you read my review from last year's Secrets Excellence vacation, you would think I worked for them (See July 2004 under Bill F. if its still up there). but after 2 leaks, an inoperative toilet, an indifferent staff and gastric problems, I seriously questions Apples rating system. On the plane back, I sat next to an apple employee who bragged about all the investment his company is making in the area. I have a suggestion. Instead of 10000 rooms, cut it to 5000 and put in a true water purification system and guaranteed American Food Service standards. Why in the world would anyone want to go to someplace that makes them ill for close to 2000? I shudder to think of the vacation I could have had driving somewhere in the states for that kind of money. LOok elsewhere---Sunscape Punta Cana Grand is not worth the gamble!

<Content>Sunscape 鈥?Great Family Getaway My Husband and I had a wonderful time at Sunscape. We visited May 29 - June 6th. We were joined by my parents, sister and her two children (1113). My husband and I are frequent travelers. It is hard to find a destination that satisfies varied vacation budgets, culinary tastes and activities. All-Inclusives have been our savior, and the Sunscape did not let us down. At first we were somewhat disappointed when we saw the beach and the limited equipment available for use. For those use to Beaches/Sandals properties, you may also feel cheated to learn that you will have to pay to snorkel, catamaran, waterski, and the like. The beach at the hotel also has seaweed. They will sweep it up from time-to-time, but it was present in the water, which did not make for the best beach swims. The hotel staff and activities exceeded our expectations. They had a wide variety of activities, for kids and adults alike. There is beach and pool volleyball, pool basketball, yoga, water aerobics, napkin /towel folding - - even horseback riding for the kids on Mondays. There is one big pool, one adult pool, and what I would call a mini-pool rather than a jacuzzi. The big pool has a fabulous pool bar...they keep the drinks coming all day. The kids enjoyed virgin pina coladas. My husband and I drank our fare share of Coco-Loco's. Our weather was perfect the entire week. Only a couple evenings of light rain and clouds on the day of our departure. Late May/ early June also seems to be favorable for vacationing, as the resort was well-attended but not overly crowded. We would place our towels on beach chairs to hold them around 9 am, and that was only because of the size of our group. No need to rush out any earlier than that. Pool mats are available, and some do tend to take ownership but there was always plenty to go around. We also enjoyed the food, and I am surprised to hear of some of the poor reviews. The Italian dining was my favorite. It's the fanciest. Great service. The portions are not large, but by the time you order all five courses you will certainly not leave filling hungry. The Tex Mex Restaurant was also very good. You have to like Johnny Cash, though (it's the only CD they play, again...and again...). I'm not too crazy about buffets, so I skipped it at night. However in the morning, I found them to have a better selection than I expected. I really enjoyed the beach parties too, and the entertainment. It's funny -- most people write that they like the beach parties but don't like the food in the buffet, which I find to be one and the same.As others have said, the rooms are clean but simple. Again, better than I expected. I was in Building 4 and there was no smell of mildew. Do turn down your air at night. I too got a sore throat. The nightly entertainment was great. They have movies right after dinner, nightly shows, and then for those whose have the energy to carry on either Karaoke / Piano Bar or Disco. The entertainers were great, friendly and funny. What I thought was nice was the variety available to the guests.We did only one tour -- Catalina Island - an all day trip, but I would recommend it, as mentioned before the snorkeling at the hotel is not the best. Catalina has an awsome beach, beautiful blue water and lots of fish to see while snorkeling - book thru Luis!Remember to bring cash (US$ accepted, small bills), lots of sunscreen and bug repellant (citronella candels also work good for your room). Beach vendors will barter for US items like toiletries, TShirts, etc.Give Sunscape a try...We did and we now have another week full of fond family vacation memories!

<Content>Sunscpe??? never again we have been in Sunscape from 26 to 27 june. The same day we arrived the same hour we call back the travel agent to change hotel. We were 24 people and nobody have been in a so terrible hotel. This is not a 5* , is 3 * , with terrible and dirty rooms, dirty pool, etc, etc. Only people that never stayed in in Bavaro beache, can say this is a GOOD HOTEL.???? Sunscape NEVER AGAIN ,THANK YOU. Good hotels are: Iberostar, Princess Bavaro, Paradisius, Palladim, Melia, Riu Taino,These are 5*.

<Content>Not worth the money To preface, we'd like to say that we have been to many of the Caribbean Islands and various resorts of all different ratings. To say this place is a 4-5 star resort is very misleading.First, the food might TASTE ok, but it really isn't ok. My husband and I both had digestive problems-and I ususally have an iron stomach. We aren't sure if it was from food, or maybe the ice isn't purified, but we went through some Immodium! The alcohol served wasn't top shelf as others have said, they only had their own rot got brand of rum, and nasty beer. The service is ok, some areas were better than others. The Tex Mex and Italian restaurants had good service, but the American Grill where most go for lunch was very slow. The bars, although we didn't drink that much due to our digestive issues, had good service. the front desk was pretty much worthless---we didn't find them helpful or courteous at all.The grounds were ok. We have seen much better in 3 star resorts on other islands. We came across a rat one evening---yuck! We also saw quite a few dead roaches in the halls where our rooms were located. The beach was nice, but they were much nicer (with less seaweed) as you moved north on the island. The pools were kind of gross. The water was about 90 degrees, it felt like bath water and wasn't refreshing at all. The pools also needed resurfacing, be careful because sitting against the wall will snag your bathingsuit.We are divers and found that this was not a good place to dive. The waters are all fished out and the coral is nothing that you can't see off the coast of Florida.The rooms were ok. We gave our maid a buck and a handful of candy each day, and we found that our room was cleaned first thing in the morning and we usually had our refrigerator stocked (with bottled beer and sodas).You do have to give the staff credit. The shows were nice and they really work their butts off. You see them when you wake and they are still there when you retire for the night. They were also pretty fluent with many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French.We will not return to this resort, and definitely would not rate it 4-5 stars. Others that we spoke with recommended Secrets or Paradisius.We made our own flight arrangements through Pan Am clipper Connection, and really want to sway anyone from this airline. Our flight going to Punta Cana was cancelled and we ended up losing a day at our resort. Our rescheduled flight going there was delayed, and we were switched to another airline to get us to our connecting flight. Our flight was cancelled when we were coming home as well, and we ended up flying on another airline into a different city and renting a car for the 4 hour drive home.We are so happy to be home.

<Content>we all had a good time but My husband and I and our two sons, with five other family's twenty in all, spent seven days at the Grand. The hotel is very nice and the grounds are beautiful. We all were a little upset with the rooms. The bathroom in our room had a bad smell, even though I know they cleaned every day. the rooms needed to be redone, they looked very worn. We did not complain because we were out most of the time.The bar service was great, and the people are very nice and try there best to make you happy. We all had a massage which was great, highly recommended. Kids had a great time. There are games on the beach and they all loved the pool. Piano bar the best and the disco is fun. If you like snorkeling, go see Tootie fruitie on the beach were there are flee markets.He charges about 15 dollars a person but what a great trip. Do not sign up for horse back rideing, the girl walks around the pool with pictures.It was a nightmare.If food is important to you you may not like it here. All of us were on mostly a liquid diet that week. Only at the beach party was the food most enjoyable. And all of us could not understand. All week long we did not see one ripe tomato, they were all green, and the lettuce for salads was warm iceburg almost runny. But at the beach party we ate red ripe tomatos roman lettuce, fresh cheese, great veggies. Why only on one night ?, if they did this all week long it would be fabulous. I guess you only get what you pay for. If you are planning a trip here i would only go for 4to5 days, you run out of things to do. This resort is small. Would we go back? No

<Content>Not what we expected at all My husband and I saved for 2 years to go on this trip. With 4 children thats a little hard to do. We booked this trip 6 months in advance and when we arrived we had to wait 1 hour for our room to be ready, we arrived at the hotel at noon. When we got to our room it was the wrong room we had paid for. no big deal we just let it go. We tried for 4 days to contact our children back home and were unable to do so, here our ringer on our phone was broken and when we told them about it they did nothing. Next, the adult pool has no bartender there to serve you, we had to walk all the way on the other side of the resort just to get a drink. Whatever you do dont go to the bank and ask for American money they dont have any? But they will give you pesos but you cant exchange them back for American money. The first 2 nights we were there we had no hot water, that was reported nothing was ever done. When we went to check out after 7 days I was already upset and had tons of anxiety about not being able to reach my children I found out they had left messages at the front desk for me that I never recieved. Then they had the nerve to hand us a phone bill for 3 phone calls 4 minutes a piece that totaled 159.00, NO way in hell was I paying this. If it wasnt for our apple rep helping us and trying to make things right I dont know what we would have done. I will say that it is poorly managed and the money that we spent to go there especially being a 5 golden apple resort was definately not what we expected, we will never stay there again.

<Content>AWESOME Vacation Sunscape Grand My husband and I stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand May 30th-June 6th. We went there for our honeymoon.What can I say, we had an awesome time. We liked that the resort was smaller then some resorts in Punta Cana. Everything was easy access and within short walking distance. We had seen on excursions and read some resorts there were so large, it would take a while just to get to the beach or restaurants.There was always things to do, or nothing to do if you just wanted to relax.We loved the nightly shows. The Monday night show, and the beach party on Thursday night were our favorites. The activities committee were great and very funny. The staff, waiters, maids, etc. were always friendly and always said Hola in passing. Beach was ok, not as tropical as what we had hoped for. The water wasn't clear blue, or green. But, in area's of excursions it was beautiful.We went on the Saona Island trip. It made for a very long day. We left at 7am and returned at 6:30pm. Was nice, but we loved the Outback Safari. Seeing the countryside, the people, how they live, the banana trees, coffee and cocoa trees was awesome and our favorite. We felt it made us truly see Punta Cana and part of the Dominican Republic, outside of just staying secluded at our resort and not really seeing the island. The countryside is beautiful. Got great pictures.The Rooms were fine. They are a little musty smelling, so bring some type of air freshner. You will find all your clothes will smell of it. But, for the price and eveything included it was of no issue.We ate at Windows most of the time, and enjoyed trying different foods.The pool is where we stayed most of the time. Bring at least 15 sunblock. With the sun so very hot, I still got a great tan.Tipping does go a long way. We took a lot of one dollar bills, and used most of them. It does get you preferred service. Not so much as it's the thing to do to get better service. Most of the staff there live away from their families to work, and are probably under payed for what they do.For early risers the beach garden grill is open very early to go get coffee.If you have any questions, please email me.All I can say, we had the most wonderful time, and will definitely go back again.

<Content>perfect and relaxing getaway We just spent 7 wonderful days at this resort. Arrived May 31st and returned home June 6th. This was our first vacation in the Dominican and we were hesistant at first. We are very happy we chose this for our familiy vacation. The resort is beautiful. The grounds are very well cared for. Staff is so courteous and always willing to meet your needs. The food was above average for all inclusive I would say. Windows buffet for breakfast was one of our favorite daily activities.. Our 13 year old son loved the fresh fruit smoothie bar. The beach party on Thursday night is not to be missed. The whole ambience is what the Caribbean is all about. Plan to relax and enjoy!!! The weather was perfect, cloudy only 1 day. Take all of your toiletries and sunblock as things in the gift shoppe are very expensive, (ie: sunblock 18 to 20 dollars a bottle). No one in our group experienced any type of stomach problems. Go to the shops on the beach to get the best prices on stuff,( cigars, rum, gifts, etc.) Offer the vendors much less than they ask, (usually 1/4 to 1/2 of their asking price will buy the products. ) Be prepared you will see a few topless sunbathers on the beach but it is not allowed at the main pool. See Enricho at the beach for any water excursion needs. He will sometimes offer you a better deal. The rooms are nice and clean. Had problems a couple of days receiving our towel and washcloth supplies.. but asked the housecleaning lady and she gladly took care of it, restocked our mini fridge daily with bottled water, soft drinks and beer. Even though tips are not expected, a dollar or two goes a long way.Excellent vacation!! Can't wait to go back!!!

<Content>Simply The Best!!!! Fantastic time, the best what else can I say - well here goes.Travelled to the Dom Rep from May 16-01 June, ended up with an extra day due to our floight being cancelled - what a bonus!Brilliant rooms, we upgraded to a club room before we went however would recommend you actually do this when you get there. Fantastic weather except the first two day where we had a few downpours!Brilliant staff - look out for Gloria and Chocolate at the Bars. If your booking trips, then go through Lewis down at reception rather than your tour rep. They're an american co and we were the first on everything!Look out for Cecile the quad bike man - this was a brilliant tour and did this twice.Bavarao splash - driving your own speedboats and the Souna Islands visits are def woth booking.Good shops in the hotel and Bavaro Plaza only a twenty minutes taxi ride away. More than safe to go here, probably not on your own though.Pools great, we spent most of our time at the adult pool and the beach but would recomend the main pool for some seriously strong cocktails.If your going to the beach walk 10 minutes down the strip to where the orange sunbeds are = less seaweed - however beach cleared of this most days. Restaurants brilliant - our favourite was Windows the buffet restaurant where there was something for everyone. Don't miss the beach bbq on Thursdays or the dominican night on a Monday, however don't sit at the front unless you like to perform on the stage.Movies shown every night at 1930 and excellent for kids with the kids club etc.Spa is worth a visit, an extra cost but the jaquzzi's great for sunburn and stronger than the ones by the pool at $5 per person for 30 minutes.If you like Casinos then the best one is the Tower, great just for a change of scenery and again get the hotel to book your cab. Free admission and free drinks whilst gambling.Try and speak the spanish langauge, however poor that ours was it was appreciated.If we could change one thing it would be that the Beach Garden Restaurant would be open more than just a Tuesday night as this was the best! And be strong with the vendors on the beach if your into bartering then start as low as possible-they will soon tell you their cheapest price!It was the best holiday we have had and met four other couples to enjoy the trip with. If we can go back then we will!Beware we are generally ok with the sun wearing factors 8,4  2, however if your want to sunbathe here then we would suggest wearing factors 30,25,20 and the lowest being 15!A picturesque country with friendly locals and extreme value for money. Do not listen to any negatives re hygiene and tummy troubles, not that we did not exoerience twenty four hours of this however we know this was due to all the pineapple and coconuts in the pina coladas! You'll be a fool not to pick this hotel as smaller than most hence why the service is so great!

<Content>Nice Vacation We returned from the Grand back to the states on June 4th. We had a really nice 7 day stay. The weather was great...it only rained one time and that was at night...although it was a tropical storm I think! Make sure you take bug spray!!!! There were several people who did do this and had major bug bites. We had mosquitoes in the bathroom on a daily basis...but didnt have problems with our room other than that. Make sure to take pool snacks! I paid $5.00 for a bag of Doritos in the gift shop...I was craving normal food.....The food at the resort was good...but there are just some things you can't go without after a few days. Make sure to take a cup of your own so you don't have to keep going to the bar.Do NOT jump off of the Iceburg in the ocean...HAHAHA....somone in my group learned that the hard way!All in all, the resort is very relaxing. I took my 16 year old son with me and my husband...not sure if it's the greatest place for teenagers..I only saw 2 or 3 while we were there. Mostly small children. Very well behaved for the most part though. It's extremely humid!!!!! I'd also advise taking a spray bottle so you can put ice water in it and cool off in the afternoon. The pool get's really warm. Have a great trip! E-mail me if you have questions.

<Content>Great Vacation!!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand from 5/20-5/25. We had a great time. I was a little worried after reading all the reviews the two months before. Most of all I was worried about the rain. It rained the day we got there and then only 2 nights after. We spent most of our time at the family pool. We loved Jose!!! He was great to us, as was everyone else. It was very hot there!!! You have to have sunscreen or you will definately regret it!!!! For our first time in the DR we spent all our time relaxing and enjoying the experience. Food was good especially the breakfast at Windows. Expect to go through a period where your stomach is upset with the food. We brough Immodium and we were fine. We didn't do any excursions, so I cannot comment. But for relaxing and resting it was perfect. The resort was not crowded at all. I think because people were worried about construction. I would not have known about the construction if I hadn't read it on this forum! Don't always believe what you read. Your vacation is only what you make of it, and we had a blast. We stayed at building 5 on the 3rd level and it was beautiful. Hope this helps!!! Well worth the money!!!

<Content>What a Vacation !!! This place is where my boyfriend and I had the most magical vacation of our lives. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous, and helped out with all of our special needs. We loved the fact that there was a 24 hour bar and adult pool that was child free. The spa was even better than the pool and bar, and we intimately got to know every nook and cranny of the pool and massage areas that were seculed behind a fence.A vacation is what YOU make it. We found that the disco, the activities on the beach and the nightly entertainment provided by the resort was not our cup of tea, so instead we took the opportunity be our own entertainment. We met some cool couples and we created our own Plato's Retreat. The beach party was fair. it was the buffet restaurant relocated on the beach to serve you dinner. If you liked eating at Windows the bufffet restaurant then you will enjoy this, i personally just considered it the same buffet food, just now it included flies. We opted for a liquid diet that night. We found that money talks or you walk. Bring lots of $1 bills for tipping. Its amazing what kind of service you get for $2.There was a nicDollar for dollar this is a great vacation. People forget that this is the poorest island in the carribean and when i read other reviews trashing this place, i think the author forgot that they didn't pay for the Ritz Carlton. I couldn't personally expect more for $100 day all inclusive with people waiting on my every need. They staff truly aimed to please, even if it broke the rules.If anyone reading this was here from April 11-18, 2005......You might have seen me at the pool or walking on the beach with the body jewlery that probably caught your attention with the black bottom bathing suit. Everyone that was on the resort that week was so friendly, cool and fun.... i want to say hi, if you didn't get my name.

<Content>Nice and Relaxing at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand We stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand my husband and I from May 25-June 1,2005. We loved the resort. It was a samller resort which required no wrist bands and we loved the fact you didn't have to worry about making reservations at the restaurants. We stayed in building 5 on the third floor with a huge wrap around balcony as we were on the end. We had a view of the adult pool and you could see the ocean. No problem with hot water or the air. There was a king size bed and it was comfortable. There was a mini-fridge in the room stocked daily with bottled water, pop and beer. No problems with that at all restocked daily. We used the fitness center daily it was a nice place to work out as it had treadmills,bikes and some weights. We are more of the beach people so we would start the day at the beach no problem with getting chairs and usually we would get there after 11. The weather was great all week sunny and hot only rained one time in the middle of the night. The main pool was nice had a swim up bar and floating mattresses around. One night we saw some people taking the mattressess to there room. Whatever floats your boat. We never had any problem getting any mattresses. There was an adult pool which was quiet. The only problem was there was a bar but no bartender. There was pop and water set out but if you wanted a drink you had to go get it. I think because the resort wasn't that full which was nice for us. The staff is wonderful these people work hard all day long. The grounds are well kept and beautiful. Kudos to all that work so hard. We had a wonderful vacation. I think it was best that we ever had. I would go back in a minute. We exactly what we wanted to make our anniversary and my birthday special. The food was great better then we thought it was going to be. The beach and domincan night buffets were great. The only problem we had was being harrassed to buy things from the vendors but we just said no thanks and kept walking. The same as on the beach when you walk there is a group of shops and the people will come out and start talking to you. We just kept walking and said no $$$ with us. We did buy a some braclets , earrings and statue of a family which were nice. Don't forget any items as the gift shop is high priced. I paid $8 for a magazine. The sun is really hot bring lots of sunscreen. We came home with nice tans and my husband hair is bleached out people thought he colored it. Overall a wonderful relaxing vacation.

<Content>I miss it My boyfriend and I were there for a week and had the most amazing time. The atmosphere was amazing. We made the best memories of our lives there. We always say we want to go back, and we hope to some day. Besides the beautiful beaches and all the fun, the people here were wonderful. They were all so helpful and kind. It was nice to see such happy and relaxed people...rather than the rush of American life. I recommend this place to everyone.

<Content>Nice place to Relax My husband and I just returned from a mini vacation at the Sunscape Grand and stayed from 5/25 through 5/28 and loved it. I was skeptical after reading the reviews, but I think a lot has to do with the time of year you are there. We were in Building 4 which is a nice quiet building but still near everything. We did not see a lot of children at the resort - maybe 10 kids all of which were very well behaved. Didn't see very many single groups ... mostly couples or families.The room we were in, 4118, was on the first floor and we had no problems with it. You MUST keep the air conditioning on otherwise the room will get very humid, very quickly. The beds were firm but comfortable. I caught a sore throat from the air vents blowing on the bed but we were able to redirect the flow of air...a little too late though.The pool was beautiful and at a very nice temp. Actually, in the afternoon it almost got too warm and really didn't cool you off. I had anticipated not being able to get chairs by the pool after reading reviews, but this was not a problem. We went out at 8:00 am each morning and there was maybe 1 or 2 other couples at the pool and no towels on the chairs. We did then reserve our chairs and then went to breakfast. I also don't think the resort was anywhere near full so this may be a problem when more guests are there. We stayed at the pool all day so I did not see a problem with us reserving our chairs early. Bring SUNSCREEN..sun is very intense and you could get a bad burn very quickly - both days there wasn't a cloud in the sky.The food was ok. We had been to the Dominican Republic before so we knew what to expect. There were the basics at breakfast and always found something I liked at lunch. Since we were there only 3 nights, we ate at the TexMex restaurant which was good, the Beach Party was fun (BRING BUG SPRAY) and the al la carte restaurant (can't remember the name) which was also good. Just watch what you eat and remember, you can't drink the water that comes out of the tap...ONLY bottled water. You don't have to worry about the ice or anthing like that. I only heard one gentleman at the pool saying that he had intestinal problems, but everyone's body is different and will react to the food differently. The only time we were a little hassled was the night of the beach party when some of the vendors set up by the pool and they wanted you to buy their jewelry. Just say no thank you, be firm if they are persistant and keep walking. We brought home some very nice pictures of me and my husband with parrots. Each day, two gentlemen brought different animals around the pool area and take your picture with them. These pictures are on display and there is absolutely no pressure to buy them. They are $6 each.Overall, it was a great couple of days of doing nothing but relaxing and soaking up the sun. Everyone we met was pleasant and greated you with Hola. Jose at the swim-up bar was great and you never had to wait for a drink. Just remember...your vacation is what you make it...just relax go with the flow, and have a wonderful vacation.

<Content>Didn't want to come home!!! We stayed at the Sunscape from 5/24-5/29/05. I was a little leary having never been to Punta Cana but all I can say is it was the BEST vacation I've ever had! First the Aiport was beautiful and the resort was 15 minutes from the Airport. Check in was a breeze and EVERYONE was friendly. We were greeted with a Welcome Home the moment we got there. We didn't even have to lug our bags to the room, they took care of it for us. The resort is very, very well maintained. We could see people working from dawn til dusk on the property. We have stayed at many resorts in Jamaica  Cancun and the food  service for all-inclusives left a lot to be desired so I wasn't expecting much. I was more than impressed with the food, Windows Buffet is not your normal run-of-the-mill Buffet. You had a lot to choose from a Pasta Station, Grill and they had different theme nites, like Mexican nite  International nite. The staff is very attentive. The Tex-Mex restaurant was also very good. There are no wristbands here, if you don't like something at one restaurant, go to another! There was a managers Cocktail Reception on Wednesday, and because we went with Apple Vacations, we also had another Cocktail Reception later that week. They had a Beach Party one night  then a Bar-B-Cue on Friday. O,Yeah there is a minibar in the room they keep stocked with beer  soda  the room service is INCLUDED! We had steak and grilled chicken one night, awesome! Top shelf beverages. The entertainment was also great, karoke was too funny. The staff always has something going on. Bring your own books, magazines, lotions etc. because those items there are 3x as much as you would pay here. Considering it was in the 50's, rainy  miserable in Philly, we picked a great time to go  an excellent resort to stay at.

<Content>Can't wait to go back Just returned from a wonderful week and can't wait to go back. First the negatives, believe it or not were Americans. We met some very nice people but since we were on our honeymoon, we did not appreciate the couple who invited themselves to dine with us or walk the beach. Careful who you become friendly with, they may end up being stalkers! Loved the Outback Safari tour. My wife enjoyed meeting the children at the school. The scenery was beautiful and we learned alot about the island. Did not think it was appropriate for the topless on the beach since there were many children around. Mostly exibitionist attention seekers, lack of class. They should have went to the adult pool. The food was good, enjoyed the American Grill the most. The staff was very nice and eager to please. Did not catch alot of the night activities (we were on our honeymoon!!) but enjoyed the beach party. Take thermal mugs, sunscreen, sunburn gel, hats, comfortable shoes (if you take any tours), and a couple swimsuits. We took lots of dollar bills to tip. Loved the quiet time with my new wife and our nightly walks on the beach. Can't wait to take her back.......

<Content>Great people at Sunscape Grand We returned from Sunscape Grand on May 15th and we had a great time despite the weather. We will definately go back to Punta Cana but will try a different resort with a better beach as that was the primary let down. We happened to be there during a Marlin tournament and the resort is located next to the dock where all the boats come in to. We found the beach to be loaded with sea weed which could have been contributed to the all the boat traffic but it was enough to keep us closer to the pool rather than the beach. We didnt have great weather and actually as the week went on the weather got worse instead of better as we had hoped. I thought the food was excellent and actually the best steak I have ever had!! I loved the pepper steak in the American Grille and I cannot say enough about the staff there!! Hector and Robert at the American Grille are absolutely a couple of the nicest guys we have ever met. Gloria and Matias at the splash bar were awesome and we had a lot of laughs with them. We brought our insulated mugs but never needed to use them because we drank the drinks too fast and they didnt have a chance to get warm! The rooms and grounds were spotless and I didnt find the musty sheet smell that was previously mentioned but we could have just been lucky. All in all it was a great experience and a great value.

<Content>Cozy Resort We stayed at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand the week of April 17 to the 24th. The weather left a lot to be desired as we had about 2 days of sun and cloudy  rainy the rest of the time. Not what you would expect for mid april in the carribbean. The staff was friendly. The food was o.k. and we had no problem finding something to eat at buffets. My biggest gripe was the people staying at the resort. How obnoxious to put their towels down under cabanas and leave them the whole day and not even be there most of the time. Lets face it there was a lack of chairs and esp. in shaded areas. After several days of scrounging around to find lounge chairs, I got up the next day at 7:30 a.m. and couldn't believe that there was only a couple places left without towels. The next day I was up at 7 and again only 2 places left by the pool. This is absolutely disgusting. A year ago we were at Sunscape Casa del Mar and people did just the opposite. When they went from beach to pool they took their towels with them. Something needs to be done about this. Maybe someone should start picking up towels and see what happens when they finally get back late afternoon to pick them up and they are not there. The other thing that was lacking was there is no cover over chairs at show area. We missed 3 shows that were rained out. After about 20 min. of a show it downpoured heavy rain. So much for evening entertainment. You think that they would have some cover esp. with all the sophisicated lighting and sound system. On the plus side, they had shuffleboard, bocce ball, horseshoes and other games to play. There was a big trampoline and Sunscape ice berg to climb. They had a list of various activities but noticed that they didn't stick to the schedule sometimes. And sometimes evening programs got changed like beach party was cancelled and weather was better (no rain) late afternoon and no one knew it was on for next night. I can say that everything is close as it does not take long to get to your room and restrooms are very clean. Hotel room was clean but the furnishings look dated. We didn't mind after all we came for the beach and outdoor activities. Barring a few above mentioned problems and the hotel is not responsible for the weather, we had a good time.

<Content>Sunscape Goes Out of There Way to Please there Guest My husband and I just got back. We have stayed at the Sunscape at least 6 times its always better and better. The staff goes out of there way to please everyone. Because the Sunscape is small there is more of a personal touch. Julio was great at the piano bar and Juan Salsa is all over it in the evening at the Beach Grill. We had a fabulous time and can't wait to go back.

<Content>quite pleasant despite the weather Just returned from stay of 5-13 to 5-20 with my first husband of 26 years. Heavy rains and clouds the first 5 days although the temps were warm. The hotel is very clean and the staff was eager to please. We never had to wait for a drink or meal. The food was average but I discovered toward the end of the week it was my own fault for not trying more things. I thought the main buffet Windows had the best food and I'm usually not a buffet fan. Breakfast was great and lots of fruit offered. Don't miss the Thursday night beach party! I love the size of the resort as you get to know the staff and bartenders. The only beer, Presidente , was good and I am a die hard Miller Lite fan. They also had top shelf liquor. Absolutely no stomach problems with a sensitive eater!There was a prior review regarding musty smelling sheets and I have to agree, however, I believe it is because the storage is not air conditioned. I felt the sheets were clean. On the same note next time I will bring my own fresh smelling lifejacket for the watersports...The grounds, pool and beach were all beautiful and clean. Any room is a short walk away. Bring skid free shoes as the tile gets very slippery. The resort is comfortable and casual with lots of fun quirky things to entertain. This was our first experience with an all inclusive and we are sold on the value of this resort. (note: This is not a shopping destination. The cigars and coffee were great!)

<Content>Excellent We stayed at the Sunscape Grand in Feb, with my boyfriend and my parents and sister. The rooms were very large and atmospheric, however if you want peace and quite you need to get a room somewhere on the outer rim of the hotel. Each room has a very nice balcany, and the beds a nice and confortable. Be wearly of negative reviews of people who rated the hotel poorly because they went during hurricane season, and it rained the whole time- not the hotels fault. Do your homework, and don't go during the off season. Me and my BF are both 25, so I have to say there was not too much entertainment for us, but since this was a family vacation we weren't planning on pulling all nighters. The bar during the day was great, but most people went to bed early. This is more of a family place, with lots of people with little children. Also, if you don't like europeans, for whatever reason, don't come here either. Personally we were looking for a nice relaxing vacation, and that's what we got. The food was great (stay away from the cafe- nothing good there). Don't miss the thursday night beach party, I will never forget it, it was just spectacular. The restaurants are never too crowded, and the food was great. The staff was very friendly, and since it's a small resort they remember who you are. The pool was nice looking, but the water was way to cold, so barely anyone was in it. However you need to get up early and grab a chair by the poor, other wise they fill up.All and all, it was very nice. The ocean is not as nice as some places I've seen, but it's blueish, and very warm. We did the ATV adventure, and it wasn't what I expected, but at least you got to see how some of these people live, so for us it was worth it. Also there is not much tourist stuff here, no old architecture, or much to see. So be prepared to stuff your face for however long your there for, and drink by the poolWord of advise, if your looking for american standards, and your gonna complain about every single little thing (many americans were guilty here), why bother leaving home. Stay in bed, and order chinese good, and let the other wordly people go and have fun....to everyone else, go, enjoy.

<Content>One of our best trips ever We were at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand the first week of May 2005. Everything was spectacular, the food, drinks, service, people, weather, beach, absoultely everything. Rooms were clean and spacious. The grounds were kept in perfect shape. The food was great at every resturant that we ate at and at every meal. I would tell anyone to go there, and we defintely want to go back. Feel free to e-mail us with any questions.

<Content>Loved it! We just returned from the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. We were there from 5/04/05-5/09/05. We had a marvelous time! The weather was great, didn't rain once.The hotel's landscape was absolutely beautiful. The beach was great. They cleaned up the seaweed everyday, which I noticed other hotels on the strip did not. I did have to get up early to reserve a palm hut, which we needed for shade in the afternoon.The food was better than I expected. The only restaurant I didn't care for was the Tex Mex, but my husband did. My favorite restaurant was the outdoor Beach Garden. They had typical American sandwiches, grilled chicken, bacon cheese burgers, clubs, etc. This restaurant is open pretty much 24/7. They also have room service!The drinks were great, but definitely bring insulated mugs. They serve the drinks in 8 oz plastic cups normally, but will make them in any mug you give them. Our insulated mugs kept are drinks cooler and we didn't have to go the bar as often! The beer is Presidente draft, but they have Bohemia Especial bottles in the room.The service was excellent. The people are so friendly!Definitely go to the beach party, it was a blast.We also recommend the sunset horse back riding tour (It was beautiful scenery!) and the parasailing. We had a tremendous experience and can't wait to go back next year!Oh, bring bug spray because I did get bit one night.

<Content>Will never return This is a very long list of problems that occured.....One thing that we thought was terrible is the fact that everyday that we were there we could not find chairs together at the pool or under a hut on the beach. I believe it is due to the fact that people would hold their chairs by leaving towels and other belongings on them. Some of these chairs would be empty for hours. When you pay a lot of money to go on a trip and look forward to relaxing by the pool or on the beach and are unable to even get a chair it is very frustrating. The resort needs to do something to correct this problem. Another big issue that occurred was with a staff member. Because of rain one day we played bingo with a staff member. His name is Rico B. He was obviously intoxicated (we saw him drinking the night before at the disco). He was extremely unprofessional. He made a couple of comments to other guests calling them white boy among other things. Then after bingo was over I asked him if the beach party was still going to happen that evening and he replied Come on, be smart and Use your head referring to it being cloudy. Myself along with the people that I was with were very taken back by this. Referring back to the beach party we were upset at the fact that it was cancelled because it had rained early in the day. The rest of the day was fine. That was on Thursday. We were told it could not be rescheduled either. But then on the day we were leaving (Saturday) they were setting up for it for that night. That was something we were really looking forward to. I also could not believe the way they have these people set up on their beach and coming to the resort 2 nights a week to sell merchandise. I have never been so harassed. I can understand coming across that kind of thing outside the resort, but not in it. It was ridiculous. Then on our final day we were around the pool area when 2 men had a donkey there that they use to give donkey rides. When the donkey would not walk they began to hit the donkey in front of all the people around. They actually picked up my husband's sneaker and hit the donkey on his behind! I got very upset and told them to stop. We couldn't believe it. As animal lovers we were very upset by this! This resort also does NOT have ONE ATM machine on the entire resort. In this day and age I can't understand how a place like that can not have an ATM machine. We ended up having to borrow money from my Mother because we could not get any from our account. They do have a bank on the premises from which we were going to get a cash advance from our credit card. We called the front desk to find out the hours. We were told it was open until 9:00. We called the bank around 5:00 or so to ask if we would receive pesos or American dollars. We were told that she was leaving for the day. We said we thought they were open until 9:00 and she replied Yes, but she had to leave. What kind of service is this? On another day the weather was not good I wanted to have a manicure at the spa. I walked in and about 5-6 women were sitting around talking and I was told it was impossible to get a manicure that day. Then they continued to sit around talking. Service?? We tried to do the banana boat on our last day. Earlier in the day we asked if we needed to reserve it and we were basically told to come back anytime and it should be available. Around 4:00 we went to do it. We were told we couldn't do it that day to come back tomorrow. We told them we were leaving that day and they said Sorry. The rooms are not what any of us considered to be 5 Golden Apple. We noticed one of our glasses having a pretty large crack in it, and that same glass stayed in our room until we left never being replaced.Needless to say myself, my husband, and the 4 other people we traveled with will never return.

<Content>Enjoyed our trip to Punta Cana We just got back from the Sunscape Grand - went the last week of April.The weather was great, people very nice. Having been to several All inclusiives in Punta Cana, Puerto Plata and Mexico this one was average. We wanted a smaller resort and it was a perfect size. I read reviews that the food was bad, that was not the case for us - the buffet could have been better, but certainly something for everyone. We ate at the Italian and steak restaurant twice. We got there around 6:30 and no wait.The Dominicana night and the Beach party on the beach were wonderful, don't miss them. We went horseback riding which we booked where you get the towels. Very very nice!Also went parasailing and snorkeling. We booked through some locals on the beach. If you go over by the shops on the beach in front of the first set is where the people are to do this. I think the boat is called tuti fruiti, they were wonderful, no booking time, just walk over when you want to go. They gave a great parasailing ride and just my family went on the snorkeling so we could stay as long as we want etc.The rooms were fine and clean. We were in building 2, which was very convenient. Yes you can hear the music at night but it over by 10:30-11I would recommend this resort to families especially if you have small kids cause trips back to your room are not far, the beach and pool are close, it really is nice.I would say they should have music at the pool, the action is more on the beach and MORE bartenders - it is crazy to have one at the pool bar.People do save chairs and I noticed people saving the floats in the pool.That was new to a lot of us there. Unbelievable!Enjoy!

<Content>Honeymoon at Sunscape, D.R. My now wife and I set forth to the Dom. Rep. Great time to be had!We were there for 6 days starting April 25th. We didn't know what to expect.We arrived at the airport--smooth transition in. Fast lines. Advice: bring a pen to fill out the entrance paperwork. Got to the Sunscape--greeted with a fruit drink. The room was excellent, but it was on the ground floor with foliage which attracted biting insects. Beautiful view of the adult pool and lounge. The room was large and the bed was ultra comfy. Mini bar was free--beer, soda, orange juice.Advice: get a room on the second floor. The doors have enough room on the bottom for snakes and hermet crabs. We witnessed a snake go into a room--a small garden snake variety.Food: B. Restaurant, Windows, had a large selection of food. The breakfasts were great. We stayed away from the milk products because sometimes they were not on ice. Freshly squeezed cantalope juice was awesome. The mangos were unbelievable. Restaurant, The Italian, was very nice. We went with a bunch of Americans we made friends with and the courses were over all good. However, to be warned, the two people who had the Shrimp Course, had pretty bad stomach problems the next day. The Garden Grill had decent American foods. The orange fried chicken was tasty. 24 hour free room service: they were quick but the food looked and tasted like it was made quick. The chocolate chip cookies were awesome.Note: there is no restaurants open from 4:00 to 6:00pm.Nightlife: A. The piano bar was a great time. All alcohol was included on our trip. Got up and sang to my new wife! The disco looked pretty happening--didn't spend too much time there though. There was a show every night outside. We saw two of them. They were pretty decent. Really funny at times.Bars: A+. Made anything that you could think of as long as they could understand you. All inclusive.Beach: B. The beach was really nice, but they did not have enough shade and chairs for the amount of people staying at the hotel. You had to get lucky in the afternoon to find a suitable seat. The beach was mostly adult but some kids were playing but not horrible. They brought you drinks and you could order them from the beach. that was nice. The water was about 75 degrees--perfect. the seabreeze felt great! Neighboring beaches, while walking past, had dozens more chairs and shade than the Sunscape.We went Kayaking in the ocean! that was easily one the best highlights of the trip. It was so much fun, and it was free.Pools: A. There was two pools; a large pool, more kid oriented, but with a swim up bar. an adult pool, where no children were alowed. That is where we met so many nice people from all over the world. The adult pool felt more free thinking. It also had a whirlpool.Bank on site: Did the job. Could get US dollars when they had them. The first time i went to get extra money, they did not have US dollars but two days later they did.Advice: do not misplace the towel card!!!!!!! it is 15 dollars per card if you lose them or if you do not claim them back from the towel lady and depending on who your check out guy is at the front desk, they will not let you go without paying. Their Fun Activity staff helped us out greatly to resolve the situation. Thanks to them--they are very helpful and will bend over backwards to help. the towel lady all the sudden did not speak english when confronted. The front desk person asks us for 20 dollars per card first, which was suspect. Watch out! This is a country who likes to haggle for price, and some times even the help will be aggressive salespeople. This added a considerable amount of stress at the end of our beautiful stay and this particular desk person did not care. We found out later from a person who was staying there, that they did not have their cards either, but the desk person who helped them let them go with a smile. Just make sure you bring your cards back to check out! Let it be known that no one explains to you that you need to keep the cards for check out.Advice: Do not use the water from the hotel room faucets. They are not filtered.Overall, we will be planning to take another trip to the Dom. Rep. And Sunscape is at the top of the list for all inclusive resorts for us. Chances are we will be back to the Sunscape! A Great over all time. It was a blast!

<Content>Really enjoyed ourselves The resort was beautiful. We walked quite a ways down the beach to see the other resorts and they weren't as nice. Very well kept grounds and small which I thought was nice as you didn't have to walk very far to get another drink, get to the beach etc.The rooms were ok - kept very clean but our room had a broken chair and was a little beat up if you ask me (the woodwork etc..). Also I was disappointed that we had to ask for water etc. as I was under the assumption that our room fridge would be kept stocked.The wait staff was very friendly and helpful (w/ the exception of Juan at the swim up bar - we read great reviews on him here and he was a bit of a sour puss and I don't think I ever saw him smile.) I was very disappointed in the food. Apparently they recently switched cooks and I thought the food for the most part was awful. I didn't like that the juices served for breakfast was warm. The Tex Mex did serve a great filet for dinner though. I would advise to stay away from the seafood and the pasta at the Italian restaurant didn't taste like any pasta I had ever had before - was more like chef boyardee...I got very ill our 3rd day there - not sure if it was from the food, water (we drank bottled water - but I have to wonder about the ice in the drinks) or if it was from the day long drinking that I did of the vodka and lemonade the day before. The first night we were there they had a managers reception at the adult pool. This was very nice - cocktails and appetizers were carried around by wait staff. There was also entertainment - some native dances, a fire blower etc. that I thought was excellent.The couples entertainment the following night was very funny and we really enjoyed that as well.Other then being sick that one day I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Some people complained that there were a lot of families w/ children there but it didn't bother me in the least bit. As a matter of fact I would go back and take my kids - I look forward to it.One thing I wish I would have done is take some toys or crayons/coloring books for the native children. I didn't think we would see any as we were taking a short trip and I didn't think we would be going into town but we saw several native children on the beach the day we took our long walk and they were thrilled to get ANYTHING. We gave them our empty cups and straws and a half eaten banana.Items you definitely want to bring - sunscreen, insulated cups as the drink cups are very small, a sun hat, extra bathing suit or 2....We also went parasailing which was a blast!

<Content>Will Definitely Return to Sunscape My friend and I stayed at Sunscape Grand from April 26-May 1st. We were VERY happy with every aspect of our vacation. We took US Airway direct out of Philadephia. The checkin was quick, and the flight was extremely smooth. The lines at the airport went fast, and we were greeted by our Apple Reps., who quickly took us to our hotel.I have stayed at several resorts in Punta Cana and Puerta Plata, but I have to say this resort quickly became my favorite. The Grand Flamenco is very close in second place.Check-In was smooth, easy and effortless. We were greeted with a little bag filled with shampoo, body gel and lotion. We were also given yummy drinks!Our room was on the first floor, in building three. We were close to everything... the lobby, pools, beach and BARS! The room was clean, neat and had plenty of towels.I am a very critical person when it comes to food. I must say, the food was outstanding. I especially enjoyed breakfast... and started each day with french toast (yum). I ate lunch at the Beach Garden (the grilled chicken sandwich was delicious!) twice, and the buffet several times, which was different each day, but equally good.The snacks at the pool bar were yummy too! I enjoyed the chips and homemade salsa every afternoon. The pizza wasn't like home, but wasn't horrible considering we were in a different country.Dinner was terrific! We went to the buffet on Italian Night, and the food was very tasty. We especially loved American Grill. The guacomole was so good! We went there two different nights. One night I had the grilled chicken, the other night I had the chicken fajitas. Both were very good! The frozen margaritas were yum! The Italian Restaurant was good as well. I had the salad (VERY good), spinach pasta, and shrimp. Thursday (beach night) was really special. Eating on the beach, while listening to the band play and watching the sunset was really special. What an amazing view! Friday afternoon the head chef prepared paella on the beach. It was delicious and fun to watch him make.Now for the drinks.... Pina Coladas were the perfect treat to a hot sunny day. The Coco locos were amazing! One of the bartenders, Chocolate, made mudslides to die for. He even drizzled chocolate syrup on the cup, and on top. SOO GOOD!!Shout out to Juan Carlos. He is such a sweet, hardworking guy who constantly went out of his way to make our stay special. :)The shows were cute, especially the one on Tuesday and Saturday Night. We enjoyed them. The cigar bar was a fun atmosphere, especially when it was karaoke night. The club was tiny, but really cute too.The spa was wonderful. The perfect relaxation that I needed! Yoga on the beach was fabulous too. What can be better than that??I know for sure I will be returning to this resort in the near future. I was VERY pleased with my stay. Thank You Sunscape! :)

<Content>Worst trip ever ! Our plan was to stay 5 nights, we only last 48 hours there before leaving to go home. DAY ONE: Upon arrival, we were exhaused from the trip so we wanted to nap before heading to dinner. When we turned the comforter down, there were stains all over the sheets. Four phone calls, one personal visit to the front desk and four hours later they finally changed the sheet with major attitude I may add. They did not bother to change the pillow cases or blankets. They also neglected to clean the mini-fridge that had hair in it. When I asked it it would be possble to change rooms they said they would charge an additional $55 per night. Needless to say, the first dinner that night was unedible but we were still optimistic for the next day. DAY TWO: Breakfast was no better and you could not even have cereal b/c the milk was not warm but hot as they leave it out on the counter. So, we decide we are going to go home b/c this is just not what we wanted in a vacation but our phone does not work. The front desk promised all day that they would fix it and they did not. I asked if I may use their phone to make arrangement to leave and they were more than unhelpful. They did not care that we wanted to leave and did not offer any solutions. Everytime you approached them, they were so condesending and they just snickered at you. By that evening, we were feeling helpless and desperate. My husband physically brought the phone down to the front desk and demanded they help us. They front desk person told my husband he would be sorry he spoke to them like that. At this point I was considering calling the American consulate, as we felt very threatened and unsafe. Finally, we get a working phone and contact a charter company out of Boston that would fly us home. They said the flight was leaving in one hour so we packed everything we could within five minutes, got a taxi and ran for our lives!. This hotel was dispicable! I cant even believe that human beings can act in this manner.We have traveled some, and never came across such poor customer service or ignorance in our life! We are not your typical complainers and I would normally never go to this length to write something like this but that is how bad it was. That was the first and last trip to the Dominican Republic. There are too many lovely places/people in the world to waste your time there!

<Content>Twice in 1 year! Well, we loved this place so much when there in March 2004 with friends that we went back in Nov 2004... This time we took our kids (ages 13  16) and 16 friends and family members! We all had a blast. As this second time was over Thanksgiving, there were more families than when we visited in March. This addition of small kids changed it a little, but as we had our kids with us...it was great. Imagine...a full Thanksgiving feast on the beach....music on the beach...and a movie on the beach. What a GREAT holiday!We had an EAGLES cheerleader, old friends, new friends, family members and work associates with us. Everyone thanked us for letting them know about our trip and inviting them along. The only ones sorry...were the ones who did not make the trip!There was some work being done at the resort in readiness for the upcoming winter visitors but it did not bother us. The workers were friendly and courteous. And the rest of the staff...some familiar faces from March...were superb. I would definately visit again. And the kids...well they said it was the best vacation they have had (we've been to Disney World!)

<Content>fantastic time I just got back from the Sunscape Grand and let me tell you what a awsome time I had. We were in building 5 and had a view of the adult pool. The rooms were very clean and that really is all you need on vacation because you really do not spend much time in there. Everyone was so friendly and always willing to help out. The beach was average, there was some seaweed depending on the day but I really did not hang out there because it was so fun at the large pool that has the swim up bar. We meet so many neat people from Chicago(Mo,Maria,Tammy, a BIG HELLO), England, Jersey(Hello Joe, hope you made it home ok) and a wonderful couple from Indiana and many more. The wait staff, front desk and bartenders were so fun and helpful. At night we just went to the piano bar(jamica man was awsome, its a must see) and then to the disco. There is not a whole lot of stuff to do outside the resort but in the resort you can make lots of fun! The resort was just a fun place to stay and it really just grows on you. We were only there for 3nts and it was not long enough. The only thing I would have like would have been more activities around the pool with music, it seemed alittle quiet at times we even went up and had them turn the radio up and they were more than welcome to do that. It was not a big deal but when you are on vacation you want to here that music to keep you going. The drinks were good. They even have name brand liqour.The lobby is gorgeous and the grounds were kepted very clean. The food was really good as well, the American Grill we eat everyday for lunch. At night we eat at Windows and for breakfast too.Well just alittle from me, but let me tell you we had a blast and were very happy with our choice, and will be returning soon and by the way the weather was 90degrees with humidity at about 92% so it was warm, bring lots of suncreen.If you have any questions you can email me at -----------.

<Content>Not So Grand We took our honeymoon to this resort from april 20-27 and were quite dissappointed. Halfway through our trip we were offered, along with everyone else at the resort, the option to be transferred to Sunscape The Beach and it was the best decision we could have ever made. Here is an honest breakdown of what we experienced at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. I will have a review of the wonderful Sunscape The Beach as well if you would like to check out the comparison.Grounds: The grounds were very well kept. The beaches were white sand beaches that had a decent amount of seaweed on the shores but not enough to really cause me to complain. The pools/restaurants/restrooms and so on were very very clean. Pools. Two pools-1 adult pool and one larger pool for everyone. I was dissappointed in the size of these pools as it made it hard to relax on a raft since you would constantly be bumping into to someone at the adult pool or getting splashed by kids playing at the larger pool. This is a resort for everyone so I am not complaining about the kids but it would have been nicer to have a larger pool for the amount of people visiting. Restaurants. After eating at all the restaurants we really found out that these restaurants didn't give you anything to write home about. The food was very poor and we seldom finished a plate. The best food that we had was breakfast which consisted of bacon and an omelete which is hard to screw up. Rooms. Our room was very spacious which was very nice with a view of the main pool. This room was not cleaned to a very good standard because immediately upon arrival we saw obvious hairs all over the bathroom and bedroom floor. We ran out of hot water one day and after calling the front desk twice never got fixed. Service. Overall the service was poor. We tipped our maids everyday hoping that it would make in a difference in getting towels, toilet paper, sheets etc. After three calls to the front desk and a visit as well we finally received toilet paper and then had to take towels off of the maids cart in the hallway. Overall without toilet paper for over a day! Needless to say Tipping did not help. The staff at the restaurants/bars and actaully front desk were very very nice. The Dominicans are very friendly people which made that part of the trip refreshing. Overall we did have a nice time but after reading the reveiws we and many others at the resort were very surprised in how high it was rated. In addition after getting to spend 3 full days at Sunscape The Beach we truly realized how dissappointed Sunscape Grand was in comparison.

<Content>We Loved It!!!! Hola....We stayed at the resort Apr 9- 16 and couldn't of asked for more perfect weather!! The sun was very very hot, but we brought plenty (12 bottles and you will need them) of sunscreen so we were ok. Some friends we met there were not so lucky and had some extremely sore sunburns and blisters. (right Glen??) ($29 for lotion in the gift shop)We were mostly beach potatoes our whole week and enjoyed yhe relaxation and calming breeze from the ocean. We walked the beach both ways for quite a bit. If you go to the right past the marina, it is mostly in the natives area, unraked and not taken care of, so you may encounter some garbage etc. but still a scenic little stroll. If you go to the left, you will walk by the other resorts which seemed rather large and crowded compared to our resort. Our beach was cleaned daily, and the grass and weed situation changed with the tides. Some days the water was crystal clear and other windier days there was grass floating, but was not a problem.Our room was spotless, spacious, and very comfortable. We were in building 3 3rd floor and the week we were there, they seemed to be replacing all the king size beds on the floor with new mattresses. The restaurants and bars were all very good and the service was great.(We liked the Tex-Mex best - the corny Johnny Cash music made it fun as we knew all the songs anyway:))Check in was a little slow but couldn't be helped as everyone on our bus was staying at our hotel, but it wasn't too long and we were on our way.Ladies - pack your monthly feminine products just in case - a pack of 8 was $10 in the gift shop.The resort is American owned, and the majority of guests seemed to be Yanks or Canucks, :) and the staff we came in contact with all spoke very good English.We loved the coffee there and brought home 5 lbs!! (kinda gave Timmy Ho's a run for their money in my book :) )We stayed at the Fiesta the last time we went there, and while very nice, the Sunscape was far more to our liking, in that it was smaller and friendlier.We will most definately go back to this resort again!!!! I am saving already for next year!!

<Content>Great Vacation Returned on March 14th. The resort was wonderful. We arrived at 1030 and room was ready. Greeted with cold towels and drinks. Great friendly service. Room was clean, hotel grounds beautiful, plenty of towels and great maid service. Food was wonderful especially the beach party. The beach was clean, water wonderful and we never had problems getting chairs. I read all the bad reviews about this resort and was worried prior to going. I don't know what people expect. There were 4 of us in my party and we had a fabulous time. We can't wait to return. We booked through apple tours and they were terrific. Charter flight wonderful and we loved the airport in Punta Cana.

<Content>Depends on what you are looking for Just returned from a week at the Sunscape Punta Grand March 19-26. The things that were great were outstanding and the things that were poor were really poor. Here's a detailed synopsis.Grounds: The resort itself is beautiful, immaculate and well maintained. The beaches are clean and powdery white sand. Rooms: Not super luxury high end but very clean and spacious. See if you can get one on the 3rd floor, they have wood cathedral ceilings that are quite nice.Staff: Service ranged from mediocre in the Windows/Tex Mex restaurants to good in Da Marios and very good in the American Grill at dinner. The bar staff were great everywhere. The Piano bar and adult pool, had the best and made it a lot of fun. Tips do make a difference in getting seated at Da Marios (Italian restaurant). One night 8 people (4 groups) that very clearly arrived after my friends and I were seated before us. Complaints were not taken or listened to at the desk about this.Food: After talking to quite a few other people, this topic will differ depending on what you are used to as a frame of reference. My opinion,this resort had the WORST food of any all-inclusive resort I have been to in the Carribean, Mexico or Europe. I was disapointed at every meal. I would rate the restaurants as follows:Da Marios - about 2 steps below Olive Garden at best in qualityTex Mex - chips and salsa were good, rest was practically inedibleAmerican Grill - best at the resort. Mix of types of food. Bland but edible. This restaurant is not air conditioned and was quite hot the 2 nights we ate there.Windows - buffet style. Mix of different stations, fruit, deli, eggs to order, pasta etc. They tended to overcook everything on the grill even after being requested in Spanish to cook it as asked.Beverages - no champagne, house wine was swill, local beer (Presidente) only kind available and only on tap, liquor was name brand but not top shelf and not everything was available at every bar. Soda and bottled water was readily available everywhere.Noise level: Most of the buildings are tile, stone etc. Noises are magnified everywhere making it difficult to rest during the day. At night there was a fair amount of noise as well, mostly from people being loud. Tough to sleep really at any time of the day.Crowd: Ranged from late 20's to late 50's for the most part. Mostly American, Canadian, British with a mix of German and French as well. Mainly couples/families but I was pleasantly surprised at how many solo singles or singles that came with a couple friends there were.All in all not a terrible trip but I was clearly disappointed and would not go back to this resort. The Dominican Republic is a beautiful country with very friendly hard working people. I recomend the destination but I'd suggest another resort if good food and drinks are important to you.

<Content>Fantastic!! I travelled to the Sunscape Grand as a single mother (my husband had to work) and two young children, 8 and 4. We had a wonderful time! We were there from March 17-24th 2005.When I arrived, the check-in was quick. We were put in section 1, which, I have to admit, was quite loud. It is close to the show stage and also near the fitness centre so you hear the loud music at night from your room and also the loud aerobics music starts at 8:30am. We got used to it and used ear plugs so after the first night, it didn't really bother us anymore. It was nice to have a balcony. If you are going, ask for a room in either building 4 or 5 which were much quieter.The resort was absolutely beautiful with live flamingos in the fountains and beautifully landscaped gardens. The pools were large and well maintained. The swim up bar was terrific as you could keep cool and drink refreshments at the same time. The bars were very accessible from wherever you were and they never served alcohol to my children even when my kids said they were getting a drink for me. I thought that was very responsible of them. The food was fantastic. My kids ate more than ever and I had a terrific selection of tasty and healthy dishes. We ate fresh fish every night. There is a grill right on the beach so you could eat all day if you wanted. No need to bring bottled water with you. You can get one from several places on the resort and they are even stocked in your mini bar. We also brushed our teeth with the bottled water as the water from the taps is not good. My kids loved the kids club. Fernando and Esperanza were the absolute best! My youngest actually begged me everyday to take her there! All of the staff were very nice, smiling and helpful. I loved trying to speak Spanish to them, which made the trip a real experience. My kids also enjoyed the water iceberg which my oldest climbed every day and the water trampoline. They had a photographer who took pictures with your kids and live animals (small monkey, lizards and parrots). My kids loved it! We bought a few for $6/each which was not too expensive. It was nice to take home a souvenir. Some advice:1. It is very hot in the DR. Even at 9am I found the sun very hot. Bring lots of sun screen, even complete block in case you burn. Bring t-shirts or full-suits for the kids as they can easily burn. Bring wide-brimmed hats too as shade is a hot commodity there!2. If your kids like pails and shovels to play with, bring them with you. They are very expensive there ($15 US). Also bring your own snorkel gear as there is a coral reef near by. 3. You have to get up early in the morning to secure a seat under a grass hut on the beach or by the pool. I was up before 6am to put a towel under a hut on the beach. By the pool, I think I was okay a bit later. 4. Bring some of your own towels. As a result of reading Trip Advisor feedback, it is true that they are often out of towels even first thing in the morning. We wouldn't get to the towel shack until 9:30am and they were typically out. By bringing my own towel, I avoided the aggravation of having to wait for one.5. Bring lots of $1 for tips. While it is not necessary, the people certainly do appreciate it very much. All in all, our trip was relaxing and enjoyable. Absolutely nothing to complain about! We are planning to go back next year. Enjoy!

<Content>relaxing My daughter and I went to the sunscape Jan.9,to jan16 2005. The first two days the weather wasn't tanning weather, but there was plenty of things to keep us busy. But when the sun came out the pool was crowded and we had a great time. The restaurants were excellent! Never had a bad meal! The staff were very friendly and helpful! Our glasses were always filled. They have staff walking around the pool and also the beach to take our orders. The rooms were always clean but we found that housekeeping was doing our room last about 4pm everyday but maybe that was because we were on the 3rd floor. We went on a Coco tours one day and I wouldn't advise it for anyone becasue the guys that took us out on the speedboats snockling were very rude to my daughter and myself. All they were looking for were there tip. They could speak English but they chose to speak creole. The Sunscape was so clean and very well maintained. The shows at night were also excellent. We loved the Sunscape so much I'm planning to go in the fall for two weeks.

<Content>If you don't have FUN.. Its your fault.. We recently stayed at the Sunscape From 03/18-03/22. We arrived from Phila-to Charlotte to Punta Cana and when we landed we immediatly take from the Airport (nincest one i've been in) to our resort. When we arrived room ready(upgraded) 5324 Beach view awesome, and Fruit punch and cold towels. Room clean, large and well stocked. Our whole 5 days were filled with sunshine,activities and eating and drinking. Forget all about the bad reviews this is one of the nincest resorts I have been to and already planning to go back next spring. Every night a movie for the kid,(shrek 2, Pirates of the Carribean, etc) Beach partys, fresh cut fruit on the beach,coconut drinks. Food at the restaurant good. Tex mex awesome.The Dominican people go out of your way to make you stay awesome!Go enjoy and relax!!!Roger

<Content>sunscape is an under-rated find just returned from 5 days at sunscape, travelled with my 12 year old daughter. we travel extensively both in us and abroad, first time in dr.after reading the big name guidebooks we really had our doubts going in. wow were we suprised. beautiful hotel, great room, professional, respectful service, gorgeous beach, good food in spotless restaurants, nice selection of recreational amenities for all ages.and very very safe.great overall value.(i know some of the websites have been critical of the food at the all-inclusives, but HELLO, you don't go to the caribbean to eat northern italian or greek or japanese. stick to the basics or try the local specialities.)

<Content>Most amazing vacation I have nothing bad to say about this resort. It included more than any all inclusive I've been to, the facilities were imaculate, our kids 9-10-13 had a great time and there was lots for them to do. We felt extremely safe letting them roam the resort with friends. The staff were friendly and very attentive, the rooms were spotless, the food was spectacular, especially the Japenese restaurant. The ocean is a little rougher here but it is great for boogy boarding and the beach is beautiful. This was our first vacation like this with kids and I'd do it again in a minute. The drinks were readily available and there was never a shortage- the resort was booked to capacity while we were there but the service was still great. The pool is so big that you always felt you had it to yourself. Don't hesitate vacationing here, I would go back to this paradise in a flash.

<Content>impressive vacation After paying for our trip (early march) I have to say I was a little conserned, however the resort is wonderful and the staff, although they speak little english was fabulous. The rooms are fine. I do think they could use a little reburbishing of furnishings, but charming and most importantly, clean! I had concerns about bugs, and I am sure they too, have a time of year where this may be a concern, however, march is not. As for food, more than you could possibly ask for. The breakfast buffet has more than enough for all. Fresh fruit, eggs and more eggs, an omelet station and pancakes, french toast and waffles. To our delight, the buffet each nite, presented something different. Local dishes, interesting and very good. If you are looking for gourmet dining, just change your perspective, this place is tropical, and charming, primarily offering what you are there for, a taste of the Dominican Republic. No wrist bands and lots of common courtesy. They truely aim to please. The bartenders and hotel staff are more than ready to assist. We have been to many carribean resorts and this is most definitely one we plan to return to. Have a great time

<Content>Sunscape Grand - Wonderful Resort My husband and I just returned from Sunscape Punta Cana Grand on Monday 7 March 2005. We spent 8 relaxing, fun filled days! The staff is amazing. I did not meet one unfriendly person and most everyone spoke very good english. We have been to several AI resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean (2nd time to Punta Cana) and I found more people from the US at this resort than at any other we have stayed. We met some people staying down the beach at the Natura Park resort and they told us that the Americans were in the minority at that resort. There seemed to be an older crowd during this week. We are in our early forties and we were considered part of the younger crowd. :-) :-) However, when we were leaving there seemed to be a much younger crowd coming in. Room: Building 5 room 302. Very large room king bed. Maid service the best! I brought extra wash cloths but never needed them. We had three new ones each day. AC worked perfectly. Fridge stocked daily with beer, coke, water, sprite, and orange juice without us asking. I did pack half a suitcase with school supplies which I left a little each day for the maid with two dollars. She left us towel Swans, Hearts and flowers each day. :-) Food: Only went to the Buffet twice. Once for Breakfast, Once for Dinner. The buffet was small compared to other resorts but it is a smaller resort. The food was good and I never thought anything was bland. We had breakfast and dinner at the 24 hour restaurant near the beach (can't recall the name). It was not crowded, service was great and it was nice looking at the ocean while enjoying my coffee. For dinner they had excellent french onion soup and the filet mignon was prepared perfect. I had it two nights. :-) My husband had the Mahi Mahi with Shrimp. Also excellent. The second night my husband requested just shrimp and they had no problem with his special order. I tried a 'hamburger' on the beach but I'm not sure what kind of meat that was, if it was meat at all. I don't know, it was not good. The beach fruit stand was also excellent. That is what we had for lunch most days. Beach party: The beach party was amazing! The staff worked very hard setting up the beach and the food was very tasty. They had veal, beef, ribs, chicken, fish, baked potatoes, carrots, green beans, tons of desserts. We watched Pirates of the Caribbean on the beach, lounging in beach chairs. Beach: The stuff on the beach is not seaweed. It is grass. There is a difference. And it was not a real problem for us. Didn't seem to bother anyone else either. I did not smell anything bad from the marina. It was entertaining watching the party boats and fishing boats everyday. I thought the beach was beautiful! The water was very calm I believe due to the reef way off shore. The staff walks around the beach and takes drink orders which was nice. On one day, we could not find chairs. No big deal, we layed our towels on the beach and even when a chair opened up, we didn't bother taking it. All bars had top shelf liquor (Stoli, Bailey's, Jim Beam, Tanqueray, etc). I may have drank them out of Bailey's though. :-)Pools: Adult pool, very quiet. We usually went there in the evening before getting ready for dinner. Main pool with swim up bar is nice. The children that were there during our stay were very good. We barely knew there were kids in the area. Piano Bar: Julio is just too darn funny! :-) Karaoke and the Jamaican dude were very entertaining. I didn't expect the bar to be that much fun. Bar opened at 8:30pm entertainment started around 11:00pm. Julio's favorite song: I'm leaving on a jet plane..... Tour: We went on the Saona Island tour. Very touristy but we had a lot of fun. The island is beautiful. Lunch was also good (grilled chicken, pork chops, rice, fruit, pasta) Watch out for that rum! Very smooth but gets ya later. I tried the Manu uana. This must be their version of moon shine! WoW!Bottom Line: We thought this was definately a 5 golden apple resort. I really can't see what anyone could possibly complain about. Our prior stay in DR was at the Riu Bamboo and although we had a great time there as well, Sunscape ranked higher in our book.

<Content>Heads above the rest We returned from our vacation on Saturday, March 5th, 2005. I wanted to STAY!!!!!! We had originally been booked at Natura Park Resort a bit down the beach from Sunscape. When we arrived there, to our dismay, the resort was full of vacationing Spring Break kids from Spain. They all smoke non-stop, they're loud even though they are sitting right next to each other, they shout. We had no idea that this resort was going to be full of kids on Spring Break. This was exactly the thing that I told the travel agent that we wanted to avoid. NO SPRING BREAK CROWD. If I'm not mistaken, I thought they had a no Spring Breakers policy, Anyway, on day 4, I couldn't take it anymore and went to the lobby to voice my unhappiness with the situation to our Apple Representative Danelys, who was WONDERFUL, and by noon we were checked into the Sunscape Grand. WOW, what an incredible difference !!!! This place was absolutley beautiful. Everything was so much cleaner and so much more beautiful. The staff was head and shoulders above others that we have come across in our travels. So happy, helpful, always smiling, just all around so pleasant to be around. The food was great considering you are in a third world country. The drinks were fun and fruity. They would make anything that you wanted. The rooms were very nice, although our bedding smelled a bit musty. There are rafts on which you can lay on and float around in the gorgeous pool. There is also an adult pool (topless optional) which is more quiet. It has it's own bar so you never had to go far for anything. Convenient restrooms situated all over the grounds. One thing that I didn't realize going there was that the beach was topless. We only saw a few handful's of these bathing beauties, and it was a slight culture shock to me. After a day or so, you don't even really notice it anymore. All in all, after switching resorts and upgrading to the Sunscape, yes it was a huge upgrade from Natura Park Resort, we had a wonderful time. We will definitely go back again. I did find that going forward, we will not book anything less than 5 apple going through Apple Vacations. There is definitely a difference. We only go away once a year, and I will definitely spend the extra money in the future because it can make all the difference in having a good vacation and a GREAT vacation. The second half of our trip was GREAT thanks to the wonderful staff at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. This resort is beautiful. One thing I might add is that I would request a room a little further away from the main entertainment stage and outdoor bar. At night, it can be a bit noisy.

<Content>nice resort This resort should go adults only. This resort offers wonderful beaches, good restaurants and pretty grounds. The Island offers very little and it isn't recommended to venture out unless on a tour. We flew to Santa Domingo with a tour and enjoyed this very old cityThe rooms are large but they need upgrading. We found the food to be quite good and the service was always friendly. Our room was clean and the water and beer in the fridge (as we requested upon arrival) was restocked everyday with the amounts requested. We stayed 7days and enjoyed a Mexican Night, candle lit barbecue on the beach and a very good Italian meal in the Italian restaurant. The adult pool is hidden between buildings and becomes very hot and stuffy as the day progresses. The swim up bar is better used in mid to late afternoon when the kiddies are napping.The vendors have a beach mall and unlike Mexico do not pester on the beach. This is a big plus. A few venors are allowed into the resort two nights a week and that is fair.This resort is for relaxing and enjoying sun,beaches, music, good food and as much to drink as you want. If you don't want to watch the shows-leave and walk the beach and enjoy your wife or your family. The good far out weighs the bad at this resort.

<Content>Paradise found Like others, we were concerned about the bad reviews posted. Our trip was fantastic. We visited the DR February 17th through the 25th. I cannot say enough about Apple Vacations. They truly have their act together. Everything went extremely well. We flew out of Pittsburgh on USA3000. Anyone that flies any other airline after flying USA3000 is nuts. The resot itself is beutiful. The grounds are very well kept and they are constantly cleaning. The rooms were much bigger than expected, although in need of updates. The food was okay. We did not starve by any means. Some of the food was just plain weird. We are not picky eaters and didn't have a hard time finding something to eat. Be careful of the chicken, some of it was raw. Noone got sick. The beach was nice. Seeweed was definetly a problem but they did a good job at cleaning things up. Compared to the other resorts in this area, the Sunscape definetly did the best job at cleaning up the seeweed. We expected the water to be a clearer, but again I think it was more a seeweed issue than anything. The ocean water was cold, so was the pool water - almost too cold. They may want to consider heating the pool, but we were there in February. Some reviews complained of fumes from the marina which as next to the resort. This was not a problem. My husband didn't even know the marina was there until I pointed it out to him. I would recommend the Outback Safari. It was wonderful. Our tourguide, Louis made the trip. They take you to a beutiful beach to boogie board - it was a blast and well worth the money.The only bad thing I can say about the entire trip is that we have to wait another year to go back. My two boys (ages 12 and 14) had a wonderful time and cannot wait to go back. We highly recommend the Sunscape resort, however, when we go back next year we would like to see another resort.

<Content>Very pleased! There were 7 of us (adults) and we all agree that we had a blast! Some details: From the plane to the resprt, MAYBE 45 minutes. Apple Tours is very organized and efficient. Our rooms, very clean, no musty smell that I could tell and I am VERY sensitive to odors!! My sister didn't have hot water but I didn't know about it and our Travel Agent said we should have INSISTED on a room change, they showered in our room. Another friend's refrigerator didn't work, but they brought a new one to their room. The Staff: If you want to go where people speak ALL English, stay in the United States, it bothers me when people complain about the staff. They were ALL lovely people, some spoke better English than others and we learned that our Spanish was darn good. That's all a part of traveling internationally, if you're too uptight, it's gonna be a hassle, we went to have a good time and we did!! The Resort: I had no problems going into the public restrooms with bare feet and let me tell you, that is BIG!!! There was never any water or sand on those bathroom floors, immaculate!! The staff works very hard...appreciate that. The Restaurants: None of us (7) ever got sick and we ate at all the restaruants. Windows definately the winner,this is a HUGE restaurant. They serve 3 meals a day, buffet style and they must serve thousands a day. I loved the food! We all thought it was good. 5 star good? No but LOTS of choices and very well done. They are catering to many different nationalities and I was impressed! The Italian restarant: they ARE trying. Real Italian? no, but a nice change of scenery, I still enjoyed it, we all did. The Mexican: same as the Italian. We had fun with the appetizer size, we took a picture of the buffalo wings because we got 4 of them, all the appetizers were like that, but who cares, just order more of them. We had lunch at the Tex-Mex once and didn't go back, lunch at Windows was to die for!! They also have 2 places outside all day that you can get nacho's, pizza, sandwiches, so if we didn't want to go eat we just grabbed something and ate at the pool or on the beach. One point to make at Windows, you may stand in line for a personal omelet or chicken cabobs or whatever they cook on a grill in front of you, depends on the time of day. The deserts were awesome. The Beach: We had no complaints about the beach, water or seaweed. Yes there was some seaweed but not a lot and not any in the water. The water was bluer farther down the way , but also nastier at other resorts we walked by. Getting a beach chair: If you REALLY want a chair, put your towel on one early, again there were 7 of us and nobody did that, we managed fine! We went to the adult pool and used rafts in the pool or GASP! a towel on the beach!We also had a blast playing volleyball and soccer! We were between the ages of 25 and 45 and we just had so much fun. There were always people who were looking to play volleyball. This is a very busy resort, if you want something quiet, private and peaceful this is not the place. We met greatpeople from everywhere. Our goal was to have fun and we absolutely did just that!!!

<Content>The staff was great! and I am hooked on Coco Locos! We just returned last night from Sunscape - I will give them a big kudos for working on the resort. While we were there (2/20-2/25), we saw them painting the resort, re-doing a couple fountains, adding activities for the kids and laying out plans for expanding restaurants. I was impressed that Summit Group is looking to continuously improve.The beach - yes, tons of seaweed. But the staff cleaned it up very diligently. Interesting note - the beach is not owned by the hotel - it is federally owned and the hotel is not responsible for any incidents on the beach.The food - the food was good. My chief complaint was that the buffet food doesn't stay hot very long after you get it. Breakfast was great and I enjoyed trying new dishes.Excursions - we did La Saona, ATV's, Outback Safari and Manati Park. Swim with the dolphins was fantastic - I am a huge dolphin lover. The park is what it is - I do give credit to trying to establish a zoo type atmosphere with something for everyone. La Saona is OUTSTANDING! The beach is gorgeous and we got great buys on coffee and rum. Outback Safari was also a great trip. You really saw the country side and how people truly live. I did take a bag of school supplies, toothbrushes and toothpast to a local school while on the tour. NOTE - it is ILLEGAL to hand out candy and money to children in the Dominican. The boogie boarding was great and my boyfriend is determined we are going back to that beach when we go back. ATV's were very cool - we ended up being the only couple out during that time slot. Seeing where the Atlantic and Caribbean meet is incredibly beautiful. Drinks - try the coco loco's! I even got the recipe from the bartender! The staff was all great - we didn't meet anyone who was not willing to help or smile and say hola. Will we go back? Honestly, no. but not because of the resort. We are beach/ocean people, not pool people. The sea was pretty choppy while we were there and I admit, we did not realize we were on the Atlantic Ocean not the Caribbean Sea. We will go back to the Dominican though, just on the southern tip. We did meet the folks a couple reviews down who had a party of 25 getting married. Super nice folks! and we also meet 2 couples from Philly who we exchanged emails with. Feel free to email me with questions or to see photos!

<Content>Wonderful After reading some negative reviews on this resort, I had some concerns. They couldn't be farther from the truth. Sunscape Punta Cana Grand was a lovely resort. Not too big, not too small. The grounds and landscaping are breathtaking and so well kept. The staff is constantly perfecting them. Speaking of the staff, they cannot do enough for you, they are warm and friendly and always have a smile on their faces. The rooms were ample size although may be ready for a little updating, especially the bathrooms, however, they are absolutely spotless. Housekeeping service twice a day. Fully stocked mini-bar (drinks only), replenished daily. The pool was large and never too crowded although you do have to get up early to reserve your lounge chairs at both the pool and beach especially if you want shade which I promise you will need. There is a small adults only pool however we traveled with 3 small children so never had a need to get over there. If you are traveling with children I would recommend Buildings 1, 2 or 3. The Explorer's Club met our expectations and the staff was wonderful. My children would go there to get out of the sun for a bit and participated in a few beach games, donkey rides and camping night. We also enjoyed some of the organized adult activities...beach volleyball, shuffleboard, horseshoes, bingo, towel art, water aerobics to name a few. The food was okay. In the ala carte restaurants, the portions were small and the service was on the slow side but that may have been as issue for us b/c of the kids and our need to make it to the daily 7:30pm kids movie. (Great, on a big outdoor screen). Windows, the main restaurant, buffet style really worked out well for us. It had a nice variety and a different theme each evening. Do not miss Dominican Night. Fabulous! We booked through Apple Vacations and there were representatives on every leg of our trip. They were very helpful. One day they arranged transportaion to a local cigar factory for my husband to purchase cigars to bring home for gifts. (He was gone for only about 1 hour). The only negative was 1 week was too short. We loved it and would go back in a minute, next time for at least 10 days! Thank you, Sunscape, for an outstanding vacation! We hope to see you again!

<Content>Renewed in the Republic Hi! My husband and I just returned from Punta Cana. 2/12 - 2/19 We celebrated our 15th Wedding Anniversary. Sunscape made our special trip memorable. From the moment we walked thru the lobby (drinks  sweets) we expressed our satisfaction to each other. Our week stay was unbelieveable! The view from our room was spectacular. We were so excited! I liked the variety of food available. Wonderful presentation! The staff always had a kind word to share. They did a wonderful job trying to motivate us lazy vacationers (Games, dance lessons, How-to sessions- food, drink, towel art) We also enjoyed asking Chocolate for a Budwieser. He always flashed a big smile when he saw us. Our room was cleaned each and everyday. Better than home! Ha ha Our trip to Sonoa Island was EXCELLENT. If you have a chance, take advantage of this trip. The Apple Representatives helped make our stay very enjoyable. We would like to return with our children next trip.  I was worried after reading all those negative comments that were left by others on this website. I'm glad I didn't form an opinion based on their silly comments. I didn't find one to be true...........dirty beaches, stinky fumes, bad food, or terrible service. NOT!

<Content>A GRAND Disappointment Our family recently returned from the Sunscape Grand Resort at Punta Cana, after a 7 night stay. Before booking this vacation, we became aware of the Golden Apple Five-Star rating awarded this resort through various reviews. We believed that our family had made a good choice for our vacation dollars. Unfortunately NOT! Compared to other Carribean destinations, this location was Fair at best. The beach was unkept with lots of Sea-Weed every day. Visitors should expect very breezy conditions and a rough surf daily. Off shore snorkeling was poor. The food preperation at this resort was poor. Frequently the food (especially at the daily buffets) was often served cold and the meat was often undercooked. In addition to our entire family, other guests who we spoke to, suffered from serious Gastrointestinal (Stomach) distress within the first 48 hours of stay. This resort needs much improvement in customer service. BEWARE, if you do not speak or understand spanish, there WILL BE a big communication barrier with the staff. Our room service was very poor for this level of resort. Our room was not cleaned and towels were not replaced until after 4pm every day! The Fitness Center-Gym had few pieces of equipment that were poorly maintained. The Fitness area was only open from 8am until 8pm daily, which eliminates any thought of early morning or late evening workouts. Nightly entertainment was nothing more than re-runs of old movies and group of locals who mastered Lip-Sync. There was a lack of things to do for younger individuals. The grounds and pools were very clean and attractive however. If your plan is to lay in a loung chair at the pool side from sun-up until sun-down and, you do not have a family to entertain, this facility will suffice quite well. I do not recommend this resort to families with younger childeren. We've been there, now we know!

<Content>Suncape Grand is a great resort We stayed at the Sunscape Grand from Feb. 14-21 and had a GREAT time. It is really hard to believe the last 2 negative reviews that have been written because they do not in any way reflect our experience. We have stayed at a number of different all-inclusives in Mexico and Cuba and this resort was by far the best. The staff simply cannot be beat - we found them to be equally friendly and helpful irrespective as to whether they were continually tipped (we tipped a few of our favourites only at the end of the week and received excellent services throughout our stay). The quality of wait and bar staff, housekeeping, security, front desk surpassed anything we have found elsewhere, including many hotels in Europe and the U.S.  The food, contrary to the other reviews, was great - the variety and quality were excellent for an all-inclusive. Although we have had problems at other all-inclusives we had absolutely no difficulty finding something good to eat at the Grand. The rooms are not luxurious (they appear to be in the process of upgrading some of the furniture) but they are very spacious, comfortable and clean. We will definitely return to Punta Cana and to the Sunscape Grand.

<Content>Very relaxing!! My husband and I visited this resort the 1st week of February. The weather was breezy but nice, with maybe a brief shower here and there. Not enough or long enough to head back inside. The rooms were fair but clean. Anything you needed was a phone call away. Room service was quick. Any problem we had (A/C not on) was fixed immediently. The only complaints I have re. the room were: Can be noisy. It's amazes me how many people think it's ok to let there kids act like animals, especially in the hall way. The other complaint was no water for quite a few hours one day, not a problem the rest of the week. The beach was nice, and the water warmer than the pool! There is lots of seaweed but so what you're in the ocean! We had no problem finding chairs on the beach and we didn't get out ther until after 9. The pool area was warm (less breezy) and was nice and clean. Any cups from lazy people that can't pick up after themselves was cleaned up rather quickly by staff. I couldn't believe the chair thing by the pool!! I can't figure how it's ok to reserve quite a few chairs in the a.m. and not use them until , oh, 1-2p.m. One request for pool area...play more latin music!! Restaurants were nice, food good. The only place I didn't like was The American Grill. It wasn't because of the food, the service was almost non existant!! I don't know how you can go wrong with the food, there's something for everyone!! The staff really do a nice job with presentation. I heard of no one getting sick. I'm not saying it doesn't happen. I can see one way it can happen....people need to use the serving utensils that are located at the particular station of food. I was shocked to see some folks using their hands to grab food, gag, and even one guy put something back after handling it!!! So watch how and where you take things from a buffet. We're not people that stay up late, especially after a day of sun and rum-runners!! We saw only 2 shows. They were funny, you can't go there expecting Broad Way. The staff work really hard and look like they have fun. Isn't that what vacation is all about?? We were there for the Super Bowl (we were 2 of 4 Pats fans!!). They showed the game on the big screen where the movies are. What a good time...a bar set up and snacks. We met alot of nice people from Philly....Hi Mark and Dawn!We found the staff everywhere to be friendly. I really tried to speak as much of my limited Spanish as I could. A little smile and a buenos dia goes a long way. Tips go a long way, too. Bring lots of small bills if you intend on rewarding good service. Walking along the beach during the day is safe. I didn't feel so safe walking outside the resort along the road..that expedition ended quickly!!!All- in-all a nice resort. Good food and people. I would go back in the future.feel free to email me with any questions.

<Content>Had an AWSOME stay here...... Stayed here Nov. 9 - Nov. 15, 2004. A group of about 30 ppl were here for my best friends wedding, and let me jsut say that everything was amazing. The wedding itself was outstanding, from the flowers to the cocktail hour reception. If you are looking to get 5 star resturants then No this is not the place, but everything else is great.When you arrive you are greeted with cookies and yummy rum punch, what a great way to start a trip. I had a third floor room with cathedral ceilings. The staff is very friendly and pretty much willing to do anything in their power to make your stay easyer. The main bar behind the pool has great drinks, and i recommend Chocolate, he is an awsome bartender. I tipped about $1 a drink and was treated like royalty. as soon as you put down an empty drink a new one is there in seconds. I reccomend the ATV tours. We all took one one day and it was great. Its about a 4hour tour that goes through the beach and the town. Its breathtaking the things you see, and it was only $40USD per person, well worth it. I dont understand how anyone could have a bad time here. Let me tell you that it is well worth the money and i would love to go back any time!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful Time Just returned from Sunscape Punta Cana Grand on Saturday (2-19-05). Traveled there with wife and 2 kids (ages 10 and 8).Room: Very clean and well maintained. No problems at all. Housekeeping was in everyday and cleaned and made beds. Towels replaced daily and refridgerator stocked daily with snacks and beverages.Food: The food was alright but not our favorite aspect of this resort. Don'tget me wrong, we didn't go starving but food is prepared differently. Drinkswere plentiful and very good.Beach: The beach had a lot of seaweed but that did not bother us at all. Workers out early in the morning everyday cleaning up the seaweed from the beach.Entertainment: Plenty of things to do for kids and adults. Kids really enjoyed nightly movie( 7:30 every night).Overall we enjoyed our stay at Sunscape and plan on another visit in the future.

<Content>Before you consider the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand, you'd better think again! Here it is - as fair as I can make it.1) My room was not ready on time. The receptionist seemed unsympathetic and spoke little English.2) When our room was ready, our bags were not brought to the room. I carried my own bags to the room because I was tired of waiting.3) The front desk initially forgot to provide a safety deposit key with our package. To fix the situation, they reached into another open room package on the desk and handed me a key. Obviously, the keys fit more than one room's safety deposit box, so be careful. 4) Mucho seaweed and debris in the water (cups, straws, plastic). 5) Also, there was a lot of debris on the beach (more than I have seen at other beaches). I even found a broken beer bottle. 6) Overall, the food was bad, bad, bad. Don't let anyone fool you. Some things were good (deserts) and some things OK (grilled chicken and lobster and the Italian restaurant) but overall, it was disappointing.7) Shortage of towels at the pool. Four of my five days there I went half the day without a towel and had to go back every 30 minutes to check. They keep saying the same thing 20...30 minutes. They should have a towel for every towel key but they don't and don't seem to care.8) It was a real problem if you showed up past 9am at the pool/beach trying to get a chair. Sunscape permits chairs be reserved all day - even if nobody eventually uses them. My advise is to wait a reasonable period of time and then claim the chair(s). 9) Even though it is advertised, the Cigar Bar is not open. The front desk person said he has never seen it open.10) The dancers in the show are high school caliber talented at best. 11) The resort seems older and not as clean as I'm used to (I've been to 8 other resorts in Punta Cana and Cancun). The shower curtain had mildew stains. 12) The service was not consistent. On 2 occasions, our drink order was not taken. They always seemed confused when you arrived at the buffet and had a difficult time locating a table.13) They closed much of the breakfast buffet down 1/2 hour before its advertised closing time. They tried to seat us in a smoking area because they were closing off much of the seating even though there was 30 minutes before closing. 14) Many topless sunbathers at the pool even though it is prohibited (I was not offended but a parent with a child may be).I could go on, but I think you get the picture.

<Content>Very disappointing. I cannot believe this has been rated a five golden apple! It really wasn't a nice resort at all. RESORT: The resort is small, which I actually liked. But it is in no way as nice as other resorts that are ranked 5 golden apples. STAFF: The people who worked there, with the exception of a few bartenders, were very friendly. I had a small child with me, and they went out their way to be nice to him. FOOD: The food was absolutely horrible! And when I say horrible--I mean I wasn't able to eat the entire time I was there! I'm not sure if it's that way in all of Punta Cana, but the all-inclusives in Mexico were much better. DRINKS: The drinks were in no way top shelf. And if you happened to find a brand of alcohol that you recognized, they gave you very little of it. POOL: Forget about getting a towel at the pool. EVERYTIME we attempted to get a towel, they would tell us to come back in 20 minutes. When we'd come back in 20 minutes--they would tell us 20 minutes again! An hour later we'd get our towels. Ridiculous! And most guests like to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve their pool lounges with their towels, so it's very difficult to find somewhere to sit.BEACH: We really didn't spend much time at the beach, but it looked beautiful. And yes, there was a lot of seaweed as others reported, but I don't think enough for it to be a problem.ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment staff was a lot of fun and very friendly. We also got a kick out of the audience participation skits. But the dancers were mediocre at best. There was also a lot of lip syncing, which was disappointing.BUGS: I was bit up pretty badly on my ankles--the first day we were there! And then there are the reports of Malaria in Punta Cana...Overall, it was very disappointing to us, especially because our expectations were higher due to the resorts' apple rating. And not being able to eat was a problem as well. Sorry--friendly people just can't make up for all of the negative aspects of the resort.

<Content>Horrible is an understatement Went to Punta Cana Sunscape Grand after receiving great reviews from travel agent promoting trip with Apple Vacations. HORRIBLE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. The hotel lobby is beautiful however the service is not so good.   FOOD - HORRIBLE - WORSE FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE. I lived off of fruit from FRUIT CART on the beach for 5 of my 8 day stay. I tried different restaurants and the buffet but all was simply HORRIBLE. No variety at all. I would expect to  have some typical food from the country or island that I am visiting but you will not find that at this resort. This was the most bland (tasteless food I had ever eaten). I have lived in Miami and know what Dominican food taste like and it is not at all like anything at this resort not even on THEME night at the buffet.  BEACH - HORRIBLE - Could not get a beach chair or cabana on beach or at pool. Suspecting it may be a problem getting shade on  the beach (travelled with a 2 year old child) I decided to go to the beach at 7:00 am first morning at sunset grand and  look for shaded area (Cabana or Palm Tree) nothing available Went at 6:00 am second morning at sunset grand and again  nothing available. Third morning went to beach at 5:00 am NOTHING AVAILABLE. People put their towels on the chairs at the beach and pool area lounge chairs the evening before perhaps when they get out of the disco/club and dont even arrive at the beach until 12:00 or 1:00 in the afternoon. This I believe was not only inconsiderate of other travellers but should not be allowed by the resort.  CAN NOT GO ON BEACH AT NIGHT - It is guarded by  Security.  BEACH WATER - HORRIBLE - Merky, dirty SMALL SMALL SMALL BEACH I felt I was in a marina not a beach area. There were terrible fumes from the boats and the beach was not very clean   EXCURSIONS - JUNGLE SAFARI only tour worth taking. Food was horrible on that as well. (Lunch meat sandwiches) and that is it. Also took tour to SANTO DOMINGO. Four hours on bus they  stopped us at restaurant to eat (BUFFET) again HORRIBLE I dont know what it is but anywhere we went the food was just horrible. When you are taking an 8 day vacation and the food is so bad your entire stay is going to be miserable. Also, bus had to stop on way back from trip to have one passenger escorted to JAIL. He never paid to take tour however was with us entire trip with exception of 2 hours in end of trip. HE APPARENTLY WAS A LOCAL AND NO TOUR GUIDE CAUGHT HIS ACT UNTIL END.  ENTERTAINMENT - EVENING SHOWS - Can't really explain how they  call it entertainment because my 2 year old could have put on a better show than those shows.  CHILDRENS ACTIVITY CENTER - EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, Nothing to do whatsoever, lady was very friendly but absolutely nothing to do because there were not crafts or supplies in the place. Went to playground only to find broken beer bottles in slides and under crawl area of LITTLE TYKES play area.  RESORT HORSEBACK RIDING - YEAH RIGHT. They have horses but you can ride about 15 feet by 15 feet area.  Dont be foolde either by the shopping at the resort. They claim to bring in reputable jewelry sellers, junk pure junk. Also when you take the excursion to Santo Domingo they let you go into the jewelry store and act as if they are going to give you a good deal because you took the tour - no deals at all.  OUR ROOM was always clean (we left daily tips for the maid) and she always made sure our minibar was fully stocked.  There may be a lot of negativity about this resort from this review however typically we do not complain but this was the worse 3000.00 dollars I have ever spent....................

<Content>Paradise My family and I visited Dominican Republic and stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand for Christmas vacation. I can`t say enough about the place. IStaff is great, food great !!! Weather unbelievable. We walked beyond the resort during the day and its nothing but stretches of beautiful unspoiled beaches. We did some extras the Outback Safari was fantastic !!! It takes you out into the mountains where the locals live, you have a typical dominican meal etc ... It was awesome !!! The marinarium trip was cool too !! You snorkel with Stingrays and sharks too cool !! The coffee there is the best !!! We`ll be back some day !!!

<Content>Total Paradise!!! My husband and I returned from Sunscape Grand last week for the 6th time and as always had a blast!!!  Check-in was great! Thanks Milton! Beautiful room overlooking the ocean and pool. When we arrived to our room there was a fresh fruit platter. Rooms are immaculate! Maid service is GREAT! Mini bar is refilled everyday, no need to ask for anything, it's always there..  Beach was very nice, all kinds of activities such as shuffleboard, soccer and volleyball court. The staff is AMAZING! Always smiling and having fun! There are always enough chairs and huts, there are huts to the left of the beach if you like to shop. Also a massage hut! ahhhhhh, so relaxing!  Pool area is so nice, again plenty of chairs and huts also floating mats. Swim up bar is great to meet people and Juan the bartender is AWESOME!! The Backstage bar has snacks such as pizza, nachos with salsa and sandwiches on rolls or crouissants, they are delicious!  The shows were very entertaining, audience participation night was so funny, lots of laughs. Magic show was great too! The entertainers work so hard and put on a GREAT show! After the show we went to the piano bar and visited JULIO!!!! So much fun! Dave Richards is a great entertainer, Karoke and he ALWAYS gets the audience going! We miss you guys!!!  Food at ALL the ala cartes (Tex Mex  DaMario's) as well as the buffet (Windows) were excellent with a large variety. Beach garden is open 24 hours! Dinner was great there too! No reservations needed! Service was excellent where ever you decided to go.   We want to thank Juan (splash bar) Julio (piano bar) Claudamir, Matias, Daniel, Chocolate and Humberto for making our vacation another memorable one! YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!! I'm sure I forgot a few names so this is for EVERYONE!!!! THANK YOU!!!!!  Special thanks to Caren for all you did for us and welcoming us into YOUR HOME!!!   This resort is the BEST OF THE BEST!!!

<Content>Another wonderful vacation at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand We spent another great week at this resort from January 22-29, having been there also in March of 2004. We chose to return there with our 2 children ages 5 and 7 because it's an all-around excellent resort. My husband's parents joined us on this recent trip and they thoroughly enjoyed it. We are all planning to return next year. On our arrival we were greeted with a signature rum punch which helped to get our long-awaited vacation off to a good start. Our rooms were ready by 2pm. For the amount of time that we actually spent in our room (showering and sleeping), we considered the balcony to be a very nice feature. The surroundings are breathtaking. I've never seen such well-kept flowers, trees etc... on any other resort. The resort is one of the smallest that also caters to children. This makes the vacation more quaint and relaxing as all the amenities (food, room, activities, bathroom, lobby, pool, beach etc...) are never more than 2 minutes away. Hats-off to all the employees who work extremely hard to please everyone.

<Content>The friendliest place I have ever been Their were 16 of us. Not one person in our group had a complaint of any kind. The rooms were kept up at all times. The food was great, and most of all the staff treated everyone as though you were a part of their family. Our group ranged from ages 10-52 the place sure knows how to keep you entertained. We have been searching other places to go and it all comes back to the great time we had at Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>depends on what you're looking for First, my husband and I have visited quite a few all-inclusives in the Carribean and know that it is what it is. We did not go to Sunscape with five star expectations, but were looking for a fun relaxing vacation. Sunscape was successful in some areas; unsuccessful in others. Hope my review is helpful to those of you looking into places to go:Check-in: Went smoothly. We were greeted with cookies and rum punch. Even though we got in way before noon, our room was ready. Room: The room and the bathroom were large and clean, typically Caribbean in feel and style. There was a small minibar with bottled water, a few bottles of soda, and beer. Also a small TV, but the channels were pretty plentiful. If you're expecting plush, you wont find it here. If you're looking for clean and fairly comfortable, Sunscape delivers. A special note: pillows are exceptionally large and plump. If you're used to sleeping on a flatter pillow, or have neck problems, you might have to either go without or bring your own.We tipped the housekeeping staff a few bucks each day, and they were very willing to help us with towels, bottled water, etc whenever we needed it. We also had an issue with a stopped up sink and it was addressed within 10 minutes of calling the front desk.The property: It's very pretty and well-laid out. No matter where your room is, its not far from the action. Our room faced the main pool, so on an evening we opted to turn in early, it was quite noisy. We also heard lots of noise in the early hours of the morning as the staff prepared for the upcoming day. But all in all, the staff worked hard to keep the property clean, and there were lots of exotic critters to look at, as well as tropical foliage. Also, lots of shade by the pool, which is something we havent always found at other resorts.We only went to the beach a couple of times (we're pool people) and weren't overly impressed. I realize that seaweed is part of being by the ocean, but the beach looked overly covered to me. There are a couple of vendors in huts to the left, who will accost you as you walk past. It was very hard to say no, as they were very persistant, but we managed to make it through our vacation only spending $20!Food: Here's the bad news. As hard as I tried to like it, the food was, at best, mediocre. We tried the tex mex restaurant and the italian restaurant and we were less than impressed with both. food was lukewarm and really devoid of flavor. There is a grill on the beach, which serves hamburgers and hot dogs, but I'm not sure what meat they were made out of, and after tasting one of each, opted to eat elsewhere. With the exception of desserts and a few salads, I found nothing that I could actually say was good. Please note that I am not a really discriminating diner and have always found stuff to eat at other AI's, but I really struggled here...with the exception of breakfast, which was OK. Entertainment: Only made it to one show...I thought my kids high school class could have done a better job, and my sentiments were echoed by our friends, but there were some who seemed to enjoy it. We attempted to go to the piano bar one night, but at 11 oclock it was still fairly empty, so we went to bed instead. The daytime activities were fun and seemed to engage a wide variety of guests.Staff: most of the staff were very friendly and willing to help whenever we asked for something. Having been at resorts where they actually know your name by the end of your first day, I sort of felt like that extra touch was missing here. Perhaps it was the language barrier, as I do not speak spanish.Weather: Our weather was a mixture of partly cloudy and an occasional 100% sunny day. It is chilly at night and in the morning, and I did wear a lightweight sweater or jacket every day. There were a couple of nights i actually wished i had brought jeans. I'm sure its different as you get out of the winter months and into the warmer months. Bring lots of bathing suits, as mine didn't seem to dry too quickly in the room.Other stuff: Dont drink the water. Everyone says it, but its so easy to forget and turn the tap on to brush your teeth. I guarantee you'll regret it. Also know that the coconut milk is a natural laxative and take it easy on it when choosing your drinks. Trust me on this one...otherwise you'll be feeling pretty rotten for a few days! Also, the tiles get quite slippery when wet. Be cautious! We had massages while there...a great deal for $30...and very relaxing (and adults over 18 get a free 15 minutes massage!).All in all, it was fun and I'm glad we went, but I dont think we'll go back. For us, food is an important part of our vacation, and it just didnt do it for us... hope this helps!

<Content>Vacation from Hell My boyfriend, along with another couple, traveled to Punta Cana in September. Before we left, we saw on the Weather Channel that Tropical Strom Jean was headed straight for Punta Cana. We were concerned and because we purchased the trip through Apple Vacations and we included the insurance, we contacted our Apple Rep., thinking we should reschedule. We were assured that if conditions were unsafe we would be notified at the airport the following morning and not even fly out. We were not completely satisfied with this response so we directly call the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand Resort to find out what information they had on the weather. We were told that is was beautiful and sunny and that Tropical Storm Jean would be missing that particular area. Well, he could not have been more wrong. Four hours after arriving at the resort, we were invaded by 60mph winds, heavy, intense, non-stop rain and flooded rooms. This tropical strom turned into Hurricane Jean 10 hours after we arrived. Now, granted, a hurricane is an act of God and can not be controlled. BUT, what could have been saved was the customer service that was horrible by both resort staff and Apple reps. at the resort. As for the accomodations- our rooms were flooded above-ankle high, our 2 bath towels were used to keep more water from coming in our room, our bed sheets were mostly wet and stunk like must but the worst thing, NO DRINKING WATER! When we went to ask for more of the mentioned items above at the front desk, we found many other guests of the resort asking for the same thing. They had a pad of paper sitting at the front desk going with a list of rooms that needed particular items. I only asked for the necessities (especially drinking water) and even by the day we left, not one single item was brought to us. I even volunteered to get them my self because of being short-staffed. No, they wouldn't allow that. Staff was completely stressed out, understaffed and therefore it was taken out on the guests. Anytime I asked for information, items for our rooms, etc. I never received a calm, honest answer.Because of the hurricane, for a day, none of the restaurants were open and when we finally got word they would re-open, it was only the buffet for limited times during the day. It rained our entire stay and we even left a day early because more storms were coming. Neither Apple Vacations nor the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand are willing to give ANY type of compensation for our early departure or our horrible amentites or absolutely no amentities in some cases. And neither Apple Vacations nor Sunscape will take any type of responsibility. I certinly do not expect either to take responsibility for an uncontrolable hurricane but I DO expect them to take it for their dreadful and unpleasant customer service. Since the incredibly awful vacation my boyfriend, our friends and myself experienced, we have not and never will reccommend either Apple Vacations or Sunscape Punta Cana Grand to any of our friends or family.

<Content>Overall, it was great but I'm glad I didn't pay the full price! My husband and I just returned from this resort a couple of days ago. We loved the fact that there was 24 hr room service as we checked in pretty late on Friday night and we didn't have to worry about what time the restaurants were open. We found this resort to be quite entertaining as there was always something going on or something to do. They have bike riding, basket ball courts, ping-pong and pool tables and more to keep you busy. Even a characature artist that you can stand around and watch for hours. The food was overall pretty good. It wasn't gourmet or anything but there was always something good to choose from the menu and it sure was a whole lot better than Cuba by far. We never got sick which is all we could ask for. The pool bar was a little crowded but the bar closest to the beach was quick and friendly. The pool area did not play enough music which was dissappointing. It was often too quiet and all you could hear were kids or rock music that American guests had brought themselves. I prefer to listen to Spanish or Caribbean music or I would have gone to the States. The staff was friendly for the most part and most spoke a variety of languages. The entertainment staff was fun and friendly and they had a photographer around the resort that would take pictures of you and you could purchase them if you wanted later as early as that same night. We did find that there were surrounded by a lot of older and more senior guests. It wasn't a party atmosphere and the disco was empty but the entertainment crew always tried to make the most of it with their great attitudes. The nightly entertainment was better than I've experienced at any other resort. The resort is small and more intimate so there would always be people around and it never seemed like a ghost town like other larger resorts. The beach had a lot of seaweed but they were always trying to clean it up. The staff was constantly cleaning the resort and keeping on top of things. The waiters were sometimes slow and some not that friendly. The beach area did smell like fuel from the boats which was not good at all but out of all the resorts in that area, we seemed to have the most beach room and it wasn't crowded at all. The pillows in our room did smell bad and it took us two days to get new ones after asking 4 or 5 times. We were out of the way to be picked up by most of the tour buses so we had to take taxis to a location in town to be picked up which I found inconvenient. Next time I'll find a resort closer to the main area of Punta Cana. Overall, we had a good time but when we go back to Punta Cana, we'll probably try a different resort. I would not recommend paying full price to stay here but I would definately suggest it as a last minute trip, definately!

<Content>Don't Expect A Lavish Vacation My husband and I just returned from the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. We were there for one week, January 14-21. The Internet and Apple Vacations led us to expect something Grand, but it is very average. The people are lovely, kind and helpful. I know some Spanish and this helped as they have few employees who are fluent in English. They were delighted when I answered their questions in Spanish, however poor my command of the language might be. We had no problems with maid service, plenty of towels in the room and at the beach, our room was cleaned early and they came back for turn down service and fresh towels every evening. When I asked for extra sheets, towels, coffee, soap and/or water they were brought to our room promtly.The beach was beautiful, we never smelled fumes from the boats, and anyway, we thought they added to the ambience. The beach was not overcrowded like some were, and Latin resorts always play loud music all day. If you want peace and quiet it can be found, we went to a quieter side of the beach or to the Adult Pool. The food was very poor. Fortunately, my husband and I aren't big eaters, or we would have been hungry. Don't get an omelette, they hand the same bowl to everyone to fill with their ingredients, we didn't get sick, but this is definitely not a good practice. The shows were excellent, we loved them and the staff are extremely funny. We also enjoyed the outdoor movies. We had one major problem, a bed that had been water damaged and smelled horrible. It took two days to remedy the problem. First they replaced it with a smaller mattress, and then they brought the original one back with a pad on top. The smell leached into all of the bedding. It was unbearable, but after taking a pillow to the front desk for them to smell, the problem was remedied quickly. The complaints about seaweed are ridiculous, it's a beach! Yes, sea life grows there. The people work very hard to keep the beach, walkways, rooms, lobby and the entire ground clean and neat. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxed vacation and don't care about good food it's a good place at a great price. If you're looking for The Breakers in Palm Beach, then stay in the states and don't travel to third world countries. These people have nothing, and Americans act like spoiled children, it would be nice to see the Dominincan people treated kindly by Americans.One final comment, we understand that the Summit Group has recently purchased the Sunscape Hotels. They seem to be more interested in profit than in service and quality. We made a second trip to one of their hotels in Tulum in the fall and the sevice and quality of the food were not as good as before. Perhaps we should all be writing complaints to them instead of to the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>Time of my Life ! Really Fun! The PuntaCana Grand is a Really Great place for a vacation. The people on the resort both Staff  Guests are all happy and courteous. I think I got good value for the money I spent. We enjoyed the horseback riding sooooo much. We went every evening at sunset along the beach on the horses. Beautiful We met alot of nice people from Woodbridge Ontario Canada there. I'll go back for sure. Pack lots of nice outfits for the restaurants and disco, because it is upscale and everyone is dressed to the 10's. There is no riffraff there. The children /families all seemed to be from well off homes and well mannerred around the pool and beach. Thank Goodness Great Vacation Spot !

<Content>The trip of a lifetime........ We arrived home on Saturday January 8th and already I am planning our next trip. The hotel is fantastic. I am always amazed at the things people will complain about. I spent 15 years in the Hotel/Motel business as a front desk clerk to a General Manager. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The lighting is a little dim in the bed area but I found it quite adequate for what I was doing...SLEEPING! The rooms are also a little on the damp side....HELLO.....you are on the beach! HUMIDITY! Bathroom was very large , shower was huge with excellent water pressure!The grounds and buildings are beautiful....CAUTION on the tile floors however. If your feet or shoes are wet you will slip. Just walk carefully. I would recommend building four or five if you are not traveling with kids. These are located away from the main pool and most of the activities and very close to the adult pool. The grounds were constantly being worked on. Pruning, sweeping, clearing away debris from the palm trees..........very well cared for.The food is average. Windows has a variety of foods on the buffet and I found most of it very tasty. Is it 5-star gourmet? No, it is buffet food. Di Marios (the Italian Rest.) was excellent. We waited approx. 20 min for a table. Shorter than Out Back! The snack shacks on the beach had burgers and hot dogs with fries and I found them to be just fine. My only comment would be on the warmth of some things.I did not have mixed drinks, tried to stay away from all the fruit juice type drinks as they will cause stomach problems when you drink them all day long for 7 days! The Cervasa- Presidente - is excellent. The bar service is superb. Julio is the bartender at the Piano Bar and he is a delight. German (pronounced Herman) and Ignacio at the American Grill Bar and Adres at the adult pool bar became INSTANT friends who I will never forget. Beach is very clean and spread out. We walked down the beach and found other resorts were packed in like sardines.The entertainment was great. The shows are very cute and plenty of fun is had by all. The Piano Player in the piano bar was a blast. I believe he is only there every other night so make it a point to stop by at least once. For the Gentleman...be sure to participate in Old McDonalds Farm!!!!!!A few pointers....bring plastic mugs with lids for your drinks. The cups are about the size of dixie cups and they will continually refill yours for you. Also bring soap....I had packed the shampoo etc...but never thought about soap. We were given ammenities at check in but a bar of soap (to go along with the body wash we were given) would have been nice. The bar is filled once a day with water, juice, soda and beer. Yes there are only two of each so if you want more bring it with you. Be warned also...if you forget something and need it it will cost you and arm and a leg. Everything is imported so the prices are double sometimes triple what you are used to paying.I could go on and on and on...but we will be back to Sunscape Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>Go to Cancun instead! I have recently visited Punta Cana and i have stayed at this resort. I read the reviews before i went there. Overall I will not be returning to Punta Cana due to smelly sheets, bad food, and mean people. I hope you read this review and do not decide to return here! I will tell you to go to Cancun otherwise! I am returning there for my fourth time!

<Content>second-rate Actually, I blaim the Internet for the overblown expectations I had of this place: when I checked the reviews in December, it was rated #1 in Punta Cana, quite undeservedly so. Upon our arrival on New Year's day, my husband and I were surprised to find quite an average resort with shabby rooms. Among the disappointments, I can list a leaking bathtub, non-working AC (quickly fixed, but noisy afterwards), horrible food at the Garden-something cafe and the fact that the hotel's beach represents the worst stretch of the beatiful Bavaro Beach. While it is no problem to walk half a mile or more to better beaches (as we did every single day), it is also possible to find other resorts at better locations. Non-stop blaring music on the beach and by the pool was annoying, but we were lucky to stay in building 5, where it was not that bad. The distance from the pool did not stop drunk people from screaming in the middle of the night, however. An added pleasure was a $30 fee for late checkout, which was applied despite the fact that with the package we got, both arrival and departure were scheduled for around 9-10 p.m.In general, I totally agree with one of the more recent reviews: by European standards, we would only rate this hotel as three star, and very disappointing in comparison with previous trips - my sentiments exactly!

<Content>A perfect week! We are a family of 4 (kids are 11 and 7 years old) who have been to at least 6 all inclusive resorts before (in Mexico and Dominican Republic). We spent the week of Dec 19 - Dec 25 at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. This was by far the best all inclusive we have been to. No bracelets, no standing in a long line in the morning to book a table for one of the fancy restaurants. You were able to go back to all the restaurants more than once and get served instead of standing in a line at a buffet. Food was very good, great kids activites, an excellent manager - Hans from Holland- who was everywhere to make sure everything was handled properly. Great spa. Tennis lessons for $25/hour. 5 minutes from a golf course and only 25 minutes from airport. The resort was neither too small nor too large (If you forgot something in the room, you could easily go back to the room and get it and be back at the beach or the pool in 3 minutes). All staff very friendly. There organized plenty of beach and poolside activities, but (unlike many of the other all inclusive places) if you wanted to relax and read, you only had to tell them once. Nice size rooms and perfectly cleaned each day by the lovely maid. My only complaints would be the lack of light in public bathrooms and the hotel room. They need stronger lightbulbs. And my husband thought there was too much techno music played by the pool. Would we go back? Yes, in a heartbeat!

<Content>a dump!!!! Christmas vacation with my family and brother's family. I expected sun, fun and did not expect to get sick.I never drank their water but I did eat their food.Problems :smelly, dank, dark rooms. There were no towels in the bath or at the beach.Stocked mini-bar had 2 bottles of water, one sprite, 1 beer, and Coca Cola. Big dealNo chairs available at the beach or poolFood was worse than a college food service.Italian restaurant ok but has 3 hour wait. Frankly anyone from NYC/ north jersey eats better in local pizzeria than this place.Purpose of trip was sun and fun but I am still having diarrhea a week later.A real disappointment.Rip off add-on$10.00 /per person admission fee to Dom Rep, Not part of package. Needless delay at airport to collect same. No pens to fill ot forms that could have been completed on airplane and fee added to All Inclusive fee.

<Content>Not As Nice As We'd Hoped Looking at previous reviews of this hotel, it seems as though people either love it or hate it. We fall somewhere in between. We鈥檙e professional, Spanish-speaking Brits, aged 50, and are well-travelled in Latin America, especially Mexico and Chile. We visited Sunscape between 15 and 29 December, 2004. The hotel foyer was impressive and well-decorated for Christmas. The grounds are well maintained. The Entertainments Manager maintained a high profile and was visible several times a day doing his rounds. We agree with some previous comments about the rooms: ours was dark with a view only of a pathway and the next block. Everything certainly gets damp and remains that way (perhaps dehumidifiers should be installed?) and we thought it was a bit much to be asked to pay for use of the room鈥檚 safety-deposit box. We encountered the occasional mosquito and cockroach but the chambermaid kept the room very clean, especially the bathroom. The food is definitely poor: poor standard, poor choice and tasteless. Only the American style bacon is good. The dining room staff vary from unhelpful to surly, with just a couple of exceptions. We often had a long wait to get our first cup of coffee at breakfast and refills were very difficult to come by. It was very weak, American-style coffee, anyway. However, the hotel did pull out all the stops for the Christmas Day dinner on the beach, and Christmas Eve dinner and the themed Dominican nights weren鈥檛 too bad either. Congratulations go to whoever is responsible for the carved fruit and flower decorations in the dining room.We ate at the American Grill once and experienced a half hour wait for a table although there were plenty empty when we were shown in. It appeared to be understaffed. The food is second rate. The Italian restaurant serves better food, but my aperitif was snatched away before I鈥檇 finished it and our main course arrived before we鈥檇 had time to eat the starters which were then removed. I think they were trying to rush us. We didn鈥檛 go back. The Beach Garden Restaurant was a ghastly fried chicken and chips (French fries) type of place. Breakfasts were not available there during our stay, except for very early morning self-service coffee and rolls. Unfortunately there was no beach barbecue either, due to bad weather.There are absolutely no discernible boat fumes on the beach and the swimming area is cordoned off for safety. If anyone thinks boat fumes are a problem, they should either use the pool or walk half a mile or so along the beach where there are some lovely areas for swimming. There is sometimes a problem with seaweed, according to the weather conditions, but if it鈥檚 bad in one area you can often walk along the beach and find a clear spot, and it鈥檚 nothing like we鈥檙e used to in the UK anyway. Activities were poor and badly organised, although the evening entertainment on the stage wasn鈥檛 bad for a hotel. It was also rather annoying to have to listen to two conflicting lots of loud music at the same time by the pool. The lyrics of some of the rap music were unsuitable for a family audience anyway. Drinks, especially the cocktails, were very weak and often inconsistent in the way they were made. The hotel should look at the timing of the (children鈥檚) film that they show each evening. It seemed to us that there was more interest from adults than kids and the timing during dinner wasn鈥檛 convenient for anyone. The weekly programme doesn鈥檛 change either, so if you鈥檙e there for more than a week, there鈥檚 nothing new and indeed, I see they were showing the same films back in May of last year. No wonder they break down from time to time! We went on two trips: Saona Island and Santo Domingo. The island trip was excellent and very good value. The capital city is not very interesting, but that is hardly anyone鈥檚 fault. On both trips, we had a very informative guide and guest safety was a strong priority. Two other points: Americans, please do not tip. It is not necessary, at least not until the end of your stay, if you really must. You will get far better service if you can manage to speak a bit of Spanish! And, to those North Americans who were having loud conversations in the corridor of Block 5 at 2.30 in the morning of December 18th, thank you for waking us up! You know who you were. By European standards, we would only rate this hotel as three star, and very disappointing in comparison with previous trips to Mexico and St Lucia.

<Content>Very nice resort!! What a beautiful resort!! I've been to a few resorts and have never seen such a lush and beautifully manicured resort. Honestly, I spent most of my time by the pools, but the few times I went to the beach I found it very, very nice. I will break down the good and bad of the resort below.Food - This was hit and miss. The American Grill served great food and the waitstaff were a lot of fun. They even came to our table and did shots of tequila with us, great bunch of guys. Look for Santiago and Humberto, they love their tequila. The Beach Grill was also good for lunch with many American foods and Windows was also good for Breakfast. Other than that, the food wasn't up to the standards of US food, but the still did their best to offer a wide selection. Bars - The bars and their staff were fantastic!! The Pool bars are great with very friendly staff. Umbrellas, the Piano Bar, was a great time. Ya Man, the Piano player, is a lot of fun and the bartender is also very funny and a great guy.Front Desk Staff - This is one of my only complaints. They were very disorganized and not really showing much customer service. Accomodations - The rooms were average. Nothing to write home about but nothing that would stop me from going back.Entertainment - Great. The staff goes out of their way to make sure everyone has the opportunity to have a good time.Tours - We did the Jeep Tour offered by Prieto. This was enjoyable as I am a Jeep enthusiast and enjoyed driving in some rough terrain. It was humbling to see the way of life of most Dominicans, but the tour could have been done in a half day. The buffet served on a private beach for lunch was probably the best overall food of the trip. Connections - Our travel agent, Liberty Travel, booked us with Prieto for our connections to and from the airport. Neither went smoothly. Upon arrival, we had to sit in a van with 8 other people for a half hour waiting til they found one more person to fill the van. Not enjoyable. Our departure from the hotel to the airport was even worse. After a half hour of waiting for the van, we had to call a cab to take us to the airport. When we were about 15 minutes away from the resort, we saw the van coming down the road to pick us up. In essence, they never showed up and almost left us late for our flight. The Bellman said that Prieto does this all the time. I definitely recommend going with VIP or Apple, as most we talked to had no problems with either.Summary - The resort itself was beautiful. The service outside of the lobby was great. The waitstaff are incredible, tip them a few times and they will wait on you hand and foot. The food is average and the drinks are great as well. Overall, I would recommend it to anyone I would just do a few things differently, like using someone other than Prieto.

<Content>One of the best vacations ever! OVERALL: I'm not quite sure why anyone is complaining about this place, because we had an amazing time. I guess every vacation is what you make of it. Our group took full advantage of the activities the staff put on around the pool and beach...they had volleyball games, merengue and bachata lessons, water aerobics, yoga, olympic games for the kids, tennis, etc. If you're the type who likes to be active and have fun, this place offered plenty to do! But, it wasn't a party resort in the sense that you couldn't spend your time relaxing quitely. STAFF: Amazing. They are all such genuinely good people who want you to have a great vacation. Especially RIGOB, ANDRES, CHOCOLATE, IVONNE. These guys MADE our vacation! I have been on many vacations to the Carribean and Mexico, and this was one of my favorite places. From what I saw, the people here are not beggers. They are proud of what they have, but they are incredibly grateful to whatever they are offered. POOL: Yes, it was hard to get seats if you were lazy in the morning. But we always managed to get one from our group to reserve some by 8 or 9am. BEACH: From the reviews I've read, it seems like the water is always different. While we were there, it was beautiful! I don't know what gas people were talking about ?? Of course there was some seaweed in the water, but every morning the workers would rake up the weeds washed on shore. Also, you can walk for miles on the shore. We walked about 2 miles up and discovered a reef right up on the beach with a bunch of cool creatures and shells. FOOD: It was better than I expected for buffet. They definitely have a wide selection and all the restaurants are different. The Italian was my favorite...excellent presentation. The grouper was fabulous. They also have ice cream at the bar during the day and it's some of the best I've ever tasted. DRINKS: They will make ANY drink you want with whatever alcohol you request (if they have it). They had Stoli, Baileys, etc. If you're picky about beer though, they only have Presidente on tap and a couple of other bottles in the rooms. However, the Presidente is very good. Put a lime in it and it tastes just like a Corona. NIGHTLIFE: They put on shows/movies every night and will accomodate for rain. The best shows are the ones the staff puts on..they dress up and it's very funny. They also do a lot to involve the audience, so don't sit in front if you're shy! :)PRICES: Suntan lotion, medicine, candy are very expensive b/c of import taxes. But everything else is reasonable. There are shops on the beach to get souvenirs. Thank you to the staff for a wonderful time! I hope to return next year. If anyone has any further questions feel free to email me.

<Content>MMM cookies I went with my family of four from the 23rd of December to the 30th. The weather was amazing...only with one day of rain that happened to be our last day there. As a twenty-one year old, I thought that going with my family was going to be pretty lame, but I met alot of MOSTLY cool people who were sort of my age. The beach was beautiful-white sand, and there is a cool natural pool you can get to if you walk a little ways. The nightlife could have been a little better, with not much to do but drink like a champ, and go to the discotec or piano bar. The drinks were strong enough that I had a great time every night, however. The food was alright..nothing to call home about, but the cookies they give you when you get there are worth the trip. Seriously, indulge all you can in those cookies. The staff were 9 out of 10 very friendly..did I mention that the cookies were AMAZING? Have fun!

<Content>Worst AI I've been to, try Mexico, its better!! You arrive after a two day delay and the lobby looks nice as does the pool area. Then the staff who check you in tell you that they haven't been advised of your delay and there's a problem. Although you've paid several thousand dollars, they were unfriendly and have a lack customer focus.You are given two damp rooms right by the beach on the ground floor. Only to find out these are the last rooms to go as the corridor floods when it rains!! The rooms are dark, cold, damp and miserable. Although this AI, there are parades of people trying to sell you photos, boat rides, zoo trips, etc etc. We had to pay the local agent to get a quick transfer from the Airport.I'll be constructive:Good things: Great beach and nice location. Pool area and gardens quite nice.Bad things:Room Towels were unavailable to late in the day most days?????? Maid service so slow. Food is absolutely terrible, we all got sick except by 5 year old. Stopped eating by 3rd day.Loads of exhaust fumes from boats. Our room was damp and had ants continually invading the sink area. No plug in the sink etc etc. Pillows smelt very bad without going into detail and the TV was the size of a portable.I've been to four AI's and this was the worst. Some of the staff are nice but others unhelpful/unfriendly.

<Content>LOVED THE SUNSCAPE GRAND I will say that the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand was quite an experience. My husband and I went with 3 other couples and it was a riot! We are all in our late 20's-30's and had a wonerful time! When we got to the airport, we were a little confused as to where to go and what not, but found our way shortly after with a little help. They got us onto a bus which the driver was very funny and I was trying to speak spanish to him, and I had no clue! We got to the resort and they had a drink for us with cookies while we waited only a short while for our room. We got to the pool and unfortunatly i wanted a drink at the swim up bar right away and the bartender was away for a moment so I did the duty of hopping up onto the barstool and hopped back behind the bar to pour some drinks for the guests and myself, when he got back he was pleasantly surprised and told me you done here, you go now and I was on my way after making $7.00 in tips. The food was good, the drinks were good and the staff were all very friendly! I highly recommend it~ Have a good vacation~!

<Content>Best Holiday I've Had My husband and I stayed a tthis hotel from 16th Dec - 23rd Dec. We went to Cuba in June and hated it and therefore very dubious about Dom Rep. Nothing could have prepared us for complete difference! The hotel was great with planty to do, plenty of choice on where and what to eat and drink. We also thought the entertainment was great, especially Dave Richards in the Piano Bar. The staff in Cuba were rude, surly and completely uninterested in offering a service even when tipped (and we stayed in a 5 star hotel). Whereas the Domincans were so freindly and couldn'y do enough for us even without the tips! The only complaint we had was the lumpy pillow and having to listen to alot of americans whining that 'it's not like this back home' You don;t say. Maybe thats because it's not home and you are in a very poor country yet we found everything outstanding. We didn't take our children but even so there were so many things for kids to do with their own play areas etc so we are in the process of booking up for same time next year.My advice is 1) Don't go to Cuba. 2) Ignore all the bad stuff the Americans have written. 3) Remember you have a sense of humour and lastly for good live entertainment go see Dave in the Piano Bar!!

<Content>Dec15-22 (2 adults in 30+, 3.5 year old toddler) Not sure where to start positives or negatives. Stayed in bldng#4 first floor facing pool, building between Italian and Beach Cafe. ROOMWe didn't have any problems with room or maid service or towels, on contrary, our relatives did. They had broken phone, air-conditioner was not working when they got there, not enough towels, water got into the room after afternoon storm and more...FOODWe prefer mexican style food rather than american style food and this resort was rather opposite. Avocado was not served a whole day long as we were used to in Riviera Maya. Salsa and chips were only available after 12.00 at Backstage bar. On another hand, sandwiches, burgers and french fries were available at Beach cafe and Backstage Bar lunctime thru about 4pm. Beach Cafe lunch service was nice if you wanted to sit down and get served. Also, all drinks including coffee and tea were served by waiters in buffet ('Windows') as well.No reservations required for dinner, no seating time or limit on how many nights. 3 choices - Seafood, Italian and American Grill. Seafood at Beach Cafe - NOT air-conditioned, open twice a week, horrible service, after almost 2 hours food came undercooked and barely warm. American-Tex Grill - air-conditioned, great food and service ( doors said closed Thursday but it was closed at least Friday as well). Italian - air-conditioned, great service, nice food and desert, closed Tuesday.Usually, Thursday is beach dinner party but during our stay we had storm on Thrusday so beach dinner party didn't happen.Buffet - less choices that one may expect but those provided were often of good quality. Morning - cottage cheese or such would have been appreciated. Also, 3 type of cheeses and 3 types of deli available repeated morning after morning. 3-4 types of cereals, yogurt selection. Fresh fruit/milk drinks could be mixed for you but fruit selection varied from 3-4 types available down to 1-2. No nuts or other toppings howerver. Fresh fruits were Okey so better other days. 4-5 Juices were too sweat and watery for my liking.Eggs and omelets could be cooked on grill for you as usual. Belgian waffles too dry. French toast and pancakes Ok.Lunch/Dinner - beef was rarely found. Pork or fish were usual grill selection. Few days only pork was offered. I think grilled beef and chicken was only offered once on Italian night, beef fajitas quickly run out another night, few nights before - grilled calamari were offered which was tasty variation. 2-3 types of Pasta could be cooked for you with 2-3 souces to choose from. Mash potatoes i think were only available once as well.Variety of grilled vegetable dishes were good. Usually, offered 1-3 during one seating. There were tempura style vegetables as well but I didn't try those as I don't like it. Few salads were unusual but good as well. Avocado was offered every 2-3 days only.DRINKS - bar service greatly varied. I would echo that splash bar (Juan Cruz) and backstage bar (Rafael) during the day by far had the best service and tastiest drinks made. Other places served me watery tomato juice and another time WARM tomato juice, in addition to making other drinks by what seemed to be inconsistent or incorrect recipies and no it was not compensated by smile or service.EXTRASResort is compact, you are close to everything. We like that. Resort has extras that we have not seen in other places. Amenities: donkey ride for children, once a week optional trip to Matinee park with kids club staff, dinner for kids at 6.30 with kids club staff, family movie at 7.30 before mini-disco at 9, camping night on tuesday that keeps children buzy until midnight, playground located on the beach and at children's club. Shaded area to play table games on the beach. Shuffle board, bocce and horse shoe play areas. Also, volleyball, soccer and badminton fields as well as area for baseball and basketball hoop. Fruits being cut for you on the beach, selection varied so. Few days fruit stand had Mango that was great, in addition to pineapple, watermelon and few others..POOLgreat size, area for aerobics and watersports (volley, basketball, waterpolo), pool was the same depth which i liked so i never had to worry while driving my son on yellow water matress provided by hotel. There were plenty of people just resting on those matresses in the pool and enjoying themselves.BEACHSomeone previously wrote about boat smell, i think it is true on many occasions. Resort is closest one to touristy fisherman place. Also, water next to resort was murky with a lot of seaweed on 4 out of 4 days. It cleared later in the week and we could see fish. I guess it depends on weather and wind conditions.If you walk about 15 minutes along resort shoreline to no-man territory, water is great - no seaweed and see-thru all days but beach is rather dirty there because territory doesn't belong to any resort.Last resort after which no-man land began was called Blau.We spend all our time on the beach so periodical smell from boats and murky water would be the biggest turn down for us.

<Content>Not a nice place... The good: Freshly squeezed fruit juices in the morning. That's it for good...The rest of it: The beech is horrible. A lot of sea weed, dirty water, constant noise from motor boats and party boats. The smell of gasoline from the boats all day long. My daughter got stung by the sea lice on the second day and spent four days taking cortisone and steroid pills and shots and getting her wounds cleaned at the doctors office. I don't care about $240 in medical bills...the best part of vacation was getting out of there. She had spots that looked like 2nd degree burns and they mostly cleared only after 3 months. The resort management didn't want to take any responsibility because the beach is the Federal property and the resort is not responsible for anything that happens on the beach. Hmmm...according to their brochure they are displaying flags when there are jelly fish in the water. My wife and I also were stung by something in the water, but we had milder reaction, but it still looked like good burns for couple of weeks. The food is something else. It is hard to imagine how much effort they put into making the food inedible! The duck legs tastes like roadkill. The rabbit in sour cream tastes like...have no words to describe the taste....actually there is no taste. I'll eat about anything, but I can't understand where they get cooks who can make fresh fish taste like toilet paper. The only thing that they know how to cook is the bacon.The suggestion: If you enjoy spending your time in a pool with peeing kiddies and getting loaded - this is the place to be! If you enjoy dirty beach with who-knows-what floating in the water and love inhaling gasoline fumes - this is perfect place! If you enjoy resort management that doesn't give a hoot about your problems, unless you are represented by some agency that does a lot of repeat bookings for them - this place is tops, thought I doubt that other resorts are better! Make sure that you bring at least $200 in small bills for a 7 night stay - got to tip maid every day if you want your towels replaced. Don't forget to tip barmen for every drink, or you will become invisible very fast! And most important, stay away from fresh milk and tap water while in DR.Feel free to email me at pollitra@ix.netcom.com if you have any questions. I'll try to answert them as my time permits...I am a slow writer...it took me about 4 months to sit down and write this review.

<Content>Typical AI - Would go back if the price was right... Booked last minute deal to Sunscape Punta Cana Grand via Apple. Two from Chicago from 12/15-12/19/04 for $549.99 each. Stayed at several AI's in St. Luica (1), Riviera Maya (3), and this was our first time to DR. Flights - USA 3000 was alright. Condor Airlines impressed me. German based crew was very good and professional.Resort - Starting to show its age. Cracked stucco everywhere which may have been from the hurricane but am not sure. Little things here and there were either very worn or broken.Food - Typical AI food! Italian was good and the Tex-Mex was good but buffet is very typical with a smaller selection then other AIs. Presidente Beer on tap. Banana Mamas were excellent bar drinks. No cappiccinos, only espresso.Beach - Beautiful sand beach. Never had a problem finding a shaded chair. Staff did an excellent job of picking up the seaweed which washed ashore. No big deal! However, what did bother me was that there seemed to be a lot of trash in the water. Don't know if this is from the hurricane or from the locals, but it is a shame to see. Also, the pictures and staff will tell you that you can snorkel from the beach, but that is incorrect. There is nothing to see except sand and seaweed, only saw one fish. The boat that will take you to a reef off shore about 3/4 mile is US$17/pp and the reef is nice but is showing some signs of usage...Scuba - Both my wife and I are certified with about 30 - 40 dives. Shop was okay and the staff was fairly friendly, but the DiveMaster was very new. Stopped the dive at one point to surface to see where he was. Just not impressed at all... which is a major bummer since I usually do a dive a day. Only did two dives as a result. Pool - Nice pools, larger pool is kind of busy with all the kids. Adult pool is very quite.Guests - Lots of Europeans (some nice-some rude) but they are topless on the beach and adult pool. Rooms - Typical AI rooms. Stocked mini bar. We stayed in 5314 which is very quite and great view of the ocean. I tipped $10 to the clerk when checking in and I like to think that it helped. Only disappointment was that we tipped our maid $5 per day and never received any towel art! : (Bummer, but I am sure the maid appreciated the extra $$ especially this time of year.Staff - I was kind of disappointed. Perhaps it is just this hotel, but the staff seemed kinda rude or they had an attitude or maybe just a cultural thing, but both my wife and I thought that the Dominican's were not as friendly or nice as those in Riviera Maya. Not everyone spoke English, but we were able to get by with most of the staff.Overall, you make what you want of the vacation. I probably would not go back to this Sunscape but would give the DR another chance at another resort.

<Content>Poor Service Beautiful Resort, but horrible service. This is not the place for good communication. About 80% of the people do not understand you here and you can't understand them. When you ask them a question they will look at you with confusion, put up a finger (as in wait one minute), and not return... There was a moment that we were hungry after hours, I ordered a tuna fish sandwich and was told okay it will be 20 minutes, it went way over 20 minutes so I called again, they said it was on it's way up-another 20-30 minutes past, I called again  then they told me they don't have Tuna fish sandwiches-So I had to order another meal and wait another 20 minutes...This place is also bad as getting you things, it's always wait five minutes, and you will wait anywhere between 30minutes to 1 hour and thats only if the remember you.... The food was okay, but I've had better. Not much of a selection at the buffet, mostly the same food night after night..... The activities were fun! The shows were great!!! But I wouldn't come back to this resort ever!!!! I think I'd try the Iberostar or the Catalina....

<Content>Great Resort !! Great Time !! Just returned from the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand Monday 12/13/04.Traveled with two other couples. The resort was fantastic ! Stayed at the Catalonia Bavaro last year and there is no comparison to the Sunscape.The food was great, had no problems. The Shimp at the beach cafe and the Italian was the best. There was not one bad meal all the time we were there. The buffet had plenty to chose from. The staff was the best I have meet at any all inclusive we have stayed at, right up there with the Iberostar resorts we have stayed at in Mexico. The grounds were very well kept and clean. It is not a hugh resort, seemed to be just the right size, if you have to go back to your room for something not a long walk from the public areas. Room could use alittle upgrading, but very clean, air worked well. Nice beach, even had bar service while at the beach, a nice touch. Nice pool with swim up bar. Can't find anything bad to say at all about the resort. Talked to people from the Alegro (sp) the resort next to the Sunscape and the food was so bad people were checking out, some trying to come over and eat at the Sunscape. Will be returning to the Sunscape next Dec.. A great resort.You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Sun  Our stay at Sunscape was in the begining of December. We traveled with a total of 22 people. The weather was wonderful and we had only a couple minor showers. The hotel staff was the best! They always went out of their way to make sure you were happy. We had a large, loud and crazy group and the staff made sure we had fun and allowed us to party like we wanted to. The hotel rooms could have been better. They did need some updating, but we were never in them! The resort was very clean and it was amazing to see how hard everyone worked there.We went snorkling right off the resort and saw some wonderful fish and coral. They allowed you to feed the fish, so remember to take bread with you. The food was good and most in our group liked it. I found the food much better here than in Mexico. It's not what we're used to in the US but you have to remember where you are.We felt very safe in the resort. The security was everywhere! We walked the beaches out of the resort during the day, but did not go out of the resort at night.Overall, we had a wonderful time and would go back again to the Sunscape.

<Content>Nice but.... We visited over Thanksgiving 2004.Nice place in general....Good service....Nice grounds (they seemed recovered from the hurricanes). Food was pretty good and so were the drinks.We went all inclusive so it was nice. Ocean was nice...lots of seaweed off the beach, but no biggie.Snorkeling was by boat from the hotel....$17 per person for an hour.Rooms were nice and pretty well kept.Negatives are the noise and the water area.I prefer to sleep about 11-12 PM. But they had a show every night til 1 -2 AM that was loud with lots of bass pounding music.In the AM, workers would wheel these loaded carts for work that sounded like they were coming into your room! lol But they were loud enough to wake me up every time.Water area is roped off to prevent all the boats that roar past from cutting you up.All in all, not a bad place.

<Content>Loved the Dominican My husband and I returned from the Dominican 23/11/04. It was our first vist to the Dominican and it was fantastic. We were there for three weeks, and had quite a lot of rain, but we do intend to re-visit, more towards end November beginning of December. The staff were amazing, friendly, helpful, happy and entertaining. Food was great, with plenty of choice. Gym and activities were just as described in brochure. Rooms were very comfortable. We went on 2 trips: Monster truck, which was great, bit sad at times when visiting poor villages, but would recommend it, and Saona Island, which was disappointing as the beach was no nicer than Punta Cana and the sea was full of rocks, so very difficult to get in. We met some wonderful people. The only complaint would be that if it does rain, there is nothing to do. All the daytime bars are openair, a few extra indoor bars would be nice. or perhaps shutters around pool bar for bad weather.

<Content>Grand time at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand! My wife and I just returned from this beautiful resort on 12/1/04. We absolutely loved it. The beach, both pools, the staff, the room, and all of the activities were first class. The only problem we had involved the Tex-Mex restaurant at the American Grill Restaurant. This restaurant had been closed for remodeling, and re-opened a few days ago. Perhaps this explains one of the worst restaurant experiences we ever endured. We were told to expect a 30-40 minute wait, which turned into 1.5 hours. When we finally got up to the restaurant, we were shocked to see so many empty tables. So why the wait? The food took a very long time to arrive, and they forgot my baked potato, which really didn't matter by then. Other than that, we loved the resort and would come back again some time. Hats off to Juan Cruz at the Splash Bar, and Juan at the Adult Pool bar for their excellent service and hospitality. The grilled schrimp at the Italian Restaurant was excuisite!! -Dave  Jean

<Content>looked great before the hurricane hit having been to the dominican before and reading the reviews of the sunscape complex, i was really looking foward to this vacation. i'd booked two weeks from the 15th of september. but as we left england we were told their was a tropical storm/hurricane jeanne heading in that direction, the holiday reps reassured my party that it would be fine and they'd keep us informed if there was any chance danger. to cut a long story short my party (including my six month old son)arrived at the hotel eight hours before the hurricane hit. lets just say the next couple of days were close to hell. the only good thing was that the staff went out of there way to help my party especial my son. on the saturday when the complex was finally getting back on it feet, and we could look forward to our last week or so there. we were evacuated and sent home for our own safety. to make matters worse when we got home we were then told we'd only be getting 25% back of what we paid for this trip. i've nothing against sunscape and i am actually thinking of return there early next year when the weather a bit better (haha) but check the small print with the holiday company please.

<Content>Good food, Great drinks and pretty grounds My boyfriend, Ken, and I just returned from a week at Sunscape Grand and overall we had a great time. The employees work very hard to keep everyone happy and the grounds are very nice and well maintained. Overall the food was good. We always found something to eat and I overdosed on the salsa during the day at the pool bar. Some people did get sick, but that happens to a lot of people in all THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. Take precautions, drink a lot of water, get out of the sun sometimes and choose the chicken over the beef. It is hard to tell what does it to people because we all ate different things at different times and people's bodies reacted differently. The cheese is fine, I don't understand those complaints. Remember things are processed differently because you are in a DIFFERENT COUNTRY. The drinks are free flowing and they make them very strong. (Rum and Coke with a side of Coke please). The Presidente beer was just as good as any light beer that you have here. I think I liked it better! The only complaint I have is the beach. I thought from reading other reviews that the seaweed was an exaggeration and being from CT we are used to it. There was a lot of seaweed! The staff cleaned it up the best they could. Other islands have crystal clear water and no seaweed. But we don't layout at the beach anyway! From speaking to people I learned that the seaweed is because Punta Cana is located where the Atlantic meets the Caribbean creating stirred up water. Other travelers recommened to try the La Romana area which is on the Caribbean side of the island. My boyfriend, who has not traveled to the Caribbean before, was not bothered by it at all. I think most of the hotels in Punta Cana have similar water. Lastly, a big hello to Ed and Robin, Maddy and Jack and Kathy and Brian! Hope you are all doing well!

<Content>Excellent Vacation We just got back from a nine-day stay at Sunscape. We left on November 10th from Bradley Airport in Windsor Locks, CT at 6:00 am, and arrived in Punta Cana about 4:00 pm, with a three-hour layover in Miami in between. As we entered the airport, our pictures were taken. We proceeded to another desk where we paid $10.00 per person for our declaration green cards, which are needed to exit the country. They gave us four cards, and although the sign says to fill out all four, we didn鈥檛 have to. We went to another desk where the officers took the four cards and our passports, took two of the cards, and returned the other two with our passports. Before we left the hotel the last day, we completed the other two cards. After picking up our luggage, we found the Prieto tour desk to get our transfer to the hotel. The ride was about 20 minutes, and we arrived about 5:30 pm. We were the only ones on the bus and checking in, therefore, check-in was quick but we did not get our welcome drinks or cookies. We figured because of the hour we checked in, we weren鈥檛 going to get them anyway. It was no big deal to us, as we just wanted to get to our room and change for the manager鈥檚 cocktail party, which started at 6:30 pm. The party is on Wednesday, and you are given champagne and appetizers. There is also some sort of entertainment.RoomOur room was located in building four on the second floor. Everything was in working order. The room was large, had a four poster king bed, dresser, two night stands, a television in a cabinet, which also had a refrigerator with soda, water, juice, and beer. There was also a coffee maker, and a large bathroom with the sink outside the bathroom door. The mattress seemed a little hard, but we had no trouble sleeping at all. It appeared that all the floors were available in our building, but we could see that building five had some floors shut down as they were putting everything back together from the hurricane. However, by the time we left, most of the floors were available.HousekeepingAll in all, the housekeepers were good. We did have a couple days where we needed to ask for towels. The room was always clean though. We do have to say, it may not be cleaned first thing in the morning. There were a couple days when we went back to the room after lunch and it still wasn鈥檛 done, but we didn鈥檛 stress over it. In the evening, while we were at dinner, they came back into the room and gave us fresh towels and turned the bed down. We always tried to leave the housekeepers a little something, whether it was chocolate, money, or pads and pens to write, to let them know we appreciated the work they did. We didn鈥檛 get special treatment, or weren鈥檛 expecting it; we just knew they appreciated the gesture.FoodWe thought the food was good, and plenty of it. For breakfast, the Beach Garden Restaurant did not have the continental or ala Carte breakfast as other reviews mentioned. Windows Restaurant was the only place for breakfast, and it was buffet style. There were eggs made to order, cereal, pancakes, waffles, French toast, fresh fruit, yogurt, and various hot dishes to choose from. There were lots of homemade bread, rolls, muffins, and pastries as well as several different juices to choose from. For lunch, we mostly ate at the Beach Garden Restaurant, which we ordered off the menu. There were salads, pizza, and sandwiches for the most part. The sandwiches came with fries, so there was more than enough to eat. The pizzas were also a good size for one person. We also ate at Windows a couple of times for lunch. That was buffet style with plenty to choose from. Hamburgers and hot dogs, which were made for you, pastas, a grill that they cooked the special of the day on, and also various hot dishes to choose from. There was a salad bar and soup, plenty of breads again, as well as a dessert table. For dinner, there were always three restaurants open. Windows was buffet style, and we only ate there twice. One night they had lobster tails, which are much different than what we are used to, and the other night was Italian night. Plenty of food, but we only thought it was so-so. We felt the lunch buffet was much better. The Beach Garden was open on the nights that the American Grill and the Italian restaurant were closed. We only ate there once for dinner. It had several items to choose from off the menu, and although the portions weren鈥檛 huge, it was plenty if you ordered an appetizer and dessert. We went to the American Grill two times, and the items on the menu included steak, ribs, and fajitas. As other reviews mentioned, the fajitas are great. We also tried the steak and ribs the other night we went. Again, not huge portions, but plenty for us as they started you off with tortillas and salsa, plus we ordered an appetizer and dessert. We ate at the Italian restaurant three times, and we were very pleased with that. The garlic shrimp and angel hair pasta is great as well as the veal medallions. The Caesar salad and buffalo mozzarella on tomatoes were great appetizers, and the tiramisu and canolli were great dessert selections. The canolli is more like a cream horn, and very light and tasty. We also tried the tortellini and seafood soup for appetizers, and the stuffed chicken breast for dinner. Those were good choices as well. The beach party, which is usually on Thursday, was cancelled due to the weather, but all the other restaurants were open that night. At the pool bar, there were snacks from 12-6 each day. There were tortilla chips and salsa, finger sandwiches, pizza, and popcorn. We usually headed over there about 4:00 for an afternoon snack. They also put out coffee, tea, and cookies about 4:00 on the upper deck of the pool bar as well. We did not get sick on the food at all, but because of the change in our diets we did spend a little time on the toilet. We look at it as less weight we gained, so not really a bad thing. The service in the restaurants and bars was great. We didn鈥檛 feel that anybody was looking for tips, and we didn鈥檛 tip all the time, but the times we did we could tell it was appreciated. WeatherThe weather was not the greatest. It rained for a total of two days. Our first full day was a wash out, but we brought travel scrabble to pass the time. It rained a half day two other days as well. Sometimes you need a break from the sun, so the rain didn鈥檛 bother us much. It was very windy while we were there, and we didn鈥檛 think it was all that hot. The sun was in and out of the clouds, so maybe that had something to do with it. We did get our share of the sun, and did come back with a little tan, despite the clouds.PoolsThe main pool is large, and it also where the kids are, so it can get very noisy. There are plenty of chairs, and we did not see where people held on to rafts either. Sure, some people got up early to hold their specific chair, but it wasn鈥檛 necessary. Our travel agent told us, before we left, that the adult pool was going to be closed for repairs. After a few days of being there, we went and checked, and it was open. It is much smaller, more shade, and not too many chairs. You really need to get there by 9:00 if you want a chair. The hot tub is also there, but it was not hot. The water was just a bit warmer in the hot tub than the pools, and the pools were chilly.ActivitiesThere are plenty of activities you can get involved in if you want. They did not push you to do anything. We went to relax, and that is what we did. In the evening, there is a movie at 6:30, which we did not attend, and a show at 9:30, weather permitting. The show lasted about an hour, and we thought they were pretty good, even funny at times. After the show, the disco and piano bar open. We walked into the disco twice, for about a minute each, and left. There wasn鈥檛 much going on at 10:30, but maybe later it got busy. We never made it into the piano bar.As for bugs, we did not get bit at all. We didn鈥檛 have to use any of the bug spray or lotion we brought, but it鈥檚 good to have in the event there is a problem. One night we saw them spraying for bugs though. The marina is next door, and as other people mentioned smelling the fumes, we did not. Maybe it was the time we were there, and maybe the wind helped keep the smell away. There was also a lot of work being done on the grounds, between building a new deck around the Beach Garden Restaurant, and painting in the lobby and around the pool. This did not bother us at all as we thought it was great that they were keeping the property clean and updated, however I am sure some people were disturbed by it.All in all, an excellent vacation, and we wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to go back again. Go, have a good time, and remember it is not the United States or any other country that you are from.

<Content>vacation from hell Before going on our trip to punta cana we were watching the weather because of all the hurricanes. we called our apple representative to confirm our trip, hours before leaving for punta cana. We told him there is a hurricane going to hit the the night get there, and he said if you dont get on the plane you dont get a refund. So we got on the plane Sept 15. and arrived in punta cana around 12:00pm we had four hours of sun until it started raining and in the middle of the night hurricane jeane was hitting punta cana. our hotel was in better condition then others but it was not a vacation. it rained the whole time we were there. then they cut the trip short because they wanted everyone out. i think apple vacations owe me some kind of refund for risking my life in the hurricane, cutting my vacation shorter, not getting to use the facility at the resort because only one restuarant was open when there should have been four open, i couldnt work out at all because the gym was closed. we had to stay in our room pretty much of the time. and the rooms were flooded with water and there wasnt any air condition our room started to smell. no maid service had to go days with out clean towels. the only nice thing to say was it was beautiful the first four hours. and the staff was great the entire time. but this was truly a vacation from hell...

<Content>Best vacation ever, BUT NEED SOME HELP Hi everybody, me and my friends just got back from Hotel Sunscape and we had a blast. The hotel was amazing and staff was very nice.Food was good, nobody got sick. I agree about the Tex Mex restaurant ... you must try the chicken faghitas. It is delicious!There were great shows in the evening. We even participated in one and that was fun. The animation team was great. Always lots of stuff to do. We really liked those guys. Especially Rigob. He was the max. We told him we would stay in touch and we got his phonenumber. But the problem is: at the airport they stole our bag, so we lost everything. Question to all the people reading this review and who are going to sunscape: can you please give him the message that the Belgians lost his phone number and cannot call him. If you want you can ask him for his number again and mail it to me. Tell him we are doing our best to make him president of Belgium ;o) LOL.If you have the number you can mail it to me at: anaconda1977@hotmail.comTHANKS VERY MUCHAnyway ... if you do not know if you are going or not: don't hesitate, book the trip and have a good time ...Enjoy

<Content>Survived Hurricane Jeane at Sunscape... My husband and I (along with another couple) stayed a week at Sunscape back in September. Our wonderful vacation was cut short mid-week when Hurricane Jeane decided to pay us a visit. Prior to the hurricane destruction, we found the resort to be beautiful. The pools were clean, the staff was friendly, and we had a great time. We really enjoyed the Tex-Mex American Grill....the margaritas were the best! The Italian restaurant was also very good. The swim-up bar was a lot of fun and the disco is a must. The night of Jeane's arrival we were told to prepare for a tropical storm. Being from Indiana, we had no idea what to expect! The winds reportedly reached 80 miles an hour and it was a little frightening in our top floor room! After everthing was over...it rained for days and days and days. We kept busy by playing cards and Scrabble. The resort staff continued to be very professional and they provided all of the guests with plenty of food and bottled water. We were impressed with Sunscape before the hurricane and after. We would definitely stay at this great resort on a future trip to the Dominican Republic. However, we plan to avoid travel during hurricane season!

<Content>Very Relaxing! We just got back from Sunscape Punta Cana Grand on October 30th. We had a great time and great weather. Don't believe the weather forecasts. It was supposed to rain and thunderstorm everyday we were there. It did not even rain once. Everything was great at the resort mostlyFood - Awesome! I am a pretty picky eater, but I found so much stuff. You have to try the Chicken Fajitas at the American Grill a la carte. Yummy! The buffet was great too. Everything and anything you can think of.Entertainment - Always lots of good shows each night. Movies for kids(Nemo, Shrek, Pirates of the Carribean..etc) The shows are hilarious, always good for a laugh.Staff - Very friendly, awesome bartenders(Chocolate is awesome, he is cute too!) Bring them something from home, they really appreciate it.Activities - Tons of stuff to do to keep you busy. Water games, aerobics, shuffleborad, bocci ball, volleyball, soccer, baseball, snorkelling, boating, paddleboats, and the list goes on forever. Pool - Pretty good size, very clean and nice swim-up bar. Beach - Beautiful, although a little bit of seaweed and stuff because of the hurricane, it keeps washing up even if they clean it up all the time. Very fun trampoline in the ocean.COMPLAINTS:All the brochures say that horseback riding is included. It's not, they try and charge you $20 per person. Keep an eye on the people working at the front desk. When you need to make a phone call with a calling card, don't let them read the number off of it. They copied mine down, and called the USA and used up all my minutes.The bridge over the pool was under construction our whole trip. We had to walk all the way around.Other then these complaints we had a great trip and wonderful relaxing vacation!!

<Content>Relaxed and Entertained -Oct 16-23 It's very tough to follow a finely detailed review like that but here goes:The grounds were kept incredibly well. There was very minimal damage but no real signs in comparison to other resorts nearby.Try to find a dead blade of grass at this place. The plants and flowers are changed and cultivated regularly.The rooms were clean and the air-conditioning was running nice and cool. For those who care about TV's, you have your free DishNet stuff at your disposal for your movie and ESPN needs.room service - 24/7. Drinks - 24/7.Being the off season for resorts, this place was really quiet. Nice and quiet. It seemed like there were maybe 100 people at the resort tops.The restaurants were fantastic. DiMarios has nice elegance with great Italian food. I loved the bread, and the angel hair pasta.Don't be stingy on the wine, just because who have to buy them, doesn't make it a bad thing. There are some nice bottles on that list. Always loved the Ruffino.Tex Mex made me laugh. It's not my type of thing visiting an hispanic country and watching them act American but it did put a smile on my face.Make sure you tip them nicely for the tequila that's mandatory post meal. They really are nice people.My personal favourite, the Beach Cafe, nice in the day, very pimp at night. The seafood piella for 2 was amazing and don't shy away from the strawberry cheesecake.Windows food was nice as well, a decent selection and it's a buffet for those who like to eat that way. It doesn't have as much elegance as some of the others.The swim up bar was flowing. Thanks to Juan Cruz for keeping me topped up, or perhaps, tanked up.Chocolate and Rafael, thanks for the Bloody Caesars. You made them just the way I liked them.The disco was great for blowing off some steam. For those that like to shoot loose, order 100 tequila shots and hand them out to everybody.The piano bar has a nice, flavour to it, just to talk and mellow out.If you compare this to the Catolonia, which is pretty much why everyone reads this stuff, to compare to other resorts, the staff at Sunscape were more friendly, it's smaller, more intimate and the grounds are better well kept. It's only a 5 dollar cab to Catalonia so if you want to golf it's right there. Hope this helps anyone in need of an honest review.Special thanks to our American friends, Gary and Anne, that we met on our 3rd day. You are a nice couple and it was more than a pleasure meeting up with you and having dinner.Cheers

<Content>It was terrible (to leave!) We truly enjoyed our stay at Sunscape Punta Cana Grande (Oct 18-21). Here's a lengthy run-down on our short stay.The staff-They make you feel so welcome. Now I understand why and how people who post remember the staff members names. Our favorites were Osvaldo and Pena (accent over the n) at the Windows buffet in the am, Adan and Milton at the check-in, Carlos at the Beach Garden (lunch). I'm sure that I'm forgetting a few. Martina and the guys at the towel handout palapa were great, too. Once they found out that we were Red Sox fans, we were always greeted with Ganamos! (we won!). It was amazing to see how into baseball they are and supportive of the Sox due to the Dominican players on the team.The food-You can't go wrong at Windows. I'm a choosy eater, but always found something to satisfy me. Local items that I loved were fried green plantains, yuca, chinola (a tart local fruit), and of course, the chicarrones (small fried pieces of chicken the night we went to the Dominican buffet). I certainly gained weight on the desserts, and again, I'm picky on that note, too. Da Mario was nice- though the dishes were just OK in my opinion. We're too spoiled by restaurants in Boston's North End. so. . . But the Italian cured ham (proscuitto) and melon was right on. I loved the tiramisu- they presented it with 4 thick slices of chocolate on the sides, which made it look like it came in a box. The flavor was pretty authentic. Cannolis aren't what I'm used to, I'd call these cream horns. They are filled with mousse and taste great.The Beach Garden is a great, casual place right off the beach. The burgers were savory, the cheesesteak sandwich literally is steak, cheese, onions, on a sub roll, sliced in 4. Don't expect a Philly Cheesesteak. I enjoyed the presentation. They have icecream cones at lunch, too. The Tex-Mex restaurant was a hoot- the decorations and the music were what you'd expect of that theme. I'm not a Tex-Mex fan so I'll spare you my opinion there.The rooms-Request a 3rd floor room and you'll enjoy a high ceiling. We got placed in Bldg. 3, though I wanted 4 or 5. 4  5 were only occupied on the first floor so in the end my choice wasn't an option. 1,2,  3 are close to the main pool and are noisier. Merengue is non-stop, so you'll have to love it. When we left, they were repairing bdlg. 4 5.The rooms were spacious with bright yellow flowered bedcovers. The safe deposit box is in room. They also give you a welcome pack of shampoo, body gel, lotion so you can skip packing those. The shower pressure was fine, as was temperature. They have Sunbeam shower heads and clock/radios in the room. No problems with getting hand towels though we brought extras. The bed was fine- we like slightly firmer mattresses. The sheets were OK too, though I brought one just in case. Some of these precautions I took based on previous complaints.You can also request an upgrade- we did at check-in, but nothing was available. They do have a VIP type package- no comments since we didn't use it. We did later at Secrets (we were offered an upgrade to Secrets later).The grounds-Clean, well-kept. They really care for the place. We got a kick out of the ducks near bldg 1  3.The beach-We didn't spend any time at the pool. The beach was fine. Yes, there is seaweed, but we weren't turned off by it. The staff was there at 7 am raking the little piles and they worked through the day until 4 or 5 pm. Hard workers!!! The marina wasn't unsightly to us, nor were the little shacks on either side of the beach. But if you want a rolling surf, no seaweed, no boats in your view (there were very few during our stay), go elsewhere (and save Sunscape for the rest of us!).Also, we didn't see people saving spaces at 4 am in the morning- possibly because it was low-season or most people favored the pool. We'd be out there all day and there would still be places to choose from. We also liked the lounge chairs better at Sunscape- Secrets had faded yellow pads which retained wetness and smell. Suncape has blue stretchy fabric over the chairs, which work out better.Tennis courts-They are well-maintained clay courts (better maintained than Secrets' courts) and the hurricane didn't destroy the lights, so you could play until 8 pm.Water sports-We took out a kayak and the next day the catamaran. You may not get any instruction, depending on who is there. We were find with the kayak, but had no experience with the catamaran prior to that. They will make you sign a waiver or purchase insurance ($3/ day or $10 for the week).whew! That's the long of it. We expected very little based on the complaints, but we nevertheless enjoyed the food. We'd stay there again as it was an excellent value. Go if you aren't going to hold them to an unfair standard, and you'll enjoy it. I actually missed the friendly staff after we moved to Secrets!!! Sunscape, we'll be back!Finally, we liked how we were never pestered by vendors. Sure, they tried, but for the most part if we said no, they let it be. The Dominicans are great people and I respect them for their level of service.

<Content>Best vacation so far !!! We went Oct.16 - 23/04. The rooms were huge with 2 queen beds or a king bed. The food and service was superb. No reservations are required, just go and eat!! The only thing i didn't like was their cheeze. Dominican cheeze is different. The resort was very beautiful and well kept. They also had lots of good entertainment daily, including live shows at night and big sreen movies. A good place for kids as well. I've never seen people work so hard to please and always smiling and very friendly. We had no problem leaving a few bucks tip at restaurants, even though we didn't have to. We met alot of nice people there and they were also quite impressed. I couldn't find too many things wrong with this place. Overall, it was excellent. Heads up to Brad  Liz for inviting us on our 15th. Gracias!!!!

<Content>Oct. 14 to 19th My wife and I just returned from the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand last night after being there for 5 nights. The place is incredible! First of all, we were a little worried about hurricane damage prior to leaving鈥f you are worrying about that as well, stop worrying, I would have never known a hurricane had gone through by looking at the resort. The Natura Park located adjacent to the resort was undergoing some serious repairs and was closed, but the Sunscape is perfect.FoodI thought the food was great, my wife and I had no trouble finding great stuff to eat. Windows buffet was our favorite for breakfast and lunch. We tried the beachfront caf茅 for lunch and it was good, but the Windows selection was so incredible it was hard to justify going anywhere else. I zoned in on the fajita station for lunch and the made to order omelets for breakfast鈥ut we literally could have lived in Windows and been happy鈥ntil we found Dimario鈥檚 and the American grill. Dimario's was fantastic, really good food (Shrimp Pasta鈥mmm), excellent atmosphere (it was our 10 year anniversary, so atmosphere was somewhat important), and pretty incredible service. (Service was phenomenal throughout the resort though, so you almost got used to it. I have never been treated so well by so many nice people, and have never experienced service that could even hold a candle to what I experienced at the Sunscape.) The American Grill was my wife鈥檚 favorite. They had some black bean soup that was fantastic, and the steaks we had were good. The only thing I will say slightly negative about the food is that the cheese we had, in all of the restaurants, was not like the cheese we have in the US, it was more like different flavors of velveta. After the first day I just kind of avoided heavily cheesy dishes, but I think most people would probably have no problem with it鈥 am a little picky about dairy products. Best guacamole, next to my wife鈥檚, in the world, hands down.DrinksAnything you want to drink鈥eriously anything鈥nytime (unless you like beer, then you are kind of stuck with the Presidente, which everyone says is great, I never tried it, too busy drinking all the stuff I always wanted to try). We did see several people hauling cases of Presidente home on the plane鈥ou have to really like a beer to take it home with you on a plane.Beach/PoolsThe beach was beautiful, the water was warm, and the breeze was great. The water was a little deeper and a little darker blue than I was anticipating. The only other Caribbean destination I have been to is Aruba, so compared to Aruba, it is deeper and darker colored, but still incredibly beautiful. We kayaked and snorkeled. We took one snorkeling trip to the reef, well worth it, tons of fish.We spent most of our time at the pool, which was great. Lots of room and very clean. The pool was beautiful at night as well. We swam in the adult pool a couple of nights and had it all to ourselves. The only thing lame about this resort is some of the selfish people who visit here. The practice of 鈥渃laiming鈥?a chair by putting your towel on it, then disappearing for the rest of the day is just rude, and it is unfortunate that others feel pressured to do it because they think they won鈥檛 have a spot. We resisted the selfish urge and still always had a spot to rest. Some people even 鈥渃laimed鈥?the floating mattresses by folding them up and putting them on a chair鈥IDICULOUS鈥?never ceases to amaze me how lame and selfish some people can be鈥nough of that though. We still never waited much more than 20 minutes for a mattress when we wanted one. Pools and beach were great.MISCThe entertainment was fun, we went to the show every night, and enjoyed it. The piano bar was fun, and there is a great saxophone player who works there鈥e never made a mistake, loved listening to him. The disco isn鈥檛 our thing, but looked fun enough. There is so much space to spread out and find your own quiet spot. I was a little concerned it wouldn鈥檛 be romantic, but it was, and still the people with kids appeared to be having a lot of fun. We talked about wanting to bring our kids there sometime. We made some friends from Philadelphia who said they would want to bring their kids there as well (hey Dave and Sandy!) Overall it was great. I would definitely go back to Punta Cana, and would definitely want to stay at the Sunscape.

<Content>A Nice Place to relax....... My husband and I just returned from the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand yesterday, October 16, 2004. We have travelled to different parts of the Caribbean, and the Sunscape was smaller than some of the hotels we have stayed at but this can be a plus...no huge line-ups at the restaurant, quiet spots on the beach,etc. The grounds were clean and well-groomed, our room was average, clean and a nice view.We chose to eat at The Windows Restaurant which is a buffet so I can only comment on it. The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent keeping on top of clearing away our used dishes, refilling our glasses, etc. I found there was a variety of food and never had a problem filling a plate or two. The desserts were amazing and I wish there had been a problem filling a plate!!!!The beach was average and could use a few more huts for shade, but clean and safe. Paddleboats, kayaks, catamarans, etc. were all available, however we did have a problem getting someone to show us the basics of using a catamaran. An hour lesson was offered for $25.00 US, but no one wanted to show us....not enough wind (people were out there using them!!!). After the third day, we finally ended up taking our chances and went out on our own had a great time and saved ourselves $25.00!!!! All in all, it was a nice vacation and I would not have a problem recommending Sunscape Punta Cana Grand to anyone.

<Content>Relaxed!! We visited the Punta Cana Grand back in July this year and whilst most of these reviews are of relative quality, we are very disappointed to read of peoples problems with this hotel. Having travelled extensively around the Carribean, Africa and Europe, I think we qualify as well seasoned travellers! This hotel was mainly set up for Americans and we met a lot of lovely American people there during our 2 week stay. Unfortunately there were a few Americans who appeared to be unhappy unless they complained.......every other country is NOT the same as America!! Being there as a couple meant we had the choice of joining in with the Family pool entertainment or having a thoroughly relaxing time around the adult pool, were we found the staff (especially Domingo) very polite and accomodating and we especially loved the bar service around the pool, which you will not get in many places. At night, the entertainment was based on trying to satisfy a wide variety of people, children and adults alike, we enjoyed everything we did or watched, as you have a choice about what to do.....because its your holiday and you choose what you want to do!!! The entertainments staff were fantastic, (Especially Fredrico and Juan Carlos, not forgetting Mimi!!!) they all work very hard and always had a smile and a laugh with us, even when we made it to the disco and made fools of ourselves!! We did both suffer from stomach problems but......not to an extent were we had to remain in our rooms and then again, this is only to be expected when travelling so far from the UK! The choice of food was absolutely fine, although I would say it got a bit boring at the end of 2 weeks. We loved our room, which was very clean and a well stocked bar, made a bit of difference. From talking to others it appears that block 5 is the best....if you dont have children as its the quietest!! All in all, we had a wonderful, relaxing time and we laughed a lot..is that not what holidays are all about? I can therefore fully recommend this hotel for a wonderfully relaxing holiday where you actually have a choice for how you spend your time with the staff at Punta Cana Grand.

<Content>Honeymoon at Sunscape My husband and I went to Sunscape for our honeymoon on Sept. 6. Hurricane Ivan was heading in that direction but we decided to risk it. Fortunately it decided to go south of us. We had a wonderful time. I was a bit hesitant after reading the negative reviews, but it was a beautiful place. Our room was a superior grand on the top floor of the 4th building and we had the best view on the island-gorgeous!! The service was excellent, but it probably helped that we tipped a few dollars. Those people work so hard for so little. The drinks were plentiful and strong. The only big negative was the food. We both got sick. Be sure to bring Immodium. I'm also very picky about food and couldn't find much to eat. Most people did okay, though. Except for the food, we had a wonderful time in a beautiful place. Also, go on the Safari excursion. We went to the most beautiful beach and had Dominican food (beans  rice) to eat. Well worth the money.

<Content>Much more than we expected We got a great deal on Sunscape and then we read the reviews posted here. We headed off for our trip with very low expectations assuming we'd get what we paid for. However, we were pleasantly surpised by the quality, cleanliness, and service of the resort. We were given a partial ocean-view room which was beautiful. The staff was always pleasant and helpful and the grounds were beautiful. The food was excellent, too, with so many choices that we only regret that we didn't have time to try more selections. We drank the filtered water in the restaurants, ate whatever we pleased, and never got sick! When going to Punta Cana you have to keep in mind a few things: this is a third world country, it's the tropics, it's the beach, at the ocean, and it didn't cost you a fortune for a great vacation.

<Content>Holiday From Hell!!!! My husband and I took a holiday at the Sunscape from 15 July to 29 July last year (2003). We never realised until just recently that this Trip Advisor website existed but, having discovered it, we feel obliged to put our Review on. Before I go any further, we have to tell you that we have never complained about any other hotel we have stayed at before and that we are extremely well travelled and would not complain for no reason. We have been to the Caribbean many, many times, we've been to Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore and all round Indonesia and have never had any problems. The Sunscape, however, for us was the HOLIDAY FROM HELL!! There was and, by reading the reviews, there still appears to be a major hygiene problem there. I went on this holiday perfectly well and two weeks later, after being admitted to the local hospital twice and put on IV, returned home 18 pounds lighter and very, very ill!! Fourteen months on, I am still ill, I have not gained any weight, I have not worked and I am still on medication and having to go to the Department of Infection  Tropical Medicine in the UK. Whilst we were there, everybody upon everybody was being ill, some worse than others! When we complained to the hotel, we were just told there is no problem here, you must have a weak stomach, it's the oil the food is cooked in! I had already been to the Dominican 6 years before and had eaten and drunk everything and had not even experienced a Spanish tummy! Whilst in the local hospital, I was treated for a parasite and I am still being treated for an exotic parasite back home! We took no risks while we were there, we never left the complex, we never drunk the water and we never cleaned our teeth in anything but the bottled water. Sorry, but anyone that says there is no problem with the hygiene of this hotel, has to think again!!I am sorry to have to be so negative but I really cannot say anything good about a hotel that makes you this ill. If anybody wants to ask any questions, please feel free to e-mail me anytime. It would be good to hear from anyone else that has also been ill from this hotel.

<Content>A great break from the winter blues I was planning my annual winter getaway and was thinking about the great time I had at Sunscape this past Feb. ( 2/7 to 2/14) After reading these recent reviews, it got me to thinking that I should offer my thoughts. I am a male in my late 40's and travel alone. The staff made feel very welcome and comfortable.My room was on the first floor of building 5 facing the managers homes which was next to the adult pool. I might just be easy to please but I thought the rooms were great ( no bug problems), room service was great, and never had a problem with running out of clean towels. One thing to remember, they put bottles of water in your room for a reason! Don't drink the tap water. There was seaweed on the beach but every morning they were out there raking it up and loading it on to trucks. I didn't ever smell the gas fumes that have been mentioned.Having a pocket full of singles goes a long way in making the bartenders happy. Most of the guests were friendly and there for the same reason I was, to have fun. Of course, as always, there were people that just couldn't be made happy. I did see several people get sick and then hear them blame the water, food ect. However, they somehow didn't remember the 20+ pina colatas they enjoyed the day before. Whoops!!Luis at the adult pool bar will keep you laughing until your sides hurt.There were a lot of kids there and seemed like there was always something going on for them.I like to get up early, eat and then hit the beach and pool bar so I didn't really go to the disco or piano bar but heard they were fun.I only ate at Windows but I had plenty of things to choose from and the cooks all remembered meeach meal. Also, there was food all day at the Backstage Bar and at a grill set up on the beach. Simple but good food. (Burgers, dogs, chips and pizzas.)I would highly recommend Sunscape for a great time. I will be returning Feb. of 2005 only this time I'll have several friends along that can't wait to have as much fun as I did.

<Content>Best Service. Simply heaven. I have recently returned to Chicago from a short stay at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand (Sept 10-14th). Fortunatly we left the morning before Jeanne arrived. I sure hope that the staff and everyone is allright! Especially Boris!~My fellow girlfriend and I travel to a different country every year and have stayed at many different All-Inclusive resorts. This resort by far exceeds my expectations of Customer Service! In my travels I have never seen the employees bendover backwards for you and every one is smiling all the time. Most of the employees have learned basic French and English. I was so impressed that a resort will take the time and energy to do this. The guests that come here are also fun and entertaining. (I think it is the stiff drinks! But at least it is a better quality liquor than some resorts that I have stayed at.)My girl friend Tina and I we happy that there were other people from the States many resorts have been mainly european (no offense) but there was always some friendly to talk to.The food was excellent in the ala cart resturants. It was also great to be able to not have to make reservations for the resturants and you can go to each ala Cart Resturant more than one time per stay. De Mario's is excellent, the shrimp pasta was amazing, I am willing to come back to this resort just for that dinner.Well If anyone has any questions please feel free to email me. jkildew@nchmarketing.comThis is a resort that I will be coming back to in June 2005!

<Content>If Paradise is half as nice... ...as Sunscape Punta Cana, then Paradise must be a fantastic place! Put simply, we had the best holiday of our lives at Sunscape - the place was just faultless. The gardens were beautiful and immaculately kept, the rooms airy and spacious, and the staff couldn't do enough to help; they always had a smile and were sincere in every effort to ensure you enjoyed your holiday to the full. (Special mentions must go to Luis, Otto, Boris  Michael, who were a credit to the place.)The variety of food was excellent, with a choice of four restaurants: Tex-Mex and Italian (American Grill and De Mario's) were available, plus Windows which offered all manner of menus - best place for breakfast was the Beachfront Bar (Steak  Eggs rule!) As for drinks... well, the waiters rarely let your glass go dry.The main pool was a little too noisy for our tastes, but an alternative was offered at the quieter Adult Pool/Plantation Bar (where Luis worked); there's also a jacuzzi there. This was a real oasis of calm relaxation (apart from the odd over-noisy American!)As for excursions, avoid Dominican Discovery which is overpriced and sadly doesn't live up to its potential, and the trip by catamaran to the so-called deserted island of Seona which was just jammed with fellow tourists and all a bit of a let-down. But... the Marinarium just along the attractive beachfront offers the opportunity to swim with sharks and stingrays, simply one of the most amazing experiences ever!! Also, don't listen to the rep's downer on horse-riding: the animals are very well looked after and our ride along the coast was simply wonderful.Our holiday ended on a sour note when Hurricane Jeanne tore through the resort, causing terrible damage - it was so sad to see all the wreckage on the morning after. But the hotel staff continued to do all they could for us, even under the most trying conditions (which is more than could be said of our rep, who was a disaster... never mind, that's not Sunscape's fault).All in all, just brilliant - and we will return, although hopefully without Jeanne!!

<Content>Holiday with a wild ending Just come back from sunscape Punta Cana, having been delayed a day due to Hurricane Jeanne which hit our Hotel Thursday morning at 2.00am. It was devastating to see the damage it had done, ruined beautiful gardens, both swimming pools and tore roofing off. This happened on the last day of our wonderful holiday. The hotel is execellent and also the staff, They will do anything for you. The bar staff and waiters in the restaurants are so friendly, they want to serve you all the time, anything you want they get for you.The food is execellent, especially in the Italian. American Grill and the Seafood Restaurants. The main Restaurant Windows was ok but got a bit crowded and you had to queue especially at breakfast. Recommend to go to the Beach Garden Restaurant for your breakfast ( waiter service) having Steak and eggs for breakfast, over looking the beach and sea. Once a week they put on a beach BBQ party,(weather permitting) that was fabulous.Went Horse riding along the beach $20 for an hour. The horses are in good shape very well looked after regardless of what the reps tells you. Trips such as the Dominican Experience and Sonia Island were not really worth the money the day is too long and very tiring. Swimming with the sharks (its ok as they are only nursing sharks and vegetarian) is the best trip, its only half a day and you can walk along the beach to get the boat that takes you out to meet them. In all it was a brilliant holiday and the Sixth time we have been to Dominican, but the first time in Punta Cana.

<Content>Great People My fiance and I went down with some friends 10/10/04 - 10/17/04. We thought the place was great and the people were even better. In spite of Ivan out to the west, the weather was beautiful... up until Jeanne came through. Punta Cana got hit pretty hard and our resort had sustained a lot of damage. Even with the chaos that the hurricane had left, the staff really came throught to assist all the guests. They had plenty of food and alcohol (most importantly) and the staff stayed in great spirits. They were even still running room service! We heard horror stories from one of the other resorts, Secrets (supposedly one of the nicest resorts on the island). Apparently Secrets was really damaged and then the security guards started looting the place and they had guns!! Even worse, the hotel management wasn't doing anything about it. Someone at the resort had to call the US Embassy to get help. The guests had to be taken out of there by military helicopters and had to leave most of their belongings behind. Hearing those stories made me even more thankful for the staff at Sunscape.

<Content>Great vacation Hubby and I went for a relaxing 8day-7night stay at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand Resort (Sept 4-11, 2004) First time we鈥檝e ever done an all inclusive package and love it . The Dominican people in general are very nice, food on site was very good, and is a nice selection beach day/meal.Drinks 鈥?little strong, but I guess that鈥檚 the Dominican way. Beach 鈥?seaweed is there due to being on a coral reef, but they clean it up many times each day. Water I expected something more crystal clear, but if you walk about a mile or so down the beach 鈥?there is nice clear water with no sea weed and bath tub warm. The beach itself clean, white sand with no shells to cut your feet, and Oh My.. TOPLESS beach, there are some sites!The resort in general is very nice; the shows they put on each night are every entertaining and funny. The resort is very family friendly and has activities all day, such as water aerobics, beach volleyball, and tennis, bike riding. The resort even has their own donkey family onsite.While there we did an excursion 鈥?Outback Safari - $75 per person an entire day event, and very nice, and educational. Makes you really appreciate what we have at home. We would enjoy coming again in the near future and bringing the kids this time. The Dominican Republic is a very beautiful place to visit and the Sunscape Resort is a nice reasonably priced place to stay with your family and friends.

<Content>Dream Honeymoon at Sunscape After cruise plans fell through for our honeymoon a couple weeks before our wedding day, I had my husband call some local travel agents to look into all-inclusives. Sunscape was very highly recomended by our agent; who also got us a wonderful deal. I must admit, landing into the Punta Cana Airport gave me some reservations as to how our trip was going to go. But once we got through the non-english speaking airport and the bumpy ride to the resort I was just astounded by the beauty. From the moment we stepped in thier doors all of the staff was so pleasent. Our room was very clean with promt maid service ( almost a little too much so), the maid knocked on our door around 8:30 every morning. She had no problem waiting until we were ready to get up and go on our way for the day. She kept our mini-bar well stocked every day of our trip. The food was exceptional, very wide variety, it ranged form the usual cheeseburgers and steaks that my husband prefers to numerous types of seafood dishes that I enjoy. We couldn't ask for better service from the waitersPatricio and Angel both went well out of thier way for us. My husband is in a wheelchair so we could not visit the American Grill restaurant becuse it is on the second floor with no ramp or elevator so,they brought the American Grill restaurant to us. Once a week they have a huge beach party dinner. With it being on the beach, I could not get my husbands wheelchir through the sand. Although we declined, the staff offered to carry him in his wheelchair through the sand to accomodate us. They offer endless drinks, although they do make them VERY strong even if you ask them not to put too much alcohol in them. Every evening a movie is offered, as well as contests and comedy type shows.I can't imagine the type of service people that speak negatively about this place are accustomed to. Everything was exceptional and we would highly recommend Sunscape to anybody that wants a nice relaxing, laid back vacation, and do plan on visiting again. Next time we plan on making it a family vacation with us and my parents. My only real suggestion would be not to travel ANYWHERE in the Carribean in August or September, since it is hurricane season.

<Content>Had a Blast! We stayed at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand along with our 2 girls 4 and 2yrs and my mother 8/26-9/1. We all had a blast!!!The grounds were beautiful, clean and well kept. The food was quite good especially on the Dominican Night, the food was traditional and delicious. There was always something for everyone and we were always happy.The staff was great! They were always smiling and very helpful. We took $75 in singles and lots of $5 and it gave us great pleasure to tip for wonderful service. We also took along crayons, pencils, notebooks, gluesticks, etc. and gave them to the staff we got to know had children. They were so grateful especially since school was to start the following week. The Dominican people are very hard working and you would never know they were tired because they just always had great smiles on their faces.Overall the resort is a small wonderful family friendly place. Our girls had a great time, made great friends (Elena, Ashley, Melissa Kyle) and are still asking when we can go back.Thanks again to the wonderful staff...Paulina, Yahira, Andres, Juan Carlos, Osvaldo, etc.

<Content>Freddy Boy I went to this hotel in April 04 it was great the staff were friendly especally Freddy he made up a song while we were there and every time we saw him he would come over to us a big smile and start singing his song.The food was great, I am quite fussy with my food and always found something I would like in windows buffet restaurant. We went to the American grill a few times because I just loved the Chicken fajitas they were lovely.There was also another restaurant right by the beach which we went to nearly every day for lunch because you could choose from a menu from burgers to sandwiches and pizza's lots of variety.There was a ice cream machine which you could help yourself to during the day that was great especially for the kids.We went in quite a big group of family and friends but I would definatly recommend to couples and familys and big groups to go it was great.You would certanly never go hungry or thirsty at this hotel.There was a show every night and also a film being shown every night before the show, which was great, the films were upto date great films that both kids and adults would like, the shows were great to some were very funny and some were great dancing shows with lots of colourful costumes.

<Content>Nice Place but very small. We spent 1 night and 2 days at the Sunscape due to a flight cancellation. Coming from the Palladium Bavaro Grand Resort, the Sunscape was a bit of a let down for the tail end of our trip.The Sunscape is a very nice clean well kept resort. Its also very, very small. The rooms are Okay but are motel style as opposed to villa style at the Palladium. I did not like the motel style room set up at the Sunscape. Its like a motel at a travel lodge along an interstate highway. The pool is small and gets abit crowded. The beach is also very small, maybe 250 yard stretch. The sea here is not carribean like. The sea is dark and there was a lot of sea weed in the water and on the beach. We did not see anyone in the sea swiming. The grounds are very well kept and tropical. Food selection is limited even at the buffet, but seemed to be very good quality. The drinks are great. Very good quality drinks and good booze.The lobby area is very appealing and very well kept. There is a disco and an indoor a/c piano bar.Although this is a very nice place, We would never go back to stay at the Sunscape. Its way to small of a resort with a poor beach/ocean and to many other negatives. We prefer the larger resorts like the Palladium. The beach at the Palladium is one of the best in the world and its about 3/4 of a mile long. There are tons of things to do and things to see at a larger place like the Palladium.

<Content>Paradiseo My family of 4 2 adults, 14 and 2 year old stayed from 8/29-9/3. The grounds were as reported in several write ups- fabulous. The Food was great! I had rib-eye steaks every day for dinner. There were several options every meal-buffet  al acarte. The beach was nice, not spectacular. They had a kids club for ages 4-12. The drinks flowed 24/7. The entertainment was nice. The Sunscape or Punta Cana is not really a night life mecca, so if you have asperations of partying all night long, the resort is not the place to do it with others. Remember that drinks don't stop flowing-ever! If you are with a crowd you can create you own party on the beach-no problem! There is a disco on site for 18 and older, but there is another club called Mangos in town. If you have specific questions, I suggest that you call the resort directly. I went through apple vacations and they have an english speaking rep on site all day. Call the resort and request to be transfered to the rep. I called ahead and found out that laptop computers could be connected to the web in the room for $2 per connection. My connection was for 3 days, 19hours and some minutes. I never disconnected, so I never had a phone line. Call ahead! My bill was $2 for the internet. The computer saved our asses because I was able to track Francis live via the web and finally I found out that our return flight was cancelled really early because of the web and was able to be re-routed VIA JFK to Seattle with the family. We left a plane load of passengers behind. Thanks to the technological advantage we are home! We have been to a few all inclusive resorts and the Sunscape, with the exception of the beach appearance, is nearly tops. We have been to Couples in Ocho Rios, Crown Paradise and the Cancun Palace in Cancun. Bring a big cup if you like a lot of volume and dont want to walk to the bar too much. Bring 100 1 dollar bills for tips- you will be the queen/king, and remember that this is the third world. Vorizon cell phones work, but us phones will be roaming. The apple rep told us that the cell phone is the cheapest way to call off the island even with roaming charges. Incoming calls only have to pay roaming plus air time. I don't have Vorizon so contact them directly if you are a Vorizon customer. Sprint and Quest phones did not work at all. If you have any questions, please ask via email. Frank

<Content>The shower **** The Sunscape was fantastic. The ocean was calm, the food good, entertainment great, everything was wonderful....except for one thing...the shower. We thought that there was something wrong with the shower in our room, as there was absolutely no water pressure. We complained and were put in a different room. Alas, the same thing there. It may seem such a small thing to some, but I need a good shower! Because of the overbooking, guests were offered an upgrade to Secrets Excellence. We decided to take advantage of that and just loved Secrets. However, the ocean there is quite rough and I nearly drowned! If it weren't for my husband, I may not have made it back to shore!

<Content>Club Tropicana drinks are free Yes, my caribbean knowledge before our holiday to Punta Cana was limited to the lyrics of the Wham song. But I have listened to it a lot, so I do know what I'm talking about. If you really tried, like some people seem to, you could find probably find a couple of petty problems to moan about. If you want to have a wonderful holiday, it's very easy to do that at Sunscape. The week my wife and I (early 30's) just spent there was amazingly relaxing. The white sands, clear Caribbean Sea, palm trees...I have never felt so chilled out. However, the best bits for us were the activities. My advice is to have a Catamaran lesson (20$) early in your holiday, once you know how to sail it you can take it out for free every day. The other free water activities like kayak, pedalo etc are also fun. I can't overemphasise though, how amazing the snorkel on the coral reef was. Snorkelling on the beach is fun, but for $20 you get taken on a 2 hour trip to a world that I thought only existed on the BBC. Our other extras are also recommended: a $30 relaxing massage and a $70 trip to Manat铆 Park including swimming with dolphins.I personally don't go on holiday for the food, so I won't go on about it - suffice to say in my opinion it was fine. The room and service were absolutely top notch. Cabaret entertainment isn't my thing, but the majority of the guests seemed to be delighted every time the country's national anthem (The Vengabus Is Coming) was played. And if you don't fancy joining in, there are plenty of other things to do. One quick question, which I would love to see answered in future reviews: if you are one of the people who takes photos of yourself with the resort staff: why ?Overall, my wife and I were absolutely delighted with our holiday. And as Henry Ford probably said one summer: If you think you can have a fantastic holiday or you think you can find things to complain about - you're probably right

<Content>Service, food and beauty were just spectacular! Great resort ! Loved the hotel. Service, food and shows were very, very good. A beautiful resort, in an awesome location. My husband and I had a very relaxing and enjoyable vacation. Would love to go back. The only complaint I had was that the restaurants needed to be a bit cooler. Other than that, everything was great!

<Content>Best vacation I have ever had I just finished reading a lot of the reviews and I can't believe why people would give this resort anything less than a 4 out of 5. Maybe it's because I'm young, that I enjoyed it so much. I'm 18 and was in Sunscape this April (2004) with my mom, my friend, her sister, and her mom. We had the best time, and couldn't have asked for more. The only bad thing, I agree with everybody on, is the seaweed in the water. But it's nothing you can't handle. I made lifetime friends with most of the staff, Rico, Andres, Michellet, etc.. all the entertainment/staff. Wendy, Juan, etc from the bars. The food was also great, and even the chefs would remember you and always have time to say hello, how are you?.. the night entertainment was good, it always made us laugh and the little disco on the 2nd floor of the lobby also kept me and my friends quite entertained well into the night. my mom and my friend's mom had a great time also, but not as much fun as me and my friends. Basically, if you're young and you want to have fun and get to know people, go here.. if you're a bit older you'll like it too, but maybe not as much as the younger crowd. It all depends on your taste. If anybody has any other questions you can email me and I'll be glad to give more details.. I'm going back there again this novemeber, and in April 2005!

<Content>We all had a great time My husband and I and two of our kids 15 and 12went to Sunscape from July 23rd to July 30th 2004.We had a great time. We have been to 2 others resorts in Punta Cana, the Melia and Secrets.Sunscape was better than the Melia, but nothing beats Secrets (Secrets and Sunscape are ownedby the same company). I have to say after reading some of the reviews on here I was a littleafraid of what to expect. Seaweed was never a problem (but hey, it is the beach). Shade was scarce. We learned to put our towels out before we went to bed.The kids had a wonderful time. We barely saw them :). There was a lot of kids and they allseem to hang out together which was nice. The food was okay, I wouldn't say great.Service was slow in the American Grill and I do mean slow!Nothing is on ice (fruit, juices, lunch meat ect)so I can see where people could get sick althoughno one in our family did. We ate smart!You do have to remember you are in another country with different food safety laws.Our room was great. Building 3, third floor,with a view of the ocean and pool. We didn'thear any noise at night like some reviews.Our room was clean and well stocked. We even asked for extra sprite and beer one day and each day the maid remembered and stocked the extras for us. We didn't receive the night turn down service that was advertised. The maids did come back again around 7 pm with extra towels and drinks though.Check in was quick and our room was ready when we arrived around noon. When you arrive they welcome you home with cookies and rum punch or just punch. (a nice touch to start your vacation) Check outwas another story. You can have a late checkoutfor a fee if your room was not requested. Ours was because of the view we had. The staff at the desk was going to give us a hospitality room since our plane didn't leave until later in the day, but they only were going to let us have it for a half hour(4 people showered in a half hour, I don't think so).We talked to our vacation rep and he was able to get us the room for an hour. It was a regular,clean room in another building which was nice.I had heard from reviews that they give you a room that everyone uses and the towels are not replaced that wasn't the case with us.The beach is beautiful with plenty of activities for those that want. The pool is nice, but it is showing it's age.Never a wait at any of the bars for drinks and they sure do pour that liquor with a heavy hand!As for the airport, yes they do go through your luggage very a lot. But hey in this day and age I want that!Again we all had a wonderful time, with plenty to do for those that want and plenty not to do for those that don'tWould I go back? You bet, in a New York Minute!

<Content>Just loved it. Hola! We can't say enough good things about this resort. My husband and I along with our three children, the grandparents and friends just returned on August 26, 2004. The grounds were beautiful as was the beach. We enjoyed the beach also during the morning hours. We did not have any trouble getting seats in the shade. The food was great. The staff including restaurant, bartenders, and entertainers were great. They always had a smile on their face and were one of the warmest people we ever met. We especially would like to thank the entertainment people including Fernando, Andres, and Rigo for keeping us all entertained. We are looking forward to going back not for a week but two!

<Content>Family Reunion Travel Dates: August 16 to August 23, 2004. My mom took all of us, our spouses and/or boyfriends/girlfriends, and our children to Sunscape for a little family reunion. We had a total of 19 in our group, ages ranging from 50+ to 4 months old. Each family group had their own room on the first floor of Building #5.The resort was completely amazing, there was something to do for everyone there. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous. And the beach itself, compared to the other 3 resorts, was the cleanest.My children are 6 1/2 and 9 and enjoyed the time they spent with the Explorer's Club. My youngest performed in two of the kid shows (you all would know her as Madonna ahahaha). They even had dinner with Raphel one night at Windows while we enjoyed a child free dinner at the Italian eatery.I was not too impressed with the Beach Cafe for my first lunch nor my first night's dinner at the Tex Mex. My Ribeye was over 3/4 fat. Our last night there I did try the Beef Filet and it was absolutely much better. I noticed that at the sit down places, service was difficult, but what do you expect when you have so many people...a few orders got mixed up, forgotten etc, but was correctly in a timely manner. I absolutely LOVED the Window's International Buffet. My favorite waiter was Francisco. I found all the food there (breakfast lunch and dinner) to be the most enjoyable, tasteful and just simply great. The beach party and dinner was probably my favorite evening during our week stay.The nightly shows we all enjoyed as a family and looked forward to them every night (yeah to my sister and her boyfriend for winning The Ideal Couple). My only complaint with the shows is that because children are there, one couple that did perform in The Ideal Couple show could have toned it down a little and probably should have worn a pair of panties that night...The rooms were very comfortable, air conditioning help up just great, maid service was an A++, beds were a little too hard, but my back didn't seem to mind after a few nights. They could please fix the ice machines in each building's little lobbied area.The workers there are truly amazing, very helpful and extremely pleasant and upbeat. All the workers there treated everyone with the upmost respect and really made the week fun and enjoyable for all. Baby Ann is only 4 months old and had the pleasure of learning one of the dances, Rico was a good teacher.The bartenders I really didn't get to know that well, but my youngest daughter was a regular at the pool bar and they usually had her favorite virgin drink waiting for her when they saw her coming.I would definetely go back to this same resort if I ever get the opportunity to go back. I would also recommend this resort to anyone, especially with children, to go to Sunscape.

<Content>Can't wait to go back! I just returned from an amazing vacation at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand (8-13--8-20). I have to admit I was pretty nervous about the country, the hotel, etc. based on reviews I had read, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Sunscape was a tropical paradise.First of all, the resort area is absolutely gorgeous and well-maintained. The pool is warm and clean. Water aerobics are very fun.The beach area is excellent, although it's a good idea to wake up early and stake claims on chairs in the shade. The water is pretty, but not the most fantastic Caribbean aqua color. The staff was great. I had read many complaints about how some did not speak good English. My response to this is that you are going to a foreign, Spanish speaking country. What did you expect? Most of the staff speaks good English. They were extremely friendly and accomodating. I would suggest bringing at least $75 in singles to tip the housekeepers, bartenders, and servers even though the resort is all-inclusive. These people work long hours in high heat for little pay. Tip the ones who give you good service. They will remember.The food was very good overall. You really could find anything you had a taste for. The Beach Garden and Dimario's are fantastic in the evenings if you're looking for classy, sit-down meals. The American Grill and buffet are good for casual dining. The bartenders are excellent, and the Coco Loco's are amazing. I will admit that a few of us in the group got a little sick, but add lots of tropical fruits, alcohol, and extreme sunshine to your daily life all at once, and it's bound to happen. There are many free activities at the resort, and the Activities Team will encourage you to get involved (salsa lessons, volleyball, etc). Take advantage of these activities, and don't worry about looking like an idiot. You're on vacation. Also, if you are traveling through Apple Vacations, I would highly, highly recommend the Saona trip. It is a one-day excursion to the uninhabited Saona island. You will sail on a huge catamaran, spend a few hours relaxing on the island and eating a fabulous lunch, swimming in a natural pool with starfish, and racing speedboats back to the marina. I cannot even describe how beautiful it was. The folks at Apple are great. Attend the meeting on the first day; their advice will make your vacation much more enjoyable.This is not the resort to go to if you're looking for a party-filled nightlife. There is a movie on a big screen each night, followed by a performance. The nightly shows were entertaining, and I would suggest attending them. Afterwards, you can try out the piano bar, the outdoor bar area, or the disco. The disco is not your typical American dance club; the DJ plays a variety of American, Latin, and European music. Have a good time even if you don't understand the lyrics.Be firm with the pushy venders next to the resort. They will ask outrageous prices for items of dollar-store quality. Do not be afraid to offer them $5 for something they ask $60 for. You can get some good deals if you are confident. The rooms were very nice. Your bed will be hard, but you will be very tired by the end of the day. Each room has a balcony, and you can get free room service any time. Don't drink the water from the sink; bottled water only. Stay hydrated!Overall, the Sunscape was fantastic. A few improvements could have been made here or there, but nothing that stopped us from having a great week. Our vacation flew by, and I can't wait to go back! We started planning our next trip before we even left the resort!

<Content>Sunscape was OK My family and I loved the people, hotel and grounds all were very nice. The food was just OK. My words of advice for anyone traveling to Sunscape would be to bring all of your own medicines because they are extremly expensive if bought from the hotel shop. The other thing I would suggest is that when you book an excursion ask lots of questions to make sure its right one for you. My family went on the catamaran excursion and I broke my foot. If you go on this trip wear water shoes, the island that you go to has about a three foot area of broken shells and large rocks and is very difficult to walk on without shoes. I met wonderful people at sunscape and we exchanged emails but I misplaced mine, if anyone of you that I met reads this please email me.

<Content>WOW! Could Not Have Been Better Just returned from a 7 day trip to Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. My entire family agrees that it was the best vacation we have ever had. There were eight in our party and we had 3 rooms. When we first arrived 2 rooms were next to each other on the 1st floor and the 3rd room was in another building on the 2nd floor. The party placed on the 2nd floor had a 3 year old with them and we were fearful that she would fall thru the railings. We went to the front desk and spoke with Sandy, who immedately resolved the problem and move the them across the hall from us. We found that the Dominican People are extremely friendly, love kids and do everything possible to make your stay at their hotel an enjoyable one. The food was very good and there was a wide variety to choice from. 24 hour room service was great. We brought singles and fives to tip. Although tips are not expected they are greatly appreciated. The grounds were beautiful, the rooms were very clean and well kept. Our maid left flowers and towels folded in different animals every day. Every request that was made of the staff was fulfilled. Our kids, who ranged in age from 15 to 3, all had a great time. I highly recommed this resort to anyone with children. Every night a family movie is played at 7:30 followed by a live show at 9:30. There is plenty of activities for adults also. The piano bar is fantastic! The bartender (Hulio) is a hoot and the entertainment was outstanding. Franklin the sax player/ singer is very talented and puts on a great show. Also must try a mudslide made by the bartener, Chocolate, who works evenings at the pool bar! The only problem we ran into was my son got an ear infection, from swimming in the ocean. There is a doctor on site who did a fantastic job of getting my son well. We had no other problems with illness. We loved our stay and are planning on returning next year.

<Content>LOVED SUNSCAPE  Myself my husband, my 3 yr old daughter, my sister, brother-in-law, their 10 yr old son, 15 yr old daughter,  a close family friend all stayed at the Sunscape during 8/13-8/20/04  we all had a blast! The food was great, the entertainment was great  the staff was absolutely phenominal. Upon our arrival we were placed in bldg 5 on the 2nd fl  the rest of our crew was placed in bldg 4 on the 1st fl, we didn't like the 2nd fl w/a 3 yr old daughter so we went back to the lobby  spoke w/Sandy who was able to have our room switched over to bldg 4 across the hall from the rest of our crew w/in minutes. Sandy could not have been more accomodating. The people that work at the resort are the best people that I have ever encountered. One of my favorites was Franklin who plays the saxophone  can sing just about anything that you request. If anyone knows someone that is in the entertaining business, please send them out to listen to Franklin, they will find that he is someone well worth listening too. Franklin will be a hit one day. He has the talent to make it far in life. Julio at the Piano Bar is a total comedian  he keeps you laughing, he is just too wonderful. Julio, Claudio, Damian,  Chocolate all make the best drinks  are as friendly as can be. Cecelia who also works at the resort was wonderful. She made you feel at home each time you encountered her. The maid that was assigned to our room, Viscuella, I believe is how you spell her name, did a phenominal job w/keeping our rooms maintained. She would make doves w/the towels, leave petals all over the sinks  she always ensured that we had beverages  clean towels. Angel  his staff were great as well, they were able to seat the eight of us together  were always on the ball. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if they have kids. We brought down a few hundred one dollar bills to use for tipping  they were all extremly gracious of the money. A dollar to the people of the Dominican Republic is worth 40-45 pesos. If your looking for a friendly, fun, family vacation, then Sunscape is the place to go. They even have movies every evening at 7:30 for the kids w/the staff doing a show following the movie @ 9:30. Myself  my family were reluctant to go to this hotel because we had heard some stories about people getting ill from the food, but, none of us from our group got sick  the people that we met at the resort were all ok as well. My nephew however, did get an ear infection from too much swimming but, the doctor at the resort was able to accomodate him. If you have children, I would just recommend bringing down ear drops. We will be back next year w/even more people visiting in our party. If your staying at the Sunscape you will not be disappointed...

<Content>Fabulous family resort...nonstop fun with R 8-1-04 to 8-5-04: Totally surpassed my expectations for a family oriented, all- inclusive resort. My 10 yr old son said Sunscape was more fun than Disneyworld and wants to revisist Sunscape. The food, service and staff were exemplary. The resort is absolutely beautiful with a West Indies/Ernest Hemingway theme. The rooms are spacious with high ceilings. The resort offers so many activities--something for everyone. We met guests from many other countries-- which was a great experience for my son. The nightly stage shows were comical  a must to see--no matter how tired you are. If you have time, visit the Metaphorphysis Spa for a deep tissue massage.... Of the many excursions, definitely do the Outback Safari--say hi to Nacho-- Sunscape Punta Cana Grand Resort gave us a vacation but we made it a memorable adventure. Next time, we plan to stay longer.

<Content>Outstanding Service August 2004- We just returned from a great vacation at Sunscape, Punta Cana Grand. We were so impressed with the outstanding service. The people were genuinely nice and went out of their way to greet you. The bartenders, waiters/waitresses, buffet servers, cleaning crew, entertainment crew, etc. were all excellent.I was so glad I brought singles to tip - they deserved it. (I recommend you bring $75 in singles to tip. Also bring $5s and $10s. The ATM machine only gives you pesos and you cannot exchange pesos for dollars. It is very difficult to get change for $20s, $50s  $100s.)*The rooms were beautiful. I loved the tile floor. The beds were a little hard, but you survive.*The food was pretty good. Marios was the only restaurant that enforced long pants for men.*The pool was fun. The beach was OK. There was a smell of gasoline from the boats that was a little strong at times on the beach.* We had a great time parasailing,snorkeling, horseback-riding, riding on the banana boat, and riding quads. (all cost an additional fee)*Stay away from the deep-sea fishing. Four hour boat trip, twelve miles out, caught nothing but upset stomachs.*My family loved the water trampoline, kayaks, ping pong, tennis, paddle boats, catamarans, and shuffle board. (all included with your stay)* You do not have to wear a band on your wrist like most resorts.We had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend this resort for families with children.

<Content>Sunscape was the perfect choice My mom and I had a girls' week at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand 4 August -11 August, and we loved every minute of it! Our check in was easy and quick - there was a server waiting for us in the lobby to give us drinks while we checked in. We arrived at about 12:30 and were able to get into our room right away to begin our vacation. When we entered our room, we were amazed at how nice it was. The cleaning staff even decorated the sink with flowers and placed flowers between the towels in the bathroom. Every day our room was cleaned by mid-afternoon, and when we returned to the room at night, the beds were turned down and the towels were replenished a second time. We asked for Diet Cokes in our refrigerator once and then got them every day after that. We read some reviews of the hotel before we left, including complaints about the nearby marina, but we thought the beach was absolutely gorgeous! We were there to be in the sun so finding shade wasn't an issue for us, but you do have to get towels on shaded chairs early or you won't get them. The water was clear and beautiful, the sand was lovely, and the weather was gorgeous. We had short showers in the evenings, but nothing to interrupt the lovely daytime weather. The watersports place on the beach has a few free things like paddleboats, catamarans, kayaks, and snorkel gear that we took advantage of almost every day.  The Italian restaurant was really nice, and we enjoyed it so much we went there three times! I recommend the garlic shrimp dish, lasagna appetizer, and the mozz  tomato salad - all delicious! When you are seated, you are treated to a cosmopolitan while you peruse the menu. The atmosphere is elegant. Windows (the buffet) had a different theme each night, and there was always something there that even the pickiest eater could enjoy. The dessert table was overwhelming in a good way! You just can't go there expecting everything to taste the same as it does in the US because you're not in the US. the staff in all of the restaurants and all over the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful. One night my mom was sick, and our waiter even made her a big plate of mashed potatoes to take to her room. Some people have complained about a language barrier, but the DR is a country that doesn't just cater to English-speaking people. Almost all of the staff spoke great English, and even if someone didn't understand what we asked for, they were so nice about it and usually asked someone else to translate. We picked up a pocket-sized Spanish-English book to learn a few important phrases before we left so we could at least make an attempt to speak a little Spanish. The nightly entertainment was really fun, and the bartenders at the bar next to the pool (I think it's called the Backstage Bar) were fantastic! They even began to recognize us and remember our favorite drinks. There was only one negative thing about our visit. The Spa at the hotel is managed separately, and while I did enjoy my session for the most part, the woman who was doing the massage got a cell phone call, answered it, and talked to the caller for about 5 minutes while continuing the massage with her one free hand. I should have said something but I was so surprised, i didn't quite know what to say! The spa does have a lot of great options though, and the Island Recovery Treatment that I chose was fabulous. Our vacation was excellent overall and we would recommend this resort to anyone - we already have. I would go back there in a minute. Thanks to all the staff at the Sunscape for making our stay so enjoyable! If anyone has questions, feel free to email me.

<Content>The best vacation we've ever had! We just returned from five days at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand, and we had the best vacation of our lives! The resort was fabulous in every respect. The staff was friendly, helpful, and treated us very well. The restaurants served delicious food, and the icy cold drinks by the pool always brought big smiles to our faces. Our room was big, clean, and very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay tremendously and can鈥檛 wait to go back. This winter we鈥檙e planning on taking Spanish classes so we can converse better with the wonderful people of the Dominican Republic. We would wholeheartedly recommend the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation in the Caribbean.--Wayne and Tracy McLennan,Natick, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

<Content>One of my all time favorite vacations! Just got back from a 5 day trip to this incredible resort. You get so much for your money at this place. The grounds are paradise; the architecture absolutely stunning. The beach could have been a tiny bit better, but it is still absolutely beautiful. We saw smiling faces every where we went. Don't pay any attention to the grumpy people complaining about this place; it is not perfect but you are not paying for perfect.Some of the food was incredible (grilled lobster with garlic sauce); some of it was quite ordinary. The drinks were wonderful. It was so much fun to sit on the beach and have a waiter walk up and ask you what you would like!There is quite a European crowd there. The largest group leaving the airport with us was headed for Madrid.The Apple vacation staff was very accomdating and anxious to make everything perfect. We loved our room; fortunately we were on the end next to the beach and the view was stunning.I just can't say enough about this place - it is paradise!

<Content>Absolutely Brilliant!!! Myself, my husband my son (aged 13) have just returned from a wonderful two week holiday at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. Having read reviews before we went I was a bit worried especially about the beach area. Well all I can say is I really dont know what people expect. This place was amazing. The Marina that is so often mentioned negatively was in fact I thought quite attractive. During the two weeks we were there I can honestly say I did not smell gasoline at all. The beach area itself was beautiful - yes you do get grass - but this is constantly cleaned up by the staff and it certainly does not look bad.The hotel itself was brilliant - the staff worked so hard right from the enterainment staff down to the maid that cleaned your room. The food in all the restaurants was the best I have ever had in an all inclusive hotel - the choice was limitless.There is nothing I could say that disappointed me. I really loved every minute of my hoiday and would go back in a flash.Any questions, please email me.

<Content>We loved punta cana My husband and I and four of our children had a great time. We were there for a week , the kids range from 17 to 23 . We all had a great time . I cannot commend the staff enough , they wait on you hand and foot. I have never been to a place were even room service is included.If you go here and don't have a good time then you don't know how to have a good time.We went on a couple excursions from swimming with the sharks and stingrays to deepsea fishing. One thing to watch out for is the merchants trying to sell you stuff. They start out at very high prices , the take a fraction of what they originally asked for. I would reccomend this trip to anyone ,we had a ball.We came home thinking we got our moneys worth.

<Content>Great Service Just got back today 08/06/2004. Great for kids of all ages. The only reason I did not rate my stay as excellent was because of the Marina next to the resort. The ages in our group were, 72 , 49, 42, 15 and 11 and we all had a great time. Thank You

<Content>Had a wonderful experience! I am a semi-seasoned traveler so I have several experiences to compare to. The grounds are immaculate. The food was better than all 3 of the Mexico resorts we've stayed at and the beach party was fantastic. None of our party of 4 got sick, but we watched what we ate (no salads, limited fruit). The staff was great, no language barrier at all. The bartenders became so familiar with us, just after the first night, that they knew what we wanted before we even asked.There is tremendous competition with the shade, however. I believe some were leaving their towles over night instead of getting up early to reserve a spot. I did not agree with letting the children take up the spaces at the swim up bar, but it is a family friendly resort. Another potiential downfall is the hard pillows and beds. However, if you bring your own pillow, you've got 1 of 2 licked!We had heard so many complaints from others traveling to the area that stayed at other resorts that it made ours seem like a gold mine.The Dominican Republic is by far the most beautiful island I've seen thus far and this includes St. Thomas, St. Lucia, St. Croix, St. John, Belieze, Mexico, St. Marteen, Ocho Rios, Grand Cayman. But to experience it, you've got to travel AWAY from the resort. The highlight of our trip was the Outback Safari. Here we saw breathtaking scenery. Remember Jurasick Park (spell?) It was filmed on the island!In summary, we had a great time, enhanced significantly by the staff, food and excursions.Feel free to contact me with any questions!

<Content>Sunscape was Amazing! Stayed at the Sunscape from 7/28 - 8/5 with my husband and two daughters, age 18  2. A wonderful time was had by all! My husband was reluctant to travel to the DR and didn't think he would like it (he puts a very high priority on good food!) he is now a convert! Unfortunately, upon arrival I found out that my luggage was misplaced somewhere in Miami. Eleanor and Carin kept on top of the situation and were able to get me my luggage by the first evening. This is definetely a family resort, and if your looking for rollicking nightlife you may want to look elsewhere, but there was an incredible array of things to do for most people! My older daughter quickly made friends and got certified at Scuba Diving, learned to windsurf, and snorkled every day. Even though the explorers club is for ages 4+, the wonderful staff welcomed little Melissa to join in their nighttime show! Watching a movie in the open air each night was really neat. The room was fine, and kept very clean by our friendly maid! (who also left me extra towels, coffee and water each day!) The staff was amazing and most that had direct regular guest contact spoke very good English. The restaraunts offered a wide variety of foods. The buffet restaraunt, Windows, had a different theme each night, and you truly could not begin to eat all that they offer, even if you only ate there all week. The first night we ate at Windows we were offered a glass of champagne as we entered, and proceeded to be amazed at the quality of food. The fried lobster was heavenly, the desserts were beautiful and it almost seemed a shame to cut into some of the cakes (my daughter particularly loved the cookies topped with strawberries and vanilla). My husband and I were able to pry my older daughter away from her new friends one night to babysit her sister so that we could go to the restaraunt DeMario's for dinner. It was exellent, I would highly recommend the buffalo mozzarella as an appetizer, even though this is actually fresh mozzarella on top of a nice sliced tomato, drizzled with olive oil and herbs even my husband had admit that it was great! We then went to the cigar bar, which was quiet, but elegant, for after-dinner drinks. Of course, there were dishes that did not appeal to me (some type of goat stew for example), but I just didn't eat it! There was so much more to choose from! The pool was beautiful, as was the beach. The water was clear and clean. The irridescent green color didn't extend as far out into the water as some would like, but that is due to the depth of the water, not to it's cleanliness! There is a natural breakwater in front of the hotel, and a channel for the boats to pass through to get to open water. This is why there are several boats moored to the right of the hotel. The boats are primarily fishing boats (extremely expensive one's at that) as that is how many of the natives make their living. My husband went on two very reasonable priced sport-fishing trips for Marlin, Mahi Mahi, etc. This is a great resort for someone wanting to deep-sea fish! Each morning we would sit on the balcony, drinking yummy Dominican coffee and watching the fishing boats leave for the day, and each afternoon we would walk to the pier and see what they caught! One day we saw a spear fisherman walking in the surf trailing along a 6 foot shark! (as well as about 100 tourists). To each his own is how I look at these helpful reviews. For example, I too was searched repeatedly at the Punta Cana airport, but I was glad to oblige. We were flying into New York after heightened terror alerts, I just hope they search everyone as thoroughly! We were somewhat careful about what we ate, but not overly so. We ate alot of seafood. Neverthess, not one of us got sick, and neither did anyone else that we spoke to at the resort. There were a few changes that I would make next time (for instance staying in building 4 or 5, instead of building 2, which was too close to the vendor's huts), but live and learn. No resort is perfect, and there are possible criticisms for even the most elegant establishments. However, I have to say that I had one of my best vacations ever at the Suncsape, and would highly recommend this resort to anyone (particulary families) heading to beautiful Punta Cana!

<Content>Could have been better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just got back from Sunscape, after spending a week 7/28/04-8/03/04. The people were very friendly, the grounds very well kept. If you're looking for excitment after 11pm then this is not the hotel for you. My husband and I are 28, and it was very boring, their's a Disco Club nothing but 80's and spanish music. My husband got sick the second day there, alot of people that we met from other resorts were also sick. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER!!!!!!! The day leaving the resort my husband , my son , and myself got sick and we're still sick. The beach was o.k. Food was o.k. Drinks o.k. The rooms were very dark, we stayed in building 4 away from the stage. We went on two tours, Crazy Wheels was the best you get to drive your own RV it's about 3hrs, it takes you to two private beaches that was the best. $85 one person,$56 two people kids half. The other was Bavaro Expedition not worth it at all. This trip was 8hrs takes you to the village of the Haitian people, see how they live then to a private beach for lunch. It's a very long drive on a dirt road, I sleep to and from. If you do the Crazy Wheels which you get to drive your own RV don't even bother doing the Expedition it's the same thing. Crazy Wheels do not wear sneakers, dress very light you will get Very Very Muddy!!!!!!! buy it was fun. When we got to the airport they will search your bags as if you're a criminal. They open everyone suitcase take their clothes out then want you to repack. DO NOT BUY BARCELO 151 OVERPROOF RUM!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS ILLEGAL AND THEY WILL TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU. If you pack it in your carry-on, if they forgot to check it with your suitcase, they will check it again before you get on the plane so they're no hiding anything at all. We went US Airways, never again. Overall I did not like the treatment at the airport, the hotel was boring, I would'nt go back there. I travel every year and this is the frist time I had a complaint about any carribbean Island. Go to Jamaica (Negril)$1 is $40 peso in Punta Cana. If you have any question feel free to ask.

<Content>Potential but Poor I found that the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand has beautiful grounds, mostly friendly staff and much potential, but there are some major things about the place that need to be addressed. (I do want to preface my statement with the fact that we have traveled to the Caribbean 6 times and are not complainers.) All of our other experiences have been enjoyable, some more luxurious than others but enjoyable. Many people that we spoke to had become ill due to their stay at this facility. My daughter was very, very ill and it was suggested that she be hospitalized with a bacteria-dysentery infection. It has been 5 days of treatment and she still is unable to keep anything but liquids down. In those few days she has lost 10 pounds. It is accompanied by severe cramping, weakness, dizziness and lethargy. We did not take any risks by drinking anything but bottled water and eating only cooked foods not raw vegetables or fruit. The illness alone will prevent us from ever booking this resort again. There is limited shade around the pool and beach. I needed to get up at 6:00 am to get a chair and then sometimes they were already taken. One family told me they get up at 4:00am to reserve their chairs! The staff setting up for the beach party on Thursdays need the East end of the beach for the set up which limits where the guests may sit during the day. We were treated rudely on the beach, set up day. In an attempt to get us to move, the staff began to encircle us with tables, so close that it was difficult to get out of our beach chairs without having to move the tables. It was an intimidating and rude action by the staff. I did look for a new place to sit that day after the intimidation, but nothing was availble. It made for an upsetting most uncomfortable day. Most days our rooms were clean by 4:00pm but one day upon return to our room at 7:00pm the beds were still unmade and there were no clean towels, for which to shower. That is unacceptable.The beach is not as clean as the other beaches we have been to, and the marina sits just beyond the swimming area so the water has gasoline floats. The place has potential with the proper owner/manager but we will never return and I will not suggest that anyone else go there with so many other options that also have good deals and without the risks of rude treatment, illness, limited shade and pool/beach chairs, and better efficiency in the cleaning of rooms. On several occasions when we used our beach towel card to get a towel they were out of them and told us to wait or return. They know the number of guests that have checked in and should have ample towels for the guest. If you want to ask me further questions do not hesitate to contact me ; cwatte@aol.com P.S. It has now been more than one month since we have been to this resort and my daughter is still sick and has seen the doctor 3 times. She is just now beginning to have an appitite and eat without pain or other side effects.

<Content>Sunscape Punta Cana Grand was truely awesome My family and I just spent a week at the Sunscape Punta Cana grand. (July19-26 2004). It was one of the best vacations I have ever been on, and we have traveled and tried many different things. This resort was beautiful and the staff was amazing. Everyone worked hard to make the guests happy. The employees were always in good moods no matter what they were doing or what time of day it was. The pool was great, it was large enough to where it was never over crowded and u could always find a float within 5 minutes. There were always seats to be found around the pool, yes it is true that the seats in the shade went fast and people did get up early just to save them..but if u really want the shade then wake up early too. There is seaweed in the water. It is cleaned up everyday a few times. It really isnt bad at all. The water isnt as amazing as some might hope, but it truely isnt that bad either. There was always room at the bars to get a drink because there were so many of them. The bartenders could make any drink you ask them for without a problem. You hardly ever had to wait for a drink at all. There was always food to be found somewhere. The food was my only complaint though. It isnt because it wasnt good. I am just a very very picky eater so a lot of it just didnt appeal to me..but even for people like me they had pasta hamburgers and hotdogs and french fries..so there was something for me to have. Otherwise, if you are into trying things there is such a selection there it is to die for. They serve anything you can ever imagine. Most people I met there thought the food was amazing. The room was nice. It was always kept clean. It was nice and cool and the water pressure was great. No matter what you asked for they brought it for you if they could. The service was phenomenal there. The entertainment was awesome. Every night there was a different movie for the kids to watch but anyone could watch it, they had activities all day for kids to do, and adults as well. There were games and contests all day to play and prizes to win. The activities crew was great. They were hilarious. (thank you Andres, Rigo, Robert, Michelet, Minimi, Juan Carlos and anyone i may have missed) The nightly show was great. Some nights was a dancing and singing show..and other nights it was audience participation. Great Great Great. The dancers and singers were so good. they really worked hard to put on a quality show. (Carlitos, Moreno, Erika, Sadie, Irene, Vanessa, Miguel, and Cassie Lindo--awesome job!!). I would recommend this hotel to anyone going there for sure. I cannot wait to go back. I plan on it as soon as i can. The weather is great. Its hot, sunny, and nice. Mueve la Colita Mamita Rica, Mueve la Colita...(Clap clap clap)...go there to find out about that...Enjoy!!!! ~CARMELA

<Content>Didn't want to leave Well, first and foremost I'm not a staff member and I'm not getting paid for this review I'm just writting to give my opinion on the Sunscape. This is not my first all inclusive and I have traveled to different locations through out the world.On July 16th we arrived at the Sunscape and stayed for 5 nights and had an incredible time. The staff were more than pleasant and helpful with requests. FOOD- Average for an all-inclusive resort. Tex-Mex and the Cafe are the best.Beach- One would beautiful. Yes, there are boats and seaweed in the water. However, your supposed to find boats and seaweed in the ocean.Activities-The sunset cruise was great if you ask they will take you to where they have sharks caged in the middle of the ocean so you can snorkel right next to them. The speedboats were fun, but I don't know if there really worth $60. Horse back riding was awesome the 2 hour sunset. The massages are great on the beach. Parasailing is short but you can see the whole island it's breathtaking. The banana boats were fun for $7.00. They do have activities on the resort to keep you busy however we did not participate. Pool- relaxing, It is true that you have to get up in the early morning to get a shaded chair, however we found a chair and rafts every day and who wants to be in the shade when you go to an island for the sun.Shopping- bargin for what you want one of the guys wanted $75 for a ring I paid $25One last note remeber to bring one dollar bills this is very important because knowone has change and if you use the ATM it will give you pesos and they won't exchange them at the resort.

<Content>Absolutely the best vacation spot for families My family and I all enjoyed our time at Sunscape Punta Cana Grand during the second week of July. We stayed in building 3 with a great view of both the ocean and the pool . I found the variety of food was fine. (If your in a hurry just go to windows). My children thorougly enjoyed the kids club and the mini disco,oh, and let's not forget the donkey rides on the beach. Rafael, Michelle, and Paulina are absolutely wonderful with the kids. There were times when the kids didn't want to be with us. There are great events for them to participate during the day like the volleyball games, little olympics, just to name a few. There's also a wonderful kids area right by the pool on the beach with a make believe sunken ship and a swing set. The Sunscape staff does a great to outstanding job making your stay as pleasant as possible and even though your not required to tip please be considerate and think how many hours these people work a couple of dollars means a world to them. My suggestion is to bring at least $100 in singles (very difficult to get change in the resort) and fives in order to tip. If you want great service be kind. We tipped well and received the best service every single day.I do recommend that if you want a shaded spot, you will have to get up early or put something out before you go to sleep.But the most memorable events are the ones I had in the company of the entertainment staff Mini Me, the MC, Andres, Fernando, and Juan Carlos. Absolutely the most energetic happy people I have ever met. They work all day from the morning excersice activities to the disco at night. These people work 12 hour day for twelve days straight and then get 3 days off. What spirit! God Bless. They are absolutely funny. You'll love the shows produced by them and PLEASE, participate in the suncape dance the COLITA. We purchased the cd and do the colita every day. What a great group of guys. For the ladies, if your interested in getting braids, don't get it done at the hotel it's $40 just walk to the sencond hut on the beach and ask for MARGARITA she'll charge you $25.00 and won't rip your head off or make them to tight. I enjoyed the braids but please remember: PUT SUN BLOCK ON YOU SCALP or were a hat.As for stomach problems, the only problem was my mom who ate tooo much fruit after being forwarned and drank too many pina coladas. Otherwise NO ONE had stomach problems. Just stay away from the fruit and limit the tropical drinks.I can only say that the only mishap was listening to all the rude American guests. Remember that this is a Latin country where the language is spanish. The staff does speak English along with several other languages, but be respectful. There were many guests who were complaining about everything from the rooms to the slow service and other minor little things. Come on, your on vacation. If you want it to be perfect and glamorous then don't go. I can not wait to go again and HIGHLY RECOMEND this resort. A great vacation for the price. If you have any questions just contact me.

<Content>Very Nice Place Sunscape Punta Cana Grand was a very nice place.The staff was very friendly and helpful.Our room was nice.Yes,the bed was hard,but so is mine at home.The food was above average from the other all-inclusive places I have stayed.I could always find something to do.No place in the world is going to satify everybody,but my Wife and I are planning another trip to this same resort next year.We had a very relaxing, enjoyable stay here.

<Content>Sunscape was nice We just returned from the Sunscape on July 21st. We had a really good time, we kept busy doing all sorts of water activities. Please only go through the hotel for any water sports, the salesmen on the beach are a little bit shady! The horseback riding on the beach was fun. The food was okay most of us had some stomach problems but we were also drinking a bit!! Our room was nice, building four third floor. The bed however was not so nice, very uncomfortable!! My husband and I always ask for an upgrade in our room but this time it was not necessary. Our maid was wonderful, so thankful for the crayons and coloring books I brought along, Please if you have time, go to the dollar store and get some, it really made her day. The drinks were good and the service always friendly. The beach was clean but you really have to get up early to get a good spot. We really enjoyed the pool and pool bar and had no trouble getting a raft everyday. I was a little scared after reading some of the reviews on the Sunscape but was pleasently surprised! Try the Sunscape we are glad we did!

<Content>Sunscape sucks!!!! Our experience at this resort was awful. The room was musty, the bed was hard and you can hear everything in the rooms around you. FOOD IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! We are not picky people but this place was ridiculous. I cannot believe these other reviews when people say they loved it, I think those reviews must be from the staff or someone on drugs, because we have nothing good to say about the resort. Don't go to Sunscape!!

<Content>Very Good Time My fiance and I spent a week from July 9th to the 16th at the Sunscape. We had spent a week at the Riu Bambu two years ago and the Sunscape was very comparable. The BeachThe Riu had a much nicer beach. For anyone that wants a beautiful beach and very nice clean water than the Sunscape may disappoint you. I think that was the one downfall of the place. The water was not carribean turquoise blue. There was a Marina just to the right of the Sunscape and there were approximately 30 boats harbored right in front of the Sunscape. When they would go out to start one up (mostly in the mornings) it would smell like gasoline for a short time. To the left was the shacks that the locals had to sell items. They weren鈥檛 a problem but just took away from the overall view of the area. The seaweed was cleaned up every morning and then by the afternoon a small amount was on the beach again. This wasn鈥檛 a real problem but some may not like that. There always seemed to be enough chairs and finding shade usually wasn鈥檛 a problem.The PoolThe pool was very nice. The only problem here was that people really did get up at 4:00 or 5:00 im the morning to stick towels on the chairs, especially the few that were in the shade. Then most of the day nobody sat in them. If you can鈥檛 handle not having shade by the pool then you would need to get up early to get a spot. The RestaurantsWindows Buffet: The breakfast buffet was very good. We ate the first two nights at the dinner buffet and really thought it was awful. We are not very picky eaters either. We ate all 7 nights at the Riu Buffet two years ago and thought it was wonderful. I heard other guest complain about Windows. It was usually very hot in there as well.American Grill: We tried this place next since we didn鈥檛 care for Windows and it was much better. I had beef fajitas twice and also tried a steak. I enjoyed all of the meals. The workers were all great and very friendly. The food was good and it was very comfortable.Italian: The Italian restaurant I thought was also very good. I had Grilled Shrimp on Angel hair pasta and it was great. The service was excellent as well. This is the only restaurant that men have to wear long pants. There is also garden restaurant next to the beach that didn鈥檛 have as good of service but we ate breakfast there at an outside table right on the beach and it was very nice.All the bars had great service and some made drinks stronger than others but they would get you whatever you wanted. The RoomOur room was very nice. We stayed in building 4 on the third floor close to the beach. It was a good room. The air conditioner worked great and kept it very comfortable. The bathroom was fine with good water pressure. The only bad thing was we were located right across from the American Grill and the Garden Beach Restaurant and at 4:00 in the morning you could hear them banging dishes and they were quite noisy. We had requested building 4 or 5 to be away from the noise of the nightly shows but the noise was loud from the show over there also. It was over by 11:00 and then was quiet after that. I would recommend requesting building 5 to be a little further away. OtherThe Service was great throughout the resort. I thought in general the work staff was nicer than the Riu. Our maid hugged us every day. We took $1 bills to give and they appreciated them. The bartenders and waiters seemed to get a lot of tips but we also would give a couple to a grounds crew person or a bus boy that seemed to be busting their butt and they would be so thankful it was worth it. We often would see them at breakfast at one restaurant and then at dinner at another. They work long days and work very hard.. Although we didn鈥檛 have a child with us it seemed like they had a lot to do for kids. The nightly movie was a lot of fun for them.The beach party on Thursday night was very fun. They played music and had dancing and it was very enjoyable.I would definitely recommend Sunscape for a vacation with one caveat, if the beach and Carribean blue water are the most important thing to you then consider somewhere else. If great service, very good entertainment, a good pool and decent food are more important then the Sunscape will be great for you.

<Content>I Wanna Go Back Ok, this is gonna seem really late since my husband and I were there in October 2003 for our honeymoon. We stayed for 8 days. Reason I am on here is because there is serious contemplation of going back for our anniversary. We absolutely loved Sunscape and wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else!! First, I must recommend to ANYONE going that has EVER WANTED TO SWIM WITH DOLPHINS - YOU MUST GO TO THE MANATI PARK. I have always dreamed of swimming with dolphins. Well, we did - FOR $75 a PERSON!! People in our travel group couldn't believe how cheap that was. One woman had done it in HAwaii and paid $200 a pop. It was the most beautiful experience ever - I didn't want to ever get out of that pool. Manati Park was, by far, our favorite part of the trip and we don't even have children yet. We got four pictures taken with them. There is a male and female dolphin. The female is trained to come up and kiss you. The male then pulls you around the pool. Talk about amazing and feeling nature at its best. We also did the Marinarium trip to swim with the sharks and rays. That was really awesome but I agree - watch your toes on the coral - OUCH. But what beautiful pictures you'll get. Take an underwater camera for sure.As for the resort, yeah - we got a bellyache or two. Honestly, people here who are complaining about rude service - the only rudeness we encountered at all was from the travelers to be blunt. There were some people whose behavior really made it obvious why people think Americans are quite borish. Our room was by the adult pool - heard and saw things that made me embarrassed that those people were obviously from America. However, the staff was amazing. Everywhere we went, we got friendly smiles and help with anything we needed. At checkin, we mentioned we were honeymooners. They upgraded our room and we got flowers on the bed. WE got to know some servers by name. Yes, if you tip, they remember you and will go above and beyond. But, let's face it - those poor people are really busting their humps to do what they do and deserve respect. We fell in love with the children outside the resort who were swimming near the pier and with the vendors. They all tried to make you smile in one way or another.Our room was nice enough. Yes, I freaked out over the bugs and had a hard time sleeping soundly without worrying about being bitten. The halls are loud but alot of the disturbance also came from the tourists being loud and obnoxious themselves. Our bathroom was a little ancient but who cares? We weren't there to tour toilets - we were there to experience a lifestyle and culture different than our own. Isn't that what the purpose of vacation is?? I laugh at the people who go and then complain because there is little American music and food? Then why the HECK are YOU GOING TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY?? If you want that, go to a FLorida or California beach silly. I was loving the Spanish flair. DR is definitely more Spanish influenced than Caribbean. But no less wonderful. I agree that the nightlife was a little boring - I felt too old for the disco and too young for the piano bar so we were stuck but the food, the music, everything else was great. Now I am not a seasoned traveler by any means so take my opinion for what it is worth. However, I left there with the warmest feeling I have ever had for any place I have ever visited. I was actually sad to leave. I have never found a more beautiful culture of people than the people in the DR. And other people I know who went agree with me. We plan to go back at some point and go on the excursions we didn't get to do - like the safari. But, I will definitely swim with the dolphins again and sit back and smile when I see the happiness around me.

<Content>Paradise at the Sunscape Grand We spent 7 days at the Sunscape Grand and were totally pleased. The weather was terrific, and we found the people to be very friendly. Everyday the walkways around the resort were washed down. The maid was in our room twice a day. There were staff picking up around the pool and beach through-out the day. Punta Cana is a beautiful place and I will go there to vacation again. The food was ok but nothing spectactular.

<Content>Fantastic time in Punta Cana A group of us (18) along with small children went to the Sunscape Punta Grand from June 21 - 28, 2004. We loved it. The food  drinks were great. There were great restaurants to choose from. We all had a ball and would go back again in a heart beat. I highly recomend two tours that an Apple Rep can set you up with. One was a snorkeling trip (from the 2nd pier by the hotel) - it was great - we swam with sharks and they had a food and drinks on the boat. The other which was fanstastic was a day long trip to a secluded island - well worth the trip. On this you swim with starfish and have an uninhabited island to yourself for the day where they cook up a fabulous lunch and drinks. The water here was crystal clear. The water at the hotel is not crystal clear but it is pretty and we were all in it. No one in our group got sick but at times we did have stomach cramps. It's truly a great, friendly beautiful resort that has it all. Write if you have any questions.

<Content>Best Ever Absolutely the best vacation we have taken so far. From the moment we entered the lobby, we were greeted with warm smiles and cold drinks. Food was great, room also. Drinks could use a little more alcohol, but nothing that they would not adjust for you. Even with it all inclusive, it does not hurt to keep plenty of singles with you, as they truely appreciate of even a dollar tip as they are paid very little and work 12 hour days.

<Content>Hated Sunscape I just want to tell you my experience at Sunscape. I came back on July 2nd 2004, and I do not intend to go back to that resort. First off, my reservation was never made. I had paid for a VIP upgrade package through signature, and it was never taken down. The room was very damp and cold. Any paper we had in the room was wet, and damp, do not know why. Every morning, while we were sleeping. Housekeeping would come into our room to clean it, at 7:30 in the morning. The first night we were there, our plane came in at 10:30 p.m. We were told that the Beach Garden restaurant was the only restaurant open at this time to get food. When we get there, they tell us they are closed. Even though they were patrons in there. Being pregnant, and traveling all day, and being hungry did not add to the pleasure. The staff told us that we can get burgers. Fine, but to be ignored, and not being offered anything to drink, and waiting 45 minutes for a burger, did not give a great first impression of the resort. Why were there so many boats parked by the resort, it stinked of gasoline. And there was too much garbage around the beaches. The only thing that was good was the pool was heated. One night I needed to have some tea. I called room service to order 1 coffee, and 1 tea. And a half hour later, the person drops off two plastic cups with hot water covered with saran wrap. No tea bags, sugar, coffee or milk. Asked him for the other stuff, and said he will be right back. Another 陆 hour late, shows up with 1 plastic cup of hot milk with saran wrap on it. But still no tea bags, or coffee or sugar. Needless to say I gave up. Why are there no English speaking people in the bank? They wouldnot give us money in Amrican $, only pesos, which we did not need. Also, on the last day, we got food poisoning from the undercooked burgers served on the beach. That鈥檚 good for pregnant people, isn鈥檛 it?Well at least I had fun on the marinium trip.

<Content>Absolutely Awful, Huge Disappointment! We arrived Sunday night, June 20th with the bus dropping us off at the lobby and to the surprise of the Apple Rep (that was on the bus), nobody from the hotel was there to take our bags. We proceeded on to the front desk to check in and they refused our request to be in the same building as our friends. As we were heading to our rooms one of the hotel staff comes running out of nowhere to give us punch and cookies. As we finished that we proceeded on to our room and the same hotel person runs back out with a bottle of rum asking if we wanted some in our drinks that we had drank long ago. That should have been our first clue. It took us a while that first day to find out that they make all of the drinks non-alcoholic (that was a first) unless you specify that you want some, very backwards from any other Caribbean vacation that we鈥檝e been on. They advertise premium liquors but will not pour those unless you ask for them by name and when you do, they seem very irritated and a lot of times had to go to another bar to find that one bottle they have on the property. There is only one beer available (Presidente) which I have had in the past and liked but this beer that was on draft was awful and may be what made everyone but my wife sick (she doesn鈥檛 like beer) from the 2nd day until we left that following Sunday, the 27th.The room my wife and I stayed in was 5319 in building 5, 3rd floor was an adequate room unless you were planning on sleeping at all during your stay. The room was the noisiest hotel room I鈥檝e ever been in, it had a tin roof and when it rained at night it sounded like the roof was caving in and the sound of water leaking in the room which it fortunately wasn鈥檛, the walls are paper thin as we could hear every conversation and movement from our neighbors on both sides, the local disco next to our building went from midnight to 4:45am every morning along with the rooster going from 2:30am-6am and constant noise from the kids running up and down the halls. The beds had to have been the hardest most uncomfortable mattresses we've slept on. The maids would constantly knock on the door and then just walk right into your room before you had the chance to answer them.This was not a resort that was geared for American tourists as all of the music, day in and day out was nothing but Salsa/Latin music. The disco was a total joke because it was all of the hotel staff from this hotel and all of the hotels in the area and they partied and played all Salsa/Latin music. You definitely didn鈥檛 feel welcome. The resort staff was less than friendly towards us and they always seem to act as though we were inconveniencing them. The pool was extremely warm and needed painting very badly. Kids everywhere diving into the pool and the hotel would only allow about 6 rafts/floats in the pool. The hotel staff around the pool were more interested in picking up the tourist women than actually getting some activities going.We saw our Apple rep (Mark) one time in 8 days and that was during the orientation. Mark was very informative but it would have been nice to know where he was the rest of the time. We would go to the Apple desk at the times that were stated when somebody would be there, but to no avail. We ended up booking our excursions through another travel rep in the hotel lobby. The food was very bland and unimpressive and not sure if this could have caused us to get so sick. The tomatoes (green) in the salsa and on the hamburgers weren鈥檛 ripe which was a little odd. The 2nd night there we put our name in to eat at the American Grill and for some reason the host kept giving tables to people after us. We told the host 4 times that we were standing right there and yet he continued to seat other people. My wife and I made the mistake of sleeping in one day and missed breakfast. Well we tried every restaurant and snack bar between 10:30am 鈥?12:30pm and they all just pointed to their watch and said not open until 12:30pm. I鈥檝e personally been to Cancun 8 times, Cozumel 3 times, Aruba, Bermuda, Jamaica, Dominican Republic(Luperon and Puerta Plata), St Lucia, Bahamas and Costa Rica and I would say this was the worst of all the hotels and I鈥檝e never been sick on any of these vacations. We love the Caribbean and the beach and will continue to travel there but we would never return to Punta Cana or this hotel.

<Content>Warning: Do not go to Sunscape I want to start off by saying that I am not a chronic complainer, and in fact, have not found one thing wrong with any vacation that I have been on through Apple Vacations. I am not picky, not hostile, and not, in any way, a miserable person. So, you can trust this review as fair and honest. When I read most of the reviews before going, I assumed that the people who bashe the hotel would have found something wrong with every hotel. But, I realized that the reviews were accurate. If you have another option, take it. I would never go back to the Sunscape.The grounds of the hotel were very pretty, and check-in was a breeze. Even though they said check-in wasn't until 12:00, a room was ready for us at 10:00, and our luggage arrived within minutes after checking in. I found the rooms very cute and very clean. The hotel is smaller than most resorts, which was good in one respect because you didn't have far to walk to the beach and dinner, etc. However, every night felt like a frat party because it was so loud. The noise carried on until 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning -- and not just noise: music, screaming, etc.The beach was very small and there was not enough shade. People were getting up at 4:00 a.m. just to reserve their chairs and palm trees. We got up around 6:00 a.m. and still found some, but by 7:00, everything was taken. The beach was full of seawead and the water was very dirty. A marina was right next to the hotel, and boats were docked in the water. At times, it smelled as if gasoline was being released into the water. I went in the ocean one time, and refused to go back in after that.Every week they hold a beach party and they begin to set up at 9:00 a.m. Becuase of this, we were told by employees that we couldn't lay on the beach, and were told to move our chair into the sun. When I refused, they began to throw tables around me chair, and I was blocked in by tables. When I went to management, I was told to go to the adult pool to lay out (which is topless and there isn't any shade). We ended up laying out by the main pool and it was nice, but again, not enough shade. The pool was nice and the swim up bar was great to have. However, when the guys were cleaning the pool in the morning, we observed then throwing the used drinks that were laying around the pool into the pool, which I found extremely discusting.The staff by the pool was just fabulous, probably the best part of the trip. they constantly came up and tried to get people involved in different activities, and were always upbeat and friendly.The food was just average. I am not a picky eater by any means, but I had a hard time finding food in the buffet restaurant. The a la carte restaurants were very good, however.Ok, here is the really bad part. Everybody got sick. Everybody we talked to had at least one person in the group that got sick. We were told that the chef was baffled by the number of people that got sick. I was so violently ill when I returned to the states that they doctors wanted to hospitalize me. I have lost over 10 pounds in the 3 days that I have been back, and have to go in for weekly blood tests to determine whether the parasite is still present in my body. I cannot eat any solid foods for at least a week, and will be out of work for another week, at the very minimum. Now, I know what some people are thinking: this is a third world country, its a risk that you take. I have been to the DR several times, so have my parents, and we never got sick. I have been to mexico over 5 times, and I have gotten sick occasionly there, but never this severe. This time around, I didn't drink the water, didn't even brush my teeth with the tap water, didn't eat the fruit or any raw vegis. I did everything I was suppose to, and still caught something. If I was the only one, I would think it was a fluke, but honestly, so many people got sick at this hotel that it has to be a hygiene issue with the food and/or the stafff. I would never go back to this resort, and while the resort is cheaper than many others, It is worth the extra money to be safe.

<Content>Loved It Here I recently took the vacation to the DR in June of 04' at the Sunscape Beach Resort and I absolutly loved it. The Hotel was beautiful and all the staff was extremely friendly. I have read others complaints about the place before going, and was a little nervous about my high expectations which were surpassed. I cannot say enough about how beautiful it is in the DR and how nice and informative the people were. The food was better then expected as well. I know for a fact that we will be back to this wonderful money friendly vacation.If taking some of the tours I would recommend the ATV tour and the snorkling w/ the sharks and rays. Me and my girlfriend did not however get the opportunity to do the speed boats (something that I heard was great).

<Content>Loved it We, my husband, 5 year old and myself, just spent 4 nights at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. The people were extremely nice, the grounds are kept up beautifully. the food is varied and very fresh.If you want shde, get up before 7 am and leave your towels at a cabana at the beach or pool.It only rained at the night of the beach party, after the guys had been working all day setting it up. Others told us they got sick but we didn't, but I guess too much sun, alcohol and fruits you're not used to are a bad combination!My only complaint is with the kids club, the canadian woman was unfriendly and gave both me and my husband the feeling that she didn't want to be bothered. She also didn't adhere to the posted schedule, my daughter never had a donkey ride.Overall, I like Punta cana better than Cancun.

<Content>What a great time!! This resort was amazing. My husband and I visited Sunscape May 16 - 23 and it was a great time. We were married at Sandals, Ocho Rios in 2001, so we were a little leary about going to another resort other than sandals. We were amazed by how beautiful this place was and a $1,000.00 cheaper which was nice. We were greeted with punch and you can add rum if you choose. We went straight to our room with was in building 5 on the 3rd floor and the room was great. We were overlooking the adult pool and you could see the beach past the pool. We had heard the bugs were bad but we didn't have any problems. I woke up with some red bumps on my legs each morning but they never itched or bothered me. The beer, Presidente was pretty good. I'm a budlight drinker so I was a little nervous about the beer but it was actually pretty good. You just have to watch how much you drink cause it will get you the next day. ha ha We spent most of our evenings at the Piano Bar and that place is great and Julio, the bartender was awesome. He's a little quiet at first but once he starts warming up, he's a riot. He loves the Green Bay Packers too so if you really want to warm up to Julio, talk about his packers... Eyyyeee yiiiii yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii............. his favorite saying.. Gloria is awesome, she brings you drinks while your sitting outside at night. Everyone here is very nice. The restaurants are nice and the food was great. We had the picture guy take our pics a couple nights so we had some professional pics to take home. We didn't get to have the beach party which was a real bummer so hopefully next time. Don't worry about the seaweed because that is not a problem like some other people say... Also, as far as the water goes, you CAN brush your teeth with it (our apple rep told us it was fine) and we did so and were fine. The only time we got sick was when we drank too much and that was our own fault. The shows are ok, nothing like they were in Jamaica. Overall this place was a great time and I would recommend it to anyone. You can hang out and meet people if you want (Hi Bob and Tanya from Pittsburg) or just be alone. If you go, tell Julio from the Piana Bar hello and Osvaldo from Windows hello too. They really go out of their way to make your vacation wonderful.

<Content>Can't stop thinking about how great the vacation was. We had never traveled outside the U.S. before so we were a little concerned, but once the door opened from the plane at the Punta cana airport we never looked back, the people in Dom Rep are very nice, but the the people at sunscape are remarkable what a great bunch of people. The resort is very clean the food varity great always something to do. we will return in the future !

<Content>My best vacation yet!! I just got back from vacationing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic...I stayed at the Sunscape Resort from May 22 thru May 29, 2004. Like many of you I had read many conflicting reviews about this resort. I have been to Mexico twice, Cayman Islands, and Jamaica a couple of times, but have never been as pleased as I was with visiting the Dominican Republic. When we arrived at the airport in Punta Cana it was somewhat confusing. There wasn't really anyone there directing you where to go, but first off you have to pay your $10 tourist card fee and then go thru customs. After that you will collect your luggage and then locate what company you are with...we were with Apple Vacations. Then you get directed to the correct shuttle van. It was about a 30 minute drive to our hotel. At first you might be wondering what type of place you have come to...there is trash all over the roads and in people's yards...much worse than I have seen Jamaica or Mexico. I had e-mailed Sunscape a few days before our arrival (I went with my mom...I'm 30 and she's 47) and requested 3rd floor in Building #5 since all the reviews suggested it. We got there around 3:30 p.m. and to our surprise got checked into a 3rd floor building #5 room. Everything went very smoothly...we went to our room and the bellman brought our luggage up about 20 minutes later. There aren't any elevators at the resort except in the lobby. So keep that in mind when you are given a room, however the 3rd floor is so nice because of the very high vaulted ceilings. The rooms are very adequate. Definitely not the best I have ever stayed in, but probably equilavent to a Best Western. You do have a mini fridge in your room, quite a few cable channels if that's what you like, and the bathroom is pretty nice...the sink is separate from the shower and toilet which is nice I think. About the only complaint I ever had with our room was the beds being pretty uncomfortable (basically almost like laying on a box spring), and the lighting isn't the greatest. The ceiling fan was definitely an added bonus though. I never had any water pressure problems like some reviews. I would have to say one of the best things about the trip were the people. I did not run across anyone who was rude. It seemed that everyone truly loves their job there. The beach was absolutely gorgeous. Not a bit of problems with seaweed. There was plenty of fine sandy beach area. The water was a little cold, but you appreciated it after laying out for a while. The water was perfectly clear. I didn't have any of the vendors come and bug me on the beach. You do need to get up pretty early to get the spot you want on the beach and at the pool. We got out and about around 8 a.m. and all the shaded and partly shaded spots at the pool were taken and quite a few spots on the beach were taken too. A lot of people get up really early and take a towel or book to reserve their spots and then I guess go back to bed for a while. Because lots of spots were reserved, but not many people around. The dress code at Sunscape is very casual. I never had to get more dressed up than a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. Evan at the Italian restaurant at night we wore shorts (needs to be a sleeved shirt and guys do need to wear dress pants). The food was good, but almost too fancy of an atmosphere for me. We ate at Windows Buffet for dinner only one night and weren't very impressed at all. The only place we saw open for breakfast was the buffet and it was pretty good for breakfast. They would make omlets, waffles, french toast, pancakes, all kinds of pastries and bread, several varieties of fresh juices, bacon, eggs, cereal, fruit bar, and even would make a smoothie for you. For dinner we ate at the American Grill a couple of nights and were pretty pleased with the food. They have American and Mexican dishes. I had the steak fajitas and the steak another night. Both were really good! They play country music. The Thursday night beach party was absolutely fantastic. They literally spend the entire day setting up for this. The food choices are unimaginable. Just being able to eat with the sand under your feet was an enjoyable experience. The nightly entertainment was pretty good. In my opinion pretty much like a cruise ship type stuff. We only made it to 3 of the shows, the Tribute Show, Latin Show and the Beach Party show. The 1st two were dancing with different costumes and music and the Beach Party was audience participation.We went on 1 excursion...the Outback Safari. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the real Dominican Republic. You get to visit a school, a house, a market place, and then the most beautiful beach I have ever been to. We left at 8 a.m. and didn't get back till around 6 p.m. Definitely bring sunscreen and I would bring some kind of hat if I had it to do over again. My face got pretty burned riding around in the big jeep type thing all day.This review has ended up being a book and I know I have left lots of stuff out. But, if you have any questions at all I would be more than happy to answer whatever you want to know about the resort or Dominican Republic itself. I am already planning my next trip for December!

<Content>Amazing Place. The best small resort we've every stayed at. We moved from Catalonia Bavaro after three days because Catalonia wasn't the 5 Star resort we were promised. Sunscape was. We took the 5 Apple Square Deal and didnt know which hotel we would be at until we checked in at the airport. DO NOT DO THIS - especially when your taking such a major vacation. I think it's best to know where you are going to stay but we were promised a Five Star Resort. We spent 3 days at Catalonia before finally giving up and moving to Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. The 2 places were like Night and Day. Catalonia only had domestic drinks except for one bottle of Absolut that only ever seemed to appear when we tipped. The place was really old and dirty. The final straw came on the 3rd day when we sampled the mexican restaurant. If you can't get mexican food right...... The resort was old, dirty, poorly kept, the food is awful, the pool is dirty, the plants on the grounds are dying, the AC in the room doesn't work and leaks. 3 days in we had had enough, and we moved to Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. At first, The Apple reps at the Catalonia (locals) refused to move us wanting us to pay addition $$ to move to a cheaper resort. We called our travel agent who contacted Apple. They waived the $25 transfer fee. We still had to pay $13 each more for each night, but it was totally worth it. Top shelf liquor, juicy steaks, beautiful clean, new resort, amazing staff. We also found 10 other people that had moved from the Catalonia. And to top it off... who did we see on the last night in the club........ the local Apple Reps from the Catalonia. We would go back to Sunscape anytime. One of the best things about Sunscape is the size, it's smaller than most resorts so it's very easy to get around and you're quick to meet people. Also once a week, there is the Manager's Cocktail party. The manager of the resort comes out and introduces all the main staff. It's a really nice touch and proves how committed they are to making sure the resort is the best. I can't recommend this place enough.

<Content>Best holiday ever. My boyfriend and I came to Sunscape Punta Cana Grand on 12th May for two weeks and it was our first time in the Carribian.We were both very suprised at the quality of service, food and accommodation that we received.The staff were really friendly and done everything they could to make our stay as pleasurable as possible. The food was excellent. There was a wide choice of places to eat which was all very enjoyable. There was not one meal that we ate on holiday that we did not enjoy.. The American Grill was particularly nice. Osvaldo and Pena who work there were great waiters and done everything they could to make sure that we were happy. I would have to say that the Umberella/Piano bar was the best bar there. It had a very relaxed atmosphere. The bar man, Julio was very funny and made us feel very welcome.The rooms were very clean with maid service about three times a day to fill up the mini bar..This has got to be the best holiday that we have been on and will not hesitate to come back again next year! I would definatly reccommend this place to everybody.

<Content>Unforgettable effort by them to make our stay special We have never visited the islands, so we are coming at this review with nothing with which to compare our experience. The resort is beautiful, the staff is completely dedicated to providing guests with wonderful food, atmosphere and experience. The staff members pat your children on the head, and always return your smiles. They work long long hours, and maintain an incredible cheerful demeanor. They work hard and live simply, but they have joy; the rest of us could learn a lot from watching their joy.We enjoyed Windows buffet, with theme nights every night; in and out in 12 minutes flat for one breakfast (kids get tired of sitting in a restaurant when there's fun to be had). Da Mario's was classy and delicious, but we only went once because it's a long time for kids to sit. American Grill is a fun reminder of home; Garth Brooks playing, steaks cooking. I recommend eating early (close to 6:00) to avoid crowds. Beach Cafe has good food, but it's loud-- you can eat outside. A simple room service menu is available 24/7, and various food items are available throughout the resort (self serve ice cream bar, pizzas, popcorn, nachos, etc.) BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU EAT! Three of the four of us became ill-- two of us, it ruined a day. No puttiing our finger on what did it, as we all ate and drank different things, but avoided the tap water. This is definitely an issue on the island-- seemed especially prevalent among the 11 year old kids-- too many Shirley Temples? Be smart-- don't do too many Pina Coladas, and perhaps ask for drinks without ice. The Explorer's Club was different than I imagined. Only about 7 or 8 kids in the entire resort participated at one time; which seems low for a 300+ room resort. My 6 year old loved it; my 11 year old rarely participated. This was a little disappointing as we had planned for both kids to busy themselves with this program. The staff was apparently kind and cheerful; but there was one day that we met the kids on the beach and they were being watched by who I think was a guest because the camp leader was trying to find someone to give donkey rides. It's just very casual and loose and although my son enjoyed it and looked forward to the activities every day, it's not as put together as you might expect. I recommend the Outback Safari as well as the Marinarium. These are extra cost, as they are not a part of the resort, but they are wonderful activities that show you much of the area's land and sea. The guests we met who were more well traveled than us, we picked their brains and they spoke very highly of Sunscape. They agreed it's beautiful, well kept, and the food is better than most other resorts.We took this trip through Apple Vacations; the representatives at the resort are there to help and they really know their stuff. Take full advantage of their knowledge!! Finally, it's a beautiful place, the Dominicans are beautiful people, and our experience, though different than I thought it would be, was truly unforgettable. I'd say, Go with an open mind. You are going to another country, and it is real, and beautiful, and you should do everything to make your experience authentic. Speak a little Spanish, see the island, and just enjoy. Oh, and if your pillows are too flat, use your Spanish/English dictionary and a dollar, and you'll surely score some fluffy pillows and as a bonus, extra beer for your minibar!

<Content>Vibrant, friendly good value for money We went last July for 2 weeks, a family of 3 with a 3 year old. We had a truly wonderful time. Weather was glorious, room big with ocean view if you crane your neck from the balcony! It was great, my son especially enjoyed the outdoor kids cinema each night (Shrek, Scooby Doo etc) and we loved the food, snacks and cocktails(!). We all had upset stomachs but we've been to the DR before and had the same. It was mostly populated by Americans (as you can tell by the reviews) and sometimes Americans can be a little loud (sorry! but true!) so we tried to get the restaurants etc early to avoid the crowds. We absolutely LOVED the catamaran trip and would recommend to all. It was very loud in our room at night but having said that we had to get back in for 9pm as my little boy couldn't stay up! Excellent value for money, i'm looking to book somewhere else in the carribbean this year but can't find anyway to match the combination of price and quality.

<Content>Immaculate and SO Friendly My husband, parents, daughter(14 months) and I went from May 1-8, 2004. The resort is absolutely immaculate and beautiful. Small but homey. The staff was fabulous with my daughter who was less than well-behaved at times. Food was great, beaches clean. I can only complain of one thing and that is sometimes there is quite a wait in the restaurants from sit down to dessert. This was only a problem for us because my daughter is so young and has a VERY short attention span. G0 to Sunscapes. It was beautiful.

<Content>You will love it, We did I know this is a little late, we stayed from 4/17 to 4/24 and all I can say is this is the best place we have been to in the Caribbean, we have stayed at Grand Lido Negril, Breezes Runaway bay, Hedo II, and Grand Sport Villa Ocho Rios. Over the past few years we thought that Jamaica experience was not what it was, so we gave Punta Cana a tryAnd we are glad we did. When we got to Sunscape we were greeted with cookies and rum punch, we arrived before noon and our room was not ready, no big deal, I bought a cigar and hit the pool bar and we were greeted like we had been there for weeks,After about 2 hours one of the desk staff was walking by us and ask if there was anything she could do, I lightheartedly said we could use a room, She stopped what she was doing and walked up to the front desk with in seconds we had our room, and the wait was worth it, form our balcony we could see the beach and the pool bar. I cannot say enough good things about the staff. My girlfriend and I have never had service like this in our life. Every worker we ran into would say hello and the bartenders would stop us to ask us how we were doing, even when they were off duty. I tipped a buck when it was my turn to get the drinks not because I'm tipper, because they deserved it, at times we would just be sitting around without a drink and Nicolas (Rum and cookie greeter) would stop what he was doing and go get us drinks.The food鈥?.let me just say I have spent a lot of money for less quality, we did not have one bad meal, and the beach dinner was A1 food in a A1 setting, I over heard people complaining that the night of the beach dinner they closed the other restaurants and they had to eat on the beach鈥?.HELLO why did you come to the Caribbean if you did not want to enjoy a vary nice dinner on the beach. The burgers on the beach were not a Wendy's but they were not a White castle, it way worked for me after 4 hours in the Vary hot sun, drinking beers.The rooms were ok nothing to brag about, bed was hard (beers will take care of that problem) and speaking of beers if you put a few bucks under the empty beer bottles every day, the maid will load up your frig with beers for you, I never opened the frig with out seeing at least 5 beers in it.Also one day I left my safe key in the lock, the maid found it when she was cleaning the room and took it to security,I called down to the desk and they had the head of security come to our room with it, he had me make sure all our stuff was there and gave it back to me. Nothing was stolen and I had a few hundred bucks in the safe. If you like Lobster you must go to the Green Parrot (located on the beach) you will have to pay for it but you cannot beat a grill cooked lobster on the beach to end the day. I have only a few minor negative things that bugged me. The first, kids at the swim up bar, I do not like waiting forThe bar tender to get me a drink because someone's brat is playing motorboat while the bartender is making a drink for them, The kids should have there own pool away from the swim up bar.Second is the slime ball rude lazy bums that feel the need to get up at 5:00am to go down to the pool or the beach put out towels on chairs and go back to bed or to breakfast, every day we had a hard time finding chairs, there were no people in sight, but all the chairs were taken, we ran into a person that put towels on chairs down at the beach at the pool then went on a 4 hour off resort trip鈥︹€?Rude! The third is the adult pool does not have a swim up bar, is void of music and is stuck on the backside of the resort where you get no wind and no view of the beach.And the last is, if you have a room near the Tex Mex it does get noisy in the early AM. The staff uses carts to move the food to the restaurant and you will hear every crack in the pavement it hits鈥?but then again if we got up early this would not be a problem.Bottom line you will get your bang for the buck and have fun doing it.

<Content>Just Returned I've been reading these reviews for a couple of months in anticipation of our vacation. Some reviews were great and some made me very nervous. So.......now I decided to write my own review. Oh.......by the way, none of us got sick while we were there - I was really worried about that after reading some of these reviews!Me and my husband spent a week at Sunscape, May 7th thru the 14th. Sunscape is a beautiful property. It's a small resort, which I kind of liked! We stayed in building 5 which was really close to everything.....beach, restaurants, etc. (I think the best buildings to stay in are 4 or 5 because they are so close to everything). Anyway, the resort was spotless, I never even saw a piece of paper or cigarette butt on the ground (smoking is allowed at all the restaurants, except Italian - or at least I didn't see anyone smoking in the Italian). I can't say enough about the cleanliness and manicured look of the grounds......very nice! Our room was a nice size but not luxurious, however, kept very clean and stocked with plenty of soda, beer and bottled water. We really were only in the room to sleep anyway! The maid's carts were a little noisy at times, but this can't be helped because there is no carpeting on the floors. They come into your room a few times during the day and evening so if you don't want to be disturbed, be sure to put the sign on the door. They give you a safe key (free), but if you lose it they will charge you $100 - it's best to just wear it on your neck. There was an ironing board, iron and hair dryer in the room.The waiters, bartenders and basically all of the staff were wonderful! I think we had only 1 waitress during the week at the buffet that was not friendly (she didn't even speak to us - just kept coming back to pour coffee, but never even broke a smile). All the others were always smiling, trying to teach you Spanish words and just really trying to make everyone relax and have a good time. Tips were included in our Apple package, however, we felt we still wanted to tip.......these people do not get paid very well and they all work sooooo hard!Buffet was varied........some of the foods we did not recognize, but it was fun to try some different foods. Breakfast buffet was great! They had everything you could want......egg station (any way you wanted them), pancakes, waffles, french toast, plus all other things some of which I tasted and others that did not look appetizing - at least not for breakfast.We got great service at the Italian Restaurant, they were very attentive and we definitly tipped there - we actually ate there 3 nights! (grilled shrimp over linquini was very good and so was the tortolini appetizer as well as the mussels. American grill was fun.......the staff dress up with cowboy hats and they play country western music at the restaurant. My cousin has been at Sunscape 3 times and he told me the steaks were a bit tough and he said to order the medallions of beef because it was filet mignon.......so.........that's what we ordered and it was very good.........very tender and definitly tasted like filet mignon to me.We absolutely loved the fruit stand on the beach.....we made a stop there at least twice a day for fresh pineapples, watermelon, cantaloupe, honey due, mango's, coconut, etc. It was sooooo refreshing and she cut it right in front of you and it was the sweetest fruit I ever tasted. Pool  Beach: Pool was very nice. I'm not really a pool person, but the pool was always spotless so we did use it. We usually started the day at the beach because there's a great breeze there (some days a little too windy, but it feels good in that hot sun). Even with the wind I was surprised how the sand did not blow all over you like it does at our beaches. Anyway, we usually spent most of the morning and part of the afternoon at the beach and then we'd move over to the pool and just float around on large comfortable mats. They have a swim up bar that was fun in the pool. We even brought our cigarettes in the water so we could sit on the stools at the bar and have a drink and cigarette........LOL They did have activities going on during the day.......you can do them if you choose.......no one harrasses you to participate. They play pool volleyball, basketball, bingo, games, dance lessions, exercise classes, stretching classes, etc. Most of these activities take place around the pool and we were mostly on the beach.They also have an adult pool where topless sunbathing is allowed (this is behind building 5). By the way, topless sunbathing is also allowed on the beach but not at the main pool. Beach was very clean.........yes, there was some seaweed in the water, but they do a great job of removing it each morning.......they work so hard at this that it is amazing to just sit and watch them in the mornings. They do this all by hand too! They actually had a screen and 2 guys were in the water using the screen to collect seaweed and then there were a bunch of them raking the seaweed with an ordinary rake and making small piles on the beach....then a truck comes and they throw it in a truck and take it away. It's like a never-ending job! Like I said, the beach area was very well maintained, plenty of lounge chairs (you just had to get up early to save them if you wanted to be under a hut for shade, although there are plenty of palm trees for shade). We never had a problem finding a lounge chair on the beach, although they were harder to find at the pool........seems people saved their pool chairs from early in the morning and they were still empty when we went to the pool at 2 p.m. (all saved, but no one sitting in them). I just think that's plain rude! The only disappointment I had with the beach was the choppiness of the water (and Sunscape has no control over that). We had taken our snorkeling equipment and the water was just too choppy for good snorkeling- this could be because of the time of year that we went - I was told by a dominican that this is their rainy season. We did end up booking the Marinarium Tour, but the water was very choppy for that too and the current was very strong......we had a very hard time trying to swim to the various reefs so that was a disappointment. I thought that tour was way over priced too at $70/person. We've done way better snorkeling tours for a lot less money in Cozumel, Grand Cayman, Aruba and St. Thomas and the experience was way better!By the way, we did take long walks to the left of the resort (pass the vendors) every morning and after walking by some of the other resorts I realized that Sunscape did have the nicest beach area......the other resorts looked worn and torn. There are some boats in front of Suncape just like other posters said, however, I never smelled any fuel from those boats and I thought they were pretty to look at.....I mean water should have boats in it......LOLVendors: We decided to do the shopping thing so we went to look at the goods on the beach. We went in our bathing suits and without any money....we figured this way they could not harrass us and if we saw something we wanted we'd ask them to hold it and go get money. Well, they were amazing.......I actually did find things in 3 of the huts (you do have to wheel and deal with them, but they were all very pleasant). Anyway, I spent $21 at this one hut and asked him to hold it for us and we'd be back with our money - he just told us to take it with us and come back with the money later. They did this at the other 2 huts too! This just blew me away that they trusted us to take the goods and come back in the next few hours to pay them! This really left a great impression on me! I said to this one How do you know I'm going to come back and he just said I trust you. Of course, me and my husband went right to our room to put our stuff away and went right back to pay all 3 of them. Don't forget, you do have to wheel and deal with them, but it was a way better experience than I had when we were in Jamaica! I mean for $21 I ended up getting 4 lbs of coffee, a magnet and a Caribbean print button down shirt for my grandson. They originally wanted $19 just for the shirt! So......don't be afraid to deal with them.It seems like they had a very good program for kids. All the kids seemed to keep busy at the kids club. Every night at 7:30, they showed a movie on a large screen right outside and they had a show every night at 9:30. The theatre is outside so I don't know what would happen if it rained - guess there would be no show! We were lucky, we only had a few showers that did not last long.They gave us an evaluation form for fill out and they asked for suggestions, etc. The one thing I did put down on that form was that I thought they should have more to do in the evening. The only choices after the show were to go to the disco (which was really full of young adults - 20ish - and it was a pretty small room too and very loud with strob lights) or to go to the Piano Bar (entertainment alternated every other night in the piano bar - one night a saxophone player was in there and the next a piano player that had us do Kareoke). So........for us middle aged people it ended up being the Piano Bar, but after seeing the same entertainer the entire week.......it got old. My suggestion was that they needed another lounge.....maybe with softer music and some dance music for the middle aged people that wanted to dance. I mean we were there an entire 7 nights and the only time I heard a slow song to dance to was when the Saxophone Player played some. There was an outside bar too that a lot of people tended to just hang at after the show. By the way, we enjoyed all the shows........the dancers are great and work really hard and the audience participation shows were hilarious. Most days after the show we were really pretty tired anyway (being in the sun all day really knocks you out), but it would have been nice to have at least one other option for something to do after the show.Bartenders were all great and by the way, they do have brand name liquors - if you want them you just have to ask for them. The Dominican people are very warm and humble and definitly left a lasting impression on me.Overall, we had a very good time and were very satisfied with the resort. We usually take cruises for our vacation and are kept very active on those cruises, but we wanted to just go away and relax this time and we definitly got that at Sunscape! If this is what you are looking for you will definitely enjoy the resort!

<Content>True HOSPITALITY The Sunscape hotel staff is the definition of hospitality Everybody was so accomodating from the moment we stepped of the bus into the lobby to the moment we said our goodbyes. The staff is so appreciative to have you on their island and experiencing their culture. Juan Cruz at the swim up bar makes one heck of a drink and loves wet tip money. The weather was amazing, their mostly cloudy is chicago's sunny. It was the perfect trip and we plan on going back in the near future.

<Content>Great place...will go back again definitely.  My wife and I went to the Sunscape Grand the week of May 3 - 10th. What a marvelous place. The grounds were spotless, well maintained and absolutely gorgeous. We loved the fact that the resort was smaller than the others. We tried all the restaurants and DaMario's was fantastic. To be honest, we mostly ate at Windows and we were extremely happy with the food and service. We brought some one dollar bills for tipping and we did so most of the time. Don't let anyone tell you that you have to tip every time. That is simply not true. We were in building number 4 on the main floor and we were very happy that we were. It is away from the stage and noise. However, by 11 p.m. the shows were all over and noise was not a factor. The beach was very nice and our resort was the only one that continously raked the seaweed. There was some seaweed on the very windy days, but it was not a problem at all. I strongly remcommend this resort and would definitely go back again. A big hello to Daniel (my buddy) who always had a smiling face and was eager to help at any time.

<Content>Fantastic!!! My wife, daughter, son-in-law and I visited the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand in February 2004. We had some concerns because of some of the reviews we had read before going. WE ALL HAD A FANTASTIC TIME!!! The people were great, the food was delicious, the rooms were fine although we could hear the staff getting ready for the next days events in the night. There was very little seaweed on the beach or in the ocean.I would definately return to this resort without hesitation. The property from the grounds to the rooms was very clean and well taken care of. I have traveled to Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Hawaii. For the price, the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand can't be beat.

<Content>Really a 4.5...but rounded up to a 5. The Sunscape in Punta Cana is outstanding! The resort is small enough so that you feel at home, but large enough that it has everything you could ask for and more. The people that work at the resort are fabulous. The week of April 24-May1 was a slow week (I estimated less than 40% occupancy) so the Beach Garden Cafe was not open for Breakfast or Dinner, limiting your dining options. Also, the big beach party was cancelled mid-week because of stronger winds and with no attempt to re-schedule (which they had apparently done the week before).Weeds are a problem at the 2 resorts down the beach who do not diligently work at this problem like the Sunscape does. Only 1 day out of 7 the Sunscape had a weed problem. Find a bartender that you like and take good care of him...it will pay dividends like International brands and fast friendly service. I took $100 US in singles just for tipping maids, waiters and bartenders. The rooms are big and clean, but not luxurious. The food at the Italian restaurant was great for dinner and the Tex Mex and buffet were good. All in all, this family of 4 enjoyed our time there and if returning to Punta Cana would choose the Sunscape again.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised Visited April 29-May6/04My husband and I just returned from a very relaxing stay at the sunscape. From the time we stepped off the plane and walked into the Punta Cana Airport we were pleasantly surprised at how warm and friendly the people were. After staying in Mexico last year and experiencing , to say the least, a not so memorable time, this was Amazing. We were very sceptical about our choice in resorts, but our worries were soon put to rest upon arrival. The lobby of this resort is beautiful, as is the rest of it. They work very hard to maintain the beauty of this place. I can't stress enough how friendly, and helpful the people at this resort are. The service was perfect, the food awesome, and we're fussy eaters too!! The American Grill was fun, the Italian classy and delicious!! Windows was awesome too .Especially having a chef like Fernando! He's the best,. Everything fresh.  The Beach was beautiful. Yes , there was some seaweed, but we're from Canada eh! You haven't seen seaweed until you've visited the Atlantic Beaches! The nice thing about the beach too,is that there is always a beautiful breeze. So, no matter how hot it got, the breeze made you feel like you were in heaven! The entertainment was fun and they always got the audience to participate which was a blast! I think some people had too much Presidente!! Eh Paul!The beach vendors that were on the beach were very amusing with the way they approached people.At least they were to us. It's there job and the way they were trained in their country to make a sale. Don't knock til you've lived there. We are very fortunate to live in Canada. They are only trying to provide for their families. I would have to say the only negative that I can think of is their internet access. It was very slow. I tried to e-mail home and by the time that computer actually got to my account my time was up! So bring a lap top if you must do anything on the computer!All in all our experience was awesome and we will definately go back to this resort !

<Content>Wonderful and relaxing A party of 8 of us, family and friends went to this great hotel from 14/4/2004 until 28/4/2004, two weeks. We couldn't have had a better time, there was absolutely nothing that we could complain about. The staff could not do enough for you, the food was excellent from the Beach Bar, American Grill, Italian to Windows. Very nice surroundings. The only thing we spent money on was on suntan creams with very high factors as we hadn't anticipated how hot it was to be, but even this was wonderful. Definitely will return.

<Content>Don't be fooled Don't be fooled or misled by any negative reviews you may see or read about sunscape. We just returned from 8 days of great fun. Sunscape is terrific. It's clean, the staff is very, very nice, the food is good, the bars are great, and there will be plenty of activities to keep you as busy as you want to be. Trust me, you will love sunscape!!!!

<Content>Wonderful time My husband and I and 19 friends just returned from Sunscape, Sat, May 1. We all came here for the wedding of 1 of the couples. Everything was wonderful. The staff works very hard at making sure you are enjoying yourself. The resort itself had beautiful decor and landscaping. Beautiful palms, flowering bushes, etc. Some of us did have some stomach problems, but all in all it was a wonderful week. Could not have asked for a more relaxing vacation. Hope to go back again.

<Content>what a wonderful time My (new) husband, myself and 19 other friends just returned from Sunscape. Are visit was from April 24 through May 1, 2004. I can't say enough about this resort. It was a wonderful trip. We were married there on April 27th. Danny (wedding coordinator) took very good care of us, as did everyone else. Our room was lovely, with a wonderful view of the ocean, the grounds were well kept, the food was wonderful, and last but not least, the drinks we free flowing. The bartenders and activities workers did a wonderful job and brought many smiles to our faces. Alot of laughs!!!I can't say enough. The dancers were wonderful too. This resort is definately one that we will be returning to.

<Content>Average, but beyond average When we first arrived, I was disappointed. The kid's pool is very small, the rooms are dated and the beach was mediocre. However, the longer we stayed, the more we liked it. The staff goes overboard to be friendly. I was traveling with a 3 year old, so she didn't fit into the kids day camp, but she still had a great time. The food does get tiresome after a few days, and there are no other dining options, but we survived. Would I go back -- no. I'd go one class up.

<Content>Paradise My boyfriend and I and another couple went to Punta Cana 7/2-7/8 2003... I know this is late, but it might help some of you make decisions about summer travel. COME HERE! Our trip began rocky with a plane problem and we were delayed. Apple gave us a credit which we are using to come back to the DR in a month. That was our only problem, everything else was amazing! The grounds are breathtaking, the resort is just the right size with everything being not too far away. Our room was lovely and was kept lovely by the maid. We overlooked the kids area with the 2 donkeys. It was fun to take them apples from the fruit stand. (mmmmm- fresh fresh fresh)  The food was great! You have lots of choices. We liked the Italian restaurant and the cowboy themed place too. Pizzas, burgers etc for lunch. Dinner can be formal or laid back. Free flowing drinks.  I have to say that the people here are incredibly hard working. The animation staff play games, teach aerobics, etc then they put on a wonderful show at night and then they party with you in the disco! You'll always find a smile on their faces too. The bartenders take care of you, suggest things, and are entertaining.  The excursions were great. If you only pick one, go to the Marinarium. Snorkeling, shark sightings (nocturnal sharks) a party barge, dancing... its just wonderful. The nice English lady even hooked me up with a wonderful stable, El Pat. I was able to fullfill my dream of galloping on the beach just like the movies! (they let me ride english saddle too!!)  We took the trip to Santo Domingo as well. If you are into history you will love it. Also, it is neat to see the country side.  There is so much to say! If you are thinking about going I would encourage you. We enjoyed our time there so much we want to move there!  The 4th of July party was wonderful. They threw us a huge beach party with barbeque, dancers, a rock band (flown in from the states) flags, balloons the whole works!  The adult pool is the place to make friends. I found the guests to be friendly too. We met people from all over and ended up accumulating dining companions over our 7 day trip.  I really didn't want to go home.  We'll return to Sunscape again and again!

<Content>Relaxing time at the Sunscape We stayed at Sunscape 4/10-4/17. The resort is very clean and well cared for and the workers are constrantly cleaning. THe housekeeper was awesome-they clean your room 2-4 times a day. We stayed in building 4. It is close to adult pool and far enough away from the stage to get some releif from the noise. The rooms are comfortable. The food is just okay--We are a bit picky but there was always something that we can find that was decent. The meats at Windows were tough at times. The best meal is medallions of beef (fliet mignon) at the Tex-mex american grill. The american grill has the best food. Stay away from the fish stew. Windows is great for Breakfast and lunch! The hamburgers from the outside grill are gross! It is mystery meat! The drinks are awesome and Luis at the adult pool is absolutelu fabulous. You dont even have to move off your chair. It can be near impossible to get a chair at the beach with a hut cabana. They are gone by 6 AM. And the sun is REALLY hot! I mean sunscreen is a necessity even for dark screened folks! The disco is fun and the staff is wonderful. Beach can be stirred up at times with seaweed but is pretty. Our major problem was that we did get sick as did every single person we met at the sunscape. Major stomach cramps and impending time spent on the toilet is the common experience. We spoke to others from other resorts and they did not get sick at all. Every person we met at Sunscape got sick!! This place is great for a completely relaxing vacation spent by the pool or beach! I may go back some day!

<Content>Sunscape Punta Cana,.."What a wonderful place !" We stayed at Sunscape Punta Cana for our Honeymoon during March 26 2004-April 2 2004,...all in all, we had a wonderful time. Our room wasbeautiful, the food was excellent, as were the drinks, the staff and the service,...the best we have seen for a very long time. These people are always there, with a friendly smile always on their face,..just incredible. Everybody was very helpfull.I was a little disapointed that the beach party was cancelled that week, due to rain...however this didn't spoil anything for us.We just want to tell them to keep up to excellent service, since this is the key to keep your guests coming back. It's their people that makes this resort so successful.

<Content>So Relaxing! My boyfriend and I just returned from the Sunscape and overall we really enjoyed it! All-inclusive resorts are so easy..put the wallet away and forget about it! We brought about 100 dollars in singles on the advice of another review and boy did it make a difference in the level of service we got! We tipped the chambermaids every day and they overstocked our mini-bar with juices and extra beer and water. They also left us a case of water, which was definitely needed. Don't drink the tap water! We noticed if we tipped the bartenders right before they poured our drinks they were nice and strong. The staff remembered us wherever we went and made sure we were well-taken care of. It was so much fun to speak what little Spanish I know with the staff, we even had a sailing lesson that was mostly in Spanish. We stayed in building 5 on the third floor, I would advise everyone to request building 4 or 5 so that you are far away from the late-night noise of the pool bar and shows. The beach was soft and beautiful and I didn't mind the seaweed that others have complained about! Come on, it is the ocean after all! We learned that you have to wake up before 7am to reserve chairs or a palapa (beach hut). Shade is at a premium! Being from Manhattan, I have to admit that we are quite spoiled when it comes to food. The food at Sunscape was pretty good, though a lot of it was kind of heavy and oily. Don't even try to stay on a diet there. My low-carb high veggie plan went out the window! Windows, the buffet retaurant was the best for breakfast and dinner. We usually had burgers for lunch from the beach bbq. Our favorite feature was the fruit bar on the beach...any kind of tropical fruit was cut for us and we sure ate a lot of it! The Beach Garden cafe kind of sucked so we avoided it and American Grill was just ok. Da Mario's the Italian place was pretty good though we both got a bout of stomach upset after eating there for the second time. Overall, we had a great time resting in the sun away from the noise and craziness of New York City. The resort was spotless, quiet and a very happy, upbeat place. The staff work really hard and deserve all tips they get. We used all the water sport toys and went horseback riding and enjoyed ourselves every day! The only negative was that we had trouble getting a palapa more than once during the entire week and that two of the restaurants were nothing exciting. However, I would go back to Sunscape again because it was clean, quiet and comfortable. There were no annoying crowds or wristbands. We walked over to the other resorts next door and there were so many people jammed up against each other on the beach and by their pools. Plus they all had those ugly plastic wristbands! Definitely check out Suncape if you visit the Domincan Republic. Please email me with any questions! I'd be happy to help!

<Content>Bring the kids!!!! Just got back from Punta Cana(March19-22,04).This was my 2nd trip to D.R. Sunscape was EXCELENT! I went with my friend for a little mini-trip from our husbands and kids. I however felt guilty when I seen all the things for kids to do at this place!!!! They had staged shows FEATURING the kids..(like run-way models!)They had ceramic paintings, tables filled with legos, a huge ship filled with sand, playgyms, and even a teen center! The staff even plays ball with the boys and volleyball with the girls! If I go again, the kids must come! But just because there were alot of kids, it doesn't stop us adults from having fun! Right after the kids staged shows were the regular shows which were awesome! There's lots of audience participation things there. FUN FUN FUN. Our room had 2 double beds, very clean. The only problem any of us had there was that when it rained HARD, there is no doorways to the stairs .....its all open, so on the 1st and 2nd floors, the rain would sometimes come into peoples rooms. (we were on 3rd floor, so no problems) The staff was extremely nice. The whole resort was clean. The beach did have alot of seaweed, but it was only due to the big tropical storms that they have in the spring. I was there last fall, and there was no seaweed at all! Depends on the season. The crew is constantly cleaning it up as soon as it drifts in. I went on the outback safari tour ($84)..it makes you appreciate how lucky we are. Went on the Saona Island tour.....it was beautiful.($70?)well worth it. It was just mainly a place to relax and eat....got togo to a place where they let you get out in the open sea and swim with starfish. Went to the Marinarium. (GO THERE!)got to swim with nurse sharks and stingrays. The snorkeling was incredible. After that they take you to a spot in the sea where you can get out and walk and the tour guide walks through the water with rum and coke. Sunscape, and these tours ......want to see you have a good time. They are CONSTANTLY giving you beer, rum....you name it. And trust me, they are not shy on the amounts! I spent one whole day sick from all the liquor I had the day before.....not because of the food! The food was so good. Food was available any time you want it. All kinds of food. People who complain about this hotel must be the richy, spoiled people b/c I'm a normal average person and to me, this was true paradise. BUT, I'll bring the kids and hubby next time!!!!!

<Content>Food No Good Every thing is Deep Fried Well, we stay at the resort from March 27th through April 3rd 2004. The staff was great, the grounds were beautiful. The beach was nice. The entertainment was great. Thumbs up to HANS. However:My personal opinion on the food and the opinion of my party is everything at this resort is FRIED and reapplied with more oil and then some more. They should invest in a BBQ or a grill. The selection at Da Mario's and American Tex Mex was not great and I ate only once at each location. The buffet was the best resturant with a better selection. But once again very oily. I would not go back to this hotel because of the poor selection of the food and because of the way of the food is prepared.I stayed at room 1310. Very high ceiling. Try to stay on the second floor.

<Content>Resort Good - not the Beach Resort Facilities:- The food was the average buffet variety, was okay. The fresh juices were great (esp the chinos). The breakfast smoothie stand where you could pick the fruits you wanted was good.- For a resort, the pool was small. The main pool had a lot of people all the time. The adult pool was small too and not too clean. - The grounds were very nice. So were the rooms. We had three rooms, two in bldg 2 and one in bldg 5. Have to mention that we paid for a ocean view room in bldg 5 but were dissappointed with it. What we could see were these rickety beach huts, where one day, I actually saw a local taking a shower with a bucket (with his shorts on - thank God)!- Entertainment: Was good, I felt sometimes it was a little too adult oriented while the kids were there. I think one of those contests were act like a gigolo etc.- Staff: I though everyone was great and worked hard to make everyone's stay pleasant.Beach: My big problem was the beach. I have been to Turks  Caicos (TC) twice (once at Beaches and once at Club med), and I have to say that the beach was a big dissapointment. I don't know if this is because I have seen TC which is known for having one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. The beach was not at all blue in front of the resort (as shown in brochures and post cards). I did not step in that water, but did go for a long walk and noticed that the quality of the water was much, much better if you walked a mile up. There were a lot of people trying to sell time shares right outside the resort. Also, there were locals with their boat coming into areas where people were swimming and there was no one to stop them, my nephew almost had a close call, he was snorkling and the boat went right past him.Apart from the water, the sand was good. The palm trees were very pretty and there was always a good breeze. One thing I really liked was a sunscape fruit stall at the beach. They had the most exotic fruits, like cheeko, sugar cane, papaya etc, cut write in front of you. Many topless bathers were at the beach.One thing to mention was that we did receive a note from management after 3 days of our stay stating that we had a choice of going to their iberosatr 6 star resort ( i think that was the name) if we agreed to empty our rooms, supposedly they had over booking. We chose not to do that.In summary, I think the resort was very good for the price. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy it because I hated the water at the beach, I was expecting it to look like the pictures and it was not like that.

<Content>Recommendations Just got back and wanted to added a couple comments (dont misinterprete - we liked sunscape).1) Bring a light sweater - sometimes there is a nice draft if the wind blows from the ocean. 2) Bring a large mug - the cups are only 10 oz's. It will save you a trip or two to the bar 3) Bring loads of singles or ask the bartenders for change in a worse case 4) Stay away from the red meat - stick to chicken. 5) If snorkeling - cheeese in a can works better than bread for feeding fish - but do so at your own risk - not most places dont let you do this and for a good reason - Scuba Caribe had a dont care attitude - not lectures abt stepping on coral (etc.) 6) For lunch - its better to ask them to prepare a sandwich for takeout vs waiting at the table. 7) Re getting a chair in the morning - best to check your towels at night and be up by 7:00 if you want chair by the pool under the umbrella.Any questions email -

<Content>great trip we arrived at sunscape march 17 for a week stay. we are a party of 4 adults with 2 rooms with connecting doors.building 5 1st floor. we were greeted in the lobby with cookies rum punch and a very friendly welcome home. the lobby is amazing. the rooms were very nice, and clean. the adult pool was very nice with a bar, the main pool was gorgeous with a great swim up bar, lots to do from, laying on a raft for a little nap, dancing along the pool with the staff. the staff is amazing from the service to the nightly shows they put on. they made me tired just watching them. theres lots of sun and shade. the beach was beautiful, lots to do, paddle boats, sail boats, banana boats, kayaks, or just lay under a beautiful palm tree. we did 2 trips, first one was driving a 2 person speed boat out to a reef to go snorkeling with a tour guide. and our 2nd trip was the outback safari, which we rode on a truck to see how the dominican people live, and visited the childrens school, and they took us to a beautiful beach to go boogie boarding. the resort gives you a free 15 massage, which is nice, food was very good, very kid friendly, even babys were having fun. 2 couples got married during our stay. sunscape is a very friendly, fun, relaxing way to go. please feel free to email me for info or questions.

<Content>You Must GO!!!!!!! Visited Sunscape Punta Cana 3/19 - 3/22/2004 - Loved the property! Arrived without difficulty from BWI. Greeted in check-in line in lobby by three Sunscape staff .... one bearing freshly made chocolate chip cookies, one with a tray of fresh punch drinks and the third with the bottle of rum to pour into your drinks. Awesome!Check in was easy but we were given paperwork for wrong room. Required Apple rep to work it out. Language is a problem here so if you truly need anything, find those Apple reps and use them. That's what they're there for. They make it soooo easy.Our room, once we got there, was smashing. A nice size king premium room (upgrade if you have the chance) with a two-sided balcony over looking the beach in building #4. Out of this world views of the beach and water. I know it's an all-inclusive but tip the staff if they deserve it. Believe me, some don't so tip the ones who do.We left our maid something every day and she realy took care of us. Chocolates during nightly turn down service, fresh robes and overstocking in the mini fridge. We wanted for nothing.About the food:Windows: Table serivce from male staff was almost non-existent. Female staff was warm and friendly .. and we tipped them. Breakfast buffet was awesome, awesome, awesome! Lunch and dinner were o.k. We thought food was fancy and not to our liking but we were always able to eat a little something.Tex Mex - great fajitas but waited 30 minutes after ordering for food. Male server never returned for additional drinks etc. Friends got sick from the mushrooms on the steak.Beach Garden Cafe/Grill - good food. Club sandwhiches are the best. If you ask, they'll make your order to go and you can eat on the chaise lounge on the beach. Supposed to be open 24 hours but there are times during the day they are completely closed so note the hours posted on the door.The only reason I rated this resort above average instead of excellent was because of the lack of food we prefer. Beach and water are awesome. Tons of palm trees but lots of sun and shade. We set our towels on chairs before we went to breakfast. Towel area opens at 8:00 so instead of turning towels in each night, simply exchange them so you can pick your chair before the towel man arrives in the morning.No pestering from beach venders on Sunscape property. Walk off the property though and you are fair game. Just say no thanks and keep walking or they will pester you. ONe right after the next. Easier to not talk than to get away from them once you start.Can't figure out the seaweed complaints by some people. We were there four full days and only a small amount of sea weed floating in the water, NOT growing from the bottom. Mostly in late afternoons. Seaweed trucks in the morning remove the stuff and are done for the day. Walk down the beach to the other two resorts and THAT'S where you'll find seaweed. On the beach not that well cleaned up and all thru the water. Continue down the beach passed the resorts and you'll find deserted areas. Only people walking the beach. No resorts etc. Swim where you want. IT's wonderful.Beaches are guarded though. Sunscape had armed guards (pistols only) on 4-wheelers. I think it helped keep probelms away after dark and the beach vendors under control during the day.As far as entertainment goes, I heard complaints it wasn't that great. We aren't much into anyway. Two small kids at home and our idea of vacation is parking it on the beach 10 hours a day relaxing. I don't care too much for the shows or whatever is going on. Salsa lessons on the beach, pool aerobics, the staff themselves are entertainment without any real shows.Bartenders are also great. My husband tipped very well in the morning and was taken care of all day long. Advice: Bring some $1 bills for tips. Yeah yeah I know it's an all-inclusive and you shouldn't have too tip and personally I think they shouldn't be allowed to accept .... but some of these people work hard and do go out of thier way. So tip them and be sure NOT to tip the slackers. You'll learn fast which is which.Hospitality Suite: After checking out, you may sign up for the hospitality suite (hotel room) so you can shower before your flight home. Do this early as possible as spots fill up quickly. You have only 30 minutes for your entire party. NO, repeat NO amenities are supplied. No shampoo, soaps and we even had to chase staff for towels, which bit into our 30 minutes and there was no maid service between uses.IMPORTANT: Upon entering Punta Cana airport, you'll be required to by a green tourist card at $10/pp. Make sure you keep this card or you will have difficulty departing the Country without buying another one. The DR immigration agent took our card and Wellington the Apple tour rep was required, along with a meeting with the top airport brass, to allow us to leave without a hassle. KEEP YOUR TOURIST CARD!! It's not just as easy as buying another one!This is a nice resort. Book a premium room, drink bottled water only (even with brushing teeth), tip the people who help you and have a great time. This is a wonderful place!

<Content>excellent **** My husband and i stayed at this resort in October of 2003, it was the best. The staff were very helpfull, especially the bell man which calls himself handsome. The rooms were clean. We were fortunate to have a ocean view room. It was simply amazing. The entertainment was excellent as well. it is a resort for people of all ages. I would recommend this resort.

<Content>Everything was Perfect!!! We were at Sunscape 2/13/04-2/20/04. The trip from start to finish was awesome. We were married on the beach 2/18/04. We could've been marired on the beach or in a gazebo. The beach is by far the best choice. Sandra took care of every detail, including decorations on the beach to the flowers and reception after. Sunscape has their own photographer. He took about 115 pictures of the wedding and all turned out awesome. They also video taped the wedding, we paid for it before we left without seeing it. It couldn't have turned out better. The employees at Sunscape are all very helpful and friendly, occasionally hard to communicate, but that was part of the fun. Outback Safari with Eddie and Nico was a blast. Plenty to drink and lots to see. We had 25 people in our group and everyone loved it. We plan on going back someday...soon!  Val  Jamie G.

<Content>Great Trip Just got back from Punta Cana (March 6-13). The Sunscape is a truly great resort. The only two real things that were negative for me...well I was traveling with my mother, and our room only had a king sized bed. We asked for a room switch for two double beds and they told us they would work on it, and never got back to us ever. The other thing is that it is pretty noisy, the halls echo loud, and people are up until way late. OK, with that aside. The staff are about the nicest people you could meet. Very friendly, always smiling and ready to help. Not everyone speaks english, but the ones who didn't tried real hard! There are two pools, one for adults only, which has a jaccuzzi with cool water! it was nice. The main pool is huge. Get there early to put your towel on a chair if you want something shaded (the sun is really strong). There is a swim up bar in that pool. The alcohol is free flowing! drink up! It seemed like there were bars every corner you turned, and the resort is huge. The beach was great. At first the water at our end didn't seem that real pretty blue, but it all has to do with the sky, clouds etc. So a few days into the trip the water was very blue. Lots of seaweed though, but the water is nice and warm. There is a water sports place on the resort so you can use a catamaran, kayak, paddle boats, and snorkel gear. The boat traffic in that section of the beach is active, so there were some boat fumes. They have lounge chairs at the beach to lay on. I read another review here and it is accurate about the reef that was built way out in the water. It breaks the waves so there are no real waves where you swim. I guess the surf got pretty mean at some point in time and some people were hurt, so they built it. There were some little shops on the beach, but the people hound you like mad to buy, makes it annoying. No other shopping on the whole island though. Most of the stuff is junky. I actually came away from Punta Cana with no souvenirs, ha! There is a spa there. I got a massage and body wrap which was very nice. Cost about $80, well worth it, and they do go over to the beach and give massages there too. They have all sorts of games and activities for adults and kids scheduled through out the day. It seemed very kid-friendly. We took a jeep safari tour. That was a total disappointment. Just a long (all day) drive with other jeeps with no real sites to see (cows, sugar cane, poverty). We did get to see a school, and go inside, and a house and go inside. The little dominican children swarm and beg. SUGGESTION; bring food to give to the kids because even though they beg for dollars, they have no way to get to any market to buy anything. Some ladies from another hotel had a ton of food, and it worked out great. The end of the safari was the best part, a nice private beach where there were nice waves! awesome blue water, a beach buffet, and horses to ride. This safari cost $84, and the concensus of the others we went with all decided...not worth it. Just stay on the resort. We asked, and they do have a bus that goes to the nearest big city, which is $1.00 a ride, and an hour away, no a/c of course. So, just stay where you are, it doesn't get any better then Sunscape! The food was ok. One reviewer said not much of a choice, well I disagree. There are 4 restaurants. One is a huge buffet every day with plenty to chose from, and different stuff every day..... breakfast lunch and dinner. There is a small Italian place, with a limited menu but it was good. There is a Tex-Mex place that had a killer tenderloin, and there is a Beach Cafe that had breakfat lunch and dinner....we ate breakfast there one day, but ate at the buffet the rest of the time. There dinner menu was limited too. We did eat lunch there, they had a nice salad. There are carts on the beach, one with fresh fruit all day, and one with hot dogs and burgers for lunch. There is a snack bar with nachos, pop corn etc. Essentially there is food coming out your ears! The thursday night beach buffet was beautiful. What a set up. Great!! This was a really nice vacation and I would definately go back without hesitation!

<Content>Great Time, Great Vacation Just returned from a week at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. (March 5,2004 - March 12, 2004). My husband and I both enjoyed the vacation. I would say that the only disappointing aspect was the room. We were in Bldg. 3 (even though we had requested Bldg 5). The room was clean and was kept clean, however the bath need refurbishing. The bath just looked tired and old. Also the mattress was very, very hard. Also our mini-bar was not refilled as it should have been. Noise is definitely a problem. Besides being close to the stage the hallways are all tile and you hear every step and every sound. One other note the maids are constantly going into your rooms, they will clean and take the dirty towels but don't always have clean towels to replace them with until later in the day and then they come back and turn down your bed in the evening. Service at the resort is excellent. The people are very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and we really enjoyed not having to make reservations at the different restaurants. The Beach Party on Thursday was beautiful. The food at the beach party was a little disappointing compared to the usual, but just seeing all the work that went into the preparation was amazing. The beach is nice, yes there is seaweed but it is the beach. Enjoyed using the catamarans. We are powerboaters but the sail was easy to use. We snorkeled in the swimming area, not many fish but with a little bread and bananas you do get to see some. Needless to say the drinks were ever flowing. We went on the Outback Tour. Which is well worth the money. You really get a flavor of what the country is like. We also went on the Saona Island Tour. The catamaran ride is wonderful, the beach on Saona Island is OK, the powerboat ride is a bit much. We enjoyed it, but I could have skipped it. We did not see many of the shows (although we heard them all in our room). We booked through Apple and the really did their job. I would recommend the Sunscape to anyone. The smallness is one of it's greatest assets. It's nice to be able to walk everywhere. If you've left something in your room it's not a hike to go back and get it. And don't forget no wristbands.

<Content>Couldn't have asked for more We went to Sunscape in Punta Cana for our honeymoon. We had the Superior Ocean Front Room and it was amazing. Our room was perfect. The hotel staff was amazing. The food was great. While we did not drink the water, we did use it to brush our teeth and it was fine. The cleaning ladies supply you with plenty of water daily. The pools were clean and extremely nice. The beach was noticeably cleaner than any other resort nearby. Sunscape did a great job cleanig the seaweed off every day. We had absolutely no complaints except our balcony door was a little hard to open - not a big concern. I often wonder about the people who want to blame the resort food/water on illness. Could it possibly be the exposure to sunlight everyday and the constant consumption of alcohol?? The food was safe and the restaurant offers five restaurants. The buffets in Windows was incredible for both brunch and dinner. I would encourage anyone going to Punta Cana to stay at the Sunscape Grand. You could literally not take any extra money with you and be happy. Although, I do receommend going snorkling and parasailing. We went parasailing through Alex - he works out of a hut in front of the hotel. Although the hotel offers parasailing, if you go through Alex, you will be taken up to Bavaro Beach which is a great way to see a little more of the island.

<Content>Totally awesome I was one of 4 that went here from Jan 17 for booked for 7nghts. It was the best. Our rooms were nice, clean, the grounds were beautiful. Food was very good. Booze was all top shelf. They didn't skimp on the alchol either. Service here was outstanding. Mid week we 2 of 8 couple chosen to be Upgrade to Secrets Excellence. This places beach was breathtaking, but the service there was the worst I have ever experienced. Rooms were definetly nice. But all in all we all agreed we wish we had stayed at the Sunscape. Talked with several people at the airport and heard horror stories from other hotels. Very glad we chose Sunscape and we will definelty be returning. Best vacation we have had in a long time.

<Content>Great Facilty and Great Staff! When we arrived we were immediately greeted by the friendly and curtious staff. The facility was great and the weather was even better. I would recommend this facility over any other for the simple fact of it being away from the other facilities. The staff went out of their way to accomodate our needs. The beaches were far less crowded than any of the other facilties. We thoroughly enjoyed our vacation and we are planning to go back!

<Content>AWESOME!!!!! We've been home a little over a month since our visit to the most beautiful spot on earth and can't get this place off my mind! After reading all the reviews, thought I'd better participate with my thoughts. This place is truly a 5-STAR at a 4-STAR price!The people were very nice, the food was second to none and the entertainment was EXCELLENT! (especially the intoxicated Canadian attacking the guy in the shark costume in the pool ............probably the funniest thing I've ever seen!) The weather was perfect.........cool at night for sleeping, hot during the day. There was always something to do and the beer Presidente very cold. (Take big mugs for your beverages) Highly recommend this place..........WE'LL BE BACK!

<Content>Overall Quite Good--But Noisy! Been to all inclusives all over the Caribbean, and was pleased that Sunscape knows what its customers want, and serves them well. Plenty to do, plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and loads of the Dominican sun!Positives--no wrist bands, 24 hour food and drink, good night shows, nice variety at Windows, able to walk the beach to other resorts, hard working and polite staff.Negatives--forgot the bug spray (NOT the resort's fault!), and the noise from the people setting up the restaurants in the early, early morning. The shows get over about 11PM, and are heard throughout the resort. But a few hours later the restaurant workers start over the paths with their squeaky carts--hard to get back asleep! Luckily, we were too tired to care most of the time!The biggest positive is arriving at the airport. Anyone going into Cancun knows of the long wait to get through; or the long trips to Ocho Rios or Negril once through Montego Bay. Here, it can be minutes through Customs, and not much longer to the resort. If one sees all inclusives being very much alike, this is a huge, huge plus.

<Content>What's not to like We were at the Sunscape Feb 14 - Feb 21. How could anyone not like the Sunscape? Of course it is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are spacious and the staff keeps them and the grounds sparkling clean. Everyone is very pleasant and they speak English so communication is not a problem. We were a group of 6 - 2 couples each with an 11 year old boy. All of us had a great time. The resort is small which we felt was a plus. We are comfortable with letting the kids free to walk about on there own and it was only a quick trip to your room, restaurant, lounge or beach. Several reviews indicate people got sick, but we did not have any problems. Bottled water is everywhere. If I had to find something wrong it would be perhaps that there were not enough options, food-wise for the kids. If you have a picky eater (like I do) it could be a challenge filling a dinner plate. If you want to RELAX, RELAX, RELAX this is the place to go. Lots of great drinks and a great pool to enjoy. I recommend getting to the pool early so you can get some chairs under the cabanas. This gives you a great place to relax when you feel you need a break from the sun. And if you have some family members that can't take a lot of sun this is perfect - they are right next to the pool. We loved it so much we are already thinking about going back next year. Enjoy!

<Content>Great trip Sunscape was great We stayed at Sunscape Grand in the Dominican Republic. The resort, food and staff were great. We had no trouble checking in or out. No language problem. I read the reviews before we booked. Some good some bad. We took a chance and no regrets. We would go back in a heart beat. Trust your own instincts. J  E Milwaukee, WI

<Content>short but sweet Reading this site was very helpful. We just returned 2/19/04. As in the past reviews the grounds of this hotel are beautiful and well groomed. There are always people cleaning and prunning up the outside grounds. The pool was clean, a little cold to my liking, but enough to handle a sold out hotel as we had last week. Swim up bar was fun bartenders entertaining. The beach was beautiful with the palms trees a wonderful addition. They spent alot of time cleaming the beach from seaweed, they are the only hotel that does this, makes a big difference. There are servers on the beach to get you a cool drink in the afternoon. The rooms are older, but kept very clean. You will be told many times not to brush your teeth with the room water but that all other food and drinks are alright to consume. We had salads along with ice in our drinks and had no problems at all. All of the employees are very friendly but don not speak alot of english at all. I felt the prople at the front desk were very stand offish. When we arrived there was a water main break at the hotel so the whole hotel was without water for about 5 hours. It was our travel day so we were OK but for the people there wanting to shower for dinner there was nothing that you be done and the front desk was a bit rude. Thanks to the review that said bring bug spray Deep woods off if you have it, if your a person whom the mosquitoes love be aware they are BAD. I din't think to bring after bite or benedrill with, bring it!! Also many people had brought from home insulated mugs. Great idea the bartenders would just fill them up all day long. No bees flying around, or hanging around because there might be a empty glass around with some drink left in it. The cups are small that they use all day and plastic. Great selection of the hard stuff. good labels and plenty. They carry their local beer only, which is fine. They encourage tipping. You'll be surprised how a few dollars make a difference. On avarage for meals people were leaving 3-5 bucks it seemed. Bartenders? How good do you want to be served? Money talks in the area. As far as the kids club, I didn't have kids there but they seemed to be very busy all the time announcing things all the time. There were many kids there but they didn't bother us. They seemed to stay at one end of the pool. There also is a small wadding pool for little ones. They has a hugh movie screen outside wear they play first run movies at night, mostly kid related but enjoyable. The nighttime entertainment, all I can say is they try very hard, but coming from a family of dance I couldn't sit through it. If your using Apple Vacations make sure that if you ask for special items you have confirmation from your travel agent or copy of fax sent. The Apple reps at the hotel are very friendly and did help get us a different room. We requested king, which they said they never received any info on that but I had a copy of the fax which seemed to help us,we got 2 doubles, later that night we did get moved. Ask for an outside rooms or else you face directly into somones elses room. Not good. Front desk not helpful at all. There is a few huts on the beach for shopping, the whole barter thing. They all have the exact same thing. They all have a deal and want to braid your hair. Much nicer when one night during the week the vendors come into the hotel. As far as the food, I can't say that it was great, it was passable, filling but not fufilling. Best meal, American Tex Restaurant, get the medallion steak, best meal all week. About 4:00 everyday the cookie lady comes aroung with a sheet of cookies. The fresh fruit is great. Overall we had a good time. The 4 1/2 plane ride probably was the worst part of the whole travel experience. Don't count of getting things at the hotel gift shop. Not well stocked with reading materials at all so bring stuff from home unless your willing to pay $7.00 US for a Cosmo which was the only American magazine they had. Don't forget BUG SPRAY !!!!!

<Content>Felt like Adam and Eve Me and my boyfriend spent the best two weeks of our lives at sunscape last November. From arrival to departure nothing was too much trouble. Our room was kept immaculate at all times and our fridge was always re-stocked at least twice a day. Our only complaint was the amount of people complaining it became quite tiresome, we actually overheard one group complaining about a few clouds!!!, my only recommendation for these people would be to never holiday in england because you will definately not receive the standard of food and service that we did at sunscape. We felt like Adam and Eve being made to leave the garden of eden the day we went home. P.S And for all you people complaining about upset stomachs in our experience if you drink pina colada's which contains cocunut milk(A NATURAL LAXATIVE) is it any wonder!

<Content>Wonderful Holiday Spent two weeks from 26 November until 11 December 03 at Sunscape with my two sons (28 and 25 years old). We all had a fabulous time. The food was brilliant - so much to choose from! The grounds were kept spotless. The staff were great especially the entertainments team and the bar staff - they just couldn't do enough for us. Spent most of our time around the pool so that sons could meet more people but the beach was great as well. Yes there was some seaweed on the beach but it didn't bother us - it was cleaned up every day and after all it is the beach! The beach party was amazing - they took all day to prepare for it. The fruit carvings were spectacular. The entertainment was very good. We did have a tropical storm (Odette it was called) which was pretty awful but didn't spoil our holiday. Went on the Saona Island trip - a long day and quite expensive but still glad we went! - we made some great friends and are going back in December this year. Would recommend Sunscape to any age. Will tell everyone what a wonderful time we had!

<Content>Great people, OK beach My wife and I just came back from a week at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. If you are looking for good food, a nice pool and great people, this place is for you. If you're looking for the blue-green color and rolling waves of a tropical ocean this is not your place. There is a natural reef in out in the ocean which acts as a breakwater, knocking down the waves. That being said, the resort itself was wonderful. The staff was awesome, whether you wanted to sit by the pool or join in on the games or dance lessons. The beach party on Thursday night was a nice touch up until it rained. (Buffet on the beach and a movie on the beach afterward.) The food was also very good, but could have a slightly larger selection. The grounds were immaculate and the drinks free flowing. The movie every night was great for kids (Pirates of the Carribean, The Lion King, etc.). Do not believe the dress codes on the website! You only have to wear long pants in DaMario's. Shorts and T-shirts allowed everywhere else. For the money it was very nice, but my next trip will probably be back to the Gala Resort in Play Del Carmen Mexico.

<Content>Just what we needed My husband and I went to Punta Cana with another couple, Jan. 26-30. It was NOT long enough! We are going back as soon as we can. Every detail was perfect. The staff could not have been nicer. Great food, drinks, anything you could want. We have nothing but the best to say about the Sunscape. We did meet several other people who had stayed at other resorts before and liked Sunscape the best! We give it 5 starrs!

<Content>Great Resort My wife  I spent a week at this wonderful resort. We travel extensivley throughout the country and out of the country  have a pretty good knowledge of resorts and their services. Check in was a breeze, the building I requested (Bldg 5, 3rd floor. Really quiet, overlooking the adult pool) was granted. The resort is probably the smallest on the strip, which is of great benefit, not far to walk to anywhere. The staff here is outstanding, from the management, to the bartenders, to the housekeepers. They bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. A couple of bucks here  there to these happy people goes a long way. The grounds were perfect, lush, spotless, and clean. People have complained about the seaweed at the beach. It was raked up by 9:00 every morning and touched up throughout the day. If you want to see seaweed problems, walk up the beach past some of the other resorts where they wade past piles of it. The main pool was a little busy at times, but we preferred the beach anyway. We never had a problem getting a lounge chair in the shade. and never felt we had to walk to the beach really early to reserve one. The food was really excellent. All 4 restaurants had plenty of variety to keep us well fed and happy for the week. The beach party Thurs. night was awesome! What could be better, great food, good drinks, ocean breezes, slow dancing and a nice little show afterwards. To all who complain about this resort, are you sure you were here? We never heard one complaint from any of the hundred or so people we talked to. I highly recommend Sunscape Punta Cana Grand to anyone. One of the nicest resorts I've ever been to

<Content>Great time I was in the service industry for 15+ years. Worked all levels, all jobs. Vactioned in the Carribian/Costa Rica 3 times. Just so you know where I'm coming from when I say this was a truley wonderful vaction/resort. You like shows? Never saw one. Vacations, to me, mean getting sun, drinking good drinks, smoking Cubans, eating well, swimming, exploring. I was completely satisfied. I loved most of the food. Loved the fact that the whole place was not U.S. in the D.R. They had Presidente beer, tasted like Hieny to me and always ice cold. The service was great. Call and top shelf liquors. Don't listen to the nay sayers. They sound like the kind of people who'd complain in heaven (I mean, c'mon a freakin catapiller in your room is what you remember????!!!!). I did not use the tap water. I did not get sick (except at the southwestern rest. but I drank WAYYYY to much tequilla. It was not the great food). If you are picky, whiney or just no fun, don't go! That will leave more room for the rest of us when we go back next year. PS went in July, never too hot a single day.

<Content>Just Got Back Today From the Sunscape Just got back from the Sunscape ... went to the DR for a little R  R and that's exactly what we got. Had to spend the first few days at the Allegro (next door) because Sunscape was full. We knew this ahead of time, but noticed that other spillover people were moved to the Allegro upon arrival, so MAKE SURE you are absolutely staying at the Sunscape before leaving your city! That said, resort is great bang for the buck. Food generally quite good for a resort of this type (all-inclusive). American Grill is excellent. Beach is nice, but well worth it to take a walk past the resort areas (head north) during the day to swim in a more secluded area. Probably best to do this with another person. To sum up ... Positives: Facilities, food, adult pool (much quieter than main pool), staff, beach. Negatives/Things to Avoid: Shade scarce unless you reserve areas with towels in the a.m.; also a bit noisy if rowdy groups are in attendance and your room is close to main pool (i also would avoid the rooms near the stage). Also, don't go to Punta Cana if you think you might get stir crazy. Not much to do in the surrounding area. This is our second trip there, and we go there because there isn't much to do. And that's what makes it so lovely if you need to just get away from it all ...

<Content>Our group just returned from Sunscape and we had a a great time. Miles and miles of great beaches, great food, great disco and a piano bar, grounds were very clean and various activities were also great. But wait, the service in some cases was just ok! There were some minor problems, non of them were show stoppers. Our group does not need much to have a great time, but to be fair to the American and Canadion travelers looking for high stndards Sunscape is a bit short on that, but they are not far from being a 6 star. Details, details, details! Don't count on a front lobby desk to help you! they like to say no. A trip to Sanoa Island and Capt. Cooks is a must.We would consider going back.Enjoy your travels, Chris

<Content>JUST HAVE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF! My family has been to SunScape Grand 3 times. Caren and Rod called us the come back family. I was very comfortable with my two girls, then were 7 and 11, going about on their own. The resort is just the right size! Just beautiful! We witness two weddings on the beach. The staff were very friendly and fun to be around. The weather could not have been better. Sun, Sand, Palm Trees! What else do you need? I will be booking another week this year after Christmas. Looking forward to bringing in the New Year at SunScape!!

<Content>excellent resort My wife  I  another couple visited the resort for a week Jan 23rd-30th/2004. WOW, excellent food, service, facilities, and the staff we found absolutely amazing. no line-ups for drinks or food. No annoying bracelets. Good choices at all 4 retaurants, and good variety as well. Nothing to change here-looks and acts like a 5 star-keep it up Sunscape-We'll be back.

<Content>Ay yi yiiii!!! Sadly I am back in Canada after what will always be known as the trip of a lifetime (Jan. 24-31, 2004)! The Sunscape is beyond words but what makes it so phenomenal is its staff! I don't think I will ever forget any one of them -- A few most-memorable are...Julio, mi esposo -- we wed the first night ;o) in the piano bar where he works (no Krista, Kristal) Watch out for his fantastic drinks, they'll have you up on stage in no time Chucki, ay yi yiii -- the big guapo of an activities guy who you can't help but fall head over heels in love with even while he's dressed up as the indian from the Village People (quit hitting on the blonde girls and get back to work ;o) Ricardo, mi amigo -- not to be trusted playing cards but is well on his way to becoming a fine gentleman with a big heart Alberto, muy bueno -- the sweetest, most soft-spoken guy on the resort (my friend had a bit of crush on him and he became secretly known as ooooh Alberto)You must go here! I can't imagine a better place and I for one have only returned to Ottawa do some laundry, re-pack my bags and call my travel agent so that I can return to my husband ;o) and all of my new friends!Caren, are there any job openings?I'll be back faster than you can say AY YI YIII!!!Krista (Kristal) Ottawa, ON, Canada

<Content>Amazing Spot! My g/f and I stayed at Sunscape Jan 3-10, 2004 and loved it. The place is quite amazing, especially seeing it's rated a four star by most Cdn travel companies. It was a moderately priced resort in our opinion and was a real value for the buck, that's for sure. Seems odd that some would not like this place. The food and drink were great, the grounds are well kept and beautiful and there's lots to do. Most of all, the staff are outstanding. They go above and beyond to make your stay truly enjoyable. The beach party was awesome. Can't beat it. The beach has some seaweed but it is cleaned regularly. The pool was large and well kept. Loved the swim up bar! We would go back in a heart beat. Highly recommend Sunscape to all!

<Content>Nice but noisy My husband, myself and our two children aged 9 and 6 enjoyed Christmas week at Sunscape having spent the previous 7 nights at the Iberostar Bavaro. At Sunscape we had booked a Family Suite comprising two interconnecting rooms with two bathrooms and we were very pleased with the accommodation. Even taking into account that we had booked two rooms Sunscape was considerably cheaper than the Iberostar over Christmas which was why we chose to spend our second week there. I was very pleasantly suprised at how Sunscape compared to the Iberostar and I have to say that I consider it excellent value for money. Our children enjoyed the Kids Club (which they did not at the Iberostar) and happily ate lunch and occasionally dinner with the club. On the subject of food Sunscape again did not disappoint, in fact my husband and I both preferred the food at the buffet restaurant to that at the Iberostar buffet. However, I have to say that both of us were sick at both hotels and in the end I barely ate or drank anything at Sunscape although the food looked and tasted delicious. We travel several times a year all over the world and I have only ever once been ill (10 years ago in Egypt) before. I can tell you that we were very grateful to have two bathrooms available for our use and I spent far too much time there for my liking! I was very disgruntled at watching my family eat (and my husband drink) and not being able to join them. Other than the food issue, the only other problem we experienced was the location of our rooms. We were in building 3 top floor which had a great view but unfortunately was just above the main pool bar which became very rowdy during the evenings. We were also pretty close to the Theatre and the shows are very noisy. Now if we hadn't been travelling with a 6 year old who was shattered by 9pm we would have been at the bar ourselves making just as much noise as other guests and enjoying the shows too. However if you have young children with you I recommend that you request building 4 or 5. We were also unfortunate to have noisy and inconsiderate (English) neighbours who kept us awake in the early hours. Otherwise Sunscape is a great hotel with a good pool, great food, excellent bar, lovely grounds and plenty going on in the evenings. If I ever risked going back to the DR - which is very very unlikely - I would very happily return to Sunscape. If you have a hardy stomach, go, you will have a fabulous time.

<Content>Punta Cana Review It was nice, but we would not go back. We stayed at the Sunscape Grand Resort and the resort itself was nice - beautiful pool area, nice room. However, I must tell you, before we left on this vacation to Punta Cana I had heard many different reviews about both Punta Cana and this resort. We have traveled to Cancun and Jamaica and loved both areas.In Punta Cana you will (I repeat) you will not get the clear, beautiful Carribean water you may be use to; the seaweed on the beaches are a huge problem. I have to say that Sunscape made every effort several times each day to rake all the seaweed and they did a pretty good job, however, it never stopped. And it does not make a difference what time of the year you go - this is solely due because of where Punta Cana is located and it gets lots of wind from the Atlantic which brings all this seaweed in. When you go in the water, there is no seeing your feet as the water is murky....We heard that many people would get sick from what they ate - that's anywhere in Punta Cana - I don't think it does matter which resort you stay at. While we were all very very careful what we ate (and of course you don't even think about brushing your teeth with the faucet water) 3 out of the 6 people we traveled with still got sick (2 out of the 7 days they were there). Stay away from all seafood. This was very hard for me as I am a lover of seafood, but this is what made our friends very sick.The weather was very nice and warm, and the facility was nice, however, I would have to say that I would not go back because of the two issues I mentioned above.

<Content>Incredible!!!!!! My husband, my 20 year old daughter, my 20 year old niece and I just went to the Sunscape in Punta Cana January 5-9, 2004. It was our second time there within a year. We had a tremendous time, it is so wonderful there. The staff is awesome. The bartenders - especially Leonardo and Juan cannot be beat. My daughter and my niece had such a terrific time. I'll be looking into going back. Thanks Karen (reception desk) for all of your help - you're amazing. Thank you also to Aga (Apple Representative) - you made our trip!

<Content>Very Happy Honeymooners My husband and I had a FABULOUS honeymoon there in Spring 2003. Great time, Great drinks, Great beaches and the Greatest staff of anywhere we have ever been. We were treated as if we were the only guests there. TONS of daytime and nighttime activities. You can be as active or as lazy as you want. Breathtaking views from inside and outside the resort. Can't say enough wonderful things about it. We loved it so much that we're going back in 2004 for our 1st anniversary!!!

<Content>Sunscape is awesome! I really enjoyed my trip to Punta Cana. My family and I went from December 26th, 2003 to January 2, 2004. We tried every resturant at least once, but ended up eating at Windows the most because of the variety of food and rolls. We also enjoyed the shows. The dancers were very energetic, and the costumes were beautiful. Also, the resort had activities planned for New Year's Eve, with a special show and fireworks. If you go to Sunscape through Apple vacations, as my family did, go to the orientation the first day and find out about the excursions. My mom and I went on a trip where we could swim with nurse sharks(who have no teeth) and rays. Before the trip left, I saw the most beautiful rainbow stretching across the ocean. Great picture! For any couples out there, it is also a popular place to get married. However, the weather was a little rainy and it was very windy on the beach. But everything else was fantastic. I would go back in a second if I could. Finally, try the adult pool and the swim up bar. Both are excellent! Thanks to Apple Vacations for a fabulous time at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand!

<Content>Cant wait to go back!!! i visited this resort with my 2 friends, parents, and their friends. this place was out of this world, i dont know how it can get bad reviews! nobody got sick, and 7 days was just not enough! the staff was the best. they were so friendly and very funny, we made so many friends. we thought the rooms were find too, very clean. another thing, NO seaweed problem!! our days consisted of going to the beach, then pool, lunch, beach again then taking showers, going to dinner, watching the shows at night (awesome!) then going to the el disco bar.(that was so much fun, we even got to go behind the bar and help make drinks). there is also so much to do like snorkeling ect. but we just wanted to relax and party. when we go back i'll deff. try the spa, and snorkeling, parasailing ect. The food is a little hard to get used to AT FIRST, but after the 2nd day is was good and we missed it!i could go on forever but i def had a blast and cant wait to go back there and visit again, the staff to-miss ya!

<Content>a perfect vacation! This trip was really ideal for me and my family in every way. I read a lot of these reviews when we were planning, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised every single minute during the trip. I really wouldn't have changed a thing about this place. My family visited Punta Cana for 7 days over Christmas, Dec. 20-27, and we're 7 people: 2 50-something parents, I'm 23, sisters 21, 21, and 12, and brother 19. We took a Bahamas cruise last Christmas, and this trip was 10x better (and cheaper too, actually). We booked through Apple Vacations and they were wonderful (please please go to the orientation meeting your first day! So helpful.). The vacation really started with the plane ride, with free mimosas, a real dinner, and games with champagne and cash prizes. Unreal! We flew into La Romana (hour and a half drive as opposed to 20 minutes from Punta Cana airport) but I loved the scenery on the bus and didn't mind a bit. This country is beautiful. As for the hotel itself, I just thought everything was excellent. THE STAFF: These are the most happy, positive, and hard working people I've ever met (not to mention gorgeous -- I swear, no unattractive Dominicans). The restaurant service was faster than I've ever had at restaurants at home. Everybody was there working on Christmas Day with a huge smile on their face, and they are really honestly happy to help you. The economy isn't great in the Dominican Republic, and they have some of the best jobs available, so they're happy about it. Those I met loved practicing English with me, and loved it more when I practiced my Spanish with them (I don't know much but I got pretty good by the end of the week!). Our family learned a ton about another culture, and honestly if you don't speak a word of Spanish you'll be fine (nobody else in my family did). It is really nice however to know a bit, and I'd definitely recommend a little Spanish-English dictionary to carry around with you. Everybody at the resort is required to take English classes, but obviously some are better than others. THE ROOMS: I thought the rooms were really nice, tropical feeling, pretty furniture, AC and a ceiling fan, beds were comfortable, everything was clean, maids made swans out of towels, etc. and the size of our room made my jaw drop (but I'm used to Ramadas). :-) We were on the top (3rd) floor of our building -- which has hallways that are open to the air on both ends, how cool! -- so we had high vaulted ceilings too. Don't get me wrong, it's not the Plaza... it's not like the dressers are made out of gold or anything... but I thought it was great. My parents' room next door had trouble with the AC and bathroom fan when we arrived. They were fixed without a problem though. THE HOTEL: Tons of palm trees, gorgeous landscaping, and everything is compact so nothing is a far walk. It's really well thought out, I think, to make everything more relaxing. You get a free 15-minute massage which is right on the beach, there's a spa facility and gym, a big pool (with a swim-up bar!!!) and it's very clean and has mats to float on, etc. There's a fun and energetic entertainment team that is always looking for people to participate in little games on the beach, aerobics, dancing lessons, etc. and if you win any of the games (which are short and easy) you get prizes, like free bottles of rum. The shows they put on aren't exactly Broadway-quality, but most are pretty entertaining. One of the best features though was movies and Monday night football on the beach, in lounge chairs, at night with a great breeze, and of course a drink. Wow, how perfect??! THE BEACH: Beautiful! White, clean sand, with a decent sized roped-off area of water for swimming, etc. and the water sports building is right next to it. Lots of palm trees, cozy little shady huts, and lounge chairs, but it doesn't feel crowded. The water is clean and blue and like bath temperature, but there is a little seaweed. Being from the East coast it's much better than I'm used to though -- the seaweed is like little blades of a twiggy grass, only about 2-3 inches long each, so it's nothing to cry about, and they do come through periodically to clean it up. My brother lived on the water trampoline. The water sports were really nice to have too. There's always a paddle boat or kayak available to take out, and the water is clear and relatively shallow so you can see sting rays and coral/rock beds clearly. There's apparently a barrier reef -- you can see big waves crashing on the horizon, which is kind of cool. It's like they put it out there on purpose, because it makes the beach on shore so relaxing with little tiny waves rolling in. THE FOOD: I think I was most pleasantly surprised in the food category. I was preparing myself for a week of cafeteria/college dining hall food (we took a cruise last Christmas...) but oh my goodness, it was unbelievable. Needless to say the best feature is that it's an all-inclusive so it's all-you-can-eat (and drink) but they weren't kidding -- there's tons and in 7 days we didn't come close to trying everything. And the drinks are not watered down, in fact they're pretty strong. If you get a coconut drink, you get real coconut which is delicious (but a natural laxative, so go easy on them) -- the best pina colada I've ever had! There were lots of foods I was not expecting to see, even in the buffet restaurant, Windows, which was great. The fruit was I think the best I've ever had, and they offered interesting fruit juices too which were great... pineapple, passion fruit, watermelon, cantaloupe juice (my favorite). Great omlettes, and a great mix of dishes from around the world to try. The italian restaurant, the most formal place to eat, offered entrees like duck ravioli, veal, seafood  pasta that included calamari, mussels, etc.... I was really impressed. Even the service there was fast, and they serve you a cordial as soon as you sit down. I don't think I tried anything I didn't like. Christmas dinner was ridiculously impressive... completely set up on the beach with the most elaborate display of food, including sculptures and a LIVE nativity scene featuring the entertainment staff complete with a goat and a donkey! And by the way, our family wasn't cautious when it came to food. Obviously we didn't drink the water, but I love seafood and all of it was fantastic. I didn't take any pepto bismol or anything, so I think some of the reviews that tell you you're definitely going to get sick are exaggerating a little. 2 of our 7 people had diarrhea on the last day, however. It could have been caused by absolutely anything, maybe one too many pina coladas? I'm not sure if they ate anything in common. THE OUTBACK SAFARI: We decided to take one of the excursions offered at the hotel and I'm so so so glad we did. It was the best day of the trip. We learned a ton about the culture -- our guide, Alex, spoke perfect English and was absolutely full of information. He knew tiny details about Dominican and U.S. history and he couldn't have been nicer. He served as our bartender too and there was no shortage of rum drinks. It was on a 15-or so passenger bus that basically didn't have sides or a top, just saftey bars and 2 long benches (with seatbelts), so we could see the gorgeous landscape and talk to locals, etc. Gorgeous mountains, green hills, palm trees... they apparently fimed parts of Jurassic Park there. We stopped at a typical Dominican home which was absolutely incredible. I think there's a lot of people that should meet these wonderful people and see how little you need to be happy... it was a wake up call in a lot of ways. We stopped at a ranch for lunch, again it was great, and also made stops to buy exotic liquors, and Dominican coffee and chocolate. We learned about how the coffee and chocolate are made with really short but informative and funny presentations. The last stop was at Macau beach which had perfectly clear blue water as well, but was in a different location and had nice-sized waves for boogie boarding. So fun! We got back to the resort around 5.. a great day that I would do again in a second. SOME THINGS THAT COULD BOTHER OTHER VISITORS: Keep in mind I still gave the Sunscape 5 stars! :) We bought a couple of jars of Dominican coffee beans on the Outback Safari and I think we bot a bad batch. It smelled like an ashtray! Maybe we were supposed to treat them somehow, I don't know.... but I have to say the ground coffee we bought was excellent! Also, there are vendors on the beach right next to the Sunscape's beach that have great souveneirs and really pretty jewelery. However, if you walk by them, they're going to talk to you, and invite you to come into their store. I didn't mind at all, but I know some people do (my Dad got pretty annoyed). I actually got into a great conversation with one guy who was really anxious to learn more english. Some are nice, but most will do a ton of talking, sometimes can get pretty pushy, and give you a very special price, but like the Apple people tell you the first day, talk them down to 30-50% of their original asking price, or just walk away. :) Another thing that bothered my parents a little was our check-out day. I think the hotel turned off one of our rooms' keys early by mistake, but a trip to the front desk fixed that and they were very apologetic. We had to leave for our flight around 4, but to leave the room later than noon was a $20 charge. They do offer a free hospitality room though where you can go for an hour I think to shower, etc. before your flight, which was nice. We scheduled the room for 3pm and had to wait I'd say 15 minutes for it to be ready after that. Again, didn't bother me, but I should be fair!Wow I wrote a lot! I hope it's been helpful... the Sunscape is paradise and I'd highly recommend it!

<Content>great do not use primi taxi though We just returned from Sunscape on Dec. 19 2003, My wife and I, 2 sons and one nephew (21,23,23). We had a blast. What a great place. the only problem that we encountered in the Dominican Republic was Primi Taxi. we took an afternoon to Higuay and know about the general fares associated with taxis in foreign countries. However, in this case the price quoted was not the price expected. After a short ride (approx 2 km) we paid the fifty pesos and continued to drink at a couple local pubs on the main street. the Owner wanted to sell us a taxi driver as a tour guide and we said that we have been there before and know our way around. However the taxi driver followed us, and, thinking he was off duty and just wanted a drink, bought him a few beers. After visiting a couple pubs and picking up some souveniers, it was time that we thought to get back to the hotel to indulge in the excellent food at Sunscape. Unexpectedly, we were told that we owe 150 US dollard for the travel guide. Well after trying to shake the man the whole time, and spending what we wanted to (and basically brought) we said that we never wanted a travel guide and were going to take the bus as planned. this is where it got ugly. The swaring was wretched and then the owner made us get into the cab and took us to jail. The people at the jail were nice understanding people, as most all Dominicans are, and refused to throw us in jail. We further protested and wanted to take a bus back to the hotel to pay the man just to avoid further turmoil. but he said that we had to take his taxi to the hotel and charge us an additional 20 dollars. we got in and on the way he took us to another jail where he tried to throw us in the cell. again the police refused. well we finally made it to the hotel and paid, however the security was very helpful at the hotel when they stopped him when he continued cussing at my family. Francisco, thank you. DO NOT USE PRIMI TAXI! The rest of the stay was excellent and aside from the trouble with Primi was probably the best vacation we have been to thus far.

<Content>Entertainment/food/beach/service/room=Good time! My wife and I just returned from our 7-day trip to Sunscape, Punta Cana. DR. Our objective was to relax and get away and we were able to do exactly that. I read these review before I left and found some things to be true and some to be either false or corrected. I will provide some tips to make your trip to Punta Cana more enjoyable.Arrival This is an open-air airport. You walk off the plane and down stairs like Nixon. You can wave this peace sign if you want (I wish I would have done it!). You walk into the terminal, which could be a 300-yard walk if your plane is parked far from the baggage claim. Keep your carry on to a minimum. You will pay 20$ to get your tourist card.Transfer If you are a lady and you are carrying a bag, you are not going to do it long in the airport. A porter is going to take your bag from you. The guy saw my wife expression and said in perfect English, it s OK don't worry, I will take you to an Apple rep. We got on the bus and sped off for our 20 min ride to Sunscape. The driver drove fast and passed on the left when I thought caution was the better part of valor.Resort appearance The place was decked out in Christmas decorations, which were tasteful and tropical. The resort is like a garden. We saw hummingbirds, at least 12 different butterflies, birds, camilo lizards and a marine Iguana that hangs out between Windows resturant and Building 4. The guys feed her bananas and she is a fat, happy lizard. Probably be on the menu soon! The resort is clean and well kept. Most days there were 12-15 workers mowing the lawn raking the grass, etc. This is a 300-325-room property that has a large footprint. So this helps you to not feel a great density of people. The resort was booked full but it seemed at the time that we were the only ones there.Food My favorite topic. We brought pepto, immodium AD etc. Take them 1 day before you leave. You ARE GOING TO GET DIARREAH. It s inevitable. You are traveling in a 3rd world country. You need to stay away from the following: Salad Raw vegetables Cold pasta Undercooked or med rare, rare steak or pork All cold seafood Some cooked seafood like shellfish Coconut milk (which is a natural laxative typically found in pina colada's) Tap water (don t brush your teeth with it or drink it, more later on the water)All of this being said, I don t want to scare you, but you can prepare your self and be smart about what you eat. We were and had the ability to the bathroom when and where we wanted, which are a big part of having a good time! The pepto AA/D should help you to at least control it. We got busted in the Italian restaurant and I had to go back to the room and put long pants on. It was no problem. The veal was excellent! We went back later in the week and I had the lasagna appetizer and it was so good I had it for desert as well! The tex mex restaurant was outstanding! We ate there twice as well. The Chicken/steak fajitas were soo good and huge proportions, you will need to ask for more tortillas. They played Garth and Brooks and Dunn on CD s that were skipping all the time. It was a great reminder of home after hearing the meringue 1000 times by the end of the first day.Windows is a fine buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch; we did not eat dinner there so I will not comment. The best was Thursday night, which was the beach party extravaganza.They started on Wednesday night with 60 workers setting out dining tables, buffet tables and chairs. The set up a stage and decorations as well. Everything was ready by 6:30 Thursday night. They turned a 50 yard section of the beach to a 5 star reception/dining hall. They had fruit carvings, braided palm decorations and a desert table 10 yards long. On the menu was: Pork with a sweet sauce, corn on the cob! (hhhhrrrr), steak cooked on the beach, seafood mix (didn t eat it per above) and fresh steamed broccoli and about 60 more items I won t bore you with. After we ate the staff put on a show and everyone had a good time.Now back to the water. You can wash with it but that is it. Don t get it near your mouth! Don t stand in the shower with you mouth open and don t drink out of the toilet. The resort is aware of this and will provide bottled water that is OK. The drinks (coffee, teas etc are made with it and the ice is too. You will have as much bottle water as you can consume in your room. Check you mini refrigerator in your room. It has beer, OJ coke and water. (Nice and cold after a hot day on the beach). We took 4 liters of USA water and did not finish them. Enough with the food and Dominican bathroom practicesEntertainmentThese are 7-8 of the funniest people I have yet to meet. Mini, is the leader and MC s most of the shows. Mini speaks at least 3 languages very well. Eng, Span, Fr.. He is small but his is the second funniest guy on the resort. The first is Chuki. This is a more than slightly over weight Dominican man that has a smile on his face 24/7. He deals the free blackjack and leads most of the beach activities. He also does the Spanish lesson every day at 3:00. Chuki s pot belly is the star of every show. He is like the Punta Cana s Chris Farley. He had a grass skirt and a half shirt on and was dancing to the Cotton Eye Joe like his feet were on fire.BeachThey keep the seaweed off pretty good. We got up early and by 6:00 there a guy out there with a rake taking care of cleaning the beach. There is some considerable seaweed in the water. The nicest thing about this beach, were the palm trees. I am not a big sun guy so I like the shade. We usually found a spot were I could get the shade and my wife could work on her golden coat. The water is warm and the natural reef 400 yard off the coast breaks up the waves, so they come in gently. We took some 40 DEET bug spray on the trip. We did not need it until the wind died down during the beach dinner on Thursday. We used it but still got bit up around our ankles from sand fleas (I guess). Recommendation, take the bug spray and use it around your feet and ankles.RoomThe room was nice. We asked for a beach view and got it with out any problem. We had room 4223. It had a nice balcony that wrapped around the corner of building 4. We did not pay extra for this and it was real nice. The A/C did not work too well and we were hot the first night. The toilet was running and it forced me to get up and be a plumber for a few minutes. I went to the front desk the next day and told them about our issues and they took care of the A/C and the commode in a few hours. We also asked for two more pillows, which they took care of as well. The A/C unit could not be adjusted all week. We controlled the room s temperature with the ceiling fan.ServiceThe waiters/bartenders are very committed to there work. Tip them on your first day and on your last day. We gave them 5 U.S. for the ones who really took care of us. The bartenders like to pour drinks. The all have good drinking wrists, once a bottle is bottom s up it does not come upright for several long seconds. Other all-inclusive resorts have well drinks and bottom shelf booze. Not at the Sunscape, Alleluia the SUNSCAPE! They had Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, Drambui, Dewars, Absolute, Bailey s all of the good stuff. The beer is El Presidente, which is decent ale.Misc. The Dominican paintings that we bought did not come home in good shape as the salesmen suggested. They will rolled them up for you but ours came home stuck together.To negotiate with the street/beach vendors, start at 75% off asking price. They likely will not give you a price; they will ask you what you are willing to pay. If that happens go to the hotel gift shop, where everything has a price tag and get some prices in your head. You should expect to pay 25-35% less outside that gift shop. Then offer the beach guy 75% off the gift shop price and start back from there. If you give some, they will give some. Try not to pay more than 50% the beach vendors originally asking price. They cannot bother you on the beach, but if you walk near their stand, which are located on the opposite side of the water sports, you will be asked to take a look at what they have. As soon as you walk out of one shop the next guy has got you. No gracias works pretty well.The hotel will ask for a credit card for incidentals. They will ask your permission to take the card and imprint it. They will seal it in an envelope until you check out. They will not put your name on it, just your room #. When you check out, if you have no charges, they will give the envelope to you to tear up. This is a great effort to reduce credit card and ATM card theft in DR. If you check out the U.S. State department web site, this is a major issue for tourists. Do not even take your ATM card. Watch your credit cards at all times. In conclusion, we had an overall great trip. With some of these additional learning s, we would have had a better trip. The people on this resort understand and will help you to have a good time. If you go say hi to Pappe, Mini, Fernando and Chuki!

<Content>Good time for the money I'm a little late with the review, but better late than never. My wife and I went down for our 3 year wedding anniversary. Things went smoothly on the transistions from the airport to the resort. It's about a 30 minute trip to the resort. When you arrive they are they to serve you. We told them it was our anniversary and we had excellent service. It is a family typ atmosphere so if your going their for romance you may want to go elsewhere. For us it was great because we have a young boy that stayed home and so it felt a little like home seeing all the children around. The food was decent...you must east at the Texas Grill...their meat was to die for. You should take some imodium ad. You never know when something might hit. Also the beach was decent, but there was a lot of seaweed. If you plan to go on a excusion, you must go on the outback safari (time of your life). Lastly, you should know that coconut is a natural laxative......you get my drift. Overall we had a great time and for the price you couldn't beat the deal. Good luck in making your choice.

<Content>Staying with kids at Sunscape Grand I really enjoyed my stay at the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand this Thanksgiving. The grounds are well planned, everything is close by, food is very good at all restourants. I shall admit though that by the end of our stay i was tired of the same menu at the Windows. Staff is very nice, everyone spoke English and did their best to make our stay comfortable. Tons of sports activities, games of all kinds for kids and adults alike - you won't be bored there, no way! Dinner at the beach is something that makes you remember this place for years to come. Rooms furniture is a little dated, but clean. Kids club is awesome: special children activities in the morning and in the afternoon, movies and mini-disco at night, donkey-riding on the beach, visit to the horse farm, all this made my 8 years old daugter's vacation a blast. Even my 1 year old found things to do at the clean, very well organized kids club! One day they brought tables and chairs to the grass near the pool for the afternoon ice-cream for kids only! I found the area to be quite secure to let my 8 years old move around independently most of the time. Is not a upscale resort but very relaxing place to be!! Highly recommend. Oh, yeah, i shall also add that none of us get upset stomach.

<Content>One of a Kind!! My boyfriend and I just returned from the best vacation ever!!! at Sunscape!! I am also one of the people who read the reviews before I went and I can't even believe that anyone would rate their trip less than excellent!! It was even better than we thought - we were told by our rep that drinks and entry to the disco were not included, which they were and as well, there was 24 hour room service! not just for breakfast!!! The food was AMAZING!! I can't believe the quality of the food for what we paid! Windows was amazing! I picked the ingredients for the chef to make me my own omelet every morning...the lunch buffet was awesome as well...so was the American Grill - my boyfriend had the steak and it rocked! I had the best combo platter (definetely try it!) and Da Mario's was very good as well...constantly refilling our wine glasses and treating us like royalty!! the food there was the best!! you have to go!! Another great plus was the fact that they had all International drinks!! there was so much to choose from! everyone was friendly and our mini-bar was stocked every day, and our room was cleaned everyday...we left $5 the first day and were treated like royalty!! we met the manager and he even had a special dinner prepared for us! The beach Barbeque on thursday night was the best! tons to choose from, and you eat on the beach! We seriously couldn't have asked for anything else!! We will definetely be going back...I miss the white sand and palm trees already!! If you are thinking of visiting PLEASE do not listen to the people who did not enjoy themselves...they are obviously not people who travel to other countries much! Sunscape is the best spot to go in Punta Cana!!

<Content>We loved it!!!! This was one top notch resort. Everything about it was absolutely perfect. First of all, it is beautiful. The palms trees on the beach, the perfect white sand, the glistening pool - everything was just as it was shown in their brochures and on their website. The restaurants and the food was incredible, especially Da Mario's. After reading some of the reviews on this website, my husband and I were a little leary of the food but once we were there experiencing it for ourselves we thought the people that wrote those reviews must have been crazy (or maybe just inexperienced at trying international foods). Every meal I had was incredible! The breakfast buffet at Windows can't be beat, and the dinners at Da Mario's and the Beach Garden Restaurants were fabulous! If you go, you have to try the grouper filet and the teramisu at Da Mario's. I wish we could bring this restaurant home with us. The restaurant and bar staff treated us like royalty. We became especially attached to Julio who bartends at Umbrella's, the piano bar. Very funny guy! These people are pros and you'd think they were working for the biggest tips of their lives with the quality of service they give. And there is always some kind of activity going on. There were games on the beach and in the pool, dance lessons, aerobics, shows, parties. One great thing they did while we were there was to show the Monday Night Football game on a big movie screen on the beach! So much fun! We loved this place and if we ever return to the Dominican Republic, we would definately stay at the Sunscape again. We highly recommend it!

<Content>We're going back in May 2003 Wow!!! Sunscape was wonderful!! I traveled on 10/10/03-10/17/03 wirh two of my friends. It was the best vacation i have ever had. When we got off the plane the airport wasnt as bad as everyone had said. They took our picture, had live music that made us start doin the slasa. the bus ride to the hotel was 20 minutes the guide on the bus was informative and gave us a few tips such as NOT to drink the tap water. When we arrived at the sunscape a very handsome gentleman named Nicholas greeted us along with a few other bell boys. He was very charming...and believe it or not he did speak english. most of the staff spoke english as well as french and german. the grounds of suscape were so beautiful!!! the main lobby was also very beautiful,lots of chairs to sit and relax. while we were checkin in the staff came around with punch and cookies. from the reviews i have read i knew to wait for them to come around with the rum...it was GREAT!! it was the beginning of a nice long week of relaxation, fun in the sun with my friends and drinking the dominican rum!! Nicholas the bell boy brought our luggage to our room. Not know ing what to expect we all thought the worst just so we wouldnt be dissappointed. Well let me say the room was also beautiful. Very clean!!! A stocked fridge of beer,beer and more beer :) as well as soda and water. the maid would bring us as much as we wanted! also she left fresh flowers in our room everyday which was great because i loved having a flower in my hair. The food was excellent. ever morning we went to the buffet for breakfast and dinner was at the american grill which was the best!! loved the fahitas,nachos and potatoes skins. everyone there was so friendly and gave us alot of attention. the bartenders were wonderful!! Wendy who is a bartender by the pool was the best. he had my drink ready as soon as he saw me walking over! he would dance salsa with me everynight when i saw him at the bar. Ronaldo our bartender on the beach was great! everyone was so friendly i cant wait to go back this may 2004 to see my friends. the beach was WONDERFUL! i love the sun.the ocean was wonderful.yea there was a lil seaweed but i moved away from it and it was fine! the sand was soft and not hot at all so u could walk with ypur shoes off. the activity staff was so much fun.every day they would get you involved in games, spainish lessons, and salsa lessons on the beach! Me and my girl were shakin it!! there is a fresh fruit stand on the beach which was ownderful. we would fill a watermelon with rum and daiquiri and sip it all day.we took long walks on the beach everday and just soaked up the sun! the flea market on the side of the beach had great prices !!! go see davids store he will give you the best prices i bought so much stuff from him! we spent alot of time talking and hanging out with the dominican people. getting to know there culture AND HAVING A GREAT TIME! well the vacation was great My friend Lauren and I are goin back in may. we booked the trip a week after we came home!! oh 1 more thing. the dance club was great.we chilled there every night for a few hours doin the salsa and shakin our booty on the dance floor! we also were a lil daring and went off the resort to club mangoo which was open until 6am. the people are all friendly.food is excellent,entertainment was fun.beach was out of this world.CANT WAIT TO GO BACK IN MAY 2004!!! PUNTA CANA HERE I COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Not a bad Place for the Price Just wanted to write a short comment about the hotel to tell of our experience. Have been to the DR before staying at the Caribe Club (Bavaro Beach). This where some of the problems started as we overheard some of the hotel front desk staff tell guests the hotel was on Bavaro Beach, which is not the case. We booked and paid for a VIP Package that was to include a larger room on th ethird floor and have complimentary perks. Well when arriving upon the hotel low and behold they strictly told us that no VIP Packages exist and that our travel agent doesn't know what she was doing!!! Quite interesting. Was put on the first floor because we were told that rooms were always on a first come first serve basis. (We could see and hear the staff making up new rules for the guests as they went along. Quite Interesting!!! Our room was ok, very clean and located at the front corner right at the beach, the only downfall was staring atthe washrooms and having to smell the sewage. Now we rarely complain but as a well season Caribbean Traveller, we found this place to fly by the hip. The second night we were there a major storm blew in and low and behold all the rooms on the first floor started to flood. Was told it was not a major problem, and we figured hey were on vacation, it's not my home so if they don't care why should we!!! Right!!! Right!!! The size of the hotel is nice with everything being so close. We did manage to catch on to Yuan at the pool bar and the other gentleman at the back bar who pretended not to speak English, but low and behold when customers started to flash money in their faces, low and behold they could speak clear English!!! Absolutely amazing, a Miracle was performed. We still have ahard time with the fact that people think it's ok to tip staff while staying at an All-Inclusive. You know you are in a great resort when the Management team frowns on this and expects people to just sit back relax and not have to worry about tipping money! One poor American woman we met was running into the hundreds of dollars tippins staff and then realizing she was going broke!!! All in all, not a bad resort for the price you pay, if you are a true visitor to the DR and want to have the full Punta Cana experince you have to stay at a resort that is righ on Bavaro Beach. You will then see the beauty of of Punta Cana. Not staring at a boat docking station where you get to breath fumes 24-7. I would return to the DR in a heartbeat, but I think we will be returning back to the Caribe Princess ( Hodelpa Caribe Club). Better beach, better service, better and more modern hotel. Sorry for the so-so rating, but new guests to the DR have to be aware before you spend yor hard earned money!!

<Content>Best Bang for the Buck! My husband and I were looking for a short, but fun vacation. We chose the Sunscape because it was the best deal we found, and the reviews I read were complimentary. From the minute we arrived, the staff couldn't have been more attentive. The grounds were beautiful, and arranged nicely. Everything was easily accessable. The food was, on a scale from 1-10 a 7. You have to keep in mind that everyone has different tastes, and when you're trying to please people from several different countries, you have your job cut out for you! They really put a lot of effort into presentation, and it shows! I have nothing but great things to say, and am planning a return visit in April with my 2 children who I know will have More fun than humans are allowed!!

<Content>we stayed at sunscape! we had a good time and met a lot of people, the food was ok, do not eat the salads, because of the water is not good, the beds were so hard but ok, the people there were very nice and want so much to please you. take BENADRIL WITH you because you might get bug bites, my 2 kids got bit 2x each, and to buy something there is 3 or 4x as much . bring a hat, it is very hot. the eletric went out for about 2 hours and the back wash in the pool got us very very sick!!! i was in hospital when i got home and many others we met did to, becareful. i am ok now, but my dr here in usa said i could have died, if i did not come in, from upper resptory problems. i had no problems before we left. we did have a good time except for that. i would go back. the kids program was good and the kids had fun. the pool was like tub water and the drinks were good. the food was a little differnet but that was also good too. remember you are not in the USA any longer when you are there, so just becareful on what you eat and what you drink, and take meds with you like pepto, benadril, ect,,, and you should have a good time.

<Content>WE'LL BE BACK! We visited your resort in October and had a blast! It's hard not to when you're with a group of 27 friends. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. The bartenders were great! ( Please tell Damian that Tyson says hello.) Great variety of food and it was fun trying some new entrees. The relaxing times on the beach were wonderful, even at night after dark. The disco was fun and the entertainment at night was great. We understand that some improvements are being made to the rooms which will make the resort that much more appealing. Beautiful weather and a wonderful experience. Thanks.

<Content>The most wonderful time I just got back after going to the Dominican from October 22 to the 28th. This was a trip for me with three of my single friends. I can assure you that you will have a great time, married or not. I loved the buildings and was greeted upon entrance by staff. Our room was lovely with beautiful decor. There are mini bars in each room that are stocked free of charge. The beach was wonderful and the staff dispose of the seaweed each morning. Some people complain of the seaweed. Honestly, it's an ocean and it is still clearer than anything you will see in the states. There were many activities that were held it was just up to you if you wanted to be involved. The staff was very focued on making sure you had fun. They pulled you into Merenge or Salsa lessons, water aerobics, stretching or even beer drinking contests!! You could make this vacation very social or relax and hang out on the beach. The discotheque was great and so was the piano bar. The noise that people complain about was easily muffled with the drapes and I was so tierd that I did not lose any sleep over it. The bartenders were friendly and always ready. The food was great and so much variety!! I went scuba diving everyday with Scuba Caribe and had a blast. They have a location on the beach and someone staffed in the pool at all times. Very nice. I used the gym there and they have some equiptment: a treadmill, three bikes and a stair master. They had steps, weights and some weight machines. I met some neat people in there and worked out two days. My friends did the spa thing and had a great time. It did rain the first few days and our room flooded. We were right there in the room with the maids bailing out the water. She was there as we all took care of this. We were all laughing and having a good time. The staff were very nice and helpful. They wanted to make sure we had a good time. We saw the shows there and they were great and very entertaining. I must say that I have two children and next time I would bring them. There are activities galore for them. I saw at least four jungle gyms, donkeys, junior olympics and the staff taking kids to dinner in Windows so the parents could have a romantic dinner in the Italian Restaurant. When I left they even printed off the weather for me in Kansas City and ran it out to my van for me. I cannot praise the staff there enough!!Thanks for the wonderful time!

<Content>Had a Blast! My boyfriend and I just got back from Punta Cana and loved it! The staff were great, the beach lovely (a little seaweed once in a while, but we were still able to snorkle right in front of the hotel), the food was abundant and we were always able to find something good to eat, and the liquor was top shelf. The vendors on the beach were pushy, we bought most merchandise from Safari rum hut. Apple Rep, Linda was helpful and really nice. We had champagne and caviar twice! Lots of photos, no sunburn, and all in all a great and relaxing vacation. Please email with any questions.

<Content>We will be back in 6 months!!! My friends and I traveled to Sunscape in October. From the moment we stepped foot on the beach, we loved it. The staff was wonderful, especially all the waitors, and the room service, the bartenders, Wendy was so pleasant and friendly. The foot was delicous, especially the mexican, that was our favorite. The fahita's were scrumpious. The shops on the beach were a lot of fun, and the best shops to go to are David's, and Charles, they definately give you a good deal for your money. We had went to a club one night out of the resort, and we had a blast, the club was called mangoo. Something like that, it opens at 12 midnight until 6 am, tons of fun there, shaking that booty. Ronaldo was great on the beach, taking care of us, getting us whatever we needed. Sunscape is definately the place to be and we will be back in may.

<Content>sunscape grand resort We stayed at sunscape a few weeks ago, just wanted to let you know most people in our group got the runs I had to go to the doctors when I got home they gave me Cipro for 3 days and it helped. Also its very humid there and lots of seaweed, the pools are only 3 ft. deep so its hard to swim, we did enjoy the massages we had and everyone loved Holio in the umbrella bar.

<Content>Offical Vacation Spot I have been many places. But the Punta Cana Grand ( Sunscape) has been by far the best vacation I have ever had. I am only 21 and have made up my mind I am coming back every year. The workers are fantastic the shows are fantastic. This is truly a wonderful place I would recomend this resort to anybody.

<Content>Good value but...... In January 2003 my husband and I booked the Sunscape for a 7 night stay. It seemed like a bargain and it looked gorgeous in the Apple Vacation book. When we arrived in the lobby the manager approached us and offered us an upgrade to a different resort called Secrets. We were leary about this because it seemed too good to be true. She said she would give us the night to think about it as she couldnt move us until the next day. So we checked into our room and made our decision. The room smelled musty and was very dark even with all the lights on. This resort has some wear and tear on it. We enjoyed a wonderful show that evening put on by a group who travels to different resorts. It was a las vegas type show and it was great! Such talent by the dancers. My husband who usually doesnt like that sort of thing was impressed. The food was good. We enjoyed the next day by the pool and had snacks and drinks before we left for the other resort. Although I didnt stay there for the whole week I think from just what I saw while I was there I would have been unhappy. The resort was very small and not enough to do there and it was a little worn. I think a younger crowd looking for value might enjoy this resort. After moving to the other resort we were on an excursion (swimming with sharks and stingrays) and we were telling people about being moved from the Sunscape to Secrets and how much happier we were. There were people there from the from Sunscape and they also were offered to move and didnt and they were saying how disappointed they were that they didnt move and how bored they were. I vacation every year in the carribean and stay at all-inclusives either 5 or 6 Apples and I dont feel the Sunscape should have been rated a 5 Apple -- it was definitely more like a 4 Apple. It was a bargain but no-frills.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Had a wonderful time at the Sunscape on my honeymoon! Lost my wedding band on the baech while playing volleyball. Staff and guests helped look for it for 2 hours to no avail. Said they would have staff out at 7 next morning. Sure enough I was there with them at 7 and they found my band! Food was excellent, room very clean. Only gripe alot of seaweed in ocean. Overall vacation a 9.5! Would stay here again!

<Content>Not American-ized and Immodium-ized A group of 14 Adults traveled to Punta Cana's Sunscape Grand on 9-8-03 to 9-12-03 for 5 days and 4 nites. I have never been to an All inclusive resort, but HAVE traveled to the caribbean 4 times. I enjoyed being able to swim up to the pool bar and Juan Cruz, the bartender at the splash bar was an EXCELLENT bartender. Drinks were great and had a high percentage of alcohol content. The Presidente beer got warm very quick so drink it fast!! The entertainment was okay---fun at first but I do agree with a previous writer.....Put your hands up in the air phrase got REAL old from Antonio the activities director. I think this is the only line that he knew!! Pool games were fun---but don't let your drunk husband partake in the game of the  mens tri-athalon pool game...saw a guy tumble on the bicycle into the pool and could have gotten hurt. And YES.....take immodium AD with you along with some nexium, zantac or pepcid....I think that at least 50% of our crew got GI upsets and spent most of the day on the toilet and in bed...take your own toilet paper too! :) As I sit here typing, I still have a gnawing feeling in my stomach....The english speaking workers are few and far between...don't even try to ask the maids, grounds keepers or the maintence men a word in english....they don't speak it!! I advise you to learn a little bit of spanish prior to going...it surely helps...All of the employees were very friendly, but could not understand you. Our room was clean, nothing got stolen, but did hear of others getting items stolen and of cock roaches on the sink counter....Use your room safe. We left the maid $3.00 everday and ALWAYS had an abundance of towels and a clean room.. Beware of the obnoxious beach vendors....have a couple of drinks proir to venturing down to negiotiate with them...they ARE hysterical to deal with...got to vendor #5...he has deals better than WalMart....only offer them 25% of what they first tell you....and if you don't get them down to that price....go to the next store---they are all listening to each other and the next guy will give you a better deal!! Mama-jana is their version of our Viagra.....they will try to get you to drink it, but the bottles are not sealed and neither is the vanilla...so I didn't buy any of them.. Heard the safari trip (recommended highly by Apple Vacation) was great----lots of items to buy CHEAP---cartons of Marlboros were only $8.00 and vanilla was $2.00 and they saw sugar cane and coffee plantations. Make sure you go to the Apple Vacation talks prior to signing up for any excursions.....Was made aware of the 4X4's and cycle and horse excursions to be dangerous....but ole Pedro the horse Man at the beach towel shack will try to talk you into it!! BEWARE---if you are young, blonde and single....stay away from the entertainment/activity crew...they are on the prowl at all times......The food was good...not sure what made us sick---could not pin point it to any particular item...the Italian resturant was nice and had a great atmoshere...Windows ( Buffet ) was nice also...always something to find to eat.....and the Amercian grill/Tex Mex food was GREAT!!!! The bacon cheesburgers at lunch were out of this world....The beach was okay---warm and blue---but nothing like others that I have been to.....SEAWEED---SEAWEED---SEAWEED!! They did pitchfork it up occasionally...but it was still a nuisance!! Heard on the plane ride back that another couple at another resort had no seaweed !! That was disappointing!! Overall...would I go back to the same place???? Answer---NO!! Back to Punta Cana---Yes!! Was overall inexpensive and for a first time all inclusive...I got my money's worth!!

<Content>Mixed Review We vacationed at Sunscape 8/20-25 with our 3 children (13,11,5). Overall, I have to go with a just average rating, but my review is really quite mixed:The Bad News: We were expecting beautiful clear Caribbean water and were surprised at the dull, seaweed-filled beachfront at the Sunscape---not at all as pictured in the brochure I had sent for!!!!Don't get me wrong---the water was quite swimable, and the beach/lounge area was fine and kept quite clean, but for us, we were expecting the Caribbean and what we got was a nice Atlantic Ocean area. (We DID venture out to a recommended area about 20 minutes from the resort one day, and got to see the pretty turquoise water we were missing).Other negatives: Our kids were very excited to try Sunscapes water-trampoline--but it was broken. The wonderful Beach Party Dinner many people have written about was canceled twice while we were there, supposedly due to weather (but both nights there was no weather issue). The nightly entertainment was amateurish at best. The Teen Center was nothing more than some worn-out ping-pong tables and a croquet set (in need of repair). Our room was adequate and clean, but pretty basic and in need of some repair. Hot water was available sporatically. We were kept awake one night by a wild, extremely loud party taking place at the adjacent bar (rumor was that it was the Sunscape Staff party). We were located in the quieter building 5 near the adult pool, but noted that had we been in just about any of the other buildings, we think noise would be a big factor. The resort is small, and although this makes everything convenient, it is, at times, confining and limited.The Good News: The staff at the Sunscape is outstanding. They do the most with what they have. Service was excellent. Food was quite good. The nightly 7:30 movies were a nice feature for the kids. The main pool area is nice---kept very clean, but it's showing its age. Because the resort is small, everything is just steps away: rooms, beach, pool, restaurants.OVERALL: This resort is only for you if your top priorities are value, convenience, good food, and great service. If you're looking for a more luxurious vacation, gorgeous Caribbean waters, and lots of variety--you'll need to make another choice.

<Content>overall great vacation The resort was perfect. I couldnt have asked for more. The staff were all plesant and wearing smiles. Of coarse the drinks were always made with little alcohol so always ask for double liquor. The food was only okay. There was a lot to choose from but it was very oily. Stick to the simple stuff. The beach had been kept up but always had a lot of seaweed on it. The water was nice but not as clear blue as the water in past vacations. Both our day trips were spectacular. We took the snorkling trip with the sharks and the jungle adventure. Great scenery. I would recomend taking the trips to everyone. Our tour guides were funny and informing. Great all around vacation. Punta Cana is one of the most beautiful places.

<Content>Recommended To make my review short and sweet , Sunscape is great for budget conscious travellers looking for a beautiful beach and relaxation. Food was good , always able to find something to eat. Night shows were terrible, i didn't mind  put your hands up in the air the first night, but everynight gets a little monotonous. Rooms were clean, but cleaning staff was inconsistant on cleaning times, never knew when they were going to show up. Overall it's a place I would recommend...but no raving!

<Content>Great time at the Sunscape We returned from our 7 night trip to the Sunscape in Punta Cana in July of 2003. We really enjoyed both the Dominican Republic and the resort. Food was a little above average, the beach was nice and the service was excellent. Rooms are a little older but still nice and shows at night were fun. We took our two children who also really enjoyed the trip, especially the movies shown at night on the cinema size screen outdoors. Not much to do in the way of shopping but lots of excursions and a great place to just chill out and enjoy the beauty.We've been all over the Caribbean and this was one of our best trips.

<Content>True Paradise. We visited Sunscape in August tis year(2003) and we recieved the perfect holiday. We have two young daughters and the staff at the hotel treated them like queens. We have never visited a more friendly relaxed place before. Everyone from the manager to the cleaners made you feel welcome and not one day passed when they were not all smiling. We feel that even though we only stayed there for two weeks that we have made life time friends with some of the staff there. No matter how busy the staff seemed to be they always stopped and made time for the girls. We feel that the holiday brochure did not give this hotel justice in their write up of it as the hotel will far out do any expectations that you have off it. We will most definatly be going back. When we left the hotel the girls, ourselves and even the staff were crying. How more friendly can be? It was the most relaxed , friendly holiday we could ever expect to have. True paradise. Thank you Sunscape.

<Content>We had a great time dispite the resort We returned from the Sunscape Aug 20, 2003. The resort was average. If you have ever been to any other all inclusive please stay away. My husband and I went to Mexico last year and that all inclusive was a world of difference. Do not get me wrong we had a great time. Dispite very average food most nights. We both did get sick although lots of medicine helped so that it did not mess up the vacation. We truely enjoyed Wendy the bartender and Freddy our waiter/water boy. They were so wonderful. We spent many morning without anything to drink at breakfast. We just wanted water. Our room was a rain forest when it rained. I talked to several others with the problem. The Out Back Safarie was wonderful. The beach was fine it did have a lot of seaweed. Overall we had a great vacation.

<Content>Delicious My husband and I just got back on Sunday 8/10 from your Hotel. What can I say it was fabulous from someone who has been there 7 times and stayed twice at the Sunscape. I cannot tell what a great job the entire staff including the Management is doing. We were really impressed with everyone in the hotel who serviced us with a smile despite the heat and the multiple jobs they had to do. We wanted to let Sunscape know that during the time we spent at the adult pool with service by Luis, we met other people who had been to other resorts in Punta Cana and loved the Sunscape the best. Keep up the good work.

<Content>beware! i went to the 5 apple sunscape in june. last year i stayed at the catalonia bavaro hotel also 5 apples. what a difference.sunscape had plywood for a box spring! i was told apple is managing the resort for the new owners, so i guess thats why they are pushing the place.. we both experienced food poisoning the 3rd day there. i agree with the other writer concerning the late check out hospitaity room. i booked it for 4 pm at 5pm still nothing. also the resort is not even on the true carribbean , hence the water is not really clear. take it off your list unless you like vacationing in the bathroom!!

<Content>great trip We just returned from a very nice trip to Punta Cana where we stayed at the Sunscape resort. The beach was beautiful as well as the grounds of the resort. There was plenty to do the entire time. I highly recommend the snorkeling excursion with the sharks and sting rays- very exciting!!!! The service was excellent everywhere, everyone was extremely nice and helpful. The food was okay and I say that only because we are vegetarians and there aren't a lot of options at the restaurants. We pretty much had to stick to the same buffet restaurant WINDOWS our entire stay. The same food over and over definitely took its toll on our stomachs. We both have had Diarreah and stomach cramps for 3 days. Other than that our trip was truly wonderful and we will return some day.

<Content>Loved Sunscape We stayed at Sunscape Punta Cana in March 2003 and cannot say enough about how wonderful it was. The staff was absolutely wonderful, the food was excellent, and the rooms and the decor were outstanding. We especially appreciated that the staff could speak fluent english and had a great sense of humor and oustanding customer service skills. The flowers around the hotel were beautiful! Every evening we enjoyed the wonderful shows that were put on for both children and adults. The weather was excellent, and the hotel was immaculate. We are going again next year and staying again in the same hotel, hopefully with the same staff we had this year.

<Content>Had a wonderful time! My husband and I just returned from the Sunscape Grand in Punta Cana and what an experience! We had a wonderful time! We had never been to an all-inclusive resort or the Dominican Republic so we were a little skeptical and truly could not get our brains around the fact that everything was included!We arrived in the morning and were met with an enthusiastic staff who immediately took us to our room. I had previously e-mailed to request a room in one of the quieter buildings and our request was honored. We stayed in Building 5 and our room was beautiful and clean. The maid staff came by several times a day - one person to mop and clean, another for towels and refreshing the in room refridgerator with bottled water and soda. We were warned to bring stomach medicines as we could become ill, we did do that but fortunately we did not need it. Our most favorite part of the trip was the staff - they were truly wonderful and as they say when you check in welcome home - we felt at home. An all around great time - the food was great, service and amenities were even better! Loved the fresh fruit stand on the beach - we are taking our three children back in the spring!

<Content>Good and bad My wife and I recently returned from a week trip 7/11-7/18. We have been to other all-inclusive resorts so have something to base our opinions on.The Good: The resort itself was beautiful and very well maintained. They had many activities going on that were good to break up the day (which typically last about 1/2-1 hour each). The staff is very friendly and make all the daily events entertaining.The Bad: The food is average at best. The biggest problem was almost everyone we talked to got sick (about 80% of them). Not sick enough to ruin the vacation, but definately an inconvenience. The ocean is average at best, definately not as blue as expected, and the seaweed is an issue (even though Suscape cleans it up better than the other resorts). The entertainment was the worst we have seen at any resort. It was typically the everyday employees putting on a show. I guess it was entertaining, but they definately do not spend money for quality shows. Overall, an excellent trip for the money, however next time I would spend more to go where I will not get sick. If not for the sickness from so many people, I would rate this resort a 4 out of 5. If you are going, have fun and remember the Imodium A-D. You will be glad you have it!

<Content>Beware Salmonella! Went to Sunscape with the family over Easter Break 2003. The kids (ages 9  11) were looking forward to the kids club. For 3 nights in a row we could not locate the kids club on the property even with help from the manager and a walkie talkie, so we gave up. My daughter developed food poisoning at the end of the vacation so we took her to the doctor at home where she was diagnosed with Salmonella, verified by duplicate lab tests and reported to the health department. We called the hotel to report it to the manager, but we were never able to speak directly to him, SURPRISE. I wasn't going to bother to write a review until I read the recent reviews about the recurring illness issues, so I think they seriously have a hygiene/food prep problem. If you have kids and want to go to Punta Cana, go to Club Med. We've been there twice and never gotten sick and the kids club is always where they say it will be when they say it will be.

<Content>I We just got back from DR on 07.06.2003. Overall, it was so great that we were upset to come back.The ocean was clean and warm, a little bit of seeweed but not so much as other people described.The constant breezes made us feel very comfortable.The facilities are clean, people are very friendly and nice, very helpful. Food was pretty good in all restaurants, you have always something to choose from.We also tried different activities such as snorkeling,swimming with sharks and rays and it was awesome. One night we went to Carribean show and it was pretty cool.I t was located in the cave and it's somehing unbeleivable(cave itself). The Beach party on 4Th of July was incredible.We loved Sunscape and we may come back and it just because there are so many other places we want try as well. We highly recommend this place and you may ignore some nasty complaints from other people(some of them always unhappy no matter what or have very high expectations that can't be met).

<Content>Not empressed We spent a week in Punta Cana from June 13 - 20, 2003. I have traveled to various other islands and found this to be the most disappointing. My main disappointment was the ocean. It was very dirty the first few days. By Wednesday it did clear up some, but was full of seaweed. The blue water that was displayed in the brochures was definately not where we were located. The Sunscape was a 5 apple hotel and we have stayed at 6 apple hotels in the past. There is a definate difference. The food was okay, but after the same choices every day for breakfast that got very old. The best restaurant was the American Grill. My husband loved the beef medallions. We did not do any of the activities due to the fact that I was sick the whole time. I did not drink the water; therefore, I'm not sure if it was from the vegetables being rinsed or what. One other thing. Our flight was not until 8:35 pm so we asked for a late check out. They said that would be fine, but the day we were to check out the told us we had to be out by noon!! We had no choice. We offered to pay, but they said no. We had to use the hospitality suite which we booked for 5:00 and didn't get in until 5:30. The suite was very dirty, no towels or washclothes. There were some people that loved this place, but I don't think I would go back. I will stick with the Aventura Palace in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.

<Content>Can't Wait To Go Back I just returned from the Sunscape last week, and I am already in the process of planning another trip back. The resort itself is the perfect size. Not too big, and not too small. The beach is much larger than I was expecting. The sand was very soft and silky, and the water was perfect. There is a variety of restaurants, but keep in mind they are very strict with the dress codes. The food itself was very good for an all-inclusive resort. The only complaint on the food was the self serve snack bar. It only had pizza and hotdogs (that were only ok) The staff was extremely nice, and everyone goes out of there way to make you feel at home. There is a huge variety of activities day and night at the resort. If you get a chance to go, I strongly recomend swimming with the sharks and stingrays (it's an additional charge, but well worth it). The rooms were lovely, and very clean. I can't imagaine staying anywhere else.

<Content>Paradise We just returned from our honeymoon, we stayed at the Sunscapes Resort in Punta Cana. The resort was beautiful, very well maintained, staff was friendly, and helpful. The food in all of the resturants was good, you were able to get anything that you could of possibly wanted. We did not experience any problems with the water, but some of the visitors became ill from the sun. Make sure that you pack some strong suntan lotion, as the sun is VERY intense. This was our first experince with an all inclusive, and we were very impressed with all that they had to offer.

<Content>Not as we expected My boyfriend and I just returned from the Sunscape. We just wanted to caution everyone on our experience. We received food poisoning and I was hospitalized for 2days upon returning to the States. The food was terrible!!! But the resort was beautiful, staff nice, beach was nice, but very full of seaweed. We personally would not return to the Sunscape, but enjoy if you decide to go, just remember to bring LOTS of Pepto!!

<Content>The Resort was Great! I just got back from my abridged HONEYMOON to Sunscape (May 19-23). The resort was exactly as describe-BEAUTIFUL!!. The grounds were amazing the people were some of the friendliest I have encountered in my many trips to the Carribean. The rooms were nice although not great. They are large and at least in my room the AC worked great. The food was pretty typical of tropical destinations. You are not going to starve but you are not going to come home raving either. They do have an Italian specialty restaraunt that is fabulous, an absolute must if you go. The pool was nice, although a bit small for the capacity of the hotel but you alway have the beach which was very nice. Yes there is some seasweed but it isn't bad and if you are from the NE part of the US you won't believe the water color of the Atlantic. I did have one unfortunate story with housekeeping but all in all I would visit the Sunsacpe again. BTW this is deffinately a family destination which really doesn't come across in most of the reviews that I have read. It is not a singles or romantic destination, but don't let that stop you from going.

<Content>Escape from the Sunscape! We had three major problems and a few minor issues that you should know. Upon arrival, the front desk refused to acknowledge that we we had paid for (and were entitled) to a deluxe OCEAN FRONT room. They tried to stick us in room, overlooking the pool, just above a blaring music speaker. After a negotiation with the manager and front desk staff, they agreed to allow us an ocean front room for another additional fee. We started to settle into a lovely ocean front room with a wraparound balcony. Later the front desk man did apologize for their mistake and cancelled the extra charge. Of course, the story gets better(or worse). The previous guests did not return the vault key to the front desk. Of course this meant we were unable to use the vault. After explaining it three times to people who spoke english very well, the front desk staff still did not get it. It was not a language issue. I speak spanish. Finally, I personally assisted the maintenance man the next day as we cracked the safe open. That's number two! Eventually the assistant manager did call and apologize for the screwup. The third and final major complaint was from our day of departure. We planned at leaving the hotel at one in the afternoon. Checkout is at noon, but upon request, you may get a late checkout. We went to the beach in the morning. I went upstairs to the room at 10 to call and confirm our flight home. The phone was dead! The front desk apparently turns the phone off on day of departure. I went back to beach and asked my wife to handle it with the front desk because I reached my limit of verbal and physical restraint. When she went to the front desk, their immediate response at 10:15 am was what are you still doing here?; we need that room AND your keys will no longer work because we have invalidated them! Mind you, check out is normally noon. Can you imagine being purposely locked out of your own room before checking out ? I mean that's got to be some violation of the Geneva Convention. Anyhow, enough of our preriors and exteriors were of nice decor and the food was fine. The beach was adequate. No immediate snorkeling offshore and also be prepared for a lot of motor boat traffic fumes, oil etc. The marine boat gas pump is at the end of the property. Bartender Luis at the adult pool bar is fantastic. In summary, we travel extensively in the islands. I lived there. We had never encountered such an unresponsive or difficult front desk. Vacations shouldn't be that much work. When that taxi pulled up to the lobby for our departure, I felt like we were making a prison break!

<Content>4 Days of Paradise!! :) All I can say is WOW. We had an excellent time. We travelled to Sunscape from May 16-19, for my boyfriend's birthday. Travel to the hotel: Just a tip...If you are used to great customer service and a decent meal on your flight, do NOT travel with CHAMPION Airlines. Their service was below average to say the least. When we arrived at the airport, the whole process was very speedy. Our luggage was coming out as soon as we went to baggage claims. There are many workers around to carry your luggage to your hotel transportation. Once you find your hotel transportation, they check your name of on the list, and you are off to start your vacation!!! Check-In: I have to say that check in was very smooth. As soon as you arrive, you are greeted by very friendly and helpful hotel staff. Even though their English is not great, it does the trick and they can still manage to make you laugh. We arrived at 11:30am and check-in is not until 3. Fortunately, our room was ready as soon as we arrived...How can I complain about that????Rooms: The rooms are standard, but very nicely furnished. We stayed in building 4 on the 3rd floor. It was very nice and you have high ceilings on the 3rd floor. The room was accented with fresh flowers. We wanted a closer ocean view, so we asked to be switched and had to wait until the next day. The maids are very friendly and give you whatever you ask for. A little tip goes a long way...For the next 2 nights, the maid bought us chocolates!! :) The bed was comfy, considering I like a firm mattress, but the sheets smelled a little funny. Staff: The staff was very friendly. They would assist you in any way they could. The waiters were excellent. Never once was my glass half empty without someone refilling it or asking me if I wanted another drink. I have to say Luis...WE LOVE YOU!!! There was one waiter however....it was the waiter that comes and brings you drinks on the beach. I asked for a drink, and I did not tip him. He didn't do anything special.. After that, he did not come back to mants: The food a 3 of the 4 restaurants was above average. The Italian restaurant and the American Grill were excellent. The beach restaurant was good, and the buffet (the windows) was okay.Entertainment: The entertainment was great. The live shows every night were awesome. And the show on Friday night was EXCELLENT!! After the show, the disco opens up. The dancers from the show teach you how to dance merengue. It was a lot of fun. The Spa: I think the spa was one of the highlights of our trip. The people in the spa were amazing. They really cater to you. My boyfriend and I both got the hydrotherapy massages and truly enjoyed them. We went back to the spa on our last day and got our 15 minute massage. We enjoyed both thoroughly.Overall, our trip was amazing, and I can not wait to go back again!!!

<Content>Excellent Trip! My husband and I just returned from Sunscape , 5/9-5/16. I must say, we had a beautiful time. We did the 5 square deal with Apple and it worked out wonderfully. THere was a little confusion to what hotel we were at but no problem.When I read the complaints, I have to wonder if about the people writing them. I understand that mistakes happen all the time and everywhere but get over it, people that fixate on the negatives are probably impossible to please.The food was typical carribean food and we KNOW that the food is different. We KNOW we are in another country so the language can be an issue. Hellooo, we are in THEIR country, you should be the one speaking spanish if you have the problem. Either way, we never ever had a problem communicating and if we did, they would get someone else to translate to us.We loved everything. . The service was outstanding, the people were so helpful and we tipped here and there, not much and it wasn't expected either. The beach was beautiful and very well maintained. Seaweed started to appear by early afternoon but is cleaned up every morning and will always be an issue. We walked the beach past other resorts and Sunscape's beach was best kept.Punta Cana is so beautiful, miles upon miles of secluded beaches. We have vacationed all over to many all-incluse clubs (Jamaica 3x, Mexico, St. Lucia, Hawaii...) so I feel experienced enough to know what makes a great vacation and Sunscape did a wonderful job making our week one of the best!

<Content>Very relaxing My friend and I visited Sunscape May 9-12, 2003. We went for a short weekend - we treated ourselves for Mother's Day. The hotel is approx 20 min from the airport which is great considering we went for such a short time. Check in went smooth and we were sent to our room in Bldg 4, third floor - great ocean views. The rooms are very basic but kept very clean. A small tip and you will be brought as much water as you request. The weather was amazing the entire weekend. We spent most of our time on the beach, which had some seaweed but nothing out of control. They clean the beach every morning. The pools were VERY warmand we found that very unappealing. I know it must be hard to keep the pools cool but they should make an attempt. Considering it is only May what will they be like in July. This could be a potential health hazard. They should try to fix that problem. The staff was amazing and spoke very good english. The maids had more difficulty with English but we managed to communicate. The food was OK. We loved the italian restaurant, Windows is a typical buffet restaurant. The chicken/mushroom pizza at the American Grill was very good but we weren't thrilled with the burgers. We didn't make it to the Tex Mex but heard many great comments about it. All in all I would definitly return to this hotel. I am considering bringing my family in July. Remember you are in Punta Cana and they move very slowly - but you are on vacation - what is the rush !!!

<Content>Not what it was cracked up to be!! To make a long story short? Spend your hard earned money elsewhere! When we arrived in Punta Cana ( 3hours late, thanks Apple Vacations) I must say that customs was not a nightmare compared to others. 3 planes landed at the same time, but as we went though customs, he barely looked at our documentation, which did speed up the process. Once we arrived at Sunscape, the people at the front desk barely spoke English. You would ask them a question, and the would just say ok, and go on with what they were doing before. We were traveling with our kids, and another family. When we got into our room, we had 1 kingsize bed. After calling numerous times, they told us to come back down to the front desk. After going all the way back down to the front desk with our things, they told us there was nothing they could do that night but give us a small cot. They said they could not change our room until 2pm the next day. (A bit of info. If you need something done, go to higher management!!! Hopefully they will give you what you need. )Their entertainment was so-so, but they cancelled our Bar-B-Q with no notification. There were several people walking out to the beach looking for it, but we finally found out it was cancelled. I was disappointed given the fact that the person running the hotel was from the U.S. and he is knowledgable on customer Service. The staff will only work for tips. (with the exceptions of the guys at the pool, and pool bar)If you have already booked, get a perscription for Cipro before leaving. There were a lot of people sick for several days!! Keep that in mind!!! We will not travel there again. A wast of money

I stayed at Sunscape April 9-16 2003 with my mom ,dad and brother.Upon arrival at Sunscape you enter into a lobby area where you check in.The lobby is open air.Very nice!When waiting in line to check in everyone was served fruit punch with or without rum.Also I was served chocolate chip cookies.The people really know how to treat someone right.Check in was smooth and it was off to the room.Room-I had a third floor room with cathedral ceilings.The rooms are nice but nothing special.In the room is a mini refrigerator that was stocked with beer , soda, and water everyday!That was nice.The maids kept the room clean everyday.Hotel-The hotel grounds are very well kept.Very lush and tropical plants.The hotel is very nice.Beach-The beach was very nice as well but most of my time was spent by the pool.The beach did have some seaweed but it didnt bother me at all.I took walks only to see other beaches overcrowded.Sunscapes beach was not crowded at all.At night it was nice to go on the beach and lay on a chair and relax.Pool-The pool was where I spent most of my time.The pool was like bath water and I enjoyed it.There is a swim up bar which is nice to get drinks.I was told there it is safe to brush your teeth with the tap water but do not!I brushed my teeth in the water once.Im pretty sure that explains why I got diarrhea.There is bottle water that the maids put by the sink so you can brush your teeth.Entertainment-At night there is a movie playing on a very large screen.One night the movie was playing on the beach.Following the movie is a nightly show.Some of the shows were funny but some were corny.Activities-There is some water activities you can do.There is water aerobics and games like water polo in the pool and activites on the beach like volleyball.For the kids is the Explorers Kids Club where the kids do fun activities.Food-I thought the food was great.They had a lot of variety.One evening there was dinner on the beach that took the people who set up tables and everything quite awhile.It started toet up and people went back to their tables.There are 4 restaurants on the property.All in all I had a very fun and good time.The staff is nice and friendly. I would definitely go back again. Thanks Sunscape for a great time!!!!!!

<Content>Great resort with a seagrass beach We stayed at Sunscape March 29 - April 5. After reading many reviews about the pristine beach, we were extremely disappointed to find an almost unswimmable beach area with floating sea grass. Perhaps it was because of the wind or tide, but each morning workers had to rake and shovel piles of seagrass so that they could wheelbarrow it over to bigger piles for the beach dumptrucks to come pick it up. The palm tree beach area with white soft sand is beautiful, but we love to swim in the clear ocean and snorkel, however, the snorkelling was very poor. The sailing was a lot of fun and the boats were always available. We had to walk about 1km down the beach to find a nice swimming area. We did enjoy the beach aerobics, the coco party on the beach, the helpful and kind employees and the wonderful swimming pool. The food, service, variety of restaurants, entertainment/shows, cleanliness of the resort, availability of beach/pool chairs and overall lay-out are all very acceptable. We have been to many resorts and would recommend this resort only to those who don't wish to swim in the ocean.

<Content>Fun as Sunscape My husband, myself and 5yr old daughter visited Sunscape April 6 - 13. We had a great time. The resort is lovely and taken care of like no other resort we have ever stayed at before(including Sandals). RoomsRooms are clean and spacious. It is not luxury but you don't spend much time there. Leave a dollar or two on your pillow for the maids. We forgot once and the room was not as well made up. We had a terrace and it was spotless, a great place to relax before dinner. There is a mini bar with beer and soft drinks and bottled water. There is even bottled water on the bathroom sink so no chance of running out. StaffMost of the staff were very pleasant and eager to please. Service was usually quick and with a smile. We had heard raves about the manager, Rod. Sorry to say we saw him a few times and he never said hello, maybe just a smile. The resident manager was terrific. Activities staff work from early in the morning until late at night. A special thank you to Paulina - coordinator for the kids club. She is very sweet and loves kids. If you have teen daughters be wary of some of the guys in the activities group - no names.FoodFood is okay, not great. Highly recommend the steak at the Texmex restaurant, the shrimp pasta and lasagna at the Italian restaurant and the continental breakfast and chicken at the Beach Cafe. Also, the buffet breakfast is pretty good with awesome smoothies.ActivitiesThe nightly shows are fun and the movies for the kids are great. If you like you can get away for an hour or so for a nice dinner and the kids watch a Disney movie. Pool activities are varied and fun. Overall a great place except the food wasn't great. The beach had a lot of seaweed but you could always walk up the beach and find a clear spot. I would definitely return. It's a beautiful, well kept resort with friendly staff and small enough that you don't feel lost in the crowd.

<Content>Fun and Sun This was our first all-inclusive trip and don't think we could have asked for anything more. While the weather didn't agree with us the first two days, it was still one of our most relaxing, fun vacations.Rooms-We had a third floor room in building 2 which offered a nice ocean view and was away from the noise of the nightly shows. Double queen size beds or a single king are available (ours was double queen). Very nice and comparable to a nice US hotel. Cable TV, minibar, hair dryer all there.Food-Far exceeded my expectations. DiMarco's, the Northern Italian restuarant, is formal but the food is very good. Windows has everything for breakfast and lunch. The American grill has ala carte breakfast and burgers/sandwiches for lunch, and TexMex has great steaks and seafood. There was no problem in finding something to everyone's liking in any of these restuarants (we were a group of 20). There are also hot dogs and pizza available at the backstage bar in the afternoon and burgers and hot dogs on the beach side of the Garden Bar.Drink-Presidente is the beer of choice although Heinekin is available at the Backstage bar. There is a drink menu at every bar but the will make whatever you want and do have upper shelf brands if you ask by name (Tanquary gin, Johnny Walker Black, etc.). If you are a drinker, I would advise bringing a 20 oz., insulated cup with you, it saves on refilling drinks back and forth to the beach.Entertainment-The main stage entertainment was mostly good. Xiomara is the featured singer/dancer and she is very, very talented. The nights usually begin with a movie and show aimed at the kids followed by a more adult show. One or two of the shows are a bit corny but lots of fun.Beach-GorgeousPeople-Gloria at the backstage bar (tell her Papa sent you) and Julio at the Piano bar. Julio lights up the bar every night with 151 rum and is not to be missed. Xiomara shows up some nights and gets the crowd dancing. Tucki shows up all around the complex and gets everyone laughing. Al works at windows in the morning. She looks away while she pours coffee and rarely has her mind on her work.Other-Hobie Cats, windsurfers, snorkel equipment is all available free of charge but there are insurance charges which are pretty small ($3 a day for a hobie cat).Summary-A great, inexpensive vacation package. We didn't bring any kids but they cater to them very nicely from what we could see.

<Content>wonderful vacation We stayed at the Sunscape Punta Cana the week of March 22-29. I don't know what happened at the hotel the week after we left, since there are so many negative comments, but we had the most wonderful time from the moment we woke up until the moment we went to sleep. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations (we had traveled with them before to Mexico, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic). Everything went smoothly and we arrived at the hotel in the evening. Our room was ready as soon as we got there (I had requested a lower floor and got a room on the first floor). Everything was very clean throughout our stay. The food was excellent and the service was first-rate. Special thanks to Fernando, Papi, and Tono. All of our wishes were fulfilled before we even spoke them. Service with a smile has a special meaning here. We are going back in the summer for another wonderful week!

<Content>Do NOT stay here if you want quality This was promoted as a 5-star resort. It is at best a 2-3 star resort by american standards. The food is palatable at best and very inconsistent. The facilities are old and poorly maintained. The beds are uncomfortable and the pillows smell. The water makes you sick. The shows are amatuerish. The drinks are watered down. The disco caters ONLY to the locals. About the only good thing I can say is that the stafff was freindly and helpful. Otherwise, this was my worst vacation ever and I will never return to Punta Cana or the Dominican Republic for that matter. There are too many excellent islands out there that deserve your hard earned money.

<Content>Sunscape Leaves a Little To Be Desired My first trip to the Dominican Republic with three friends was In June of 2002. We booked through Apple Vacations (which was a total nightmare) and ended up losing one whole day of our vacation because the Apple Vacations charter plane had problems and we had to wait FIFTEEN hours in the Philadelphia airport before we got there. Needless to say, we were expecting something amazing in Punta Cana. The Sunscape wasn't amazing, however. I would rate it as being dubbed a moderate resort by the skin of its teeth. The beach was absolutely terrible. The water is murky with a lot of seaweed and very coarse sand. It was almost as if we were swimming in a bay area because there is a huge marina RIGHT IN FRONT of the beach which blocks the view of the ocean. Enourmous boats are right in front of you on the beach at all times. It was like the Jaws ride at Universal Studios or something. Now here comes the scary part, get ready. We all got explosive diarreah about 3 days into the trip and so did every other single person we spoke to at the resort. We did not drink the water, but I'm sure they wash their foods in unpurified water. How else would we have gotten so sick? The pools were very nice, and the rooms were clean. The food was actually pretty good compared to other places in Mexico I have been. My friends and I are young, attractive, and gay, and we were surrounded by a mix of married 50 year olds, and hairy Europeans who were rude and clickish. If you are gay and like to party responsibly yet have fun, this is not the place for you. This year I'm staying at the Sunclub in Punta Cana which I have heard is moderate yet exceeds the expectations of many resorts in the area. I go in June, so I'll be sure to post my reflection.

<Content>don't expect anything from management Sorry to say, this is bellow average resort (not a 4 star) with dirty beach and water (glass, sea grass), bad food, poor service, everyone I talked to had diarrhea after a few day including us. Things are being stolen from rooms by maintenance and cleaning staff (management will not do anything about it). People rating this resort must not been to the other resorts, this felt like bad rest stop. Short story but true!

<Content>Very relaxing; Had a great time My husband a I stayed at the Sunscape April 4- 11th. Our first trip to the Domican Republic and we had a very good time. We traveled with Apple Vacations from Chicago and things went smoothly. The Punta Cana airport is very small and is an open-air, grass hut looking airport. When you arrive you get in line, where you have your picture taken with a couple of girls in costume (which you can buy for $5 US dollars when you leave for home), then you have to buy a tourist card for $10 each, which you fill out and turn in to the immigration officer. You keep part of the form for your return trip - if you lose it you have to pay another $10. Then you claim your luggage and go out to the parking lot where the buses are waiting. There are tons of porters waiting to carry your luggage of course and we found it easiest to just allow them to carry our bags rather than fight them off. They only expect $1 per bag and took us directly to our Apple rep. Our luggage was put on the bus and we after everyone boarded we were off to the resort. It was about a 20 minute ride ot the resort. The countryside is very, very poor and very very dirty in US standards. Lots of garbage, especially bottles littered all over. This is due to the economy I think. The only real trade at Punta Cana is tourism.At the hotel we collected our luggage and checked in. Staff was walking around serving punch (rum added if you wanted) and chocolate chip cookies. We were assigned our room (I had requested a third floor room with a king bed,non-smoking near the beach in advance), given our keys and we were off. The porter brought the bags about 15 minutes later. We were in building 4 which was nice because it was near the beach and the restaurants and not near the kids club or the main stage. buildings 1, 2 and 3 were nearer to the kids club and the main stage, which I think would have been louder. Our room was large and had a great peaked ceiling. The bed was huge. The room is basic, but acceptable. We had a garden view anduested that and the resort was full. Our air conditioning unit was VERY loud and I complained. They came the next day (we had to remind them) to fix it and it worked better, but it was still loud and we often had to turn the fan off. Others we met said their AC were very loud as well. The mini fridge is not cold when you get there, because it has been turned off, but it cools off by the next day. Not cold by US standards, but is cool. It is stocked with bottled water, Sprite and Coke. They also bring beer (Bohemia Especial) to the room your first night and restock it daily. There was an ice machine in the 1st floor of the building. The week we were there they were just putting in alarm clocks in each room. They didn't have them before, so this is new.Maid service. Maid service was fine. We left a modest tip of $2 each day and left a note (in Spanish) of what we wanted, (i.e. extra water, beer, shampoo, pillowsetc.) and got what we asked for. There were many people who did not tipand also received the same treatment, so I don't think tipping is necessary. The tile floors were washed daily and if you put the towles in the bathtub you get fresh towels daily. I did leave $5 one day and asked for a different type of beer than Presidente or Bohemia but was informed they didn't have nay available for the rooms, which was disappointing. Bars and nightlife - This was our first experience with a pool bar and we loved it. At some of the bars they do serve Heineken beer (not at the pool bar though) if you ask, which seems to be a big secret. I drink beer and after awhile I had trouble tolerating the Presidente and the Bohemia beer they serve. My husband did as well. They definately need to get some other brands of beer. They serve local liquor unless you ask for a name brand (i.e. My husband requested Bacardi rum and Jack Daniels and coke and was able to get it without a problem) We did tip bartenders modestly ($1-2 a day) and found we had fairly good, friendly service. Many bartenders remembered what we r a beer with tomato juice and it foamed up like some sort of chemical reaction, so I'm not sure what their version of tomato juice is, but I don't recommend it. They used a lot of canned Clamato juice, which most people said was ok. There is a small disco that gets going around 11 p.m. It has a large screen TV, although the dance floor is right in front of it. It is very small and was very loud, not our cup of tea, but seemed to be popular with the younger crowd. There is a bar called Umbrellas which is a nice casual bar with large, comfortable chairs and karoake and singing. The night we were there there were only a few people there, but it seemed nice. There is a bar that is open 24 hours near the beach. Each night they showed a movie at the stage at around 7 p.m. for kids (Scooby Doo, A Bugs life, etc.) on a big screen. From 7:30 - 9 p.m. they had casino table set up for black jackin the back of the movie area. (This could get a little loud and did interefere with the people trying to watch the movie). At around 9:00 each night there was a show on the mainstage. We watched most of them. The Latin show and the Tribute show were pretty good. The others were more audience particpation and were pretty lame although the staff did try very hard to make it fun. I did get totally sick of hearing the put your hands up in the air song by the end of the week.If you are looking for an exciting trip with lots of energetic nightlife, I would say Punta Cana is not likely what you are looking for. We were looking for a very relaxing vacation so we were not disappointed with the nightlife, but some people we talked to had been hoping for more night life - more like Cancun.Restaurants - No reservations required at any of the restaurants which is nice. We always ate early (6 - 6:30 ) and never had trouble getting seated, although some we met said if you waited much past 7-7:30 you might have to wait for the specialty restaurants. Make srue to check which restaurants are closce much slower than in the US but may be so you don't feel rushed. We had things we wanted to do, so found this a little irritating at times.The main buffet restaurant is called Windows. I would rate is as average, cafeteria style food. They need more variety. There was a pasta station, a Mexican station (fajitas), several varieties of meats and some fish, salads, fruits, breads, etc. We found in most of the specialty restaurants that they use a lot of butter (their version of butter) in foods. De Marios - We ate ther 2 times. Gourmet italian, although not the type of Italian we find in the US. More formal atmosphere and children under 12 are not allowed. Good food in our opinion - we had 3 cheese lasagna (appetizer), duck ravioli (appetizer), cheese and ham (appetizer); shrimp and chicken was good. Too stuffed for dessert, but heard they were very good. American Grill - American fare with a cowbouy theme- steaks, etc. Not as good as midwest beef that we are used to but still good. Entertaining staff. Beach grill - a la carte breakfast and lunch, and dinner. We ate there 3 times. Dinner was great. Mahi mahi was excellent. My husband loved the onion soup. Seafood soup was fishy. Note: Almost all of the fish we had was very good, but it does have bones. Grouper was good, but not as good as the mahi mahi. Also at lunch they set up a little buffet with hot dogs (didn't hear good things about these!), hamburgers (these we ate and thought were fine), pizza (ok, not great) and french fries (best to get these when they are fresh and hot.)By the pool in the afternoon they have chips, salsa, hot dogs too. I loved the fresh salsa but I don't think I tolerated it well and I generally have no trouble with my stomach.Green Parrot - there is a restuarant/bar on the beach that is owned by the sunscape but is not included in the all-inclusive. You can get Corona and other beer there. Also a lobster dinner for $20. We didn't eat there but had a few beers there. It was a little odd because we ordered 2 beers and guy just shrugged. We gave him $5 and asked if this was ok and he said ok, so I have no idea what you could pay for a beer. You might be able to get them for much cheaper, but since we pay nearly $4 each for a Corona at home, I didn't complain much!Staff and service - The staff and service at the Sunscape were great. The staff always smiled and everyone said Hola! They work very long hours and did their best to serve us. We were very pleased. I walked around by myself on the resort at night a lot and always felt safe. There was a guard on duty and he walked the beach. We walked up the beach at night once to the Allegro and there was a guard there at night also. The grounds were very clean and the workers were always cleaning or working on something.We had brought along a lot of $1's bills (we brought along 50 1's)which is something I recommend for tipping, etc. You are not expected to tip, but if you do it is easiest to have small bills.Pool and beach - beautiful main pool with a section for activities. Separate small wade pool for kids. It would be nice if they had a section in main pool for kids activities and one for adults only as it was hard to play pool volleyball with all of the kids. The kids seem to have a geat time. There is an kids club that watches kids during the day and had a variety of fun activities for them. One night we saw tents set up on the beach where the kids got to camp out, they had a small screen with a movie and hot dogs/hamburgers on the beach. I would have loved this if I were a kid!There is a separate adult pool behind building 5. Quiet, no activities or music, it's own bar with a great bartender (Luis). Topless sunbathing here permitted.We didn't have a problem getting beach towels, but many people we ran into said they were often out of towels. We kept our towels for several days and when we turned them in we always made sure to exchange them right then for new ones so we knew we'd have one. We also brought a couple of our own.They could use more floate eventually. There is a problem getting a lounge chair in the shade by the main pool. You have to go down early in the morning and put your towel on a chair if you hope to get one in the shade. I went down one morning at 6 a.m. to do this. We only did this once because we found it wasn't that important to us since we spent most of the day in the water. We just kept our towels and stuff in a bag and put it by the wall near the pool bar. We did have one of our resort towels taken one day that we had hanging over the deck railing by the pool, probably because towels were in short supply. The activities desk did give us a new one so we wouldn't get charged for the lost towel. They need to get more towels and try to do something about the poolside chair situation. The beach was nice. There was a lot of seaweed, but they raked it up daily and did their best to keep it clean. If you are looking for a perfectly clean beach without seaweed, this likely won't meet your standards, but we found it fine. Plenty of chairs and shade on the beach.Spa - I didn't use it, but some others we talked to did and like it. One lady had an 80 minute massage/reflexology treatment for $80. It sounded like you could get any increment for a massage fro about $1 a minute. You could get your hair braided in those tiny braids on the beach by locals or in the spa. I was always warned not to do this because the braids are so tiny and tight it really wrecks your hair when you try to take them out.Excursions. Variety of excursions available through your tour company. Not as many as in Mexico. We went on the Kon Tiki party boat ($50 each US) which was 4 hours on a party barge. Open bar with dancing, limbo contests, etc. You can snorkel for about an hour. The snorkeling was ok, but the coral is mainly dead. This trip was ok, but I was not feeling well and didn't like the El Presidente beer, so didn't drink much. Hubby drnak rum punch and said it was ok. 5 others we talked to at the resort said they weren't impressed with it fo trip. Picked us up at 8 a.m. in lobby and returned around 4:30 p.m. Get to see the local scenery and a family home, stop for lunch, stop at a small river to take a dip if you want, coolers with beer, rum, water, flowing all day. Stop at a rum shack to buy liquor if you want. Last stop at Macao beach (beautiful) to boogie board (semi-surf) in the ocean for about 45 minutes. Bumpy ride all day and would be better if less packed but overall was a great trip for the money. Tip: Put your swim siut on before you leave and put on sunscreen before you leave and reapply all day long. Our guide Tony was great. Guides spoke English. Parasailing: Near the green Parrot on the beach there is a parasailing outfit run by the hotel. It is somewhat pricey - $45 for one person, $85 for two (you can tandem aparasail together) for 10 minutes. If you walk up the beach toward the Allegro, there is another vendor that will do it for $35 each for 12 minutes. I wanted to parasaid with a girl I had met and we had very little time, so we paid the higher price through the hotel because they were able to get out out right away. The guys running the parasail boat spoke very little English, but I had done it before so had no trouble figuring out what to do. This girl and I were alone, but we felt safe, although the guy running the boat had a tshirt tied over his face so you couldn't see anything but his eyes and looked a bit like a pirate! The parasailing was beautiful. 10 minutes isn't nearly long enough!Shopping - if you like to shop and are looking for a great shopping experience, this likely isn't the place for you. The only shops are a few shops in the hotel and some small shops set up on the beach. If you want to buy art or jewelry, buy it at the hotel. Several people bought jewelry on the beach which fell apart before then end of the week. My husband bought a pair of sunglasses at a beach shop for $10 (fake Oakleys') which fell apart by the end of the week. Be ready to barter. Every vendor calls you to his shop with plity etc. and nothing is marked. You ask how much and they start out with some OUTRAGEOUS amount. (For example $150 for my husbands sunglasses). You then say no way. They come down half or more. You still say no way and offer less. They counteroffer. You then offer what you want to pay (in our case we offered a max of $10). They whine and complain and may even swear at you adn may let you leave the shop. Most of the time they will then come and find you and say ok, they'll take your price. We found this entertaining for a short while, but soon tired of it and only went to a few shops. People we met did get good deals on t-shirts ($7 each) and cheap costume jewelry. Other tips: Bring along immodium, aspirin, Phasyme or GasX, PeptoBismal tablets, etc. just in case. My husband and I did get diarrhea and so did most of the people we talked to (about 10 people), but the immodium helped a lot. I'm not sure if it was the food, the tropical oils in the drinks, the beer or simply just drinking too much. You cannot drink the tap water, but they provide plenty of bottled water. Our room did have a sewer smell at times, which was gross and the resort grounds in general had that smell every so often. Not sure why.There was some rain ( 3 times in the 7 days we were there, mostly late afternoon/early evening), but it didn't last long and we actually found it refreshing because the sun is so intense. I brought along a small, cheap umbrella and it worked great the few times it rained. It evidently rained more the week before we were there, but we were told this was very unusual. Our Apple rep said to call direct from the room rather than using a calling card. Said calling cards were more expensive due to connection fees. We never used the phone. Bring lots of 1's (US) if you plan to shop or tip. Leaving for home: Bus picked us up in lobby around 10:30 a.m. for a 1:20 flight. They go through your luggage by hand at the airport. You can't taek fruit or Mamma Juana back. Hot in the airport and things aret food - expensive. I suggest you eat before leaving for the airport and bring a bottle of water with you. There is a very small gift shop with a very limited selection of stuff. Our flight was on time and we had no problems. They have a arrival/departure monitor, but don't rely on its accuracy. There was a flight to Philadelphia that it said was delayed but actually left right on time and several people almost missed it because they were in the bar. Listen to the announcements carefully.Overall, our experience was great and we would love to go back at some time. The Sunscape resort was very nice and the staff were great!

<Content>Good times at Sunscape! We stayed at the Sunscape March 22, 2003 to the 29th. We were a group of 3 families, 13 people, and we all had a great time. The beach is beautiful and the pool was wonderful. The food was good. The beach party cook out was the best. Plenty to do for all ages. All the rooms were full but we never had to wait in any lines. The staff was great and the manager, Rod, takes care of all the details.

<Content>I recommend the sunscape My Husband and I went to the Sunscape Grand March 1/2003 after many months of deciding where to stay . I read the reviews of this place and that is how we decided to go there. It was all they said it was going to be. It was so beautiful there and the food was good. The service was good. The drinks were excellent. The only problem we had was that it was to short.We would like to go there next year for 2 weeks and I would tell anyone to go there. It was AWESOME!!!If you would like to see some pictures just e-mail me Thanks

<Content>Just GO.. I am almost speachless. Sunscape is the best resort that I have ever been to. The food is good. The American Grill serves a great lunch and dinner, from salads to steaks. The Italian place was great, but not the kind of Italian you get in the states. The nightly shows are very entertaining and funny. The rooms are clean and well maintained. they are nothing special but we didn't spend much time there anyway. The staff.... The staff is the finest that I have ever experienced. I would like to thank Popi (bartender) and Eduardo (photograpy) these guys made us feel like we were royalty. The rest of the staff is just as good and treat you like family. The beach is great with plenty of shade for those who want it. The exec staff is very freindly and loves to here your ideas and input. If you like to drink, this is your place. 6 bars, dico, pool bar, adult pool bar. There were kids there, but you don't even notice them. The entire resort is super clean 24 hrs. a day. There are plenty of activities for the energetic or you can just spend your time relaxing on the beach or by the pool. Over all, this place is incredible. If you don't go then you are missing out on a dimmond in the ruff. Just go and see for yourself. We went with Apple Vacations, they were great. Give them a try and have fun!

<Content>It was just okay The rooms were a little musty smelling, but overall not too bad. The food was not as good as expected. The only decent restaurant was DeMario's, all the rest tasted like cafeteria food. The beach and pool were awesome!! The electric and water turned off once while we were there for about 2 hours, which was inconvenient just coming back for a long day of snorkeling. We were dying for a shower and had to wait until 8pm. Nightlife stinks- not much going on. Next time I visit Punta Cana, I'm staying at the Iberostar. I heard it is amazing!!

<Content>4get The Rest Sunscape Is The Best! Before going 2 Punta Cana my Wife  I read alot of reviews on just about every resort in Punta Cana. We wnated to find 1 with a beautiful beach, good places 2 eat  fun activities. We were a bit unsure between a few different ones-but picked Sunscape. Well we are soooo glad we did!! The place was more than we expected by far. The beach was awesome  very clean (unlike the resorts next to us). They had 4 great places to eat (the Italian Rest. was super). The activity guys kept you laughing  wanting more. The rooms are nice  maid serv was very good. They have theme parties every night ( beach dinner party for 1,200 was really cool). The nightly shows were a ways from a Vegas show -but still enteraining. The GM is from Canada  really takes pride in making sure everyone (including his employees) are having a great time!! Beach,Pool,Food,Drinks,People,Activities were all great! So if your undecided like we were-do yourself a favor  go to Sunscape!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful This resort really does deserve it's 5 stars. The resort was wonderful. The staff was so nice. The food was excellent. They had four restaurants and all were great. You didnt have to make reservations at any of them. The shows were spectacular. The scenery was breathtaking.

<Content>Sunscape is spectacular. Since August 2002 I had heard and read all the reviews about Sunscape...more than 95% were raves and the few negatives were to be expected. There is no doubt in my mind that Sunscape has found a niche in the resort industry of rehabbing smaller and more compact resorts and Americanizing them for the North American trade. A vacationing British gentleman at the resort said that he came to Sunscape because Americans have higher standards. My reason for booking Sunscape was not because it was Americanized, but because it was not a mega sprawling resort. Twice we had been to the Casadel Mar in La Romana for that particular reason and it is now called Sunscape Casa del Mar..yipee.. Many people we have met also avoid larger chains that require trams, jitneys or long walks to take them place to place. Three times in the past we had been to the city of Santo Domingo, once to Puerto Platta which I hated..lol. Twice to the! Casa del Mar in a Romana and two years go to the Catalonia Bavaro which we liked very much except it was another sprawling resort. So, we aren't any strangers to the Dominican Republic and our expectations of the newer all inclusives and we do our homework way ahead of time before booking a resort. Let me tell you about our incredible experience at Sunscape In Punta Cana. If Rod Gahr, General Manager of Sunscape had ever gone to a hotel and restaurant management school he would have been told....you can't do what you want to do!! As a result of his working his way up he has learned what guests really want. He is a hands on person and is available to guests, he loads luggage as guests depart and thanks each and every one of them. He walks around giving out red gummy bears to guests and staff alike.. Rod doesn't hide behind a locked door.ARRIVAL: On Sunday, February 9th at 12:45 p.m.: We were greeted with s!miles and welcomes by the frontdesk staff and as reported it is true with warm chocolate chip cookies and rum punch with Caren, the Director of Public Relations adding rum for those who wanted it. Many people from our GWV group received their rooms immediately. We were told as others that our rooms would be ready at 2:00 p.m. so we went to lunch at Windows and had a drink. Two o'clock arrived and everybody received their room except us and we were told a great room was being prepared, but we would have to wait until 3:00 p.m. We had been up since 3:00 a.m. and I was not a happy camper. I happened to talk to Jessica, the Guest Relations person, and she promptly talked to the front desk and assured us the room would be ready in ten minutes....thank you Jessica....it was. When booking the room we had asked for a second floor and king sized bed. We were taken to what I judged was the most wonderful locat!ion...Building #3 and Room 3220 which overlooked the pool and beach. The new mahogany four poster king sized bed (with two swans made from the towels and flowers) and the furniture represented the mahogany wood the D.R. was famous for. In the bathroom there were huge white fluffy towels and lo and behold not one, not two, but three facecloths and the amenities of large week sized shampoos, conditioner and bath gel. How many times have been to resorts and have had to bring my own face cloths . I do bring my own shampoo and conditioner and bath gel as a rule. On the large balcony was a sturdy pull out clothes dryer (I always bring clothespins and liquidsoap) Yes, we were off to a great start. Sunday night about 7:30 we headed towards Da Mario's. There were people waiting outside and we put our names in. When we asked about how long the wait was the young man told us to keep coming back and checking. This from what I had read was n!ot the Sunscape Way. We headed to the Tex-Mex Restaurant where I had the ribs which were delicious. MONDAY... we were up early and as I had read almost all chairs in the shade are hard to come by, but we lucked out as all the other chairs in the shade under the palapas had been taken by 7:00 a.m. In mid-morning I spotted Rod Gahr and Johny Mendez, the Food and Beverage Manager walking around. early in the morning. Not being the bashful type I told him as far as I was concerned I would like to be moved to the Catalonia Bavaro down the road I was quite unhappy and told him why. He turned to Mr. Mendez, the Food and Beverage Manager and told him to take care of the problem at DaMario's and he apologized profusely for our inconvenience and long wait for our room. He guaranteed we would love the resort and that evening we received a lovely fruit platter and a personal letter of apology from him which was the proper way to handle an!unhappy guest. The rest of the week was filled with pleasant suprises beyond my expectations..Things happened that we had never seen at any other 4 star resort and let me tell you about them. POOL AREA: The pool is divided in two by a woodenbridge and on the deeper side was the very activepool bar and little kiddies pool which was actually being used. On the activities side was the palapa withthe towels and bulletin boards noting activities for that evening and movies. We never ever had a problem with replacing our towels, probably because we took the dirty ones to the room and replaced them in the a.m. Around the pool where we sat from 8:00 a.m. to at least 4:30 p.m. there was always something going on. Music was not loud and obtrusive as we have found in other places. There was the usual volley ball, wateraerobics, kayak fights, dance lessons, spanish lessons, step aerobics etc. etc. Large yellow floats! were put in the pool in the a.m. One morning I noticed several children hoarding one or two of the floats under their chaises.. I don't know who, but somebody from the staff nicely (I heard him) ask the children to use them or put them back in the pool and they did. Adults and children alike took turns sharing the floats and it was never a problem..nice to see Because this is a family type resort there were many children and it was wonderful to see them playing with their new friends. One little girl from Holland was included with two American and one British girls and by hand gestures and whatever they made a happy quartet. I even heard one girl thank three others for being her friends for the week, wasn't that sweet. The children I knew through their families would go off with Paulina doing kids stuff and one morning they had a volley ball game in the pool and another a treasure hunt and their team came back with T-shirts. Another afterno! o!n we noticed a little fake Dominican Hut beingput up and decorated with palms. They had brought in coconuts and had a Coconut Party around the pool. They broke them open and filled them with a coco loco drink and Caren again was there to add rum for those who wanted it. Dominican dancers were there to provide the entertainment and dance with the guests and give lessons. There were plenty of coconuts to go around and everybody seemed to enjoy this wonderful event..One afternoon chocolate chip cookies were passed around and another day or two although bars were just steps away drinks were served to guests by staff members. The Animation Staff under the direction of Adrian Gutierrez is always there working and one in particular draws my praise..Chookie (I hope that ishow his name is spelled)., the first day I saw this plus sized man start to do water exercises I thought..wow...the hospital isn't that faraw! ay..Surprise...he gave a great work out..at least 30 minutes and never faltered. One day he walked around talking to all the guests around the pool and with us was a new guest, a little girl. Chookie welcomed her with a chuck under the chin which brought a smile. Amazingly, a few days later when he walked around he asked where the little girl was, now that is amazing..Tuesday and Fridays the parrot men come around to take pictures of the guests posing with the birds. Since my name is Parrot Mom and I do own parrots I was quite anxious to meet the parrots and learn how and where they came from. Eduardo the photographer did not just take any old picture and was quite creative and is an excellent photographer. He told me about the birds that they rent per day and how they are taken care of. For whatever reason I adopted the charming Eduardo as my son. There was a different photographer with the handler on Friday and it was a one two three deal and the developed pictures that were for sale showed the difference. Yes, I bought a cute silly candid picture from Eduardo. Now, I must tell you the negative side of the pool area. if you want shade you must get up before 7:00a.m. to reserve your spot. There was ! gentleman who had a small baby and little toddler and he explained he needed the shade for them. There was a woman in a wheelchair whose palapa was saved by her family. Personally, I've had basal cell and also need shade and I had to get up early and do the same thing. The last full day were were going to be there I was determined after being out in the sun too much to reserve a special spot. The spot the family with the baby had used this spot for several days and had left the day before. On the whole we found people very respectful of the reserved spaces and the morning I knew they were gone I happened to be up at 5:45 and in the pitch black of the building and pool area I groped my way downstairs with towels and cover-ups to reserve the much desired spot. I moved the lounges into the area only bumping into the security guard coming and going and I wonder what he thought. Interesting enough the some of the same spots were ! c!overed with towels early in the a.m. day after day and privately I think I know how and why, but my lips are sealed. There was an incident where a husband had reserved one chair for his wife near us under a palapa at 7:00a.m., she had developed sun poisoning. When she went out to get the chair it had been pushed out into the sun by four non-english speaking guests who gestured they knew nothing about it. Two other chairs under a palapa with towels of guests I had met had their chairs pushed into the sun also by other non-english speaking guest. I do understand that people from other countries do not require the space around them and felt they have the right to share your space. Sadly, many of the saved chaises were not utilized until late afternoon. A woman told me that her chair and her friends chair under a tree on the beach had the fate of having her items dumped and the people know knowing a thing about it. Managem! ent is definitely aware ofthe problem and it was mentioned at the Cocktail Party. This problem is not unique to Sunscape and the solution maybe easy. At the Casa del Mar around the pool are four huge canopies that hold at least two dozen chaises so there is never a problem getting a place in the shade. There has to be a solution whether there are more palapas installed or perhaps one or two canopies on either side of the pool.. Guests on vacation should not have to get up at 6:00 or 7:00a.m. to find a place in the shade. Since we are retired I resent having to rise at least two hours earlier so we can find a bit of shade..Another request I've heard from other guests is that additional ladders be put in both sides of the pool. and or a set of steps. There is only one ladder on the bar side and one on the activities side. Small children needed boosts and a woman I talked to with bad knees had a definite problem getti! n!g in and outand needed assistance. BEACH--Don't know what the complaints about the beach were about a little seaweed and the marina off to the side. The boats added to the scenic beauty. We walked the beach daily down to the Allegro Resort and past returning by the way of the vendors. They can be persistent, but telling them I was just looking and they took it well. When we did go back to buy and to look for a particular item they were helpful. These vendors are not self-employed and work for a company that puts up the booths so the prices are a tad higher, but they need to make their money too. Between the pool and the beach over the wall is a young man hand painting T-shirts personalizing them. There is a kiddie playground with slides. and other adult games available. RESTAURANTS: WINDOWS; On the first day we had lunch in Windows and were very unhappy. The restaurant is cavernous and dark at the breakfast and lunch we had t! here. One of the joys of a winter vacation is eating on a deck under an umbrella. No complaints about the food being offered or the staff. TEX-MEX: Ate there the first night, great ribs. AMERICAN GRILLE: We never dined there...sorry...it was downstairs from the Tex-Mex restaurant and the same building as the Beach Grille BEACH GRILLE: The next morning we heard about the Beach Grille and headed to there at 8:00 a.m. to sit overlooking the beach under an umbrella. it was pure joy. There is an regular breakfast menu which were able to order from and that was fine and we also had lunch there. There is a waiter who deserves special attention.. I don't know remember his name, but hecomes from Puerto Platta and is easily recognizable because he is bald..Very experienced and delightful..he is also a head waiter in Da Mario's. DA MARIO'S: We spent much time eating there because of the excellent food and service. The secret is to go bef! o!re 6:45 and we usually arrived about 6:30 or 6:15. The food was wonderful, especially of note were their mashed potatoes. It got so that I would order grilled shrimp and instead of pasta requested the mashed potatoes. The food, presentation and service was excellent. I could barely get to the desserts, but if I did...they had a design of a spoon and fork outlined with cocoa powder....nice touch SURPRISES: This is what sets Sunscape apart and above other resorts we have ever been to......MANAGERS COCKTAIL PARTY: Wednesday Night there is a Manager's Cocktail Party in the Lobby. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Rod personally passing around appetizers as was Adrian head of the Animation Team, the Food and Beverage Director and the Chef's. In real champagne glasses bottles of champagne flowed freely. Cruise style Rod introduced his entire staff and the people behind the scenes. He also included two men who were responsible for the sa!nitation and cleanliness of the resort and restaurants. Rod proudly announced that Sunscape had the highest rating of any resort in Punta Cana for sanitation and I didn't hear of anybody getting sick. On the plane a woman told me her husband was hospitalized for two night with foodpoisoning...she was at one of the mega resort..BEACH PARTY: Early on Thursday morning the staff started setting up for beach party in the evening. At least two hundred tables with blue glassware, candles and white tablecloths. The staff had made an lovely arbor of palm leaves to enter the area... I looked around in disbelief and wonderment at the buffet tables set up. Even on cruise ships have I never seen the selection and displays they had. We wondered even at the huge selection of cheeses...all sorts of items being grilled like whole fish and steaks. In the very, very early morning as I enjoyed some air on the balcony I heard the staff cleaning up...The gi!gantic effort of Food and Beverage Manager, Johnny Mendez and his staff in the many man hours of putting up this buffet and then having to break it down and clear the tables, chair and clean the beach for the morning has to be be a Herculean affair..POOL PARTY: Friday morning lo and behold the staff is setting up again around the arbor and pool area for apool party...another incredible buffet. ANIMATION STAFF/SHOWS: Every evening there were great movies on a large screen for kids and have to and many adults alike. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Scooby Doo, 102Dalmations and Shreik. The shows for the adults were fun some of them judged by the staff as adult..The children were asked to come to the front of the stage where they were marched off by the staff to have their own party. Before several of the shows the chiildren put on little shows...one was a fashion show..another was the movng hat.. and seeing Chookie try to explain this game to the children who spoke several languages was funny enough. HOUSEKEEPING: Since our long wait the first day we would put the card asking for the room to be made up immediately..and it was. One morning we forgot and when we returned out room had still not been made. It!'s very possible with the constant coming and goings of guests during the week that additional housekeeping personell should be added. GROUNDS: Since this is an older resort the bushes and trees are lush and kept well trimmed. STAFF: By having the management team that they do at Suncape it is obvious the rest of the staff are happycampers and as a result reflect it in their attitude towards guests.

<Content>Great Vacation We just returned from vacationing at the Sunscape Grand and were very impressed. From greeting to departure the staff made every effort to provide a welcome and enjoyable stay. The facility was large enough to afford a variety of activities but small enough that everything was convenient. Beach was wonderful, clean and provided plenty of lounges. The rooms were clean and well supplied. The dining facilities were varied and no reservations were needed. Our vacation was the last week of February and we plan to return the same time next year.

<Content>I Highly recommend Sunscape My husband and I visited Sunscape Feb.19-26, 2003. This was our first vacation w/o our children and the first time I felt completely and totally catered to. It was one of the more affordable, all-inclusive packages we could find (Apple Vacations) and although the room was not fancy, it was clean, cool and really did suit our needs. The staff there was wonderful and strived to make us comfortable. The grounds and beach were beautiful and well taken care of also. One day while on the beach we were approached by several people from the neighboring resorts (Occidental Allegro Resort Bavaro, Barcelo Bavaro Palace) who were just dying to talk to someone who spoke English, which was not a problem at Sunscape. It seemed that most of the quests (80-90%) Were American and Canadian, so there was never a lack of people to talk to. AND very few topless sun bathers. (I saw three (only on the beach) altogether and some could have past for men! LOL)The food was very different(some alittle bland) and sometimes inconsistent. We did have good luck at The American Grill(Tex Mex) getting some decent cuts of beef. We definitely didn't go hungry, for there was always something somewhere to eat. I honestly believe that if there is a problem with people getting sick, it would probably be the combination of the heat, sun and alcohol, rather then the food. I talked to a couple who have visited punta cana 5 times, each at a different resort. They told me that Although rooms at sunscape aren't quite as nice, the food was the best by far! Be sure to take anything you may need as far as medications and toiletries. A bottle of 24 Tylenol could cost ya up to ten American bucks. So be prepared! The snorkeling on the resort was much better then on the excursion we took and much cheaper. Make sure you find out when you get there what all is included, so you don't miss out on things like a free message, horseback riding,etc.I was very impressed with the staff and their work ethic! They work very hard and make very little money. Your all-inclusive covers tips for servers but not your maid, so she/he will dance and sing if you leave them a tip. We were so impressed with our maid the we ended up tipping her close to $40 for the week and have no regrets! Would be nice if more American's were as dedicated and had as great of attitudes as these people. I wish I could have brought alot of them home with me! All in all, we really have no real complaints! Give Sunscape Punta Cana a try!

<Content>Excellent vacation Feb 15 - 22 four of us stayed at Sunscape resort in Punta Cana. What a beautiful resort. Clean, friendly staff (they don't expect or wait for tips), great drinks, good food specially the Italian restaurant and also the one night we had an outdoor buffet dinner by the pool. There is disco and the piano lounge bar was great if you want to relax and participate in Karaoke. The drinks are amazing if I can remember them all; miami vice (excellent drink); bahama mama; poco loco; strawberry daquiri; pina colada; and of course each bartender has a specialty, no name to it but if I tell him to make me a special that would not make me bloath, they make it for you with a smile - excellent specialty drinks!!! One waiter even called the drink after him, which is funny specially when you ordered it from another bartender - it's called Poppy Make Me Happy!!! The other bartenders doesn't know Poppy's concoction, so you have to remember Poppy's face! It rained on Wednesday which is the day that we supposed to have dinner right on the beach, it would have been perfect and romantic...next time. The bedroom is clean, regardless of whether I leave a tip or not, the maid still cleaned the room, with flowers too! We tipped her at the end of the week. We would definitely go back again to this resort, fantastic shows and Ron Gahr staff are excellent, very friendly specially one waitress that gave us her sweet smile and jokes as she cleaned our table. The beach is wonderful, soft to touch and we walked daily for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The beach is endless, we tried walking to the Bavaro resort area and it would have taken us 1 1/2hr one way to get there so we turned back after walking for 45 minutes on the beach, it was a good excercise after eating all the good meals. My husband and our friends truly enjoyed this holiday, I would definitely go back. The day we got back in Toronto, it was snowing - we definitely wanted to go back!!!!

<Content>beautiful beach, below average service We found Sunscape to be an average resort. Food- Good. Beaches- awesome. Cleanliness- above average. Service - POOR. When a domincan says 10 minutes- that actually means 1 hour. You must have alot of patience to get what you want. My husband and I were married here and the judge was an hour and 45 minutes late. Our room was never cleaned on our wedding night and we were out of toilet paper.At our rehearsal dinner, at THe American Grill we waited 2 hours for our food- this is no exaggeration. The last annoying thing was the beach chairs. People would lay their towels and reserve them at like 6:00 in the morning and then never even lay on them. Too petty for us and too many obnoxious drunks. If you go to punta cana, stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. Elegant, food is awesome, service unbelievabe, beaches clean and tons of chairs!!! To some it up..at the surroundings of the Iberostar there are beautiful pink flamingos that parade around. At Sunscape, a live chicken waddles around the adult pool. You make the decision.

<Content>Best vacation ever! We stayed at Sunscape January 18-25, 2003. We had a wonderful stay and would return in a minute. The resort is beautiful, well kept and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. The beach is wonderful, and you are not crowded in like sardines like at other resorts we have stayed - there are lots of chairs/loungers and palm trees to lay under. The resort does a good job at keeping the beach clean (seaweed floats in but the staff rakes it up and takes it away). The food is what impressed us the most. The American Grill served wings, ribs, steak, chicken, and shrimp - all were very good! And the buffet restaurant Windows was great too - lots of variety and it all tasted good. My favourite was Da Mario's - the italian restaurant, but they serve more than just italian. We had a wonderful chicken dish with garlic mashed potatos and steamed veggies, I also had shrimp primavera on another night. For dessert, the tiramisu was incredible! The guests at the resort were mostly American(65%), Canadians (30%) and the odd handful of Europeans(5%). We enjoyed this very much because everyone spoke English  it was very easy to meet people. Also, because the majority of guests are from North America, the resort tailors their menu to this type of food.The shows/entertainment at night were great to watch. One night they set up the beach for a dinner on the beach. This was wonderful - hundreds of tables with white linen table cloths and candles and a warm ocean breeze while eating dinner. Overall, it was an absolutely wonderful trip and we would go back again. Kim  Steve Tucker, Waterloo, ON Canada

<Content>loved sunscape We had a great time at Sunscape. The staff, food, drinks, rooms, pool, beach, entertainment were excellent. The food was the best I've had thus far at an all-inclusive resort, and I'm a picky person. The rooms were very clean, the maid service was great, no complaints. I recommend leaving a small tip daily. The hotel does everything they can to keep it's guests happy. The beach was kept very clean. The nightly entertainment was great . The staff is very friendly and entertaining, they kept us busy by the pool all day long, from aqua aerobics to tequila volley ball! SPECIAL THANKS TO RIFIEAL AND CHEWKY.I was very happy with this resort and will definitly visit Sunscape again

<Content>Awesome Time! We stayed at the Sunscape 2/9/03 for 4nts. And had a GREAT time. I'm a travel agent and get around to lots of other resorts  palces and I have to say the Sunscape was AWESOME. We also toured many other resorts in Punta Cana and some were so large there just wasn't that personal one on one staff to client ratio, You always felt like just another number. Here everyone treated you like family. It was very clean, they were always cleaning some thing. My friend and I went back to our room after breakfast one morning to change into our swimsuits and the maid was cleaning everything in our room from top to bottom. You have to take in to consideration it is very humid there and things are going to smell a bit damp! But that's par for the course in most resort areas that have humidity! The food was very good lots of variety on the buffet and the sit down resturants were good also we loved the American Grill and the best part was there was no reservations required like at other resorts I have been to. They always seem to have something going on around the pool and the staff tried very hard to get everyone involved. Even for children!! They sun is very hot so take caution and use lots of high SPF sunscreen and when need be find shade like in the beach bar and grill where you can order off the menu anything from cheese steaks, burgers, hotdogs, salads and pizza. The night life is so so the shows were a bit corny but we still had a few good laughs. We love JULIO our favorite GreenBay Packer Fan in the Piano  Cigar Bar, which they light the bar on fire a few times later at night. And Julio of course is always on fire and ready to greet you with a HUGE smile! The disco was also a very fun place lots of dancing. The staff at the Sunscape trys really hard to go out of there way to make your trip very special. Rod  Caren really try there best to make this resort WONDERFUL! It's as laid back as you want it to be or as busy as you want it to be. You can take the tours like the outback safari, or 4x4 or just walk the beach which is very natural, so if your looking for a very clean prestine beach I haven't seen one in DR yet! Also there is not alot of shopping just your basic t-shirts and island souvenirs. Yes some times there was the smell of sewer, but I have encountered that in many places as well, like Mexico and Cruises. The water pressure for the toilets and shower could be improved and that was just about my only complaint. I won't hesitate to send my clients to this resort and I myself will return. I'm confident they will have a wonderful time and come back smiling and ready to book a return trip to the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. Carmin Markwardt ...

<Content>LOVED SUNSCAPE!!! IT WAS PERFECT We stayed at Sunscape from 2/1-2/8/03!!!! It was fabulous!! The resort was very nice, better than I could have ever dreamed!! The people that work there are superb!! Everyone was very pleasant, and willing to do whatever they could for you to make your trip the best. I loved every minute of it...the only way it could have been any better, would have been if I could have stayed another 2 weeks or 2 months!! The GM, Rod was very nice, and seems to really have the resort in top running condition. We did have to wait a little while for our room to be ready when we arrived, but it was worth the wait. The rooms are huge, and we were on ground floor in building 5, about 10 feet from the beach. The BBQ on the beach was awesome as well. The food was very good, every restaurant was great. The disco was nice and very fun. The people that work for Sunscape were great about getting people to join in the fun on the dance floor!!! They are such great dancers as well!!! The nightly entertainment shows were great as well....I would come back to stay at Sunscape in a heart beat. Actually wish that I didn't have to leave!!!!! It was just a wonderfully fabulous time!!!!!! Thanks again for everything..............if you are considering going to Punta Cana this is the place to stay!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>amazing I feel that this hotel is wonderful. My family and I havve been to the D.r four times now. we have stayed at the Sunscape twice. The beach is beautiful, white sand, clean water and a nice loong strip to walk or run. the water is also an excellent temp. nice and refreshing. there is a countless amunt of things you can do during the day. You can use the beautiful huge pool, with the very nice swim up bbar, particapte in the games may it be beach volley ball, soccer, aerobics, or other games the animation team has plannedd for that day. go shopping in the very tiny shop directly beside the hotel. or just lay in the sun. The animation team is wonderful putting on excellent shows at night that gets the croowd invovled as well as planning games and activities for the day. You always get asked to play but never forced. The food is the best I have tasted while staying in the D.R they have three very god resturants, windows the buffet excellent a little different every day, the tex mex or american grill which has excellent very hot wings and the best ribs I have ever tasted. The Italian restuarant was good not my favorite but thats just a personal thing. The hotel is very clean, while we where there (Jan 2-7 2003) the hotel won the award for cleanest hotel in the Punta Cana. the room are the standard hotel room, but the maid always add a special touch may it be fressh flowers, choclate, etc. The one thing i really enjoyed this year was the casion it was free to play, and you won pretend money to by things at the auction they had and youo could win things like rum, t-shirts and hats. I really enjoyed my stay here both years and would highly reccommened it to any one,looking forward to going back next year. If you havee any questions e-mail me. Diane
