<Content>Pleasant and Comfortable We stayed for a weekend break to celebrate our 40th immediately after Christmas and returning before the New Year 2008.The Hotel room was very pleasant and comfortable and were glad of the heat in the room after a day outside. Staff were very helpful and polite.Trams 1, 2,  5 stopped at Spui and the Hotel was forward and around the corner and 5 to 600 yards down the road to an inset entrance identified by red carpet steps. I think they need a large illuminated sign outside so that it can be seen from the corner.I don't know if it's a NH Hotel thing but breakfasts were very expensive especially with the GBP value falling against the Euro. E18 per person for what I would consider a 2 star presentation.A BIG thank you for the person who wrote about the Broodje Bert, lunch cafe just up the street who do a large breakfast for 7 Euros, too much for one person, double fired egg, rashers of bacon with side salad on large white or brown bread with coffee and fresh orange drink. Mind you it was cold and you kept your coats on and had to eat it quickly against the minus deg temps. Our second visit we shared one large breakfast, very adequate with very nice helpful people. Next visit must be in Summer with B/B included.

<Content>Very good, very central, very reasonable rates. My husband and I stayed in this hotel for three nights - end of October, beginning of November this year. We travelled by train from the airport, then were able to walk to the hotel, using a map, in about 15 minutes. Our room was of a good size and was pleasantly furnished, and warm. ( The weather was pretty cold outside!) We faced the inner courtyard, so had no views to speak of, but that was not a concern to us. There was tea and coffee making facilities in the room, which was good, and towels etc were plentiful and of good quality. You could even request special pillows, if you wanted, which was an unusual facility. The bed was comfortable, although our double was two singles pushed together. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, as it seemed rather pricey. Instead we found a nearby cafe, Broodje Bert, (behind hotel, facing the canal), which served a great breakfast for seven euros. The Spuistraat, the street the hotel is on, has very many eating and drinking places along it, so there is no need to travel far if tired after a hard day's sightseeing! There is even a coffee bar on the street, towards the station end, that serves delicious hash brownie cakes! (Abraxas). Would go back anytime - loved the whole experience!

<Content>toned down I posted a review of this hotel in May, having stayed for one night for business. I recently stayed again for a holiday with my girlfriend, and just wanted to slightly tone down the 5 star award I gave NH City Centre back in May, which I might have been a bit hasty in awarding due to the fact that I was upgraded for free to a suite on that occasion. This time, we stayed in a normal room, which was still very nice, but not quite the exceptional experience I had back then. The room was of a decent size, with a smallish, but very well maintained bathroom. It didn't have the outstanding view of the Singel canal I'd enjoyed on my previous visit, but that's only to be expected I suppose. Just to address something in a previous review, we didn't have any problems with water going everywhere from the shower, in fact I thought the shower was one of the best things about the room. Staying here isn't cheap though, but then that's Amsterdam for you, it's quite an expensive city to visit in general. Overall this stay was pleasant, and as ever the customer service was very good, but I think 4 star is a slightly more appropriate assessment than 5.

<Content>Advantages and Disadvantages Well, needless to say, I had a great time in amsterdam, but unlike most reviewers I'll tell you about the hotel - not my weekend because thats what I always want to know when searching for hotels. I find it very difficult choosing hotels and spend hours looking for the right one wherever I visit in the world (and I've been to over 40 countries)I believe that the following review will tell you exactly what to expect at the hotel and it is fairAdvantages:1. Central Location:The location couldn't be better. All the sights are nearby, coffeeshops, wax museum, anne frank house, bars and restaurants etc.2. Rooms are clean with an average tiled bathroom and a wooden floor in the bedroom area which is spacious. In no way is it the most stylish room that you've ever seen, but its comfortable.3. Smoking rooms ARE available (it took me ages to find this out about hotels in amsterdam). Most hotels do not have any smoking rooms and are entirely smoke-free4. TV channels are good. BBC1 and BBC2 are available at no extra cost. Pay TV is also available. 5. Reception and staff are very friendly and very helpful. Customer service is great in amsterdam anyway, spoken english is perfect and the dutch are very friendly everywhere.6. Suitcases and bags can be left at reception for no extra cost7. Check in is at 3pm however we found that after 12 noon, you can return to the reception desk and ask if the room is ready. You will be checked-in promptly.8. Check out time on a sunday only is 5pm! Pretty good if your trip ends on a sunday and you have a late flight to catch9. There is a cafe (didn't use it though ... burgers and chips kinda food)Disadavantages:1. The breakfast is expensive - its 17 euro each and is not included in the room price unless specifically asked for and I found that the breakfast is actually 22 euro each if booked as part of the room price. Eat out instead - O'Reillys Irish bar nearby does a cracking hot breakfast for 10 euro or one of the many cafe's also nearby sell coffee for 2 euro and a pastry for the same.2. Internet charges are amazingly expensive!! Yeah there is WIFI but you have to pay for it. 17 euro for 24 hours or 10 euro for an hour. Download speed is poor anyway 251 kbps and upload speed is 250 kbps so watching your favorite youtube videos or a streamed movie (to beat the pay tv) is out of the question. Again, go to o'reillys bar which is nearby the hotel, WIFI is free. Ask the staff for the username and password. You will get 1 hour free, then buy another drink and get another free hour if you like.3. The bathroom shower is nice, but it is over the bath tub with a small shower screen. Prepare to mop up the water from the floor after having a shower with a nominated towel of your choice. The water gets everywhere.4. The minbar has two bottles of water - still and sparkling at 2.50 euro each. Buy stuff in the supermarket and use the mini bar fridge iinstead.5. There is tea/coffee making in the room, but not much selection.6. There is no air conditioning. In november why would you need it? Well it would be good to have it as a heater. The room has central heating only and is controlled by the hotel. So at night it can be pretty cold.7. And finally my number one pet hate about hotels in europe - Two single beds pushed together to make a double! In some hotels the base of the bed is a double with two single matresses. Not here - its actually two singles pushed together and if there is any action (say no more) on the bed, a chasm will appear when the two beds move apart - quiet funny in the situation, but very uncomfortable to sleep over if you and your loved one like to cuddle at night. You both end up on one single because who's going to sleep over the middle bit :(Hope this helps....

<Content>Great Weekend!!! Selected this hotel after making a research for a Hotel located close to everything. Well, I could not have picked a nicer place. Great service and close I mean close to everything. Walking distance from many restaurants and tourist attractions. One street away from the trolley, close enough to get on that way of transportation but with out the noice.Fabulous bathroom products.

<Content>Fine location - very clean rooms - The location is excellent. Very central. There are caf茅s and bookstores just outside the hotel doors. If you are looking to explore the centre of Amsterdam, then this is an excellent location. You even have a number of trams passing just outside the hotel (apox 150 meters away).- There is another NH Hotel with a very similar sounding name - NH Center (I think). This should not be confused with the NH City Center. I initially went to the wrong one because the tram I was on (No. 1) was passing the other one. It's only a short walk to the other branch, but if you are with lots of bags or it is raining, it is not much fun. So best thing is to go by address - not hotel name. In fact Amsterdam is littered with NH hotels!- The rooms are really very clean, albeit a but small. However, I was on the 5th floor and had an excellent view over the roof-tops of the city. - Unlike the bedroom, the corridors are really somewhat sleepy. The carpets are worn-out, for example. However, if this does not bother you, then the nice rooms make up for the tired hallways.- The front desk was friendly and receptive. - There is no iron  board in the bedrooms. Instead, you have to use an ironing room on the 3rd floor. Would have preferred something in my room - but can not complain too much, since the ironing room was easy to access. As others have said, this is a large somewhat impersonal hotel, so you miss out on the charm of a smaller (or more exclusive) place. However, if your wish is to explore the city as opposed to spend it in the room, then this place is nice - and best of all, the rooms are clean.

<Content>Price and Quality are not equal I used to go to Amsterdam several times a year, but it was a business trip this time and this hotel has booked by a travel agent. It is not that quality what I expected. I have got the smallest room in the whole building. Price was more than a hundred euros and expected to have a bigger room. Room has a bed and a desk. When I put my lagguage into the room, nobody else could come in and I was not able to move. I complained at the reception desk and finally I got one of the biggest room in the hotel. That was much better, but still the quality is not good for the price. I really disappointed in this hotel. Only the location was really good as it is in the city center. I think I'll use my preferred hotels next time (Novotel).

<Content>Tiny dark rooms, sky high price The city was booked out for a conference so I was ill disposed to the hotel by the outrageous price they were charging. It's the most expensive room I've ever stayed in. People at checkout were gobsmacked by the double rate. To make matters worse the room was absolutely tiny - I know others were bigger - the window wouldn't open and the window looked out onto a little light well.. i.e straight onto a wall. My colleague joked a good room to commit suicide in. The lighting was poor. Very darkAdd to that the officious behaviour at breakfast (NOT INCLUDED) as two women chased guests and harangued them making them sign as they ate.. not a place I'd recommend.

<Content>Bad service The hotel is stylish and recently renovated, and location is good. However service is really not good. For example: - i asked for an umbrella and was treated by the concierge as a thief. He repeated 3 times there is strong wind, i don't recommend it (please note - no wind at all!), and when i insisted, he made me sign a form and emphasized the fact that it was EUR10 if i lost it (something which was already written on the form i had to sign!) - internet (EUR 22 per day!!!) did not work in my room, and when i asked for it to be fixed the reception said they were going to send a technician but did nothing at all - i left laudry in the bag close to the entrance, but it was not picked up by the maidApart from bad service, and despite its 5 stars, hotel is a bit cheap on details (call them details...) i.e.: - mattress is uncomfortable, too soft in the middle - probably old despite renovation, and sheets are rough - toilet paper is the cheapest quality you can imagine, really rough  uncomfortablewhat a pity alltogether...

<Content>Newly fitted room, expensive breakfast It鈥檚 a big hotel in the middle of the city. Quite old even if the room and bathroom are newly fitted.Nice selection beauty products and it鈥檚 possible to choose the most comfortable pillow.It鈥檚 quite an anonymous, therefore, if you鈥檙e looking to something with a traditional Dutch atmosphere it鈥檚 not the hotel for you.Breakfast is incredibly expensive and it鈥檚 better to go to one of the bakeries or cafes鈥?around.The restaurant in front of the hotel is amazing!

<Content>Turned out great! We were supposed to be in New York to celebrate my partner's birthday but due to passport problems at the 11th hour reluctantly cancelled and took a few days in Amsterdam instead. As we were supposed to be basking in NY luxury, and although it was a quick last minute booking, my heart sank when given our room as it was very small, stuffy and quite scruffy. HOWEVER, when I voiced my disappointment and told the lady at reception of our story, she positively zoomed into action and upgraded us to a fantastic room with a view over the rooftops of Amsterdam-it couldn't have been better-spacious, comfortable,airy and sparkling clean! It also had a mini bar/fridge which I needed for my soya milk-the other room didn't. Our stay was transformed from a disappointing one to a splendid one...thank you!The location was great-everything was in walking distance....even the museums which are at the other side are still within easy walking distance-nothing is more than half an hour's walk away.All in all, my first visit to Amsterdam was a fantastic one and this was helped by the great service and care at the hotel.

<Content>small and hot rooms After a long tour of Germany Poland and Holland me and my girlfriend decided to spend a couple of days unwinding in Amsterdam. Whilst we have stayed in all sort of hotels at both ends of the spectrum this hotel unfortunately did not match up to its price tag. The room was unbelievably small literally if you have a big case dont expect to see the floor and in July it was stifellingly hot with no air conditioning on the 5th floor of the hotel sleep is very difficult to have. The staff were very helpful and friendly and did provide us with a fan but this only circulated the hot air. When we enquired about a room with air conditioning we were told that none of the rooms had it even though its says they do on the internet ???

<Content>Modern hotel, good location NH City Centre Amsterdam is a modern business style hotel.BOOKING AND CHECK INBooking online was simple via the hotel's website and a confirmation email received. Check in was quick and polite (though it was late on a Thursday night). Reception staff spoke perfect English (as does everyone in Amsterdam). Don't be confused with NH Hotel Amsterdam Centre - a different hotel. The photos on the website are accurate.ROOM AND BATHROOMWe booked a superior room @ 140 euro per night room only. It was reasonably spacious - approx 20 feet x 15 feet. I requested a top floor room online as I thought there might be traffic noise and received one. No traffic noise and great view across rooftops and the canal. 3 large windows letting in plenty of light, but with thick curtains and blinds to block out early morning sun. Modern minimalist decor in whites/creams/browns, white duvet cover. Large bed, at least a queen size. Tea and coffee tray. Fake wood floors. TV which worked fine. Phone which we didn't use. We didn't attempt any wi-fi/internet. Room service available but we didn't use it. In room electronic safe which worked fine. Range of lighting including reading lights on each side of the bed. Daytime temperature was around 18-19 celsius during our trip and the room was comfortable - I didn't notice it being either too hot or cold and can't recall using the air-con controls as a result.Reasonable size bathroom but not huge - approx 9 feet x 10 feet. Excellent shower. Very clean. Good hairdryer. Good selection of toiletries in NH's own range - inc shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush sets, shoe polisher, mini body sponge/scrubber, soaps, shower cap. Nice soft white towels - not super luxury ones but similar to ones I would use at home. No bathrobe/slippers. OTHER SERVICES No iron and ironing board in the room, but ironing room on 3rd floor. Vending machines for soft drinks and sweets/crisps on each floor.Lifts worked well, never waited long.On Sundays there is a FREE 5 PM CHECKOUT! You just need to advise the day before that you wish to stay.LOCATIONFantastic and lovely area for wandering all round the Centre, cafes, bars, and the shopping area of Leidesplein. 1 minute walk to the tram stop, which takes you direct to Central Station (1.60 euro single, pay on board). Otherwise approx 8 euro taxi to Central Station. At least a 30min walk to Central Station.OVERALLIf you want a good quality, clean, mid-range, modern, chain-type hotel that does what it says on the box with no problems, this is a good 3.5 star choice. If you want luxury, budget, or unique/characterful, I would look elsewhere.RECOMMENDED, WILL STAY HERE AGAIN.

<Content>Not a great value--by a long shot NH is an ambitious chain, with a bit of a trendy positioning and a generally high standard of standardised cleanliness. But there were some major off notes. Like the sign at the front desk advertising room upgrades for EUR 25. Normally, at any pleasant hotel, if there are excess rooms available, one can ask for and usually get a room upgrade for EUR 0. And while I wanted to get an upgrade after entering my EUR 155 single room, a room with a bathroom that took up 40% of the floor space, the thought of parting with extra Euros was even more offputting than that of staying in such an aggressively small space.The breakfast, which mercifully was included, was competent--having some non-pork protein options. Oh, the hotel also unblocked a group reservation we had made when we were unwilling to guarantee an excessively large group of rooms, resulting in major inconvenience for an event I was organising.In a city where rooms are as pricey as Amsterdam, the extreme commercial aggressiveness of the NH makes it tough to recommend. So I won't.

<Content>Quaint Hotel I chose the hotel based on trip advisor and expedia reviews. You never really know what to expect until you get there. Since I have had the pleasure of staying in 5 star hotels around the globe, I have some pretty high expectations for hotels. Surprisingly, this hotel was quite quaint and a perfect location to walk to the coffee shops, get to the square, nice shopping area and best of all the best restaurants the city had to offer all within walking distance. The rooms are quite small (my hotel in Tokyo was much bigger) but since we hardly stayed in the room it was fine (albeit our huge luggage took up much of the space). Our view of the canal and the city was fantastic with a great sunset view. We never ate at the hotel so we cannot comment but this hotel was well worth the price. We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic location! I have been there 5 times, it is a very nice and clean hotel in a terrific position. Avoid to have breakfast there is it not very good, I would suggest you to go to the little bakery shop on the same street.

<Content>Nice Hotel We arrived very late at the hotel, part of a Trafalgar Tour so didn鈥檛 have time to take photos, sorry. The room was basic and we had twin beds (mother and daughter traveling together) which were really comfortable. The room had a safe, mini bar and flat screen tv but no airconditioning or alarm clock. The bathroom was reasonably sized with the shower over a very high bath. There were loads of restaurants around the hotel with a lovely caf茅 behind the hotel named Berts and many cafes on the same street as the hotel. Breakfast was wonderful with lots of cheeses and meats available. Sorry this review is short but we did only have a one night stay.

<Content>Hotel Review Nice 3 Star Hotel. Rooms were good size and everything was clean and well kept. Breakfast was good with a good selection of options. The location was excellent - very central. Broadband access in the room was extortionately priced at 鈧?2 for a day. When are hotels going to realise that this should be free - it doesn't cost a huge amount for them to put in place a wireless router that covers the whole building so the marginal cost of providing access for guests is minimal.I still find it very hard to get used to the fact that people smoke in the bar and in the halls. The Netherlands needs to put in place the same bans on smoking in the workplace that exist throughout many European countries. The absence of the smoking ban would stop me returning there on a personal trip (business this time).

<Content>Great Hotel The NH is an excellent hotel.The staff were always very friendly and efficient. When my wife and I arrived quite late at night we asked for a room looking out over the Singel canal and this was arranged for us instantly.The room was very quiet and toasty warm during some very cold snowy weather.The hotel is within easy walking distance of most attractions and there's a tram stop 2 mins walk from the hotel entrance.There's an amazing selection of eating places nearby and fabulously historic pubs (no food or big screen TV's) such as Gollem, Hoppe and two of our favourites Het Dokterje and In De Wildeman, all within easy staggering distance.One small quibble is the breakfast which costs 18 Euro per day ,that's 36 Euro for a couple!!! An easy solution is to pop round to Bert's cafe just round the corner by the canal where a lovely breakfast can be obtained for a fraction of the hotel's price.Finally I must disagree with the 3 Irish sisters' comments about Amsterdam. It's a fabulous city, far safer than most Irish cities, there's LOADS to see and do and the locals are amazingly tolerant,honest and friendly.This was our second trip and we will definitely be back again.

<Content>Great Hotel Girlie weekend for 3 sisters and the hotel was beautiful. We did not take breakfast in the hotel as we preferred to try some of the local cafes. The room was v spacious - triple superior room - which had three single beds (no fold up bed) which were the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in any hotel before. Tea/coffee making facilities in room, sponge, brush, comb, loofah, shampoo, etc. etc. in bathroom. Lovely big white fluffy towels. All in all I would certainly recommend the hotel to anybody for a weekend in Amsterdam. Apples and hard boiled sweets on the counter to take when we arrived and the mornning we left (Easter Sunday) there were mini eggs for customers. A nice little touch I thought.Staff were extremely friendly as were most of the Dutch people we encountered during our weekend. We took the canal trip around the city while there which was nice. Clothes shopping not bad either - MS, CA, Vera Moda, etc. etc. Weather was terribly cold and snowed quite a bit while we were there. However I was certainly not taken with the city itself. I feel I have been there, done that, but certainly will not return. I found it very sleazy and really little to offer tourists other than a trip to the Red Light District and a smoke in one of the coffee shops if that's your thing. Good girlie weekend but won't be back!!!!

<Content>Good hotel for a short stay Just back from a great four night stay in Amsterdam. Had a double room with breakfast from otel.com for 拢90 a night. Small room but clean and perfectly adequate.Rooms are allocated on arrival so make sure you ask for a room with a canal view. We had to forgo a no smoking room to get this but it was well worth it and the room was fine, not smoky at all and at no extra cost. Breakfast was good.The great thing about this hotel is the position. You could walk to most places easily, or get the tram from the next street across. There were plenty of good bars and restaurants around but it was not noisy. Don't miss the little bar called Gollem in the alley just round the corner. Great atmosphere and an amazing selection of beers.

<Content>Unexpectedly great! My fiance and I just returned from a 4 night visit to Amsterdam. We stayed at the NH City Centre, which was booked in conjunction with airfare in a package from covacations.com. We liked the location. A little alleyway over were the tram stops, which, once we figured out how to take them, was very convenient. From the tram stop, it's only about two or three stops away from Leidsplein, a fun area with more restaurants and shops. The hotel is very close to the Spui Square, which had a few bars, coffeeshops, and restaurants nearby. The street the hotel itself is on has great restaurants: of note, an Indonesian restaurant across the street called Kantjil (definitely try the Rijstaftel) and a Dutch restaurant directly across the way (can't remember the name) that had delicious traditional Dutch food. In terms of things to do, Dam Square is about a 5 minute walk, with several shopping streets close as well. Magna Plaza is a nice shopping center to check out. When we travel, we love to check out the supermarket, so stop by an Albert Heijns store! The room itself was simply furnished with a modern color scheme. We had room 503 which was sort of awkwardly wedged in a corner, but the room itself was not cramped. There were tea making ammenities, a bottle each of still and sparkling water for purchase, along with a minifridge (no minibar in there for us though!). The bed was really comfortable. We never checked out their pillow menu but thought it interesting that it was an option. The bathroom was nice. My fiance's concern with hotels in Europe is that the shower stalls (or curtains) are claustrophobic, but we had no problem here. Their stall was basically just a glass partition from the toilet, with ample space to slip under the shower head. (We liked it so much that we were thinking to remodel our bathroom similarly!) They have their own line of colorful green and yellow toiletries (though I didn't really care for its fragrance), along with a comb, brush, loofah, sponge, and sewing kit. Their breakfast buffet was superb! There was a great assortment of rolls, cold cuts, cheeses, fruit and juices, yogurt, along with bacon and sausage, scrambled and hardboiled egg, tiny pancake bites, even apple pie and spanish tortilla! Sounds funny, but my favorite part of breakfast was their coffee machine. You put a little cup underneath, press the cafe au lait button, and it's the best coffee to start your morning!I think I've covered the basics, or rather the most important points. There is a computer for internet access in a corner of the lobby. You can ask the desk for a 15 minute complimentary voucher once for the duration of your stay. The staff is great and sincerely tries to make your stay pleasant. The hotel definitely made our stay excellent. We would not hesitate to book here again when we come back to Amsterdam.

<Content>Lovely hotel, friendly staff - out the way abit We were told that check in was 2pm, so when we arrived at 10am we never expected that the room would be ready. But it was. We got in the room and it was clean and comfy. We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, the staff were friendly. The amenties were great. The only thing is if you want to be in the buzz of amsterdam. You really need to stay near Dam Square. Its about a 25min walk to the square and when your walking round all day, the last thing you want to do is walk back to the hotel. There are trams though very frequently so if you dont mind hoping on a tram then there is no problem, just make sure you have change. Amsterdam is very expensive, so the hotel was too. The mini bar was full of lovely stuff...BUT STAY AWAY as it will probabley cost you as much as the room for a night!!

<Content>a fine place for a short stay I found only one problem in my two-night stay at this comfortable, centrally located hotel close to Amsterdam's famed Dam Square.The problem related to the two lifts (elevators) which are two too few for a hotel of this size. In other respects I couldn't fault the place. Nice room, nice toilietries, plenty of food and drink available at the breakfast buffet and the staff were polite and helpful. Apart from the breakfasts I didn't eat in the hotel but i can recommend the nearby restarants November and D'Vieff Vlieghen - these are a bit pricey, but great for a special meal.

<Content>A few misses, but otherwise fine RECOMMENDED. This is a fine choice despite my 3* ranking. I travel a great deal and faithfully write Tripadvisor reviews. The problems are all rather minor.This hotel is located on a relatively low quiet street with numerous restaurants  pubs. It's is 20 min walk from the main station and Trams 1, 2,  5 stop less than 1 block away with little waiting. The hotel is in a semi-tourist area with a nice mix. You're an easy walk to anything.Check-in was a tad slow. The property was well maintained. Likes most thirty Dutch, the use of low wattage lighting makes things rather dim. Rooms had wooden floors, which while nice, made the room a little cold. Bedding was excellent and bathroom very nicely done with plenty of hot water. Room to room noise was a problem, very thin walls and noise from the hallway also came into the room. Room size was quite large by normal Amsterdam standards.This is a great choice, I'm giving 3*, 4* in terms of value for money.

<Content>Great Hotel and Staff There are 2 NH Amsterdam hotels- one is CITY CENTER and we stayed at the one that is just NH Amsterdam Center next to the Marriot is the easiest way to explain it to cab drivers. It is within walking distance to a square with many restaurants and bars. We walked everywhere. Close to Red Light District. Canal cruises are 1 block away. The rooms at this hotel are newly decorated, very clean and accomodating. We upgraded to a deluxe room. All have stocked mini refridgerators at a cost, coffee and tea. Comfy beds and pillows. Breakfast is included with some room types and it is well worth it. Very nice. The lounge is modern and quaint. The staff is over the top! Great concierge to help you find the best restuarants. The people gernerally in AMS are very kind and polite. We found that everywhere. The bellman has a great sense of humor so did the bartender. It was wonderful. Wi Fi is available for a fee of between 17 and 22 EUR a day. The NH is 1/2 hour approx. from the airport , cab fare is about 40EUR. This hotel isnt huge which is nice but has ammenities of a large hotel. The staff were like friends at the end of our stay . Great for vacation and excellent for business and also business conferences.

<Content>Great Hotel First class hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was pretty good with a choice of a hot breakfast (sausage,bacon and egg, boiled or scrambled) or meats,cheeses, rolls and bread with gallons of fruit juice and yoghurts. Rooms cleaned daily and fresh towels provided daily. Bars and restraunts near by are also very good. A good break spoiled only by the high prices in town for drinks. 鈧? - 鈧?.5 for a large beer is nearly a %100 rise of 2 years ago. Something to do with a stupid mayor i was told. All in all this break was made a whole lot better with the location and the cleanliness of this very good hotel. Go stay and enjoy

<Content>Good choice for exploring the city I stayed here for a weekend when in Amsterdam for a wedding. The location of the hotel was excellent, it is really close to great boutique shops and cosy un-touristy restaurants. The hotel room we had was large, larger than some others at the same rate. In all cases they were clean, well serviced and had everything we needed. Trams stop right outside which go to the main train station - a better option than the 鈧? taxi I got. It is also only a minute from a busy shopping street. The staff were friendly and efficient. We didn't eat breakfast as it wasn't included in our rate, instead we checked out some of the cafes on the streets and canals behind the hotel which were great. I would happily stay here again if in Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice modern hotel. Found this a very modern and comfortable hotel. Within walking distance of Dam Square and all the other sites. We had buffet breakfast included in our stay and it was excellent. Plenty to eat and you could have as much as you wanted - orange juice was freshly squeezed. One negative point I would have is that there is no safety deposit box in the room but there is one available at hotel reception which was fine. Would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Should be rated 4-Star With a quiet location on Singel canal and its own boat dock, this hotel is centered about halfway between Central Station and Museumplein. The hotel itself is made up of 5 historical buildings put together and doesn鈥檛 look like much from the street. But the interior has an expansive and sleek lobby and a large restaurant where an excellent buffet breakfast is served. Spacious modern rooms were immaculate and had all the usual amenities. The hotel offers a 鈥減illow menu鈥?where you can request your favorite. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient during my 3-night stay. This hotel is rated 3-star, but I would consider it a 4-star hotel.

<Content>Central to everything About a 2km hike from the train station, although you can catch a tram instead once you know where the hotel is....this hotel is really pretty central to everything the tourist wants to see in Amsterdam. In a pretty nice area of town with good restaurants and bars and bakeries in adjacent buildings. Our room (and many I suppose) overlooked Singel canal. Room was pretty small and oddly shaped which didn't allow us to spread our gear out very much. Staff were helpful and obviously speak good english. Didn't try breakfast at 20 euro a head but it looked good.Overall, I'd stay here again.

<Content>The best hotel for the price We payed 399 Euros for 3 nights (thursday-sunday), we stayed on the third flr overlooking the canal (a must!!) The room was small but very clean and nice. Wonderful bed, clean and equiped bathroom. Great shower- hot water and pressure. We also had breakfast and it was amazing!! a big selection of food. We considered not paying for the brkfst but we would have ended up spending another 1-2 hrs every morning and eating less...The only thing that bothered me is that there was no free wifi, which I think a hotel should give. If you disagree or don't care then disregard...

<Content>Perfect location-very quiet We stayed here 4 nights. It is perfect located, near Spui Square. The room (number 29 ground floor) was perfect, very big like a suit, free coffe and tea (and green apples in the reception also!), a lot of chapmu, soap, etc in the bathroom, views to quiet street and channel. A bit of noise because of water pipes in the room. Unfortunately there were men working in the street at 8am monday. But we were changed to 5th floor without problem. Nice views of Amsterdam roofs. People in reception are very very nice, all speak english. You have 15 minutes of Internet for free every day. Breakfast was expensive (17 euros person) but we have breakfast in some bars near hotel (Bert bar for 7 euros, croassanterie near hotel) Very nice bar with hundred of beers in small street near hotel, and a typical restaurant just one step from hotel (5 flyes) but expensive for small dishes (45 euros per person, without wine)

<Content>Great location: not too far from the core, and not too rowdy. Great location: it's not too far from the action, yet far enough away so that it's not too rowdy.I'd recommend renting a bike to explore, if you can.The rooms are fairly modern and clean, but very tiny. The walls are particularily thin, you can hear everything. The walls tremble when the doors of other rooms are slammed shut. This happens by default, you need to be considerate to slow down the closing of doors.** The housekeeping staff are very inconsiderate and loud, shouting to each other at the top of their lungs across the hallway. Very inconsiderate for those of us that have our Do Not Disturb signs clearly visible. I have submitted a complaint letter to the management. This is reason enough to not stay here again.

<Content>Quiet location Nice hotel, good location close to the Singel Canal.A short walk to Dam Square and other popular areas.If you book a standard double room they are extremely small although you do get the option on check in to upgrade to a luxury room.Breakfast is excellent with plenty to choose from.Staff are friendly and helpful.The restaurant/bar did not open during the day and during our stay only opened on Friday  Saturday evening.There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance which offer a good menu choice

<Content>Great American-style property We stayed at the NH City Centre in July 2007 for one night enroute from Paris to Frankfurt as part of my mother's 50th birthday trip to Europe.We found it convenient to the train station (about a ten minute walk with our luggage), but in a much nicer area than that directly surrounding the station.The front desk staff were quite friendly and provided us with maps, suggestions for restaurants and shopping, and an offer of an upgraded room fairly inexpensively (as well as speaking nearly unaccented English) but we stuck with our standard room, as we were only there for one night, and ended up quite impressed. Rooms were extremely large for Europe and very North American style. Minibar was well stocked, we had bathrobes and slippers in the room, and everything was very clean and well-maintained.We also found it quite convenient for sightseeing and had no problems walking to Anne Frank House, the Rijksmuseum, or the markets.

<Content>Good location The NH City Centre Amsterdam is a nice hotel located between residential areas that include the Anne Frank House and Dam Square. If you want to sleep late, better not stay here. The vacuuming was pretty loud.

<Content>Great Spot - Very Clean Checked into this hotel on my last european adventure. We were only in Amsterdam for a couple of days so the price was ok for that. The hotel was easy to find - less than 5 minutes on the tram from the main train station. its a 10 minute walk to the main shopping strip, Red Light District , Anne Frank museum, etc. Also its a straight forward walk from the Bulldog (because if you're doing the bulldog - you'll need an easy trip home ;)The last night we stayed, we had some rowdy folks in the room next to us, but honestly can't fault the hotel for that - it could happen anywhere! Also recommend the shuttle to the airport - fair priced and pretty quick.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Very friendly staff, lovely room - we had a ball while staying there. there are also some lovely little cafes and resturants - in particular check out the Indonesian style one almost opposite the hotel - delicious lunches there and very cheap.

<Content>As expected from reading previous reviews... Take platform 3 for the train service from Schiphol to Centraal station (euros 3.6 - 拢2.50 one way) then get on any of tram numbers 1, 2 or 5. Get off at the Spui stop. Cost around Euro 1.6 - 拢1.10). Get on at the middle and pay the conductor. He/she will tell you when to get off. The hotel is just around the corner from the Spui tram stop. Pretty easy to find once you get your bearings. Stayed in a superior room which was worthwhile. Ground floor with canal view. Very comfy beds and I mean comfy. Longest curtains I鈥檝e ever come across. So big in fact I could have used them as a marquee. Friendly staff. Clean towels every day with a free to use security safe within the wardrobe. Locked luggage room for those late departures. Bar shuts at 12 but there are a couple of small and quaint bars around the hotel. Didn鈥檛 have breakfast, as it seemed expensive. Just as well as there is a nice little caf茅 around the corner called Berts, which does a nice little brekki special for 7euros - 拢4.90. Tea/Coffee, juice plus adequate bread, salad plus filling. Room had lots of TV channels (naturally in Dutch)- however there was BBC World  Eurosport plus Pay TV. Cyclists absolutely everywhere so beware as you walk. An excellent base for walkabouts in Amsterdam and just a few minutes walk from Dam Square (one of the main landmarks of the city).

<Content>Enormous Family Room We stayed here for 2 nights in July and were delighted to have an enourmous family room with a kingsize bed for us and two separate singles for our children. The room had lots of furniture - too many little tables, a tv with 30+ channels including BBC 1  2 and lots of storage. There was tea and coffee in the room too. The windows were full length and the floor was laminate. The bathroom was good and there were lots of free products, not just the normal shampoo and shower gel but a comb, brush, a couple of sponges and body scubs etc all wrapped up individually.The reception staff were friendly and helpful and we made the most of the free sweets and apples.Breakfast was included in our stay and the range was super, we made up rolls and took wrapped gingerbread, biscuits and fruit with us for later. The staff were aware of this and still chatted happily to our 7 yo daughter.The location is good and we could walk every where we wanted to even with the kids.We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel for short stay The NH city centre is in a convenient location in between the Dam Square and the Flower Market. The street itself is a bit quiet as you are away from the main touristy area, but there were a few restaurants and coffeeshops close by. We had lunch at Cafe Luxemburg which is just down the street and they have very nice food at reasonable prices. There is also a croissanterie just a couple of metres away that had some delicious pastries - good option for breakfast if you want something quick and tasty. Additionally, one side of the hotel faces the canal which is not only nice for a walk, but also convenient if you want to take a hop on/off canal cruise as there is a dock right near the hotel entrance. Very easy access to trams as well - only about 15min to Centraal Station.Our standard room was on the small side but clean. The bathroom is pretty tiny but perfectly functional. We found staff to be helpful, friendly and well informed about the city and its attractions. Nothing particularly remarkable about this hotel in either positives or negatives, but is good for a short stay in Amsterdam. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a convenient base to explore the city but not particularly fussy about the overall hotel experience

<Content>Great Location I have just spent this weekend (20th-22nd July) at the NH Hotel on Amsterdam's Spuistraat and was generally pleased with my experiences there. I'll start with the good. The spotlessly clean standard double was a good size with attractive, modern decor. For once a room that really does look like the ones on the website! The location was superb; at the right end of Spuistraat, a short walk to some of the city's top restaurants and bars (Envy, Vijff Vlieghen, Cafe Brix) and most beautiful canals (Singel, Herrengracht), a brisk 10-minute walk to the central station and near to a tram stop headed the same way. The reception staff were exceptionally polite and friendly. Now for the not so good: any noise from the corridor was very audible from inside the rooms and one morning we could hear housekeeping vacuuming a neighbouring room. The room was also rather stuffy and this was a lower than average temperature for July. I couldn't say the shower was weak, but it would hardly blast any dirt off you. I consider these things minor for a weekend break and would recommend this hotel to people and stay there again myself, except in the height of summer...

<Content>Wow! Very Happy to Have Found This Place! I had resigned myself to the notion that the only reasonably-priced hotels in a central part of Amsterdam are mouse-infested [--]. Read enough reviews here on TA and you'll think so, too. But this was before I found the NH Hotel City Centre. At around 170 USD a night, it isn't exactly cheap, but what you get for the money is quite good by Amsterdam standards. I've paid a similar amount for much less (see my review of the Hotel Nes here on TA).First off, the building itself is huge...Again, by Amsterdam standards. It's as if someone plunked-down a 'big city hotel' into the middle of Amsterdam's usual narrow/labarynthine walkup buildings, though you wouldn't really know it from the outside. A large lobby, a restaurant (which I never tried...17 Euros for breakfast is just too much to pay, especially considering that I found a caf茅 right next door that has a perfect breakfast 7 days a week for about 10 Euros.), a similarly-massive lounge, and two full-size elevators (again...rare for central Amsterdam hotels). The location is excellent: A five minute walk to Dam Square, and about a twenty minute walk to either the train station or, in the other direction, the Leidseplein. The Spui tram stop is about 50 yards away from the front of the hotel, just around the corner from a (great) bookstore across the street. There is pay internet in the lobby (forgot the price), or for 10 Euros, you can purchase a password for 60 minutes of wifi (non-continuous over 24 hours, which is kind of handy). The staff I encountered were very friendly and efficient. My room was in the rear of the building, with a canal view (!) Rooms at the front will look out onto Spuistraat, which is full of pedestrian traffic day and night. Quiet and comfortable, a good bed, TV with Dutch channels and BBC. The bathroom was actually better-appointed than more expensive hotels I've stayed at, with quality soaps and such from some Spanish company whose name I forgot. As I'm a guy, I didn't delve too far into it : ) No individual air conditioning per room, but not once was I uncomfortable...Although it was kind of chilly and rainy, even in late June. Smartly, my smoking room had hardwood floors, which, I suppose, cuts down on lingering smoke oddor significantly.I was really pleased to find this place, and would wholeheartedly recommend it. It will be my first call hotel in Amsterdam from now on.

<Content>Good hotel, great location The best thing about this hotel was the location - a short walk left out of the hotel to a square with several bars/restaurants and then 10 mins on from there to Liedesplein. Turn right out of the hotel and you're a couple of minutes from the main shopping street and beyond that on to Dam Square and the RLD. Hotel itself is perfectly good - everything is clean and as you would expect. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.A couple of negatives but nothing that would particularly stop me from returning:Check in/out times were quite long (although they did seem extremely busy).I was part of a group of 14 (7 rooms) and we all managed to get rooms overlooking the central 'courtyard' (well glass roof above a seating area) which was good for waving at each other but not great views. There is a canal at the back of the hotel so getting a room overlooking that would make your stay.The room sizes varied dramtically considering that they were all the same price. Some were absolutley massive but I, unfortunatley, got saddled with the one which didn't have enough room to swing a cat! Didn't ask to be moved though (and I get the impression that they would have accommodated me) so it's my own fault!Overall a good hotel in a great location. Nothing out of the ordinary but would stay again.

<Content>loved our room Great location and we had a large room for the 3 of us overlooking canal, so we had a great one week here. The breakfast was really good, but we only ate here a couple times. We went to Croissants nearby for delicous bakery items. Everything worked out pretty well. We did hear people pass by late at night or I should say early in the morning, but that is expected.

<Content>Good location This is an ok hotel in a good location. Dam Square, Leidesplein, RLD and Jordaan areas are all in walking distance from the hotel.Painfully long check in and even worse check out. The first room they gave us was tiny and the bathroom had no bath so I asked to be moved. They did move us to a bigger room next day but as we were there just 3 days not being able to unpack made it feel a bit as if we'd lost a night . There is a good Turkish ( I think ) coffee/sandwich bar just down the canal from the hotel reasonably priced. The train into Centraal from Schipol is fast and efficient and around 8 euros for 2. Taxi to the hotel was 15 euros. I wouldn't stay here again I much preferred the NH Amsterdam Center near the Leidesplein.

<Content>Over-booked Arrived to find that there was no room available for us, although they must have received the pre-paid booking otherwise they would not have moved us to another hotel in the NH chain. They appear to operate a policy of over-booking and then move people to less popular hotels when they arrive in the city.

<Content>Good times, good location Booked through booking.com. This place was a bit pricey but it was last minute. It ended up being a pretty good location once we got our bearings. You can walk from the train station if you arent lugging too much stuff since its about 10-12 min walk. Its right next to many different restaurants and bars. It was a really busy time during my visit and it would get loud at times on the streets. You know how dudes are that like to gather and sing songs together. Weirdness. There are two entrances one on Spuistraat and one on Singel. We rented bikes and locked them up over night on the back side of the hotel (Singel) that overlooked the canal. There is a bakery just a few steps from the hotel the smelled soooo good (never got a chance to eat there) and would be nice for breakfast. The hotel does have a 16 (EUR) per person breakfast buffet and although I was turned off by the price it is a good deal if you can eat a lot. They had a huge variety and it all looked good. Now im a sucker for free stuff and they really hook you up when it comes to shampoo and loofas and a brush and body wash and... some shoe ... polish. So all in all it was a great stay.

<Content>Another great stay at the NH City Centre Hotel Stayed at the NH City Centre hotel from the 27th April - 1st May 07. Also stayed there last year 9th -12th Nov 06. Had a great stay in Nov 06, hence why I went back there again this year and had an equally good stay this year.Went to Amsterdam for Queens Day this year which was excellent fun, so the hotel and the whole of Amsterdam was extremely busy because of these celebrations but this did not effect the level of service at this hotel. Stayed in room 357 this year, the room was spacious, clean and of good condition, the view wasn't too great but the room is situated at the end of hotel building between the main street  the canal so it was perfect on this occasion as I requested a room away from the from street  the canal to avoid be disturbed by the partying that would be going throughout the weekend for Queens day and sure enough, we weren't disturbed so it was fine of this occasion to sacrifice a view for peace  quiet instead. Last year stayed in Rm 352 which faces the main street, this room was more spacious than 357 and of course had the view of Spuistraat St which was lovely. Both rooms were of good condition with tea/coffee making facilities, clean and had a modern style.Didn't have breakfast in the hotel during this stay but did try it last year when I was feeling lazy on my last morning so couldn't be bothered to go out for Breakfast, plus the bakers was closed (on Sundays). The breakfast is expensive but it was enjoyable and there are plenty of hot/cold choices to suit all tastes  preferences. However, I would recommend that you go to the local bakery called Croissants which is about 25 yards to the left of the front of the hotel. They serve very tasty, pastries, crossiants, pizza style rolls  pastries, freshly made rolls  yogurt drinks, excellent value for money and very yummy. Usually go buy my breakfast there and go back up to the hotel to have a coffee  eat my breakfast in the room before going out for the day.As all the reviews state this hotel is situated is such an ideal location, it's close to all the attractions but not too close to be effected by the noise of the crowds etc. The hotel is a modern contempary hotel, with very efficient, professional, helpful staff. The rooms are of good condition and are generally quite spacious, however I have seen that they do have some smaller double rooms so do request a bigger room, if required. You can ask for as much tea/coffee etc as you want, just go to reception and ask for more when your run out.Would always recommend this hotel to anyone going to Amsterdam and I would definitely stay there again on my next visit which will hopefully be real soon.P.S - Very nice restaurant to the left of the front of the hotel about 50 yards called Novembers - have eaten there twice, both times food  service was excellent and excellent value for money, not expensive. The restaurant is very beautiful inside and has a great atmosphere, do check it out

<Content>Not Impressed I stayed at the NH City Centre for one week in April 2007. We were able to obtain a good rate through a corporate discount. I requested a queen room, but was given a twin. Additionally, my non-smoking room smelled of smoke. I complained and housekeeping came up with a can of odor neutralizer. This didn't really help the problem. I asked for an iron --I was told they didn't have them. My colleagues in other rooms had irons. I asked to use the internet --I was told it was broken. The rooms are alright, but have tiny bathrooms. The location is actually pretty nice, with a lot of restaurants within walking distance.

<Content>Loud but lovely The rooms are very nice. Very modern spacious and comfortable.We were extremely excited about the ice maker after being in Europe for 8 days and as we all know ice is scarce. The desk clerks were very helpful and familiar with the area. This hotel is centrally located. 3 blocks from the flower market and 10 minutes from Central station and Anne Frank house by foot. Everything you could possibly want to due or see is with in at most a 15 min walk in every direction. The only down fall is the interior rooms echo noise up from the center courtyard which has people in it constantly all night. The exterior room that our friends had were much better.

<Content>Recommended Stayed here over Easter and found it a very good experience with the only down side being a very small room and could not change the room as hotel was full, well worth emailing the hotel a couple of days before asking for a particular room. We were on the 1st floor with the window facing on the main road which was a little bit noisy throughout the night but acceptable.Breakfast was included in our rate and was all you could ask for hot and cold buffet, some people were even making up rolls to take out for the day and no one complained.Can recommend the HaesJe Claes restaurant directly across from the hotel A1 Dutch food, try the Stampot. Also Humphrey鈥檚 restaurant just off Nieuwe zijds street (one street across from the hotel) towards the station end, full address 23 Nieuwe zijds kolk. Open 17:00 to 22:00, great set three course menu that changes each month.We caught the train from the airport only 鈧?.60 for a single and only 20 minutes to Amsterdam central station then 10 minute walk to hotel. The trains run every 15 minutes from platform 13A and you can get your ticket the day before you depart as well.You can also catch a train to visit the gardens of Keukenhof with their flower displays. You need to catch the number 54 bus once you arrive at Lieden station and the bus ticket, 鈧?8, includes entry to the gardens.Hotel was excellent value and perfect location.

<Content>Perfect for a weekend break! We spent three days and two nights at the hotel from the 5th April until the 7th. We decided to use the Connexion Shuttle from the airport, a quick easy way to get straight to the hotel. We arrived at about noon a room was ready but as it didnt have a view. We asked to be moved to a room with a canal view. No problem, we just had to wait until 3pm. We walked to Dam Square (10 minutes slow walk) had a light lunch and wandered back buying a few presents en route. Checked into our room small, but perect view of the Singel Canal, room was clean and had everything we needed.We opted for the buffet breakfast-not cheap @ 17 euros but worth every cent as we didnt bother with lunch.Hotel in walking distance to the Rijk and Van Gogh museums and Hard Rock Cafe(about 20 mins) . Ten minutes from the Anne Frank House- a must for everyone- I would advise you to read the book before you go if you havent already. Allow 45 minutes queuing time it was the busiest attraction in Amsterdam by far. We bought a day pass on the canal bus and received slightly discounted tickets to the Van Gogh museum. The boat bus pass lasts for a day plus carries over until noon the following day. They have a great free map of Amsterdam behind reception. I used the internet once I wasnt asked my room number so I am sure I could have used it on an other days if I had wanted to.We opted to eat at the November restaurant on Friday night which had a set menu with quality food, with a good choice and very friendly, efficient staff.We made use of the little discount cards we found in the reception area for some of the attractions, including the Dungeons which was not cheap but a fun experience. All the staff in the hotel were friendly especially the barman who created a lovely cocktail for me!I would definitely stay in the hotel again if I went back to Amsterdam as it is in a wonderful, safe, and quiet position., yet only a few minutes walk from anywhere!

<Content>What a location for a hotel Counties Kerry  Waterford Ireland  Fantastic Experience Six of us spent three nights at the NH.City Centre,we read the reviews and they were right. A clean and friendly hotel ,located inthe center of Amsterdam. The breakfast was excellent, the staff spoke clear English. A word of warning when you step outside the hotel watch out for bicyles they have the right of way and donot stop for anyone. Also if there is at least six of you inthe group book a mini-bus taxi to the airport it costs sixty euros, the staff at the hotel will obligue. The bar inthe hotel is very lively and again staff very polite and friendly. We had the largest room of the group the other rooms were small. So if you need some space then let the staff know you require room to breathe. We all had a fabulous stay at the NH City Center and would recommend it to those who wish to see all the sights and delights that Amsterdam has to offer.

<Content>nice hotel in the center of amsterdam this is a nice hotel in the center of amsterdam - i booked it through travelocity and got a good deal - it is located on spuistraat next to the singel canal and about a 5 minute walk from the dam square - one block over the the new zijds ... street where you can catch a tram to the central station or to go to the museums and the leidspleinthe breakfast is very good with croissants, bread, rolls, sweet rools, bacon, sausage links, eggs, cereal, juice, fruit, and coffee - it's a tad expensive at 17 euros per person but you get enough to eat that you don't need to eat lunchthe room is clean, but the bathroom doe snot have plugs for american style razorsthe hotel does offer 15 minutes of complimentary internet service - the official answer is once per stay, but they will let you do it once per day if they don;t run out of the complimentary vouchers - this is conveneint for checking emaili would recommedn this hotel for anyone traveling to amsterdam for pleasure or business

<Content>Despite small incompetences, this hotel is great! I got a great deal on a double from lastminute.com, and it was worth every penny. The rooms are clean, not too small, the bathrooms are really nice (first time I'd had a bubble bath in months!), and the staff are patient and friendly. However, I must warn anyone about a few mishaps: despite asking for a smoking room, I was given a non-smoking room (any nicotine addict will know this is a recipe for disaster); the hotel maids knock loudly around 9am - 10am to clean the room, making it impossible to get extra sleep; the wake up calls and hotel shuttle are completely unreliable. On my last day, it was the maids who woke me up, as opposed to the wake-up call I'd requested (never happened), and the hotel shuttle which I'd booked and confirmed never arrived. At the last moment, I begged the front desk to call another shuttle, but they called a taxi that charged me a ridiculous price to get to the airport, which was on top of the price I'd already paid for the shuttle. I wasn't happy about any of this, to be sure. But overall, the room was really nice  peaceful, so I've forgiven them the rest!

<Content>so glad I chose the hotel we stayed at this hotel Saturday - Tuesday, it was excellent in every way, location, facilities and service. we arrived on an early morning flight and made our way to the hotel, we were able to check in and leave our luggage in a secure room, leaving us free to explore for the rest of the day.We had decided to take the train from the airport to the central station, this was an easy procedure and we then caught a tram outside the station, three stops and we were just around the corner from the hotel, cheaper than the hotel shuttle service and no problems.The hotel was situated near to the shopping streets, Dam square the flower market and easy walking distance of Anne Franks house. a very convenient location to most places.We had asked for a room overlooking the canal, the room was excellent, clean towels , tea and coffee making facilities, it was very clean, spacious and the decor was pleasant, Our deal came with free breakfast, there was something for everyone, nice bread, cereals, pancakes, cooked breakfast the usual meat and cheeses and fresh fruit, I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again or recommending it to anyone for a pleasant stay,At the back of the hotel across the canal from the hotel is Cassa David an Italian restraunt , excellent pasta, pizza and steaks , we ate there 2 of the nights and really enjoyed the meal.

<Content>Great location, clean, modern, friendly barman Fantastic central location so almost no need to get trams. If you do get a tram they are caught from the parallel running street - easy! Our room was overlooking the street rather than the canal but still not a back view and not too noisy as it is a quieter street.Very little noise heard from other rooms, just people in the corridor on their way in or out.Twin beds pushed together - this seems to be standard - bed linen clean and fresh. Room a decent size with a working TV and plenty of wardrobe space. Spare pillow and blanket available.Tea making facilities and a minibar - we didnt use that. A radiator kept us warm and we were able to turn it up and down. A small window can be opened for fresh air. Heavy curtains to keep the street light out.Bathroom good - not huge but fine for visit - had a plastic footstool in it for children to wash at the basin. Clean towels when want. The only niggle was one of the bedside lights didnt work and never got fixed in the three days we were there - despite reception saying they had reported it - I think someone let her down. That wasnt good.Reception okay - the blokes a bit more hostile than the women - the women were quick to serve and straight to the point but friendly too. The blokes were a bit dozy, not really bothered and pretty rude.The bar was okay - the barman friendly.We will stay there again.Incidently, we were in a non-smoking room which was fresh. however there are guests there that will smoke weed in the rooms. This isnt allowed so if it bothers you report it. it didnt bother us and the smell didnt go in our room.

<Content>Excellent The hotel is situated in a quiet convenient location walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. Also there are tram stops nearby for further destinations. We booked the hotel for a cheap break through expedia for 2 nights. I wasn鈥檛 sure what to expect at that price but I was very surprised.The hotel was very clean. Checking in was a quick process. There where plenty of leaflets and things to do in noted in the lobby.The room was very clean and spaciousThe drinks in the bar were expensive compared to other bars.There was a very good selection at the buffet breakfast.The only downfall was we werent staying longer

<Content>Wonderful home base We stayed at the NH Amsterdam City Centre Hotel over the Christmas holiday and loved it! We booked a hotel/air package through Northwest Airlines that included breakfast. The staff was wonderful, especially the crew in the breakfast room. We enjoyed a 4th floor room overlooking the canal.The room was small but comfortable with a great bed. The bathroom was good size and nicely appointed. The hotel's bar was very nice and had great snacks. The breakfast buffet had great variety and kept us going all day. The staff was especially friendly and very welcoming.I will definately come back to the NH City Centre again!

<Content>Great Location Been to Amsterdam a couple of times and this hotel is in a fantastic location. Rooms are quite small but there are plenty of fantastic bars and places to eat located right near the hotel. Dam square is about 5 minutes away by foot.Main tram stop is about 60 seconds away, which takes direct to the main train station.All Amsterdam鈥檚 other popular attractions (Red Light, Art Galleries, Ann Franks) are easily accessible on foot.

<Content>I love the NH! I would (and often do) advise people to stay at the NH hotel.It is dead central in Amsterdam and has everything you need nearby... great restaurants, bars, coffee shops and is in the middle of all the shopping areas!The hotel itself is always very clean, and with very modern rooms. The beds are super comfy and i always get a good sleep. The area where the hotel is situated is very clean and is really festive during the winter months.The staff are very helpful too.The only minor moan i have it that there is no mini bar in the rooms, and not enough tea/coffee making facilities... oh and the soap/shampoo they provide you with doesnt smell too good!I have stayed at this hotel at various times of the year and it has always been pleasant.Highly recommend the NH!

<Content>Clean,friendly and central location It took us 20minutes to walk from Central station to the hotel. We didn't rush because we wanted to absorb the architecture and various sights. We saw Dam Square and 'The 9 Streets' just off from Spuistraat, the route we had taken.Once inside the room was clean, the view was good and the hotel staff friendly. We chose not to eat breakfast here, but instead along the road at Cafe Luxemberg. For 20 euros we enjoyed a good breakfast which kept us going for most of the day.The evening meal was difficult because all along the Spuistraat were some really classy restaurants. We dined in Restaurant Luden about 3 doors from the Hotel. Weird having a cat around our legs whilst dining. Despite this the meal was superb.A bar with a relaxed atmosphere was opposite the Hotel. There were various shops off the Spui in a predestrianised zone as well as all kinds in the '9 Streets' location.The Abraxis coffee shop is along the Spuistraat, where we had a small amount of the Hash Brownie Cake (which an hour later made us both feel relaxed). The staff were friendly and helpful.An Irish pub is just off Spuistraat which served up a great Steak  Guiness pie. Other sights we visited were the Museums, Red Light Area (preferred the daytime than the evening to visit) and department stores.Also worth doing is the candlelight cruise. A 2hr gentle boat cruise around the canal waterways. Wine and cheese and a guide made it very enjoyable, not sure about the Shadows music in the background. Amazing to see how many live in houseboats.We had a great 2 nights in Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice Stay My boyfriend and I, and 2 friends stayed here in early November 2006 for 5 days and we had a very enjoyable experience. My room was small compared to American standards but we had a nice view of the city. My friends' room was much bigger and cozier but their room had no view. The hotel is at an excellent location. 10 minutes to the Leidesplein and Rembrantsplein. 10-15 to Central Station and Red Light District. For the back-packing crowd there are a few coffeeshops on the same street or around the corner. The hotel is a business hotel so dont be surprised to see business men out and about just as one is stumbling back in. Never dined at the hotel as it was too pricey however there is no lack of places to eat nearby. Would DEFINTELY stay here again! Very pleased.Tip: Walk everywhere if you can. Theres no better way to experience the city than by foot!

<Content>Excellent location, but pricey The selling point of this hotel is the location, which is really central and in a nice area surrounded by good restaurants and cafes. The hotel itself is nothing special and a little overpriced. The room was modern if a little small. The general public areas of the hotel are done out in an art deco style, which is kind of cool, but is looking a bit shabby. For connoisseurs, the hotel is right around the corner from de tweede kamer, which is apparently one of the most popular coffee shops with locals.

<Content>Great place to stay to enjoy Amsterdam We stayed at the NH City Centre this past fourth of July week. I have been meaning to post this review since we returned. Overall, this is a very nice hotel in a fantastic location. Our room was on the ground floor and had a canal view. I expected lots of traffic noise or lobby noise, but there was none. The room was very clean and spacious. I had hoped for a king or queen bed, but they pushed two doubles together. Not quite the same, but still very comfy. The bathroom was large, shower pressure good, and there was a toilet in the main bath and a half bath as well, which was a nice surprise. The lobby staff was very friendly and helpful, even though they were always busy helping customers.The best part of the hotel was the location. I can't say enough good things about it. We walked all over Amsterdam and this location afforded us that opportunity. It was less than a 10 minute walk to Dam Square, Red Light Distict, Anne Frank Haus and no more than 15 minutes to the Rembrandt museum, where we caught our bus tours each morning. The walks were beautiful each morning and we truly enjoyed all of the shops and restaurants along the canals. Also, two of our favorite dining experiences were right next door to the NH hotel. The Five Flies is a must do for any trip to Amsterdam. Bar none - best dining experience ever. A close second was the Indonesian restaurant, Kantjil  de Tijger. Great outdoor dining and an explosion of tastes in the sampling style of entrees.The only drawbacks - there was no air conditioning in the room and they ran out of ice in the ice machine 5 out of the 6 days we stayed. They did bring a fan to our room, but it was unseasonably hot in July and the fan offered little relief. I was able to go to the lobby bar for ice, but it was inconvenient.All in all, the good far outweighed the bad and I would stay here again on any future travels to Amsterdam.

<Content>Good Location Stayed in this hotel with 2 friends in October 2006. Arrived late at night found reception staff efficient and helpful. Gave us maps and pointed out major tourist attractions.Room modern, clean with clean towels every day.Did not have breakfast in hotel - thought expensive - 16 Euros - plenty of places to eat nearby.Had no problem operating lifts with door key card.Ideal location plenty bars/restaurants and 10min walk to Anne Frank House.Lovely restaurant couple of doors away - Luden also recomend Casa di David across canal on same street as flower market - but gets very busy, go early or book.Be warned if you request early morning call to get to airport etc - ours never arrived luckily we had back-up but thankfully the taxi was waiting for us as requested. So overall had great few days break definately would use hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel at very good value I frequently visit Amsterdam for business and NH City Center was the best hotel I've ever been in this city. The location is good, central but quite. The rooms are very clean, large and very well decorated. The breakfast is excellent and so are the other services provided in the hotel. The rooms are quite modern and relaxing. They even serve aromatherapic foams and soaps in the bathroom. Back side rooms are better since the back of the hotel faces a part of Amstel river. Not to mention that the value is great. Even in a very busy period in the city we got a very hot deal. I strongly recommend this hotel for everyone

<Content>GREAT HOTEL AND LOCATION My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in March 2006. We came in from Boston and arrived in Amsterdam at about 6a.m. It was FREEZING and we were not allowed to check in yet. But, the staff was more than accomodating for us. They checked our luggage into a storage facility, gave us pillows and a blanket, and told us to relax in the sitting area. There is a great buffet breakfast and the woman in charge gave us free coffee/muffins/cereal. Everyone in the staff was more than helpful.As for the location, it is great. The back of the hotel over looks a canal and the front exits onto a nice street. The tram stop is right around the corner, but we really just walked to everything.TIP: Exit the hotel on the street side and turn right, directly next to the hotel is a GREAT restaurant. The entrance is in the alley between the hotel. I cannot recall the name but there is a bee (bumblebee) on it's sign. It is expensive and somewhat upscale, but it was the best meal I had while I was there. (a great wine list too) The user photographs are accurate. We stayed in a room identical to the one the the red bedspread.

<Content>Average Hotel The Hotel is in a good location. It is at the Flower market end of the Spuistratt. Takes about 10 to 15 minutes to walk from central station. The room was clean, had a TV, drink making facilities, hairdryer, toiletries, no fridge or mini bar. Average size with a very comfortable king size bed.You are given a swipe card for the key to the hotel room, you need this to operate the lift as well, although, each time we arrived back at the hotel we had to get ours re-programmed because apparently, it cannot be kept by a mobile phone or another credit card (but I only had my handbag to put it in!). Reception staff, ok, not especially friendly or competent, and did seem to be the same girl our entire stay.There are a couple of bars and several cafes/restaurants on the same street. It is a 10 minute walk to the red light district. 15/20 minute walk to Anne Franks House.The bar was ok, and had a happy hour 5pm until 6pm, drinks were half price. Didn't each breakfast because I think 16 euros was too much, there are cafes you can eat in for less on the same road.Hotels seem expensive in Amsterdam, so I would say that this is an ok hotel and would probably stay here again. Paid 298 euros for two nights.

<Content>Great location Stayed here with a couple of friends last week and had a great time. Brilliant location, right beside Dam Square and lots of shopping and resturaunts near by. Staff mostly friendly. Had a very grumpy receptionist when checking in but she seemed to be the only one. We had gotten married the previous week and the hotel had gotten wind of this and left a lovely basket of fruit in our room with a note congratulating us. Our room was very clean, spacious and modern. I recommend asking for a canal view room as we did due to someones recommendation on this site. Our window was very high up so there was a mezzanine level with a small table and 2 chairs so you could sit and see out over the canal. Our room had 2 double beds and two bathrooms. One of which just had a toilet. Our friends stayed in a room right next door but their room was a lot smaller so I would recommend staying in room 27 or similar. If I was to go back to Amsterdam I would definately be staying here again.

<Content>Loved It My Partner and I Stayed here for 7 nights and really enjoyed it.The staff at the hotel were very pleasant, assisting us many times! The rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. They were also cleaned daily. The Location of the hotel was probably the best feature, with only a short walk to Dam Square, and many other attractions. There was more than one english channel which was good for us, room service is also reasonably priced.We will definately be making this our hotel for any future trips to Amsterdam.

<Content>Not the worst, but far from the best. Checked in on the 31st July for a 4 nite break with my wife. Exterior a tad gloomy looking, not very welcoming. The room, was very tired looking, dirty chairs, but I soon realiased the reason. The windows were about six foot above floor level, if you wanted to look out, you had to stand on the chairs to do so. Rest of room, reasonably clean. No fridge in room, or no mini bar. I like a fridge in warm weather. Good bathroom, good shower. Checkin girl very friendly, checkout guy very business like, no chat, strictly business. Breakfast far too expensive at 鈧?6:50 each, we got a good breakfast out in the numerous cafes, for around 鈧? each. Carpets in main hall area outside bedroom were both dirty and worn. Maids were quite friendly, and cleaned well in rooms. Best quality of hotel was it's convient location. 5 mins from Dam square. I don't think it deserves the rave reviews earlier. I don't think I would use it again.

<Content>Ask for a room on the canal side Stayed here July 17-18 2006. Convenient to Central Amsterdam (within walking distance to Dam Square) and easy to find, just take a tram to Spui. There are some trendy /upscale bars and restaurants in the Spui area which seem to be more of a hangout for locals than tourists. Room was clean except for the floor. No A/C not a problem probably because our room was on the 1st floor. Paid $160/night which I thought was a bit pricey for the quality of the hotel. Staff friendly but not that helpful. If you stay here make sure you get a room on the canal side.

<Content>Good hotel, but no AC! We stayed at this hotel for 3 days at the beginning of July 2006. It's conveniently located to get to the trams or to walk directly to the Dam. Our room was larger than expected (Superior Room), but the air conditioning is very limited - it was hot at night and the cooling unit could not keep up!! Other than that, clean and convenient place to stay.

<Content>Great location, no A/C, safe or mini-bar We spent 3 nights at the NH Amsterdam City Centre at the end of June and were pleasantly surprised with some things and disappointed with others. To be fair, we thought we had booked a hotel with air conditioning and were surprised to find that it did not - especially since Amsterdam was experiencing a heat wave. The staff provided us with a fan which helped cool off the room - especially at night.Things we liked:Location: The location was fabulous. Near great restaurants and shops, within walking distance of most attractions and a block from the tram. Room: The room had been re-modeled and was very clean. The bed was very comfortable and we loved the comforters and wall-mounted lamps next to the beds.View: Even though we were on the street side rather than the canal, it had nice windows, a good city view and great natural light.Shower: Good water pressure and very hot water.Bakery: There is a wonderful bakery next door. We had fresh squeezed orange juice, warm croissants and caffe latte every morning.Shuttle to airport: The airport shuttle picked us up at the hotel and was convenient and reasonable.Staff: The staff was very accommodating to our requests for an extra pillow and the fan.Disappointments:No A/C, No mini-bar, no safe: What 3-star European hotel does not have a safe? Room Size: The room was small with no space to store luggage. And we were supposedly upgraded to a superior room.Common Areas: While the rooms had been re-modeled, the common areas (hallways, lobby, elevators) were old and tired looking.There is a great Indonesian restaurant across the street from the hotel.

<Content>Great location! Just back from a work trip to this hotel and I found the location was great, breakfast perfect and rooms nice and modern. Request a room towards the back of the hotel for lovely views of the canal. Also a lovely restaurant recommended by hotel staff (Casa David) is located at the back of the hotel and across the canal - food was great.We also visited one of the oldest pubs which is just down the road from the hotel (out the front door and turn left), the door was a split door and there was sawdust on nthe floor but they supplied a great pint of Amsel and a great red wine!Would recommend this hotel for a family or couples visiting Amsterdam, near the trams and only a 10 min walk to the second tram line, which brought us to places like the Heineken expereience - great tour! Missed out on Anne Franks house but will definitely return on a family trip at some stage, and will stay at this hotel.

<Content>The Hotel is average, ok but a bit expensive It's an average 3 star hotel, with wonderful central location: everything was withing 1 km!We spent 2 nights in a double room and paid 350 euros without breakfast (would have paid +16 euros/ person/day) or extras. I found it a bit expensive since the hotel and the rooms are ok, but nothing special. No minibar, no shops, understaffed.No problem, but nothing that would make us want to go back there.

<Content>Loved the NH Amsterdam City Centre We stayed at this hotel with our eight year old daughter for a family break and really enjoyed our stay. Hotel staff were all very friendly and very helpful. Cleaning staff did a very good job of keeping the hotel clean and tidy.Location is ideal for walking around the city and is very central but being in the street behind the Dam Square it is not noisy. Small bakery a few doors along from the hotel bakes excellent breakfast pastries and lunchtime treats, along with fruit smoothies and tasty cakes.One minnor problem - when leaving airport the taxi took us to the other NH City hotel (5 star) which caused confusion as they did not have our booking, although they quickly sorted this out and directed us to the correct hotel. We used the hotel shuttle bus for the return to the airport and found this easy and economical to use.We would definitely go back to Amsterdam and to this particular hotel.

<Content>Good, nice courteous helpful staff I stayed in this hotel two weeks ago when i was on a business trip. Pros - good location, being 10 minute walk away from the Centraal Station, nice courteous and helpful staff, Wifi connection in the rooms (you can buy the prepaid internet card in the reception desk or pay using your credit card online - in some cases it's cheaper to buy the prepaid card).The only con i have is the smallish rooms. It's enough for 1 person, but a bit crowded for 2. If you have two pieces of big luggage it's a problem. Definitely the rooms are smaller than those i have stayed in other hotels during my other business trips.Another thing i liked is that only hotel guests have access to the rooms. You need to swipe your key card on the elevator before you can press the floor where you are staying. This is an added security feature i suppose since hotels in Europe usually don't have security personnel unlike most hotels in Asia (too expensive probably).But it's clean, well maintained and conveniently located. The tram stop (Spui tram stop) is only a minute away (by foot). It's unfortunate i had to check out after 3 days and transfer to another hotel bec they were fully booked, bec. the location is good. I would recommend this place for tourists as well.

<Content>Loved it! We have just returned from a three night stay here and we loved it. We booked a superior room which was spacious and immaculately clean. It was very modern, with incredibly comfortable beds, laminate floor, lovely toiletries and lots of hot water. The staff were pleasant and helpful and we enjoyed having a drink in the bar during the evenings.We found the hotel to be very convenient and was near to everywhere we wanted to go. We were able to walk everywhere which meant that we really saw the beauty of the canals and the architecture. It is very close to the shops and the Anne Frank house. This is a must for any visit. Thought provoking and atmospheric, and with a peaceful cafe to sit and reflect on what you have experienced. This was our first visit to Amsterdam and we will be going back and when we do, we will definitely stay at the NH city centre.

<Content>Great location. Comfortable place to stay We stayed 2 nights in this hotel. If you are used to American-standard hotels, this is the place for you. It has modern rooms and conveniences. It's not your typical smaller European hotel.The rooms were very clean, large and above average in comfort. The hotel overall was contemporary and felt more like an American hotel. It is conveneintly located to so much! Easy walk to the tram stop. Just one block. Many cafes, bars and restaurants within walking distance. Visit the Hoppe pub just up the street. Over 300 years old. And get a glass of jenever.You can easily walk to the easy shopping street, and the Amsterdam historical Museum is very close. We walked all over the place while we stayed there. We only took the tram to go to the train station with our luggage. But we are walkers.The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. They spoke very English well, as most people in Amsterdam did. Who cares how fast the elevator travels? Is that really important? It didn't matter to us. We got to our room just fine. And a great room it was. I would definately recommend this hotel to other travellers.

<Content>OK but with problems I have stayed at this hotel three or four times now ( my company get some sort of deal). The rooms are OK if small. but modern and attractive. There is no mini bar. Depending on the room you get the hotel can be horribly noisy.The lifts are incredibly slow as is the service at recption which is woefully understaffed at busy times.Breakfast is good and plentiful for a European hotel.In short this hotel is just about OK but I would not spend my own money on it.

<Content>Convenient  This was my second trip to Amsterdam. I had stayed at another more expensive hotel on my first trip and the NH City Center was by far the best. This is not a large US style hotel, but for the price, it's a great choice. Great restaurants and bars nearby. The shopping district is just 5 - 10 minutes away. And the red light district is just far enough away (15 minutes walk). Hop on the tram for E$1.60 and in 10 mins you're in the museum district. Dam Square is just a short walk away. We're from S. Florida and we loved the weather in April ... cold but not blistering. Great location!The hotel staff is top notch, extremely friendly and informative. We booked a tour to Delft/The Hague with them. We had upgraded our room to a superior room and I recommend that to everyone. It was a decent size and clean. The bed was quite comfortable and we had asked for a king bed and got it. The only strange thing was that the bed comforter was split into 2 pieces (like 2 twins). The bathroom was small but sufficient and the hot water was really hot .... nice! There is no climate control in the rooms (the temp is set by the hotel centrally), but our room was comfortable and we could open the windows for some fresh air if we needed to. Wood floors and modern deco style furnishings. We had breakfast in the restaurant one morning: great breads and good selection of ham, bacon, cheeses, fruits and cereals. The eggs were not good, so avoid them. We travelled with some friends who had a standard room ... it was very small. Upgrade to a superior room ... the extra $ is worth it!I would definitely stay here again and we're planning to visit Amsterdam again in 2007.TIP: When you go, use a credit card for major purchases and a debit card to get get cash at a local ATM (there are many ATM's in AMS). You get the best exchange rate using your cards. Take cash and travellers checks only for emergencies. If you love Chinese food, go to the Sea Palace (a large floating restaurant down by Centraal Station) ... best Chinese food I ever had!

<Content>Friendly service and comfortable rooms My wife and I were visiting Amsterdam for the first time, for a trade conference and also a small holiday. After hearing some horror stories about the cheaper Amsterdam hotels we spent an afternoon on this site trying to find something nice that wouldn't break the bank. We were very happy with the NH City Centre, the reviews here were spot on. It was right in the centre of the town, a small walk away from most places (and next to the tram stop for ones further away). The rooms were designed well, modern and very clean. The bathroom and shower was great, the NH hotels all give away a great set of shampoo/gel/soap. We even bought a pack when we left! The staff were very friendly, giving us a map and marking where we were heading each time. Only slight down-point was that the room was a little cold and the bed covers not too thick but to be fair to the hotel we didn't bring this to their attention. We'll definitely be back there though next year.

<Content>A great hotel in an evene greater location I spent the Easter holidays in Amsterdam with my wife. After a long evaluation I choosed to stay at the NH City Centre because of the location and the price. This has been my third trip to Netherland's capital and this hotel is the best I remember of.The location is great, 10 minutes south of Dam square and close enough to the museums (Van Gogh...) to think about going there by foot. The tram stops at the next road.The hotel's front side is quite large for a building in the Amsterdam's centre and many rooms face the Singel canal. I booked a superior room and ended up in a huge 4 bed room in the top floor, the view was marvellous, I like to think it was the best room...Breakfast is great, pastries and croissants are delicious (crispy and delicate as it should be) I am glad I haven't payed for breakfast in advance because a discount was offered to us during check in.The room was very clean (dust is a problem for me...so I check it) and stylish. My wife really loved the place.Last but not least, 3 of the best restaurants in Amsterdam (according to Lonely Planet guide) are next to the hotel. The dutch restaurants Haesje Claes and De Vijff Vlieghen are excellent, something to experience if you plan to visit Amsterdam.

<Content>Outstanding Service We were so glad that we found this hotel. Initially we thought it might be disappointing. It is located in the University district and the external facade looked mundane and the entrance lobby could best be described as stylish, but slightly old-fashioned. However, we soon learned that intitial appearances can be deceptive.The rooms were spotlessly clean and we loved the decor. However, what really impressed us were the gems behind the reception desk. All the staff seemed exceptionally well trained, were fluent in between two and four languages, and seemed to give the impression that they were there to be helpful rather than to pass the time of day waiting for a pay cheque.The location was central, and therefore close to shopping and within walking distance of all the major attractions - including the more distant Van Gogh museum. Central shopping was just across the road and through a side street. And Dams Square was just up the road. Being close to the University there were lots of cafes and restaurants on the doorstep.The one disappointment with the hotel was the standard of the room service food. The lettuce was going brown at the edges and the burger was black. Pity the catering that we saw didn't match the front of house skills. Perhaps it was a good thing that breakfast wasn't included in our tariff and we opted to go to a local cafe instead.The hotel is also on the Shuttle Service route from the airport. It's relatively cheap and hassle free.We will be coming back. The location and quality of staff service are excellent.

<Content>Great Service  Good points- The hotel was right next to everything! The spa is right across the street as soon as you walk out for a nice relaxing massage. Restuarants everywhere! The Van Gogh  the Anne frank is within walking distance. If Dutch food is not your style, you can always walk to the supermarker .10 of a mile away.bad-1/2 a mile from the hotel (to the right) is where the red light district starts.

<Content>Excellent combination of location and rate Stayed here for TEN DAYS!! (longest ever in one hotel room) in late November-early December while attending a conference. As we learned our way around Amsterdam, it turned out the hotel was situated perfectly. Right in the heart of the city, an easy walk to most of the places you want to go. Our room overlooked the Singel canal (better option than overlooking the noisy street) and there is a restaurant in the hotel with a happy hour and not bad food for those days when you are too tired from dodging cyclists to go out to eat. Don't get confused with similarly named NH Amsterdam Centre, which is more expensive and a bit nicer, but doesn't have the location. We really loved Amsterdam and when we go back, we'll stay here again. Check out 'tZwaantje restaurant just across the canal - great ribs, good price, terrific staff.

<Content>Modern, helpful, perfect situ. I stayed here for 2 nights for a friends 30th birthday in November 2005. Excellent service - our bags were bought up to our modern, very clean rooms without prompting. Reception staff were fantastic - even giving us a local map highlighting various points of interest we wanted to visit. Was able to walk everywhere or easily jump on a tram making everything accessible. Also easy to get a cab to and from the airport for transfers. Lovely hotel - great service.

<Content>Great room and location, helpful staff We stayed at the NH City Centre for our only night in Amsterdam (mid-September) and had a great experience. The room was spacious and bathroom/shower very nice - loved the toiletries! Enjoyed a fantastic Indonesian meal just down the street and had lovely pastries for breakfast at a nearby bakery. We found the hotel's location quite convenient and the staff very helpful. In our 24 hour stay, we did a canal tour, visited the Heineken Experience, saw the floating flower market, and visited the Anne Frank house. Would definitely return.

<Content>Small room but perfectly fine - excellent location I stayed for one night at the NH City Centre and the main reason I booked it was because it is right next to my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam, Luden (highly recommended!). The hotel is in an excellent location, right next to the main shopping area and near good restaurants and bars (another tip - if you like whisky, you'll love De Stijl which is just up the road from the hotel and has hundreds of types of whisky). My room was very small but I was travelling alone so it wasn't a problem (although I wondered where I could put my suitcase!). The interior was quite modern and the room was clean. Bottled water is available in the room for 2 euros. I didn't bother with breakfast as I was catching an early train from Centraal station so I can't comment on that. I wouldn't stay here as a tourist (I would want a bit more character e.g. Canal House, or I would rent an apartment overlooking one of the canals) but it is absolutely fine for business travellers.

<Content>Highly Recommend! We stayed for 4 nights (October 6-10th, 2005). The hotel is in a great location. Easy walk to everything. Very close to Leidesplein where we spent afternoons sitting out people watching. Also the Boom Boom Chicago show is there and we had lots of fun and a short walk back to our hotel. The hotel staff were polite and helpful, but we didn't need much or ask for anything extra. Our room was in the back of the hotel overlooking a courtyard between other buildings. It was quiet. It was clean. The mini bar was always refilled. Our room was quite large. Much larger than any room we have ever stayed in Europe. The bathroom was also large and quite nice. We had a king size bed which was comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here. We booked through Expedia and got a good rate.

<Content>Great Stay at NH City Centre Amsterdam Arrived in this hotel on friday 4th November 05. We had booked two double rooms through the NH hotel website and confirmed by phone. The cost of the room was 鈧?50.00 and we decided to upgrade to a superior room for 鈧?0.00 per night. We have previously stayed in a 3 star in amsterdam and had a terraible experience so were very weary as to what would greet us! Once we opend the bedroom door what a surprise - the room was very spacious and on two levels. Everything was very clean and the bed was a kingsize with crisp white linen. The decor was modern in style and the room had tea and coffee making facilties. The second room was almost the same but on one level with two seperate toilets?? We found the hotel staff efficent and helpful. We did not eat in the hotel but had breakfast in one of the many cafe locally. The location of the hotel was excellent - within walking distance of dam square, flower market and anne franks house. We were located on the ground floor of the hotel but found it quiet and restfull. The shuttle bus connections is available to and from the airport at a cost of 鈧?1.00 per person - however as there was four of us we took a taxi which cost us 鈧?5.00 from the hotel to the airport aprox 20mins. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would return to stay there again.

<Content>Ideal location to explore... Stayed at The NH City Centre from Oct 8th - 15th, in a Superior King Size room. The room was very clean and of nice size. We had a canal side room however no view of the canal as the 5th floor rooms have an overhang below which blocks the view. Room pictures were exactly as our room looked.No noise issues as we weren't on the street... but if your worried about noise why would you book a hotel in the center of a city?Booked the stay thru NH site directly, pricing was the same as thru expedia and other sites. We confirmed our reservation with both the central booking and by email directly with the hotel and had no problems.Hotel location is ideal. Easy walk from central station, very close to Dam Square and all centrum sites, cafes and coffee shops steps from hotel.We stayed at Krasnapolsky 2 years ago and would have again but rates had gone way up. Our room at City Centre was very similar , just a tad bit smaller but very nice and still convenient.

<Content>Noisy and tiny bedroom. Excellent position right in the centre of Amsterdam. However two negative points about the hotel were: 1. Noise. Our bedroom overlooked the front of the hotel on the third floor. My wife and I were awakened several times every night by the road noises from outside.2. Very small bedroom. Our so called double bedroom was in reality a small single room. with insufficient room to even allow for a second bedside table!Hotel facilities were oterwise good but the night noise and cramped bedroom did spoil our stay.

<Content>Weekend at NH Amsteram Centre I spent a 3-day weekend with my wife at this hotel. The main reason for my choice was the good location. We麓ve got a little bit disapointed arriving at the hotel, knowing we will spend 2 nigths at a 5-star hotel. The reason was that we saw photos of the hotel online, which obviously shows rooms, entrances and halls we didn麓t see being there. Tip: never act in accordance with picutres in brochures or online websites. Behind the window we saw the hotel麓s backyard with its noisy aircondition facility. We were at the 6th floor and with the window opened you can麓t get asleep because of the noise. Fortunately we didn麓t have a room in the 1st or 2nd floor as the noise would be more bothering.TIP: after check-in you should let check the content of the minibar to avoid misunderstandings. They wanted to charge me 42 euros for beverages I ostensible had use. After a gratuitous discussion at the reception they made some calls and finally didn麓t charge me anything. The staff at the reception wasn麓t friendly and didn麓t excuse for their mistake! Not very professional for a 5-star hotel staff.TIP FOR CAR TRAVELERS: As the hotel does not have an own parking area, you have to park at a park block 100m away. 24h of parking will cost you 36 euros. Parking blocks in the center of Amsterdam costs 40 up to 50 euros for 24h. One hour costs 3-4 eur depends on location. Almost the same price you have to pay if you want to park in the streets. You can save 40 eur for 24h of parking if you park on a sunday in the streets, as then it is for free ;-).

<Content>Nice Room, No Service This hotel left me with a mixed review. I'll make a few points:Good things--- Location: It was right in the heart of the city. You'll have no problem walking anywhere in the city. We walked to the Anne Frank house, the flower market, the center of the city, and the red light district- Room style: It looked good. Very clean, modern, enough space. We had room 389 (I think), which was street side. It had a Queen bed, and a twin bed. A large desk with a chair, a cabinet, a decent sized tv, and another chair with lamp. It was plenty big for 2 people, and even big enough for 3 if you wanted. The bathroom was smaller, but the shower was really nice. It had a glass partition instaid of a door, which was unique. They provided nice towels and soap/shampoo.Bad things--- Parking: We called ahead and were told there was a parking garage. When we got there at 11:30pm, we were told it was full, and if we wanted we could park at their other location 10 minutes away. It was nearly midnight and pouring rain, not a viable option to tell a paying guest. Then they said i could park on the street, which we did. It cost us 30.60 euros a day there. Their parking garage would have been around 22.50 euros, still a lot of money.- Horrible Directions: We were given completely wrong directions two times by different staff members. Coming into the hotel, there was a year-long construction project that blocked the route and gave no detour signs. The staff should have known that, but didn't. Leaving the hotel and going to the airport, we were given directions again that were wrong. It lead us to a road which didn't exist, then later wasnt specific enough to determine whether we should be on the Amsterdam Ring, City Ring, or A10 Ring. With all of the one way streets, canals, bikers, and busses all over the place in the center of downtown, directions are at VERY valuable. They failed miserably here. (ps. I've driven in new york city, boston, etc with little to no problem... it's totally different in a foreign country with unfamiliar roads, customs, and signs)Overall--I'd stay here again. The location is great, and the rooms are fine. Just don't expect anything from any of the staff. We paid about 150 euros a night, which is semi reasonable for an inner city hotel, and would pay it again. I would advise against driving into the city though, as it is tough to do, parking is very expensive, and you wont need your car once you get there. Email me if you want any more advice or info!

<Content>Excellent choice, but problem with late arrival. We only had one problem with this hotel ... we booked online and telephoned as requested to inform them of our late arrival, the person we spoke to was rather dismissive and said it was fine (should had smelled a rat). When we arrived at 9.30pm they said that our booking was only secured until 8.00pm and that they didn't have a room for us. Now having first hand experience of 'Dutch Customer Service' we switched to Dutch and stood our ground, explained that we had in fact telephoned two weeks earlier, explained about the dismissive girl etc. in the end they 'found' a room for us.The room we had was quite large, very dark (for sleeping) and very quiet so we had some of the best nights sleep we've ever had in a hotel. The bathroom was nice, good toiletries, etc. Everything was very clean. The location is also fantastic, 5 minutes from the Kalverstraat shopping street and 10 minutes from the Leidseplein but far enough away from the tourists who congregate on the Damrak, Red light district. It was very accessible by tram too. The price was also very reasonable.The reception service was a bit 'hit and miss' they did loan me a UK adaptor, however they did forget to book my friends airport shuttle bus (luckily she is also quickly learning about 'Dutch customer service', so she booked the one before the one she really needed) and I heard antoher customer complaining about the cost of the parking which hadn't been made clear at the time of booking)All in all I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Decent Place Overall I was happy. The location is great, although next time I might stay in Leidesplein (but thats just a personal preference). Decent cafes nearby, including the Luxembourg Cafe. A decent Shaorma Restaurant across the street. This hotel is in a quiet neighborhood, close to tram and witin walking distance of EVERYTHING! The main shopping district is around the corner, literally a 2 minute walk. The hotel had a very comfortable bed, decent furnishings and although the room was small, I was happy. Better than Holiday Inn Quality, but not the Marriott if this is a helpful comparision. 15 Euros a day for wi-fi, but hey, it Europe they seem to have high internet prices here. I wil stay here again but not in the summer, I do not think the hotel is airconditioned, at least I couldn't find it. But then again, many hotels here have no a/c.

<Content>Excellent location We arrived at the hotel around 2:00PM which is about an hour earlier than the check-in time. They had our room ready for us but unfortunately it was the wrong room. When we made our reservation through Expedia we had asked for a Superior room on the upper floors overlooking the canal and also with a queen size bed. The room they had ready for us was on the ground floor with 2 twin beds. The receptionist insisted that these were the specifications that we had asked for and showed up on their computer. So I showed her our confirmation printout from Expedia and after consulting her manager she changed our room to a Superior room on the top (5th) floor with a queen bed. This room was facing the Singel Canal behind the hotel. However we could not see the canal itself because a ledge below the window was blocking it. We could see the buildings across the canal and the rest of the city. This still made a nice view. They let us see 2 other rooms facing other directions but we settled for this one. Our room was large and clean but the bathroom was small and tight, specially compared to North American standards.The reception desk was definitely understaffed and we usually had to wait a few minutes to get service. However, they were always courteous and helpful. We did not eat at the restaurant but we did order one pasta dish through room service. I had to pick up the food myself from the restaurant. It was an adequately sized plate of pasta and it tasted good. Our tray and dishes were sitting on the table outside our room close to 24 hours before somebody picked them up. Breakfast was 16 Euros but they had a deal that if we signed up at check-in to eat breakfast at the hotel every day during our stay they would only charge us 11 Euros.The cleaning staff cleaned our room every day and generally did a decent job. On 3 occasions they forgot to take the dirty drinking glasses or to leave us enough towels or soap. We used the wakeup call service just once and it was on time.At checkout the receptionist wanted to charge us for our entire stay even though we had made full payment in advance through Expedia. He only backed off when I showed him my confirmation and receipt from Expedia.The location of this hotel is simply perfect. It is in the heart of Amsterdam within walking distance of many of the tourist attractions. Tram lines are less than a minute away and Central Station is about a 15 to 20 minute walk away. There is even a large Albert Heijn supermarket nearby on Spuistraat (just behind the Royal Palace). If you're going to stock up on Dutch chocolate for the trip back home this is a good place to go for very reasonable prices.Overall we had a mixed feeling about this hotel. The location was perfect and our room was generally clean and well kept. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. However, it appeared that the organization and discipline of the management and staff and the consistency of the service needed some improvement. The service was not always a sure thing. In a number of occasions we had to point out the shortcomings to the staff in order to get the promised or expected service. I give this hotel the Above Average rating because of it鈥檚 great location.

<Content>Well Chuffed! My boyfriend and myself stayed at this hotel last week (31/8-2/9) and we had a great time. The hotel looks very smart not what I was expecting at all. The check in was smooth and hassle free (even though we where a bit early), but there was a moment of panic when I realised we had to put down a deposit for the room (鈧?00) but this was an error on my part really. The rooms looked great, clean, tidy and well decorated too. Most of all though they felt very comfortable and safe. The location of the hotel was ideal, everything being only a short walk away. There was an ample selection of coffee shops, bars and cafes to chose from just outside the hotel. My fav part of hotels are the showers (I have a thing about them!) and I鈥檓 glad to say this one was excellent! The only grip about the whole trip is that I wish we stayed longer to explore the area more. But we鈥檒l be back and I鈥檇 recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Safe, clean, and good location The location was great! The hotel is in reasonable walking distance of almost anything you want to see - The Van Gogh museum, The Anne Frank house, the train station etc. My boyfriend tried the restaurant in the hotel and said it was pretty good but pricey. I went to the restaurant on the corner (on the canal side of the hotel) as other people on TripAdvisor suggested and wasn't disappointed! A great meal for the price and very nice staff - full of locals! As someone else stated the front desk is a little understaffed we had to wait a while both checking in and checking out... but all in all the hotel was safe, clean, and great location for the price.

<Content>Location, Location, Location For 3 first time friends visiting Amsterdam we could no have asked for a better location. Located at the base of one of the inner canals we were extremely close/in all the action. There were several coffee shops within a minute walk of the front door, including the Dampkring from Ocean's 12. As for the hotel, our room was clean and we had no problems with it. The only knock is that you are lead to believe that breakfast was free and they get you for 16 Euros. Chalk that one up to us being beginners in Europe. I would definately stay at this hotel again as I felt that I was in the center of it all.

<Content>Worst hotel experience EVER Don't stay in this hotel if you would like a hassle free trip to Amsterdam!I booked 3 rooms in this hotel using the hotels online booking system and received an electronic confirmation of my booking. We arrived in Amsterdam late on a Friday night and went straight to the hotel at 12.30 at which time we were informed that they did not have rooms for us! (the fact that we were going to be late was communicated to the hotel). So, after waiting 45 minutes, they sent us to another hotel that they owned 10 minute drive away. We really didn't want to have to change rooms again the next day so we asked if we could stay in the same hotel the next night. They lied to us and told us that hotel was full.We picked up a brochure from the reception for a bike tour and went along at 11am as per the brochure. Later to discover that the hotels brochures were a year out of date and the bike company had changed the time of the tour to 10am.... so we missed it.After finally checking into our rooms at 6pm on Saturday night the room key didn't work.The breakfast was poor.And the grand finally ... they charged each of us individually for the rooms on the day we checked out. Then a week later, I got charged again for all 3 rooms!! I still don't have my money back!!!!

<Content>Comfortable hotel, located in the heart of Amsterdam This hotel is located in the heart of Amsterdam, a 15 minute walk from the Central Station. Tram and bus stops are nearby. Hotel staff is friendly. They might want to have a bit more staff on duty, checking out at 8am took +- 15 minutes. My room was a small room, the bathroom is small as well, the shower is good enough. All over the room were little 'flyers' of the NH brand. On your pillow is a 'sleep well' card. Nice thought. The bed is of reasonable quality. The room size is a bit of a downside, but if you just want to sleep (come home late, leave early), it is perfect. If you want to work / leisure on the room, I suggest phoning in in advance to check if they have more spacious rooms available. Overall, great hotel if you are not too afraid of small locations. The fact that it is in the heart of Amsterdam, is very attractive to stay here.

<Content>Excellent locale. 3 coffeeshops within 1 minute's walk The hotel itself and the room we had was clean and looked nice  simple. Nothing fancy, but better than Best Western. The room was small even though we were assured it was a Superior Room with a double bed. Definitely would not wanna stay for more than 5 days because of the small size of the room, but it sufficed for 4. In fact, it more than sufficed because there were no bedbugs or leaky ceilings or other mishaps!The bathroom only had a shower. The floor leading to the shower and the showerfloor itself were slippery. They did not have any perma-grit for traction. Other than that, the bathroom was clean and modern. The toilet was a source of endless fascination...The room was clean  fresh every day even though it was a smoking room.Our room faced the canal at the rear of the building. Quite a pretty view but the noise from the obnoxious-sounding scooters at all hours of the day and night can take some getting used to. You don't really wanna shut the windows...but sometimes you have to just to get a night's rest (or a late afternoon nap).The ice is free. There are softdrinks in machines on the 2nd  4th floors. They each cost 2 euros. That's about what they cost throughout central Amsterdam.The candy machines: Put your coins in first, then make your selection. The candy machine on the 2nd floor stole about 1.60 euros. Use the 4th floor.About one minute away, across the street and down the 1st alley to the right of the Italian Ristorante is Kadinsky Coffeeshop. Good prices and selection. We sat at the front window and got mellow.The other 2 coffeeshops within a minute's walk are to the right as you exit the front of the hotel. You walk past the cafe tables and make a right down the 1st (or 2nd) alley and you'll find Tweede Kamer, and then a few steps away, on the corner, is Dutch Flowers.If you just start walking in any direction from the hotel you're bound to come across a coffeeshop.Behave yourself, be discrete, use your good manners, and smoke much less than you normally would, and you'll have a good time.This is supposed to be a review of the hotel...Bottom line: It was clean and safe. The front desk is understaffed but the available staff are courteous. We would go there again---unless we could find a bigger room somewhere else for the same price.

<Content>Location can't be beat! My sister and I stayed at the NH City Centre for 2 nights in July 2005.If you're travelling from the Schipol airport to this hotel, be sure to take the Connexions shuttle bus service from outside the airport arrivals - 17.50euros for a return ticket and they drop you right outside the door to the hotel! You can book your return pick-up time at the Hotel reception.We arrived at the hotel at 11am so didn't expect a room to be ready, they did hold our luggage for us until 3pm though. Apparently all the hotel rooms differ in size so I can't directly compare our room, it was a fair size for the two of us for two nights, but I wouldn't want to stay for much longer in such a small room. However it was spotlessly clean, the beds were very comfy, nice modern decor, the shower was powerful and noise from other guests wasn't a major problem.The best feature of the hotel is the location - 10 mins from Dam Square and the Royal Palace, 3 mins from Flower Market, 10 mins from Leidseplein, 10 mins from Anne Frank's house (walking distances) - we didn't get a bus or tram anywhere because we were so central to everything.They definately need more reception staff at this hotel as whenever we needed to visit reception we had to wait 5/10 mins (even just to re-programme our room key as it wouldn't let us in).I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a clean, comfortable and affordable base to explore gorgeous Amsterdam!I will be back one day!

<Content>Good Location! The location was good for shopping and close to Madame Tussaud's. The rooms were clean and spacious. The first floor corner room my parents had was two levels with a king size bed. Our room was next door with twin beds, a tall ceiling and a small street level window. It would have been nice to have a small fridge in the room. Though they seemed to be a bit under staffed at the front desk they were friendly and courteous. The breakfast buffet was excellent, although pricey, but this typical. There are two wonderful restaurants just across the street.

<Content>Awful hotel--bed bugs everywhere I made a reservation on Travelocity and went to check in at the NH Amsterdam City Centre. They insisited I did not have a reservation. I told them I did. They said they could not check because the reservation desk was closed on the weekend and they were fully booked. I said that was okay I could go to an internet cafe and print out my confirmation. Finally, they gave me a room.I asked for a 7:15 wake up call. They called at 6:00. I noticed that the bed was crawling with bed bugs. I caught four and put them in a glass. The maintence guy came up to check and my bed was covered in blood where they bit me and I squashed them--if you don't know, bed bugs live off blood which they take from humans during the night.I took the bugs to the front desk and they still wanted me to pay the full rate. Horrible service. The highlight was when I called the front desk to complain about the bugs and the early wake up call and they said not to worry, they'd call me back at 7:15 and I could go back to bed...

<Content>A little gem in the Centre! We have just returned from a two night break in Amsterdam. We booked the NH Ciry Centre hotel using bookings.nl and got a pretty good deal. The reception area was big and clean as were all of the other public areas.We arrived before the normal check in time but we were allowed to complete registration and store our bags in a locked room until 3:00 pm.The staff were very friendly and helpful - we had a problem with the noisy stairs door which was next to our room on the first night but we were quickly moved without any fuss at all.We never ate in the hotel but they offer a three couse meal for 19.95 euros which I thought was pretty good value.The rooms are not huge but the two we had were very tastefully decorated with modern colours and furniture. Security is good too as you cannot enter the lift or stairs area without a room key.Excellent central location only a few minutes walk from Dam Square and The Leidseplein.All in all lovely hotel with a good location. Would stay again without a doubt.

<Content>Excellent Location I just returned from my trip to Amsterdam. The NH City Centre Hotel was very nice. Both my friend and I stayed on the 5th floor. These rooms had been recently renovated.The only problems I had with the hotel was that there were no washclothes in the bathrooms and the rooms did not have air conditioning. From what I understand, not having air conditioning is pretty common through out Europe. This in itself would not have been bad, but it got rather warm for this type of year.The only other complaint is the maid staff was a little noisy. But considering my friend and I were out partying until 3am and not getting up until 11am or so, this is not really all that bad. We needed to get up anyway.I could not have asked for a better location. From the hotel, it was either a few minute walk or up to about 20 minute walk to just about anything we wanted to see and do. We could have used the tram system, but I really did not understand the Strippenkart and the different zones. Great shopping within 5 minutes on Kalverstraat. There is a great Indonesian restaurant right down the street. We ate dinner in the hotel one night and we both really liked our meal. The price, of our meal, was very comparable to eating in other restaurants. We never got up early enough to try the breakfast. The price of the breakfast had been reduced to 13,50 Euros.Overall, the price of the hotel was great given the location. I would definitely consider staying here again, but I would bring my own washcloth and would try to go when I knew it would be rather cool.

<Content>Great Location We stayed for 10 days and enjoyed the hotel. It was clean, the room was a good size, the service was good. We liked being able to safely open the window of our third floor room for fresh air. The location is great in that it is easy to walk to most tourist places easily. The tram stop is just down the road - less than 5 minutes walk. There are numerous good restaurants handy.

<Content>excellent location my wife and i stayed here for the weekend 8-11th april. Taxi from the airport was 45eu but we did get to see apart of the town we wouldnt normally have!!i would like to mirror the previous writers comments. The breakfast was ok but not worth the 16eu per person. it wasnt til the last day that we found a great place to eat for breakfast, in dam square to the left of the palace as you view it , new cafe (seating outside).apart from that the hotel was clean and the staff friendly.we visited the sex museam ok and the torture museam not so ok.we recommend tour company Best of holland and in particular the city tour by coach and boat 32eu.the hardrock cafe was, as usual good value and for a late nite drink try cafe alto. live jazz . This was abit difficult to find, pick up one of the cards in reception but its only 10mins walk from the hard rock, if you find bergerking then its just to the right of that. excellent get there early!! we also found just off dam square (facing monument , road to the right dam street about 100yds on rh side) argentinos (blue canopy over window) steak to die for, really did melt in the mouth!!!there is alot of construction in the redlight area and alot of weirdos but the women in the larder fridges were an interesting diversion!!have fun

<Content>excellent base for the city This hotel is ideally situated for walking around Amsterdam. Within walking distance of all major attractions. The rooms were very nice, with all the usual conveniences, including tea and coffee making facilities. The breakfast in the hotel was very good, but a bit pricey 16 euros, but they didn't charge for the young children. The hotel bar was small but ok for a nightcap. There were a few bars just down the road which did the usual snacks and drinks, the Luxembourg to name one was very friendly and good with the kids. about 15 minute walk to Anne Frank House. Throughly enjoyed Amsterdam, but look out for the bikes, and Trams, they come from everywhere! Get to the Anne Frank house early if you can, we were there just after 9am, and no queues and walked straight in, but we passed by later in the morning on a canal cruise and the queue was quite long. Madam Tussauds worth a visit, bit pricey but kept the kids entertained for a while.

<Content>Only if there was nothing else available I might have been spoiled after spending 5 days in an amazing hotel in London (the Queensgate), but the NH wasn't really anything to write home about. It smelled like cigarette smoke everywhere, from the lobby to the elevator to the room. The bed was not comfortable and the room just felt dirty. On the plus side, the room was larger than anything I've come across in Europe and reception was pleasant and helpful.The best part of the hotel was its location -- it was central and allowed for easy access to all the majot sites.I suppose if the price was right, I could make a reservation again. Maybe.

<Content>Wouldn't stay anywhere else I don't know what the guy who said it stank and the location is bad was on about. The staff are helpful, the location is great and the luggage storage room was very good, they give you a ticket, unlike some other hotels i've stayed at.It's a 5 to 10 minute walk max to the main areas of town, and all the good coffee shops. There's one just down the street called Kajinksy or something, nice friendly place.I asked for a room with 2 single beds, when we got to the room it was one big bed but you could split them. The beds seemed soft enough to me, but after the days I had anything would have been ok.I really don't understand it when someone says a room stinks, man, just go ask for another room. If you really want to be sure of success, do it when other guests are around.I used TripAdvisor to scout this hotel, and as usual, I got what I expected. I'm going back at the end of May to celebrate my 21st...i'm glad I know how good the hotel is already!

<Content>Mercedes Like (Nordic, Spartan, Functional, Clean) Hotel Stayed here February 2 through 8, 2005 as part of a Gate1Travel package. We had newly refurbished rooms which were quite large by European standards. I thought this was very much like an American Chain hotel in that everything worked and the rooms and common areas were kept clean. I usually stay in Prinsengracht or Jordaan, and this hotel does not have the character of those areas, but a little character wears thin after 2 or 3 days of ascending steeply pitched stairs. The buffet breakfast was great, but I did not eat any other meals in the restaurant. There are lots of good restaurants in the neighborhood (including a very expensive French one next door). The Indonesian place across the street was fantastic and quite reasonable even in devalued US dollars. Location wise, this hotel is ideal for tourists in Amsterdam because it is near everything yet still relatively quiet. The major tram line (Spui stop) is one block away and Albert Hejn supermarket is one tram stop away. Many restaurants and coffee shops right in the neighborhood; the major shopping street of downtown Amsterdam is two blocks over.All in all, a great hotel. A little lacking in Dutch quaintness if that is important to you.

<Content>Weekend in Amsterdam I stayed in this hotel for a short weekend in March 2005, the locations very good, right in the centre of Amsterdam (within walking distance of the Central Station) the room are very small (and the bathrooms even smaller) although spotlessly clean. Didn鈥檛 have a breakfast in the hotel so can鈥檛 comment whether they are good or bad (there is a very good Dutch bar approx 100 metres up the road next to Bobs Youths hostel that does very nice breakfast though, sorry remember the name in Dutch but translates to the 鈥榗rew lounge鈥?or similar in English. There is a 鈥榤ini red light district鈥?at the rear of the hotel, but this wasn鈥檛 a problem, and the carpet throughout the hotel is positively disgusting鈥?.enjoy your stay.

<Content>Great Hotel andLocation Stayed in this Hotel March '05. Staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were a decent size and clean (also includes a powerful hairdryer), the tram stops a 30 second walk away and the 3 best coffeeshops are right around the corner. If you are interested, Kalverstraat, Dam, and leidseplein are also short walks away. The only complaint is housekeeping was not completed until 3:00pm on some days. When we return to Amsterdam this will be our Hotel of choice

<Content>A 'diamond' in central Amsterdam We have just returned from a wonderful 5 day break in Amsterdam - we were first time visitors and we can't wait to return!!! The NH City Centre should be reclassified - it is well above 3* status. We found everything about it excellent - the staff, the food, the room and the location which meant that we could walk to all the must see sights very easily. Local restaurants were very good; we ate at the Tapas bar, the Tiger Javanese restaurant and the Caprese Italian place which were all just across the road from the NH front door. The Luxembourg bar which is just up the road is superb for both snacks and more substantial meals and the staff there are very friendly and helpful.Some other reviewers have commented on the small size of the rooms at the NH- to us they were comparable to British chain hotels and we were happy with the tea+coffee and TV which had BBC1+2 and a pay to view facility. The shower was powerful and toiletries and towels were replaced every day.Beds were very comfortable and immaculately clean.Travel from the Central Station was cheap, fast and efficient - we visited Haarlem(very attractive) and Zaanse Schans (commercialised but quaint too). When we return we will visit Rotterdam and The Hague-both equally easy to reach and trains are regular and punctual. We have nothing but praise for Amsterdam and the Dutch people we encountered. We may not wait until next year to return and we will DEFINITELY stay at the NH City Centre again.

<Content>Ideal Location We visited Amsterdam in early February and found this hotel to be in a great location for all the attractions of the city. Our room, on the fourth floor, overlooked the Singel canal and was clean and quiet. It seemed to us that the bathroom had been added at a later date which made the room an odd shape and somewhat cramped but as we did`t spend too much time there it was not a problem. The staff were helpfull and the buffet breakfast was fine. There are lots of resturants and bars close by and we found the Spui bar, a few doors from the hotel to be welcoming. We would certainly return to this hotel in the future.

<Content>Great Location but.... small room The location of the hotel was excellent. It was close to everything and a walking distance to the Red Light District and a few stations away from the Anne Frank Museum. But..... the rooms are very small..... kind of has the feel of a business hotel instead of a tourist hotel. And beware of their elevator.......... very very wierd.... at least to us who are used to modern amenities. Just for one night to explore Amsterdam.......? We highly recommend it.

<Content>We'll go there again! This was our second time in Amsterdam and we stayed in the NH Amsterdam City Centre for 5 nights (Jan '05). Booked it through Bookings and got a deal which was good.The hotel is ideally situated on the Spuistraat which is nice and quiet when you want to sleep. Dam Square is less than a five minute walk away as is the Floating Flower Market. There's also a couple of nice coffee shops and a smart shop on the same street if you're into that kind of thing. We were so impressed with the location that we'll be booking this hotel again when we come back.The staff were all lovely and very helpful. Nice italian restaurant downstairs and you can order this food for your room if so inclined. The first night we did this there was a problem in the kitchen, no food after an hour. I rang them back to make sure they hadn't forgotten us and the waiter told me about the problem and he had also knocked 10% off the price of both our orders. Got the food straight away. Very impressed.The room itself was very pretty, nice comfortable bed, window on one whole side of the room, heating that you can adjust yourself (it was freezing when we were there), wooden floors, big shower and MTV and BBC on the telly, woohoo :)The only quibbles I had were both to do with the cleaning staff. Our room was very dusty, looked like it hadn't been done in weeks and the dust bunnies under the bed were as big as my terrier. There was even a layer of dust in the bathroom. The cleaning staff themselves were very loud in the mornings, shouting from one room to the other which woke us up a couple of times.But we'll definitely go back, a 4* masquerading as 3* if you ask me :)

<Content>Smashing hotel We stayed at this hotel for five nights over Christmas 2004. There was no problem with the booking process and on arrival the receptionist was very helpful in giving us the type of rooms we wanted, a standard double and superior twin with canal views. The rooms were done in a modern, simple style and were clean, comfortable and roomy. The location couldn't have been better - one side of the hotel overlooks the Singel Canal - and it's right next to the Nine Streets, which are full of different little shops and cafes, and it's very easy to get to the other main tourist areas by foot. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, so I can't comment on that, but we had one evening meal in the hotel restaurant, which was fine. I would be happy to recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to return there myself.

<Content>Great Location This hotel is in a great location in Amsterdam. The hotel restaurant had an Italian menu which was pretty good. Unfortunately, breakfast was not included in the package and cost 17euros! Staff were also friendly and knowledgeable. The room itself was very clean but quite small...the bed took up much of the space. We found the room to be cold as well especially the wood floors...I'd recommend bringing slippers or wearing thick socks. The bathroom wasn't in great shape either, the sink wasn't draining properly and the toilets weren't very pleasant. But overall, the experience was good and it was nice to be close to the downtown area which is where we spent most of our time anyways!

<Content>*** stayed here in january 2004 just before the hotel changed ownership from ams to ramada with my partner we booked direct with the hotel from home in england they booked a room for us and let us pay when we arrived as we didnt hold a credit card , there were some renovation going on when we arrived ( drilling and loud banging ) ( the hammer type !!!) we complained due to us being up since 4am that morning of our flight they were more than helpful and offered a discount on the room of 20 euros which was nice just some quick advice about the traffic lights there if your walking about listen for the clicking intermittant clicking = wait fast clicking = walk dont get caught by the local police like we did as they will stop you and tell you off they can also fine you we were lucky ! great place to visit will be going again dont spend all your time in the red light district get out and have a look around also thought of changing my name to charlie you'll understand if you go for a walk round the district....

<Content>Perfect Location I stayed here with my partner and another couple in October 2004. For us the location was perfect, right in between Dam Square and the Leidesplein where all the restaurants and bars/cafes are.It was only about a 10 minute walk from Central Station where you could catch a canal bus, these were well worth using because you get to see some beautiul sights.The hotel itself was very clean and the rooms were suprisingly spacious. They only problem I had with it was that the walls must have been very thin because I was awoken every morning by other peoples alarm clocks going off! But it did mean I got up earlier and got to sightsee alot more!The rates were quite expensive (even though we got a deal though Expedia) especially as they didn't include breakfast, but I think you are paying for the location. A typical dutch dreakfast on Dam Square in a tendy cafe called Nieuwe Kafe is superb, it was soo big that we were there for an hour and a half!!

<Author>RichardfromAtlanta
<Content>Clean, classy and solid Just got back to Atlanta this afternoon and thought I would share my thoughts. I unfortunately had to transfer out of my original hotel after the first night there (The Bridge Hotel, where I was assigned to an anfully depressing basement room with non-stop construction noise!). I was fearful about trying to find another last minute, with a convention going on in town, but the NH City Centre had some availabity so I walked over there to check it out. Ended up staying for 4 days and had a very good experience. The location is really prime, along the picturesque Singel canal on the one side, and the bustling Spuistraat, on the other. Convenient to Central Station, all the great walking neighborhoods, shopping, food, etc. The hotel also arranges a shuttle to and from the airport every hour, which is an additional 11 Euros each way, but is very convenient. The room was immaculate and very tastefully designed, recently renovated, and on the contemporary side. Great canal views, large windows. Bathroom in great shape, and extremely clean. Staff was by and large quite curtious and helpful and knowledgable. I only ate one meal there, a buffet breakfast, which was pretty well done if a bit pricey at 13.50 Euros (Amsterdam has gotten to be so expensive!). My biggest complaint was that the cleaning staff gets a little too zealous in the mornings, and had begun making a racket in the hallway on Sunday morning at 9:30. Not so cool, but not a deal breaker. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel, and will likely stay there again next trip.

<Content>Great hotel and great location We had a great time whilst staying at this hotel. The location is ideal with the more quiet and relaxing singel canal and jordan area on one side of the hotel and the bussier Spui and Dam square areas or beyond on the other. The hotel was clean, modern and spacious. There are loads of excellent eating options near Hotel. If you like indonessian food, the kanjill  tiger restaurant (take-away at the rear) is superb. Breakfast is good in cafe Luxenbourg It's a good people watching place with it's glass conservatory overlooking spui square. Bars and coffeeshops to suit all tastes near by too. We enjoyed staying here so much we've just booked to stay again over New Years Eve....See you there!

<Content>Excellent, quiet, if not a bit stale Ideally situated on one of the inner canals (Singel) - walking distance to just about anything you need to see in Amsterdam. Centraal station is about 15 minutes walk - so a taxi is recommended with luggage. The hotel itself is quiet, spotless and surprisingly spacious for an Amsterdam hotel (I don't get the small room comments at all unless they've never been to Europe). Great restaurants and cafes all within a stones throw. The only negative is it feels like a business hotel and is rather boring. But that's a very minor complaint and the only distinguishing factor from a 5 star rating.

<Content>minibar rip off An average hotel with an unpleasant policy of falsely charging your credit card after the fact.In this case we were falsely charged substantially for the minibar. Complete rip-off, beware, this hotel is scamming.

<Content>Great location great hotel... The great reviews on this site were correct, the NH city centre really is a great hotel. The staff were all very helpful and the hotel is spotless and pretty quiet and in a great location away from the main tourist squares. The spui is one of my favourite squares in Amsterdam and the hotel couldnt be closer. We were staying a week and after seeing another room, (yes, we were offered a choice!) we chose one on the ground floor with a great canal view, the room was big with high ceilings and wooden floors and the bathroom was clean and bright. Having read the other reviews about the great wee breakfast and lunch place on the canal side of the hotel (Broodje Berts) we went there and found it the perfect place for Breakfast or lunch, the bakers just thru the alley is also delicious. We ate in the Hotel bar the first night, and again the staff were great and the food was also good would stay here again time after time as you cant go wrong.

<Content>helpful freindly clean and comfortable What can i say.....FANTASTIC! the room was an average size (standard rm) but plenty big enuff for two. The service and helpfullness of staff was impeccable. The room was kept spotless by the maid who was very pleasant and sorted out our sugar shrtage problem with a smile. The location is fantastic, smack bang in the middle and an ideal location to explore A'dam from. By cutting thru the alley across the street from the main entrance you get to the tram stop......No 2  i think 5 on these two trams you could go down to the liedesplein or carry on to the museum district or go upto the back of the dam palace and central statio in the opposite direction. I wo8uld recomend getting a travel pass (24, 48, 72hour) 6.5, 10, 13 eu great value,....as soon as u arrive fromn the info office by central station. it can get a bit heavy on the legs and feet.As mentioned in an earlier review if you leave the hotel by the canalside exit and swing a right theres a great place for breakfast and reasonably priced.One thing that i thought was great was that they never charged for the security boxes...just request it at reception.....and yr valuables are kept in deposit boxes behind reception......all in all a great place to stay not like some of the pits i have stayed in here

<Content>NH City Centre Better Than Most I have stay here twice and would again. It should be a 4 star hotel. However prices have gone up since I first stayed in June 2003. It is clean and has an excellent breakfast. Staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are small but have nice sized bathrooms and the location is great and that end of the Spui is quiet.All rooms in Europe and Amsterdam especially are smaller than USA and much more expensive (you have to fund socialism). Get used to it. Rooms here are bigger than others in Amsterdam, they are clean, you can store luggage, check in early, they will arrange a Mercedes limo to go to the stadium or concert hall for 25euro, etc.Beware in Amsterdam of other 3 star hotels. I have stayed at 2 others and the rooms are tiny, beds are dirty, threadbare sheets, bad smells, bad service, etc.
