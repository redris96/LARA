<Content>do not go to this hotel Date of Service Dec 14-21Place: Barcel贸 Dominican Beach Resort, Punta CanaI found that the hotel not to be of sufficient standards to be ranked as a five star hotel, based upon the quality of service and the failure to deal with concerns and problems as they arose. My first concern was the noisiness, and lack of privacy of my first room Although this was close to the beach which was lovely, I asked for a different location as the room was not private (people could look straight into my room as they walked along the path, unless I closed the curtains completely) and most of all it was extremely noisy. Every day Pellicano Watersports would play loud music piped through loudspeakers for no apparent reason. I complained and they said I had to speak to their manager to stop this practice. This was also the outfit which I booked my scuba through and they were more than unhelpful for a number of other reasons. The staff went on strike for a day鈥檚 excursion for which I was booked to make 2 dives鈥攁pparently because the hotel had not paid the staff. They also took me out in a whaleboat without a ladder for a dive in which I ended up extremely seasick and with vertigo, and for which I had to consult a doctor at the hotel. One of the staff members also tried to charge me 15% above the rate he had quoted me verbally and it was only when I noticed the discrepancy that the initial charge was voided and recharged correctly. This speaks to a patter of disorganization, dishonesty and unprofessonalism. My room also lacked a bottle opener which meant I could use no items from the mini bar. I complained about this to the maintenance staff but never received an opener. I also complained about the fact that there were no working light bulbs outside my room which made it both dangerous and unsafe for a person after hours. I had to feel my way in pitch dark just to find my room. My request for a light bulb was rectified. I had a lumpy bed (I later discovered the entire hotel had ancient beds with large dips, over which they simply placed mattress pads to cover the dips.) These were extremely uncomfortable and not appropriate for a five star hotel.In general Barcelo was unsatisfactory because of 1) poor quality of the beds2) continuous noise (everywhere on the hotel there was piped music which was far from restful. Repeatedly playing frenetic Christmas carols around the lobby area and restaurant, and throughout the landscaped gardens transformed a beautiful location into a noisy nightmare. After complaining about the noise, I was transferred to Room 5409, which was no quieter, as I was woken every afternoon by music on the beach and various disco parties.3) poor quality food and service: Not up to the standards I had come to expect with Apple Vacations and my previous experience with the Grand Sirenis ( admittedly a five not four star apple rating).Ironically after complaining to Apple about the service , I found the door ajar to my room (I had not left it open). Fortunately nothing had been stolen. I reported this immediately, and later staff appeared to fix the door which blew open in the wind. It was very lucky that nothing was stolen, as I had a computer in my room which could not fit into the room safe.I spent more time than I wanted to on my holiday complaining about these problems, and in the end I just couldn鈥檛 wait to leave. When I first checked in, I was told I had to wait 4 hours to get my room, and when I asked to place my computer in the hotel safe, so I could go and eat and swim, I was told that there were no such facilities to place the computer. Since when does a hotel not have a safe for guests to use besides those in the rooms? I never received a report back as to why my room was open, and whose fault it was. I never received so much as an apology for this incident. Repeatedly staff would burst into my room when I was changing barely pausing after the initial knock. The TV remote did not work in the first room and was missing in the second room. My telephone was broken in my first room, and I actually repaired it in the end because I was told I would have to wait several days for a technician to come. (Frayed wire was the problem which led to a faulty connection). A half day excursion to a coffee plantation which I booked through Apple was cancelled and although Apple sent me notification the night before I never received it because it was sent to the wrong room. As a result I sat there for several hours waiting for a tour which never came, and the day was wasted when I could have taken an excursion with a different company. The problems continued even as I was checking out, with an unhelpful staff member at the front desk telling me they required exact cash to pay for my telephone bill (which I had to then go off and get).I have had a great deal of travel experience, and I know no place is perfect. The key is rectifying a problem promptly and courteously when an issue arises, and I did not find that Barcelo did this. A simple apology and knocking a trvial amount off the bill like my $ 10 phone charge would probably have been enough for me to be happy. Trivial things like missing TV remotes and bottle openers start to become exasperating when you have to chase around people to get replacements or service, when you are supposed to be concentrating on your holiday and free time, not waiting in long lines to speak to guest services or the front desk. While some of the issues were trivial,a number were very serious (e.g. my door being open and the unprofessional staff of The Pellicano Water sports).Kirsten Thompson

<Content>stonefaced staff I have read some of the reviews about staff. It is true, you can tip, it makes no difference, or do you even get a smile from them. One of the beach bartenders made me feel like i was intruding on her cell phone call. Knowing a few words in spanish is very useful here, 99% do not speak english.(or pretend not to) Food wise, i found it much better than other resorts in Punta Cana, but i would bring immodium anyways. There is a beach buffet for lunch, though it is small, and a bbq burger stand on the beach, as well as a 24 hr pizza shop (good pizzas) Maid service is hit and miss, once again , they don't speak english. They like to clean early in the morn ( if you miss that, then, hit and miss when they come back) Either they run out of supplies, ie towels, toilet paper or they just don't care if you have it in your room or not. Tipping them does not seem to matter either. On the first night there, while on our balcony, one of the guys that delivered supplies to the building chatted us up. He was tipped well, every night he would drop by and we had a list of what we needed, ie towels, bottled water, beer, coffee etc. He merited tipping, only person there that cared, and actually smiled. Rooms need upgrading, they are basic, but do need new beds and fixtures, otherwise roomy and never ran out of hot water.

<Content>Awsome Vacation I don;t know whay this resort gets such a bad rap on this website. I stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach and i thought it was great i was there from Dec 29 - Jan 5. Before leaving on my trip i was really worried because i had read the reviews on this website .... take my word for it, this place is awsome.... Just got back home this morning and i miss it so much.... The food was alright, nothing special, always a wide variety of things to eat, but nothing really to complain about... the people who work there are awsome i met a good five or six people who made my trip that much more enjoyable . Daniel the super MC and the star of ICEBREAKER TIME, took me and all my friends to a club called imagin off the resort (its in a cave very cool....check it out if you can) All the entertaininers and servers seem happy to be there and serve you.... Juan the bartender was great. !!! Aiiiiiii...... The Beach was amazing,always clean, always enough chairs. Weather was beatiful. I went on two excursions, the sunset cruise and the jurassic buggys.... Both were very entertaining.... The rooms were alright, my A/C wasn't working really well but i never complained about it, the beds are kind of concaved. So i would say the only down side to the trip was the room but even then it wasnt very bad .... Anyone will have an amazing time here.

<Content>Starved for a week... My fiancee and his family went to this hotel for a family vacation. We were so excited, but the first night we got there we walked into our rooms and that is when the problems began. Our room was not cleaned from the previous tenant, there were bugs on the floor in the bathroom, my mother in laws shower leaked all the way into their bedroom, our lamp was broken and the beds were absolutly terrible. These problems were not fixed until the third day of our trip. It took numerous times complaining to guest services and overall they were very rude to deal with. The staff never smiled and were not friendly in the least. The food was also a major disappointment. The buffet food was cold and repetitive and the a la carte restaurants were adequate. The mexican and Japanese were our favorites. To make a reservation at these restaurants you have to get up at 6 am and wait in a line. The italian restaurant was the worst and i sent my COLD meal back 2 times until i lost my appetite. The only glimpse of hope for this hotel is the beach. It was amazing and there were always alot of chairs. The music that they played near the hotel rooms and the beach got rather annoying after hearing jingle bells over 50 times a day. Overall for the amount of money that we paid to stay here was not worth it at all. We will never go back to this hotel and it should be marketed as a 3 star. Dont let your travel agents tell you any different and stay away from Block 7 hotel rooms.

<Content>Wonderful beach, pretty grounds, pretty bad service This was my 3rd trip to Punta Cana and 12th to the Carribean. I am in my late 20s, have travelled extensively with family, friends and my husband. I am very easy going (even spent a week in Cuba once during the summer months without a working A/C, living on rice and had a great time).With that in my mind, I'd like to give a very blunt overview of our Christmas vacation in Barcelo Dominican.BEACH - I love Punta Cana for its beach and the beach in front of the hotel is beautiful and worth the trip. I never had any issues with seaweed that people complain about - it's fairly clean and if ever anything washes up, it's the ocean so deal with it. There's bars and restaurants by the beach (on both ends of the hotel), volleyball, activities, whatever you want. We were there during peak time and always found available beach chairs.FOOD - I don't go to the Carribean for the food (expect St Maarten maybe). But in general, the food was good. Good enough that we didn't even care to go to the ala carte restaurants. You can always find something good to eat, lots of fish, great soups, fruit, always something grilled during dinner time. I liked both buffet restaurants, the Pizzeria was good enough, as was the beach snack bar. I had no digestion problems or any other issues with food and was quite pleased.HOTEL GROUNDS - very well maintained and beautifully lit up during the holidays. We walked around the resort a lot and did not find one problem or area that work in progress. It's very park like and nicely cared for. And out of all the hotel staff, the gardeners were the nicest (so we tipped them just because we liked them).ROOMS - we were on the ground floor in block 99 (more about that later). The room was your standard Carribean room, nice washroom (seems renovated), electronic safe, stocked mini fridge (but only with water and pop, no alcohol as advertised), and the beds have these coushin like pads under the sheets so they are fairly comfy. Our TV didn't work all the time, but we didn't care. All the rooms have balconies. I have nothing bad to say about the room.OTHER - loved Le Cafe - definitely go check it out and enjoy a nice cappucino. The pools are also decent, even though we never used them. You have internet service, a spa, a sports bar and a whole load of facilites to entertain you.So to summarize - the hotel is very nice and well maintained, beach is beautiful, food is good - it's almost a fantastic trip except for horrible service and management we ran into (but it could have just been our luck), so read on.COMPLAINTS - I am writing this section in hopes of hotel management reading it. We arrived at 1 am due to a major delay from Toronto because of snow. Because of that we ended up in block 99 which is very far from the lobby and the main area. We did not mind the walk though and the Coco restaurant was very close and pretty good. Upon our arrival, our A/C did not work, our toilet did not flush, our TV did not work and it took two days to fix the first two problems. We gave up on the 3rd. Housekeeping is awful!! We tipped every day in advance and every day we had NO towels. Not one. Each day I had to call guest services to ask for towels in the bathroom (even if we did not throw them on the floor, the chambermaid would take them and not replace them, so we started hiding them in our luggage!). Every day it took 4 hours to get towels to our room!! And honestly, if Guest Services just told me that the hotel was doing a wash, I'd understand, but they always told me they make a report and I should wait in my room. One guy even hung up on me when I called and said I had no towels. I realize the hotel was filled to capacity and they ran out of bathroom towels, but being honest with your guests instead of lying and hanging up is much more recommended.On top of the towel issue, our maid left our balcony door open every day even though we were on the ground floor. I left her a note in Spanish asking to please lock, and she totally ignored it. The entire trip we had our patio doors open during the day - thank God at least there's honest guests and workers roaming around.Beach towels posed a huge problem. Every day was a 3 hour wait (if you're lucky) and while I do realize the hotel is at capacity and don't mind waiting, it's the attitude of the ladies working at the towel booth that almost caused a riot at our hotel. Guests were furious. A lady speaking French got yelled at and laughed at for not speaking English. The girls at the counter started taking reservations for towels, but when you came back they changed shift, threw out the reservations and just told you no towel and if you inquired about the reservation system, they blamed it on the girl who left somewhere. We changed our towels twice in 7 days and that was painful b/c it rained every day and the towels would get wet and soggy. For crying out loud, get some more towels and get some nicer girls working there. They rudely kept on telling everyone they don't know when the towels will be ready and then ignored everyone and just gossiped in Spanish while all the guests were standing around like lost sheep. I have NEVER in all my travels seen worse staff attitude. I have a minor in Spanish and understood their conversations and cannot believe how horribly they talked about the guests in front of their faces.But the worst encounter had to be with the front desk staff. They lie to get you to leave or just pretend they know nothing and turn their backs. I asked about departure tax, they just said I don't know and walked away. I tried to book a reservation for the Xmas dinner and they said I didn't need one. Well, guess what - us, and two other families did not get a seat at the Xmas dinner because you did need a reservation!! Because the resort is huge and we were at block 99 (very far from centre), whenever we stopped by for some direction on the resort map, they would just say  I don't know and walk off. It's like the hotel just picked up the stupidest people off the street and gave them jobs. And finally for the hotel management - the resort is large and for people who are on the Cana side, some kind of signs/directrion would be beneficial on the resort. Not once is there a sign pointing to the lobby or restaurants, just the gift shop!! If you put the people in block 99 by the barb wire walls, then please at least give us some direction of where to walk to since your reception staff does not know anything!In general, the hotel is great, and I'd consider going back but never in the high season and you're on your own if you need any kind of help there.

<Content>Enjoyed the Barcelo Dominican Beach I travelled to the Barcelo Dominican Beach resort in Punta Cana with my wife, brother  sister and their significant others. We were there for a week in early December. The weather was a little hit and miss with clouds and showers occasionally. Check in was a little slow but it all depends how many people arrive at the same time. We were greeted with a cold beverage while we were waiting which was a nice touch. Overall the resort and grounds were beautiful. The rooms were adequate and kept very clean. They were a little dated but we weren't in Punta Cana to sit in the rooms. The beach was incredible and the ocean was very refreshing. The pool was very nice, a little cool when you first went in but great once you got use to it. We really enjoyed the Wasabi restaurant and wished we would have went there sooner. We also checked out the Italian restaurant. It was alright and some selections were better than others. I enjoyed the fillet mignon there. The buffet restaurants were fine also and you could always find something to eat. The pizzas were very good also. We walked down to the market one day and were mobbed by the vendors. They are quite pushy and have a hard time taking no for an answer. We walked down the beach to the right of the resort for quite a ways and found a couple of shops where the vendors were a little better to deal with and not as pushy. We met some very nice people from all over the world there and had a great time with them. We also did the Bavarro Runners tour and enjoyed it immensely. It is always nice to get away from the resorts and see the country side. Overall we would like to return again someday.

<Content>Wonderful trip! My family and I decided to spend Christmas in Punta Cana and we ended up having a terrific time. I was a tad worried after reading some of the more negative reviews about the hotel, but after spending a week at the Barcelo Dominican Beach Resort, I have nothing but praise for the hotel. FOOD: The food was delicious!! Good variety to ensure that everyone was satisfied. The smoothies in the morning were to die for. Try to get Super Mario as your waiter at the large buffet- what an amazing guy!!!HOTEL ROOM: Our room met the needs for 4 individuals. Nothing spectacular, but then again, we were in Punta Cana to be on the beach, not in a hotel room. It was clean and comfortable...what more could we ask for? We did have a problem with acquiring a safety deposit key. The workers at the front desk told us they were out of keys. We finally went to see our travel rep, and the problem was solved in a matter of minutes.ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment staff was incredible! These guys were so energetic and friendly. Lots of activities throughout the day and the night shows were a lot of fun. They could only speak limited English, but as long as you showed up and participated in their activitiees and dance lessons, they loved you! BEACH: The beach was stunning. You could just keep walking on soft white sand for miles. I had read that vendors were a problem, but I didn't really think so. When they approach you to have your hair braided, etc. , just smile and say no, and they'll leave you alone. Being friendly and firm is key. There are also stray dogs that wander the beach- they are sweet and totally unaggressive. Security guards also patrol the area- both day and night, so it is very safe.OVERALL COMMENTS: Language was not really an issue- although one could not really carry on a conversation with most of the employees. They really do appreciate the effort when you incorporate Spanish words into your vocabulary- gracias, buenos dias, etc. I also spoke to other guests, and it appears as though check-in is usually quite slow, so be ready for a wait. (But don't despair...at least you have finally made it to the resort!!) The workers (whether it be the maids, bartenders, entertainment crew, etc. ) go out of their way to make sure that your trip is a memorable one.

<Content>Great Resort! To all Canadians. My fiance and I just stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach for one week and had a fantastic trip. The resort grounds are big.....but not too big, the food was good and offered a variety of dishes using their theme night procedure, the beach was beautiful and the drinks were great. You must check out: Le Cafe (their version of a Starbucks), the Italian a la carte restaurant, the Japanese a la carte restaurant. Avoid: the Jurassic Buggy excursion and the ham. We did the Marinarium excursion which was absolutely great and well worth the money spent. We also loved the Zipline Adventures excursion.....the trip to the mountains was a bit long and very bumpy....but worth every minute. I would not recommend the Jurassic Buggy excursion....we didn't drive the buggies much and kept stopping at local vending spots to be hounded into purchasing souvenirs.....we couldn't even have a bottle of water without spending close to $5 US. Save your money and don't do this excursion. There are 3 large pools on the resort grounds......each offering something different. The swim up bar was great and always offered quick service. It seemed as though there was a different bar every 30 feet which was great.....and the 24 hour snack bar offered a variety of pizzas, burgers, and hot dogs. You'll never go thirsty or hungry at this resort. Language barrier......I don't speak a lot of Spanish but I never really had a problem communicating with anyone at the resort. If you know French it would help a little.....I do.....and found I used it frequently. This is our second time going to Punta Cana......loved the resort and would recommend it to anyone. Trust BARCELO....you can't go wrong. Good luck and happy holidays.

<Content>Great time at Barcelo Dominican The comments re employees speaking little English applies only to groundskeepers and some of the maids. I have seen many tourists pointing impolitely to food items at the omelet station with never a please or thank you in any language. News flash, people: one of the omelet makers (a gorgeous young man) speaks FOUR languages. As soon as I looked at him and greeted him with Hola, Buenas Dias``, his face lit upat the simple courtesy. Every day thereafter he greated me warmly in both Spanish  English -- so open your minds and hearts, fellow travelers, and you will have a much nicer vacation. I also compliment the reception desk staff -- any problem I had was quickly attended to, whether I went to the reception in person or phoned in my request. A pleasant attitude goes a long way, I think. Get more with honey than with vinegar``, or however that saying goes. Because check in is not til 3 pm, be sure to take your swimsuit, flipflops, suncream, etc. in your carry on and get to the beach or pool (or bar!) immediately. Enjoy!Beach - plenty of lounges, but sometimes hard to get a palapa. However, check out the palms and palapas for the direction of the shade and you will be fine. Vendors are not a bother--and if they are, just say No Gracias firmly and they leave you alone. The sand is quite light, so the ocean is an incredible azure! No rocks. In fact, nothing for fish to find shelter in, so no snorkeling at the beach (a major disappointment ). Grounds - beautiifully tended. Boulders are actually speakers that pipe music softly along the walkways. Lovely ponds and fountains with a bridgeway near the main buffet. Several pools, each with a bar - my favorite was the quiet pool behind Block 7 with its small water feature. Snack bar also.Drinks - the hard liquor is watered down, but the way most of us drink on vacation, that is probably a life saver! The vermouth is foul -- had to forego my favorite drink while there (martini), but made for a lovely treaton arriving home.Food - never a problem with food. Lots of variety-fish,chicken,lamb,pork,beef, salads, desserts (including a serve yourself ice cream area). Bahia Restaurant at beach nice for lunch.Specialty Restaurants - a nice change from the buffet for dinner. My favorites were the Mexican and Italian. Found service in the Spanish very lackluster (though it could just have been an off night`` The Wasabi (Japanese) is really a glorified stir fry and much too loud (I'm from Vancouver and our Benihana's, etc. are naturally far superior).Le Cafe - this little gem is beside the Casino and offers scrumptious desserts and hot  cold coffee drinks (with or without alcohol) day  night. It is airconditioned and a lovely spot to cool off -- or sit in the courtyard or terrace outside.Shows - some were terrific, others not so much. Much better than at Breezes Jibacoa in Cuba, though. Animation team were cheerful many remembered my name after one or two meetings.Rooms - I had an end room in Block 7 with a balcony overlooking the quiet pool (with a handy telescoping line dryer for wet clothes), and a little alcove with table, lamp and two easy chairs. Lovely cushiony mattress pad made for very comfortable sleeping. My only complaint: the bath tubs are VERY shallow and in urgent need of refinishing/replacement. If they were deep (like in Mexico and Cuba), I would have given the room a 10. Hot water throughout my 15 day stay. Maid only screwed up once by forgetting towels  water (mini fridge holds water, beer and soda (replenished daily)--soon rectified by housekeeping. No charge for room safes (electronic).Disco usually busy by 11 pm -- good variety of music. All ages seemed to be having a great time. All in all, I had a lovely vacation. Met terrific people from Canada (Hi Cecelia, Matt the superdancer, Brenda  Dennis, Jeanette  Ted, and Dan), the Netherlands (Hi Danny  IIlona), Belgium (Hi Harry) and the US (Hi Rich). Other travelers came from Russia, England, Italy, Spain, Ireland (Hi Donna  Jacko)., so it made for an interesting international experience. Lobby Bar was a great place to meet or hang out before or after dinner. Though I didn`t have the nerve to try it, I you can usually work a deal`with parasailing for a better price. Everyone who did it, loved it. Maybe one of these days I`ll get up the courage (LOL).

<Content>Absolutely awful This hotel was classed as Four Star plus in Thomas Cook holiday brochures but in my opinion it should be TWO star, THREE at a push.This is the third time that I have visited the Dominican Republic and because of my expereince at this hotel, it will be the last for a very long time.1. We changed rooms THREE times in one day because they were simply flithy or below standard.2. The service in the retaurants were absolutely awful, we have to find our own clean knife and fork to use.3. We felt that we were interupting the waiters social life when we asked for service.4. The food was NEVER PIPING HOT, mostly luke warm and often cold.5. We were only able to exchange our beach towels THREE times in the entire fortnight as there were never any available.6. The 'filtered water' was filled up from the cold water tap!!!7. The maids would remove your towels first thing in the morning and return with them at the end of their shift which was after four in the afternoon.8. We reported these to Customer Relations at the hotel but nothing was ever resolved.9. The manager seriously lacks CUSTOMER CARE skills. What a waste of two weeks and a hell of a lot of money.

<Content>Not Impressed We just got back from Barcelo Dominican. Well to start with we checked in and were given a key and they pointed to where we had to go. Finally someone came by with a golf cart and brought our stuff to our room for us. Real simple room. Older with no view except for the back of the childrens play area. RIGHT next door to the massage room where the women there made lots of noise right next our door early in the morning. ( oh and by the way, these are not opinions just facts of what happened ) We found that the refrigerator didnt work and was leaking on the floor. we called the front desk and .....well when we left 7 days later it still wasnt replaced. The tv didnt work and they kept bringing me more remotes...lol. IT WAS THE TV ITSELF...BIG BLACK BOX IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. wow, Now i know you're saying...that's it? no but the other stuff was small and acceptable. Over all i guess i would say that they need lots of improvement on communication and taking care of their guests needs more. Oh i forgot to mention about the mouse in our room and the safe didnt work. lol. sorry but it all happened. But there is a good side to it all.....the ala carte restaurants were fun and good food and they mixed the drinks good.

<Content>Had good points but mostly not too good. This is our 3rd tropical vacation, but our first time in the Dominican Republic. This hotel was listed as a 4+ star hotel on Westjet Vacations website. This hotel in our opinion was more like a 3 or 2+ star resort. There were some good points:The vacation was really inexpensive. $2300.00 for 2 people travelling for 11 days from Thunder Bay. Upon our arrival to our first room, we found copious amounts of mould and promptly switched rooms. Our second room was better but there was still mould in our shower/tub area around the taps. The beds were saggy and desperatly need to be changed. We found on 3 different occasions a REALLY BIG bug. This bug was a really really fast little bugger too! It looked sort of like a cockroach/beetle approximately the size of a small mouse. NOT FUN!! We also found a huge centipede!! ( about 6 inches long... gross!!) This little thing was fast too!! And.. hard to kill!! My love quickly hammered it with a shoe.. but the thing would just not die!! Eventually he did manage to kick its little 100 legged butt! But definatly did not do much for our confidence in our room so all of our stuff promptly was stored off the floor! The grounds had the potential to be incredible, but all around us this putrid scent of sewer was everywhere! It was especially bad near the buffet! They likely had some septic problem but it was definitly not appetizing to say the least. The food prep was questionable. My love got really really sick from food at the Mexican Restaurant. He actually had to see the doctor even. He is still feeling residual sickness as of this writing. The choices were lacking a bit, especially in the fruit section. We had melons and bananas everyday but no other kinds of fruit.There are NO blender drinks!! If you want a Pina Colada, you will get instead a Pina slushie.. same as if you want a Strawberry Daqueri.. you will get a Strawberry slushie... You can`t leave the resort... Too Dangerous. Now, on the plus side.... and there are great plusses.. The beach is magnificent! One of the nicest we have ever seen! The sand is as soft as powdered sugar! Gorgeous! The service was really good too. We tipped ( we think) generously and were rewarded with flowers around our sink and our bed covers arranged in fancy ways. We had prompt service at the bars and coffee house and everyone tried really hard to please us. The Brazilian restaurant was terrific! The food was hot and yummy! The entertainment was good, the Anamacion people did a great job on the beach and at night! They were funny and had interesting and fun games to play, on and off the beach!! The coffee house was amazing with the best coffee I have ever had in my life!!!!In our opinion, there are other better hotels out there, we will definatly not go back here.

<Content>Had a blast! Ok... where to start? The Beach : The beach was always kept fairly clean. If you find seaweed washes up that is because it's an ocean and they can't control that. The Pool: Surprisingly the pool with the bar wasn't very busy so service was pretty quick. Except on weekends when they allow the locals into the resort. It was kept clean as well. The Rooms: The rooms were a little outdated, but if your there to sit in your room and pick things out like that, then maybe you shouldn't go on vacation! The Staff: Staff is very friendly. The Buffet: Buffet was good. A little repetitive, but that was fine for me. When you go to the main buffet sit in Super Mario's section. He was great to us the whole week we spent there. In fact, it was my mom's birthday while we were there and we asked him to set something up for her as a surprise and what a great job he did. He set up a table with balloons and they brought out a cake and sang happy birthday to her. And they had some really nice champange as well. The grounds: The grounds were again always kept clean. The hedges always trimmed. All in all it was a great trip and myself and my family had a great trip! I would go back tomorrow!

<Content>great holiday When we had booked our holiday we looked at the reviews on trip advisor and held our breathe. The reviews were far from great.On arrival at our hotel we were delighted. In the rooms there was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, combs, shower caps, a sewing kit and a coffee maker. Also a fully stocked fridge.Ths maid service was excellant we had clean linen each day.The actual hotel was lovely with many bars pools and restaraunts. The selection of food and drinks was superb.At the pizza bar you could eat and drink 24hrs a day. There is an english speaking woman named Santa who is there to help guests and her service was second to none. She was there in a flash when I suffered from prickly heat and brought me some aloe vera leaves which work a treat she also gave me a knife to score the leaves to extract the sap.The waiters couldnt do enough for you they are polite and helpful and will help with advice about where to shop etc.as per usual market shopping is a nightmare as you dont get much peace ,never tell them that you will look at their goods on the way back as they will wait and wont forget. It is best to remain polite and say you are not buying today.Back to the hotel. As with any resort in the Dom the food is always luke warm it is very good but never hot. It is advisable to take a generous supply of tummy solutions with you. The mosquitoes lay in wait for guests too. I think they love our pale skin. The main complaint I had at this hotel was the poor supply of beach towels so when you get some dont give them back perhaps just change them when you really need to. Overall the holiday was fabulous the hotel is lovely the entertainment is alittle repetative but if you want a nice break to rest and be waited on you need to book up. We had a fantastic time.

<Content>Time for Upgrades! We were at this resort November 20 through 27, 2008. My daughter and I (out of Toronto) met my sister from Calgary and her two sons. Although my flight was delayed three hours out of Toronto, I arrived to be greeted with a drink - by my sister.I should have known, when we got off the bus - that this resort was not going to be the 4 star as promised. There was only 5 of us who got off that bus.The rooms were substandard, the food followed suit. Although, the a la carte restaurants were far better then the buffets. The lunch buffet by the ocean is far better then the main buffet.We did not get a good deal on this vacation, as we were traveling from two different provinces. This was the only resort that we could find that would allow us to arrive and depart on the same day. Carlos at Guest Services was quite nice. Joel on the first night we arrived made sure we eventually got moved - although we were moved to block six, the rooms were still substandard. The lock to my sliding glass door fell out into my hand on the first night. My air conditioning failed after day two, and the smell of must was disgusting.The five of us did have a marvelous vacation, as a vacation is what you make it - not the rooms or the meals. We met some wonderful people, and had good laughs about the resort. We met very few people who thought this resort was worth the money paid. Unless all you want out of your vacation is to spend it drunk, stumbling around - this resort is not for you. For warned is for armed!!

<Content>Trust the Reviews - Very Disgusted! We stayed at this resort in November. First of all, for the people that say they were not bothered by vendors on the beach, are not telling the truth. We were on average harassed by 10-15 people a day. They are located throughout the resort and they start bothering you from the time you leave your room, to the time you get to the beach and all the time you are there. They do walk away if you say No Thank You very firmly. I suggest getting a good tan before you go because if you look completely untanned, that is like a dollar sign to them. Your tour guides will not recommend you purchase any excursions from anyone on the beach. They will only cover you for liability reasons if you book through them (the tour you are with) so beware.The food was horrible. Never eat any salads or anything with oils. Stick to whole food like fruit, vegetables and solid meat. You are taking a chance with anything pre mixed. I was severally sick for most of my visit. Our initial room was run down and both beds had deep indentations in the middle. We went to the front desk to change rooms and they denied us until the next morning saying they were booked solid which was obviously not true as we walked around the resort. More than half of the resort was empty. We went back to the front desk the next morning only to be told no. I lied and told them that we just got engaged and wanted to hold our wedding there...miraculously a room became available!The room we moved to was very clean and nice with a king size bed in which we actually paid for in the first place. The problem was that it was in block 10 which is right by the staff entrance and the noise starts around 6:00 am. If you are an early riser this is no problem. Remember to bring ear plugs because they are constantly yelling inside each building and all the front room doors are made of wood about as thick as cigar paper along with inside walls. Extremely noisy.The maid service was wonderful. They are very nice and for a few $, will keep your fridge stocked with cold beer or whatever beverage you prefer.If you dine in the buffet area ask for Super Mario. He is the best!The cafe is a must. Coffee is wonderful but stay away from the treats in the glass jars. If you look closely, they are full of little bugs which you will find throughout your room also.The beach is nice but as people say in other reviews, they do not rake the beach as advertised. It is full of seaweed and other beach debris. This did not bother us as it is a beach!The front desk staff are blatantly rude and will take your tip but not give you better service. A little tip to exchange money is to do it at the casino. They will exchange Canadian to American at 5% so $20.00 CDN is $19.00 US. The front desk will exchange at whatever the currently rate is. Their is also a retail store on the resort which will sell anything in the store at par.Do NOT go off the resort to the little shops next door. They are a lot more aggressive then the vendors on the resort. We felt like we were going to be attacked if we didn't buy something and if you don't have a lot of cash to buy your way out, you can easily disappear down there without a trace. As soon as you walk through the guarded entrances, you are on your own and taking a big chance. This place in not Cuba or Mexico. Stick to the hotel excursions if you want to get off the resort or you have a recommended guide. One day a week they allow local vendors to come and set up booths....right along the entrance to the main buffet...give me a break! You can't even go eat dinner and have these pushy people harass you and there is no way around it. They jump right out in front of you and please do not let anyone tell you different.We only ate at the Spanish restaurant which had really good food but I ate the lettuce with oils and that is what began the sickness and It pretty much went downhill from there.Over all the staff were wonderful and helpful. Internet use is very expensive there. We paid 4 USD for 15 minutes and the service is very slow so the minutes eat up very quickly while you are waiting for pages to load. They will not give you extra minutes even if it does not work but they will just add it to your bill when you check out. Remember to exchange your money at the casino because they will ding you on the exchange when you check out unless you are paying in USD.The buffet by the beach at lunch time is really nice. I was always able to eat there with no problems and is the best spot on the beach. Only use $1.00 US Bills for tipping because most of the staff do not even look at the Loonie or Twoonie as currency but be very careful who you tip. Save it for the staff that earn your business because everyone and I mean everyone is hustling you which I completely understand considering they only make a few hundred dollars a month in salary so tips are a very lucrative income for everyone but let them earn it. If you find someone good that takes care of you then tip them and continue to go to were they are working because if they know you will tip them, the service is great.Overall, the resort is kept up nicely and well manicured. We recommend not letting them put you into block 95. This one is very run down with lots of mold and damage.The staff in the cafe are very rude and will wait on men first even if you are a female waiting in line but is the best spot on the resort to hang out. The evening shows are amazing. The customes, singing and atmosphere is nice.Be sure to bring along a deck of cards, When the weather is bad there is literally nothing to do as all events are outside and the lobby area fills up very quickly.Our tour package offered us complimentary towel cards. When we brought these cards to the towel but they tried to hustle us for $20.00 USD also and take the cards. When we refused they would not give us towels. We then had to walk all the way to the lobby to complain and all they would do was say no that is not true. We then had to walk all the way back hoping the person that was there was not. She was gone and we were able to get our towels with our cards. Be sure to exchange towels in the morning if you want clean ones as they run out very quickly and you will have to wait for them. When you bring your towels back make sure you get your cards back or they will charge you $20.00 USD at the check out.The Pizza place never had fresh food when we were there so we just stopped going. Also if you have ice cream use your own spoon to scoop it out as the scoop is sitting water that is not purified. That was also a very bad mistake we made making us sick yet again.There are massage therapists walking all over the resort to get you to book. It is costly and is done in an open hut usually with other people at the same time. If you are looking for a private massage session only go to the spa located on the resort.The store located on the resort offers everything from suntan lotion, bathing suits, medicine and everything else you might need at a reasonable price. If you want to travel light you can pick up any essentials there. Make sure you wrap up your tooth brush after you use it as the tooth paste attracts the small ants and they will fill up your tooth brush. Always make sure you save enough bottled water to brush your teeth and rinse out your tooth brush. Do not even use the hotel water to rinse your tooth brush!I would never recommend this resort nor go back there. For my first trip to Punta Cana, is was horrible.This resort is rated a 4 star but I have stayed at many 4 and 5 star resorts and this is really only a 3 maybe!We read the reviews and reluctantly booked because the price was good but will NEVER get caught in that trap again. We will pay the extra and at least enjoy our vacation. This resort was an absolute waste of money!

<Content>Want To Relax; Give Me a Try!!! My husband and I decided to visit a different place for our wedding anniversary this year. We visited the Barcelo Dominican Beach Hotel in Punta Cana November 19-26 and had a very enjoyable time. Th beaches were beautiful, no vendors bothering you; the grounds which were very large were very lush and green with beautiful flowers. You never felt crowded at any time. We dined in several of their restaurants along with their buffets, and were delighted. The staff is very happy to help you with any problems or concerns you might have. We were very happy with our choice, and know you will be too.Don and Betty

<Content>Do NOT stay at this Hotel !!! First, about us.We have been to Mexico over 20 times,backpacked,all inclusives,love small towns, the people,different cultures....l am saying this to say we are not snobs,can eat off of a street venders cart as well as 5 star restaurants.The Bad at this hotel...Number one: the Food. l hope you like Spam...deep fried,cold,in mystery sauce...wieners,beans,soggy eggs,worse pancakes,omletes cooked in a ladel of oil...pizza with canned tuna on top....All of the a la cart restaurants were horrible.l had read about the Japanese Wasabi being good.Gag me. The Mexican....do you like cheese whiz? Cause thats the cheese they use. We gave up on them the 5th night and decided to pay the 40$ for the Lobster meal at Bucaneros. After sending our Lobster back 3 times ( we could take a peice of lobster and literally spread it on the plate) l finally got a decent one, but my husband did not. Do not waste your money on this Restaurant.l also had read great bread! Well take the same tasteless dough and make it into a bunch of different shapes and you have it.Same goes for their desserts...yuck.The Gift shop: so expensive...but as were were needing 2 more gifts for home and it was the last day, we selected them,went to the cashier with our Mastercard and were told it was an additional 21% on top if we used our credit card. 21% !!! We went on a tour of the area,sugar cane field ect, we had a policeman on the open sided bus that had a rather large gun to protect us. hmmm (We were also told not to go into the main town because they would think we were american and we would get shot. Shot?? Also, we were told not to go out onto the beach at night because of bandits.) the Idiot that was the tour guide(named Arous) told us that HIV in the Dominican could not be passed on to anyone else...then proceded to tell us the price of Hookers, 50$ for a kiss and a date, 85$ for the whole thing. Apparently Hookers from Santa Domingo were the best. Was this guy a nutcase or what?? The so called Venders right beside the hotel are very nasty.Do not wear any kind of jewellry outside of the Hotel.The Beach: what can l say? pretty to look at, but filled with Butts,plastic glasses,broken glass...we watched while one young ladys foot was cleaned and a large bandage was put on her foot after being badly cut from the beach broken glass.The Internet: 4$ for 15 minutes, but time starts when she starts to put your name into the computer,so that takes off 2-3 minutes.The Front desk staff: Why is it when you need something all of a sudden no one can speak English?? When we were checking out,had the stupid internet and Lobster dinner to pay for, we used our Mastercard, but sorry..credit card machine is down..go get cash out of machine Well the ATM machine is not on the Barcelo property. It is down the drive and to the right. (another security issue) We said no, just phone Mastercard and deal with it. 10 minutes later, while the van is already loaded with our luggage and the driver is now waiting, we still are looking at these fools doing nothing. Finally l said just write it out on the slip and we will sign it. Well it was a visa slip...don't know if it will work, but l will be looking at my statement next month.Watch out for Hookers on the property, one gave my husband her room number.The staff did tell them to go the next day...The Good: the nightly shows.Very well done. the coffee shop, great coffee drinks.l will never go back to the Dominican,ever. This hotel is not worth your hard earned money.

<Content>great time After reading the various reviews varying from excellent to poorI was a little hesitant.. The 1st day was alot of travelling due to the flight schedule.Thishelped build the level of excitement foe me. When we arrived,we checked into our room right away.Roomwas good,nice and clean.It was missing a bottle opener but allyou have to do is visit guest services. I was missing a safe key as well but that was also straightenedout through guest services as well. I do recomend sitting in on your oreientaton so your conserigefrom your tour company can explain everything to you.That'swhat he is there for.Help make your stay enjoyable. Food was really good at the buffet,it had Mexican  Italian night.No need to visit the a la cartes for my family. The language wasn't a barrier for us, 99% of the employeesspoke english well;better than my Spanish.I do recomend making an attempt on Spanish. Tipping goes along way;1 or 2 bucks for the maid every morn.she restocks you frudge for you.  Overall experience was great,I would definetly go back.

<Content>Don't do it This is a folow up to my evaluation in August. After getting home still sick from vacationing at this resort i tried to contact someone form the corporate office to vioce my concerns since no one at the hotel really cared. Guess what.. no repsonse from numerous emails. They dont care about you, they just want the money. Please read all of these reviews in detail. If someone rates them good they got very very lucky . Vacation elsewhere

<Content>Had fun until we were robbed.... We loved and hated this vacation. Over our 6 night trip, we had to move to three different rooms.First Room - my wife and I requested a king size bed, but this room had two double beds. Also the safe did not work.Second Room - (in their Elite Club) on the second floor. In this room our safe once again did not work. Also our sliding glass door on the balcony did not lock. We tried to convey this information to the front desk mulitple times, but they chose to not understand us. On the second night in this room, we were robbed. The thief climbed into our room from the balcony while we were at dinner and stole our belongings. After our room was burglarized, I demanded a new room to the head of security at 2am.Third Room - to replace our last room due to terrible non-security.The theives stole our cash, Ipod, digital camera, and jewelry. The hotel employees were unsympathetic to the fact that our items were stolen, and they took no responsibilty for the unsecure balony door. They told us to go to the local police station to file a report. Their Elite Club building is on the far side of their resort, and it has an alley on the back side of it. It is unsecure there, and I would never stay in those rooms again. I think these rooms are targets for the theives, and hotel does not provide secure rooms with working doors, locks, and safes.On a positive note, the resort and beach was beautiful. Beer was plentiful, and the food was okay once we figured out how to get into the nicer restaurants.

<Content>Please read this before to book a trip at the Barcelo! I Traveled to The Barcelo a week ago... After reading the reveiws i was very sure it wasint going to be a good trip, but my mother who traveled there last year told me everything would be perfect. When we arived there at 11:00 pm we where greeted ,and they took our bags...everything seemed beautiful and perfect... when we got to our room everything changed! Our rooms doors didnt lock....our bags didnt get to us until and hour later ... the beds where horrible the blankets and sheets where thorn and dirty..the room was out dated and poorly cleaned... there was mold and bugs! So we made our way back to the front desk it was now 11:30pm.....It took until 3:00am of us waiting, arguing and begging them for a new room. We finaly got one...once we got in it... there was the same problems...tired...and fustrated we desided to make due....three other couples that arrived the same night had the same problems....the room had more mold then the first and the sheets where damp.....this was my first time traveling anywhere...im not a picky person nor do i complan but i couldnt help it in this situation. The week we stayed was not the best...the pool was dirty..same with the beach...the food was okay..but we seen a rat near the buffet and a cocroach....and to top everything off i got food poisoning the last day....Althought there was alot of bad we did make alot of friends with the staff that we will never forget...they made the trip barable..when we tried to check out ...the front desk try billing us for phone calls we didnt make!...my mom told them we had no money no visa...so they asked us to give them somthing of value! and then they waved the bus ticket in our faces and told us we couldnt leave until we payed!.....the mangment is serious messed up!....almost everyone we talking to didnt like the resort so think twice before you book with them please!

<Content>This Resort was excellent in every way My wife and I booked our Honeymoon vacation by expedia and found a great deal with Sunwing. There is nothing bad i can say about this place. The people, the food, the entertainment, the rooms, the beach, what can I say the place was perfect and at a great price to. A bunch of us are planning another trip down there in April of 2009. I would recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a good resort to go to at a very good price.

<Content>Fabulous time We arrived at the resort Friday 10/24/08 at 11:30 AM. Although we where able to check in, we did not receive our room keys until 3:00 PM just as the the hotel tells you. We changed into bathing suits and took off to explore. What a beautiful resort with many dining and entetainment options and bars. The staff was very friendly and as helpful as the could be with my poor knowledge of their language. My wife and I stayed three nights and had an absolutly splendid time. The grounds where clean, there where many optional activities, the beach was clean, as where the pools. The food was decent and we had many different options available. I must confess, after reading several of the reviews on this site, we where concerned that possibly we made a bad decision. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Our room was a standard room, very clean, excellent house keeping services and a well stocked refrigerator that was replenished daily. We travel quite often and will definitly return to this resort. In fact, we hope to return in January.

<Content>The Dominican Lovely The Hotel Good  We arrived at the Barcelo Dominican on 16 Oct 08 staying for 1 week we were a party of 6. On arrival reception was real slow at booking us in and 1 room wasn't ready so we had to wait, it was a bit of an inconvenience after a 9 hour flight and 45 min drive hopefully the next day would be better after a good nights sleep the next morning getting out of bed my husband caught his leg on something when we lifted the bedsheet there was a lovely big curly spring peering at us out if the side of the mattress things then started to get a bit better we booked a parasailing trip on the beach with alexis which was great we all had a good time. Things were starting to look good so we booked another trip this time with a tour rep actually on the hotel grounds so 4 of the party went off Quad biking it was a disater the rep didnt explain that we would need to pay out more money on the day for bandanas photos etc be more prepared wish we had booked through alexis on the beach. As the week went on we had a few more problems with the room the fridge broke the plug sockets were hanging off the wall and the safe locked us out with all our belongings in it. we reported these problems 3 times and still we waited for someone from reception to sort it out, our son was the one who got the safe open for us the other problems were never sorted the best was yet to come when we went to check out we found we had never been checked in properly (with the room not being ready) and the room was still registered to the previous occupents who had cut out leaving a bill we did have a laugh and half a good holiday would definately go back to the Dom Rep but not to the barcelo Dominican.

<Content>Beautiful I went with a group of 6 (3 couples) in February of this year (I know Im a little late writing this but better late than never!) We were a group of 6 people 24-26 who were looking to have a relaxing vacation, sleep when we were tired, eat when we were hungry and drink when we were thirsty.....that is exactly what we got. I will try to keep this as brief as possible:Check in: Check went well, there were 2 people working the desk so it was a bit slow but they welcome you with a drink and you can stay entertained watching the peacock in the rafters of the lobby. Two of my friends asked the man checking them in to please put the 6 of us near each other which he ignored completley. They finished checking in and i gave their room number to the lady who was checking myself, my boyfriend and the other couple in. She immediatly went and found 2 rooms near the first one. 2 of our rooms were right next to each other and there was only one room in between us and the third room.Room: Our room block was in the back near the tennis courts. Very convinient to get to the buffet a bit of a walk to the beach but but too bad. There was a smell of sewage right around the outside of our block for most of the week but it wasnt bad and nothing I needed to complain about.The maids were good but I found we only got 1 or 2 bottles of beer in our mini bar and not every day. We tried everything, leaving big tips, leaving notes nothing seemed to get us more beer!Over all the rooms were very clean, all 3 were exactly the same. My biggest complaint was the shower. The water pressure was terrible and you almost had to chase the water drops around the shower, I am not exaggerating the stream that came out of the shower head was smaller than what you would get out of a sink. I tried showering at differnet times in the day hoping less people using the showers would give me better water with no luck. That being said, a few bad showers are nothing in the big scheme of things. Food: The omlettes in the morning were fantastic as well the pasta at the lunch and dinner buffets was great. I am very leery about what I eat in tropical places (I have never gotten sick but dont want to start) so I keep to what looks safe. Pasta and omlettes were safe and tasted great. The a la cartes were all amazing. The Japanese was the best but Brazillian and Spanish were up there. The only problem with the Brazilian is that it is a buffet, but they bring huge slabs of meat to your table and slice it right onto your plate yummy! The mexican was alright, nothing fantastic but not bad either. The a la cartes have 3 sittings, 2 you need reservations for but the 9pm sitting is walk-in. This is what we had to do for the Japanese as it fills up FAST! One girl I travelled with was a vegetarian, and I will warn you now the staff in most of these places dont pay much attention to the fact that you dont eat meat. Be prepared to find little pieces of meat where you dont expect them, or stick to bread and cheese. I will say that the serving staff was not great, I think I was brought one cup of coffee the entire week I stayed there.Bar : The best drinks are at the lobby bar for sure, but if you can find Pedro (usually at the swim up bar) ask him for a Pedro Special....they are too good for words and I still dream about them! Also if you figure out what it is let me know!!!Pool: Gorgeous, not too busy great alternative if the beach it too windy for you!Beach: The beach is fantastic, always lots of chairs and gorgeous sand and water. The downside is the people trying to sell excursions on the beach...they are very pushy and dont take no as an answer. Store: The store on the resort is quite expensive, on par with what you would pay in a North American gift shop....also the vendors are expensive and dont bargain a whole lot. Beware of the vendor selling the larimar jewellery. He tried to pull me away from the people so he coupld rip me off with nobody knowing. He tried to charge me $90.00 for a necklace which is completley out of line, I ended up getting the necklace and a pair of earings for $30.00Excursions: We took the catamaran tour to Saona island. I loved it, lots of time to enjoy the boat as well as the beautiful beach on the island. The drive is quite long (about 2 hours) but well worth it! At the end the will hand you a bottle of rum with your picture on it, I believe they charged $15 for it but it is a great souvenier!!! I was very shocked on the bus ride to see how dirty this country is. Everywhere you look there is garbage its gross.I think that is it but if you have any questions at all please feel free to email me. I dont check my messages on here often so email is your best bet: jennyd.ab@gmail.com Enjoy your holiday and dont pay attention to the awful reviews, people seem to forget that a 4 star in the carribbean is not anything close to a 4 star in North America or Europe, they do the best with what they have.

<Content>A great vacation I was at the BDB from Oct. 12 to 19 2008. I was very anxious after reading all the bad reviews, although in Jan 98 I had stayed there for a week and everything was great then, but alot can change in 11 years.I found the room A1: very clean. I would strongly suggest though that you bring earplugs. Some (actually alot of) guests come in very late after the disco and they scream in the hallways.The food was very good. The Al La Carte restaurants were very good, but the Brazilian did not get my vote, as all the Brazilian restaurants I have been to.The beach was great except that I found the merchants on the beach quite harassing. I love taking walks on the beach but they would come and meet us almost int he water to try to bring us to their shops (which by the way were all the same).The staff is great at the resort. A lot of them speak decent english. Of course, you cannot start a conversation with them but if you need anything, they will provide it.I would definitely go back. GO FOR IT' IT IS A NICE RESORT

People were friendly, beach was amazing, food was good. I definitaly will go back asap. Employees made sure you were having fun, lots of things to do and see. If you don't want to have a good time STAY HOME!!! Knowing Spanish does help.

<Content>Sad but True :) Barcelo Dominican Beach Resort - Punta Cana DRI stayed for one week, returned on Oct. 18, 2008. This is not a 4 star/4 apple or 4 anything hotel. I rate this hotel a 3 star. The beach is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are well kept. The staff at the restaurants, bars  Pool area are so friendly and nice!! The staff at the lobby is another story......What staff? No one to help. The General Manager is useless. This resort boosts a casino. This is not a casino. This is more like a game room for those who want to lose a quick dollar. The furniture in the lobby and rooms are totally outdated!!! This hotel needs to be remodeled and it will definately turn into a 4 or 5 star hotel. The food is the same every single day at the buffet. The restaurants on the resorts were TERRIBLE (except for the Japanese restaurant, which was pretty good) Stick to the buffet, although you will get bored of eating the same. I had beautiful weather and really made the best of it. One great night was a beach club night (party hardy in drink on the beach with dj and open bar).... the maids are nice and will give you what you want. Remember tip and you shall receive! Otherwise the HOTEL NOT A 4 star!!! stop rating it so!

<Content>Bravo, Barcelo !!!! My wife and I, plus some friends, just returned from the Barcelo Dominican Beach Resort. I have to say that we were very skeptical from the many negative reviews this resort received prior to our visit, but relax. The place is very nice and any reasonable person would certainly enjoy themselves. I'll try to run through the whole gambit of questions and ease apprehensions. The trip from airport and check in was smooth. You can't get into your room until 3:00, pack your bathingsuit in your carry-on, get a drink and let your vacation begin. The grounds are well kept , very lush and green, yes there are insects who live in this enviorment, just swat them away, okay. This is a Spanish speaking country, the people believe it or not, speak Spanish and there might be a little communication problem but I find it fun trying to get across my words, the staff has plenty of people who understand. The beach is beautiful but there is seaweed in the water, I guess the Barcelo hasn't figured out how to control the flow of the Seas, Mother Nature, go figure!! The rooms were nice and clean , A/C worked, hot water worked, Maid service very good. A few of our friends had minor problems in rooms but they were handle quickly by the maintenance staff. The food, good to very good, even if you are a fussy eater there is something for you, you won't starve. I did have a little stomach problem while adjusting to the new cuisine but some immodium fixed it right up. All of the ala carte restaurants require reservations and dress code is enforced but worth it, great food. The bars are great, all of them, be patient there are a lot of people but you'll get what you want and plenty of it. The beach vendors are hard sell people, this is how they make their money, just say no, firmly, they'll get the picture. Remember a few dollars in tips go a long way and I think the staff really appreciate your kindness. My simple tip would be, to just be open, relax and enjoy this country and her people.

<Content>Wonderful Barcelo Dominican Beach I went at the beginning of August for two weeks and as a teacher feel that my school holidays are a well deserved opportunity to relax. Not something I would have taken kindly to having spoiled. Unfortunately like some other internet users I became worried that this was to be the case as there were so many negative reviews. I am now completely convinced that the writers of these negative reviews have nothing better to do than find fault. To us as a family the worst thing we could find about the whole holiday and the resort was the inefficient toaster in the buffet resteraunt. The accomodation was lovely and the gardens a delight to walk though, particularly in the evening as they lit up. The pools were kept clean and the beach raked every morning. I know because I watched some mornings from our balcony. The people working there were only too happly to talk to you if you showed even a glimmer of effort to speak to them in their own language, and after all we were in their country. Anyone who couldn't find something to their taste from the food offered really must have some sort of eating disorder as the selection appeared to cater for such a wide variety of tastes. Overall I would recommend the resort to anyone other than those so sad in their lives that they can only find fault, and have EVERY intention of repeating our time there given ANY opportunity to do so.

<Content>Great Vacation Had a great time at the Barcelo. This was my second visit to this Hotel, and I have to say that some of the negative reviews probably have more to do with the individuals rather then the Hotel.The beach is great. They clean up the beach every morning....but it's the ocean...seaweed is going to be there no matter how much they clean it...No worries!Plenty of chairs, there is never a problem with that. The only thing that is a problem is the people that set their alarms at 6:00am, stumble half asleep to the beach to get their chairs, then go back to bed and don't show up until noon to use their chairs. Seriously....what is up with this. I will never understand people that do this. Hey if you want to reserve your spot on the beach and then go eat breakfast I am cool with that...but 5-6 hours with no one in the chairs is little crazy. The hotels should do something about it but that is just a personal pet peeve of mine.Vendors on the beach....Yep.....This is how they provide for their families. They are NEVER rude, or overly persistant. They are just trying to make some money. A polite no thank-you, is all that is needed. Or better still. Listen to what they have to say, or look at what they are selling, ask their name, and take 2 minutes out of your vacation time to actually interact with the locals. Food.....No problems here. There was always a good variety to choose from. Never an issue with finding something to eat. It's not gourmet five star, and if your going on vacation for that reason, then your vacationing at the wrong spot. Plenty of fresh fruit, lots of greens, and salads. Fresh breads, pasta, 3 or 4 different meats, and plenty of sweets, and desserts.Rooms....comfortable beds, good water pressure, air conditioning worked wonderful. Mini fridge stocked with water, beer, coke, and 7-up every day. If you need more, just leave a note for your maid, and you'll get it. Coffee maker in the room was great for the morning to sit on your balcony to watch the sunrise.Animation team....Always doing something. If your looking to be active all day long, then this team will keep you hopping. They are very good at keeping you busy, and are CRAZY. They work their butts off to make sure your having a good time, and it's worth your time to join-in on a few of the activities...get to know them, and you'll be happy you did.The cafe...the Dominicans answer to Tim Hortons. I loved this cafe. Lots of hot and cold specialty coffees, and plenty of greast desserts and sweets. Bar service...never a problem to get a drink. Sometimes it's busy but just be patient...they are doing their best to serve ALL the guests as quickly as they can. A smile goes a very long way. I don't understand people that get so upset about taking 5 minutes to get a drink.....there are over 700 rooms in this hotel, so potentially 1400 people...so five minutes to get a drink is pretty good....remember your on VACATION!!!This hotel is a great spot for a vacation. The beach is great, there is plenty to eat, and the rooms are quite comfortable. There are some really great clubs, and restaurants in the area too. I don't suggest walking the streets at night, but do venture out to experience the nightlife...just be smart when your doing it.If you have any questions about the property, feel free to ask any questions at all.

<Content>We loved it I stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach with my sister earlier this year, and we were both very impressed.We had read reviews before we went, and were very nervous about the holiday being a nightmare, but were delighted that it wasn't. We'd read that since the changeover, there had been numerous hiccups and problems, but we experienced none of them. We ate in 4 of the a la carte restaurants, and all were fantastic. Although I have to say that we were very pleased with the buffets available also. My sister had a stomach ulser when we went, so we were very cautious about causing that to worsen, but the food was cleaned, fresh and well prepared and we had no problems whatsoever.The beach was beautiful and the staff all very helpful and friendly.We booked a late deal, and for the money we paid, we were more than happy. By English standards, I would say it would equate to a 3* hotel, but there was so much to do that I didn't really think about it. We literally only were in our room to sleep and wash, and the landscaping of the resort was that of a 4* hotel.I would definitely go back, no hesitation.

<Content>An average hotel Back in 2004, I went to Punta Cana and stayed at Barcelo Dominican Beach (it used to be called H10 Bavaro Resort). After staying at other hotels (like Iberostar Bavaro) I must rate this hotel as average. It's a tipical 4 star caribbean hotel. A nice lobby, a few good restaurants with a good (but not as good as other hotels) food selection and an okay pool. The rooms weren't nothing special... Small bathroom and the bed was scratched... And the AC was at 14潞 when I first entered the room (great if you want to catch a cold). The beach is good... What one could expect from Punta Cana... white sand and warm clear blue water. Regarding the animation of the hotel it was good but the staff was kind of pushy to get the people that where lying in the beach/pool to participate at their games. Overall, although is a nice hotel, I recommend that you stay elsewhere because there are definitely best choices for you to enjoy all that Punta Cana has to offer.

<Content>Think Twice I read the reviews and thought that maybe my experience would be different. NOPE! I was there the last week of august 2008 and booked my stay through Apple Vacations. Just you can't check in until 3pm and when you do there is a line of people. Mind you the lobby has open walls and it was really hot, we had been waiting since 12pm in the lobby. Luckly our room was ready on time unlike other people that were in front of us. The beach was dirty: plastic cups and straws, seaweed, cigarette butts, and worst of all sand fleas. (I have pictures to prove it) Our room was clean and the air conditioner worked. The faucet in the shower did not, we didn't have hot/warm water until the day before we left. The food tasted good, we mostly stuck with the main buffet, when we tried the other restaurant we got sick. If you don't speak spanish you will have some problems. The bartenders and staff don't speak very much english. While relaxing on the beach you will be bothered by vendors and ladies trying to braid your hair. If you plan on getting braids don't pay more than $40 USD. There are 2 different shopping areas along the beach, when you step on the beach and walk down by the water go left and they will be just past the roped off area. The other one is to the right, you will have to walk about 6-7 minutes and when you see the sign El Pirates turn and walk into the building. Remeber you have to bargan with everything and then will try to get you to spend 50-80 percent more than you should. The Minimarket that is at the resort is in euros so the water proof camera that I bought cost me $24 USD, and that same camera is missing. It was in the room one day and when we left it was no where to be found. I told our Apple Rep. when we were leaving since that is when I noticed it was missing and he replied in a smug tone, And you tell me know?!? so I said, Yes, because I just noticed it was missing! I still have not heard from the hotel if they found it yet and most likely will not. The other thing - men do not walk alone on the beach at night there are hookers that try to get $150-200 USD out of you. We are not the only couple that had that issue, after talking to some other people they had the same problem. If you have any questions, just ask!

<Content>For the Money....Not Bad We spent a week at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from September 1 to September 6. This is our 3rd trip to Punta Cana, and while this wasn鈥檛 our favorite resort (we鈥檝e stayed at the Melia Tropical and an Iberostar) it was okay for the price. We checked out Trip Advisor prior to booking this trip and imagined, based on the reports, that it would be okay in some areas and not so great in others. That鈥檚 what it was. We go for the beach and the beaches in Punta Cana cannot be beat! Despite two full days of rain (to be expected during Hurricane Season) we got plenty of 鈥渂eachtime鈥?and enjoyed our vacation overall. Here鈥檚 what we felt was the good and the not so good: Check-in was a bit of a problem since check-in is at 3:00 p.m. We arrived after a long overnight flight. We received a welcome drink and were checked in but the room hadn鈥檛 been assigned yet. We were able to have lunch and were given towel cards and could use the facilities but it would have been nice to be able to go to our room. There should be some system in place to accommodate early arrivals as most resorts have. We returned at 3:00 p.m. and it took until 3:30 p.m. to get the room key. Our reservation was for a king and we got 2 doubles but the room had such a great view we didn鈥檛 care. We saw that most people checked in during the evening and they had their rooms right away.  The maid service wasn鈥檛 the greatest (yes, we do tip!) but we think there just weren鈥檛 enough of them. We had a fully 鈥渟tocked鈥?bathroom the first day but that was it. No more tissues, washcloths, hand towels. The cleaning of the room gradually declined. It wasn鈥檛 a big problem for us but this is the difference between a 鈥淢elia鈥?type resort and this one. We had a standard room and it was very well decorated and the bathroom was one of the largest ones we鈥檝e had. It was very clean (to start with), no mold like you sometimes find with high humidity, plenty of mirror space, a good hair dryer, too. Only one complaint鈥搕he lack of water pressure. You had to practically straddle the faucets to get wet. We were on the 4th floor and that may have been the problem.  The food was okay for the Dominican. Mexico has it all over on them but we think it is because Mexico has been doing this longer. You could still find something to eat and the staff were very polite and tried their best. These people work an unbelievable number of hours a day and try to please. For the gourmet restaurants we went to the Mexican, which was okay, Japanese was the best, despite the food being a little overcooked (better than undercooked....) the Brazilian, I hate to say, was terrible. It was basically a buffet and the meats were as dry as sawdust. Their reservation system was different than most places too. To make your reservations for the gourmet restaurants you could only book one at a time. Each day you would have to book for the next day. The good thing though was the person taking the reservations was there for many hours a day so that was convenient for us. The coffee shop was great鈥搉ot Starbucks, but pretty darn nice!   The beach was beautiful, water warm, soft sand, but would have been so much better without the constant loud, and we mean LOUD, music. It never stopped. There was noise at the pool and the beach at the same time. We are all for a party but this was just too, too much! There are plenty of lounge chairs but very few palapas on the beach. If you weren鈥檛 at the beach by 6:00 a.m. you didn鈥檛 get one. We are early risers fortunately. There are many palm trees and those did provide some shade. There were vendors but we weren鈥檛 bothered by them at all. We don鈥檛 want to sound negative about this place, we did have a nice time but we wouldn鈥檛 return to this property and wouldn鈥檛 recommend it to family/friends, simply because there are other places that are nicer in Punta Cana. If you are planning a trip here, are easy going, don鈥檛 mind lots of noise, and don鈥檛 have great expectations for a romantic/restful/pampered vacation you will enjoy it. It would not be the place for your 鈥渙nce in a lifetime鈥?trip鈥搄ust our opinion.

<Content>Some good and some not so good We went to Barcelo Aug. 1, 2008 to Aug. 8, 2008. This was my first visit to Punta Cana. The resort property was huge and the gounds were very lush, the groundskeepers did a great job. Check in went well, and we were given a welcome drink while we waited.The room was basic, but clean. The shower head never worked. We put in a work order ,however it never got fixed. So we had to take a bath instead of a shower. I'm not sure how the manager keeps his/her job....people are just trying to have a happy and decent vacation. I don't see what the problem is in getting things fixed. This resort was purchased recently by Barcelo...I thought that Barcelo was a decent name in the resort business. I guess the owner is never there to over see his manager.The bar's did run out of ice daily, so we had warm drinks on occasion.The buffet by the basketball court was quiet good. The food was good and the service was excellent. This particular buffet had hardly anybody there for all three meals, which was to our liking. The main buffet by the lobby was always overcrowded. We had gone there only once......but never again, too crowded.The pools were nice and the beach was beautiful. Lots of beach loungers to go around. There were activities on the beach from around 9:00am daily. The music on the beach was repetitive, plus they could use a new stereo system, all of the music skipped. We joined in for bingo one afternoon and the prizes consisted of rum. That was alot of fun. Everynight around 10:00pm the entertainment would begin. I must say the enterainment was exceptional. There was a small casino on the property, however several of the machines were broken. I only lost $25.00 though. The sundries store on the property was EXPENSIVE! $5.00 for a can of pringles! Everything in that store was overpriced. So if you want snacks you should bring it with you.Our travel group was Nolitours. Our representive did not show up when we were told he would. Nolitours did not have a sign up with his days and hours of operation. We did not see him at all. Finally one of the other guests left a message on the Nolitours board with a message to at least leave our pickup time for our return to the airport. The Apple rep was there daily from morning till 7:00pm. So we booked our tours with Apple. The tours offered in Punta Cana are not that exciting. I will not go back to the Dominican Republic. The streets are full of garbage from the locals themselves. The government should have public service announcements asking people not to litter. The children were begging on the street and even at our tour locations. OK vacation, but I will go somewhere else.

<Content>Terrible This trip was myself and my partner, both 24; my mom who is 54 and her friend who is in her 40's.We booked our trip with Apple Vacations before we read any reviews. After we read the reviews we were a little worried, but figured that many of these people must just be picky, and never satisfied. After all, we have been on many other vacations that we LOVED, yet we still met people that were not happy. Let me tell you, the bad reviews are true. We waited 4 hours to get into our hotel room, and many people from our flight waited even longer. Someone from our flight ended up taking the keys from the front desk and handing them out to us. For whatever reason, they had most of the envelopes with keys and everything on the desk, but would not hand them out to us. I believe some rooms were still not ready and they did not want to anger some people by only handing out some keys. We had two rooms total, and both had issues. One room the air conditioning was leaking onto the bathroom floor, but it worked great so we didn't bother complaining. We also found a large cockroach in this room. The other room the A/C did not work at all, and it took 2 days to get it fixed. Even after if was fixed, it barely worked and was very noisey. The food was OK. We were not able to get reservations for the restaurants until the 2nd day since the reservations desk closes at 3PM, well after we finally were checked into our room. Luckily my mom's friend wakes up very early so we had reservations for every other day. We loved the Japanese restaurant, and most other restaurants were pretty good as well. The mexican restaurant was the worst. I was already starting to feel sick at that point, and then after a few bites of the mexican I had to go back to the room and lay down. The food at the buffet was usually pretty good. The drinks were awful. There is hardly any alcohol to choose from, unlike other all-inclusive resorts we have stayed at. Even non-alcoholic drinks are hard to come by, unless all you drink is soda. There is no orange juice (just some orange drink, like Hi-C) or any juices at all for that matter. The margaritas at this place are the worst too. The worst food was at the beach, which is the Brazilian restaurant turned into a buffet for lunch. There is a guy cooking hamburgers, but no cheese, and hot dogs that dont taste like hot dogs at all. There is pizza available by the pool available 24 hours, but that was usally pretty bad too....if you could even get some. This one spanish couple went up in front of us the one night, and litterally finished off the 4 pizzas that were sitting up there. They completely filled their plate with every piece of pizza that they could fit, not leaving any for anyone else. We finally just left after waiting 10 minutes for more pizza to come out.The staff was very rude, at least to us who didn't speak spanish very well. The spanish speaking people always received the best service, especially at the bars. it takes forever to get a drink at the bar, mainly at the pool bar. There is usually only one bartender running the whole thing and he always helps the spanish speaking people first. The waitors at the breakfast buffet were always being smart. When my mom's friend would ask for a little cream in her coffee, they would litterally get one drip in and walk away. The first time it was funny, but by the last day she finally took the carafe from him and poured it herself.The beach was gorgeous, except on the 2nd to last day there was some type of oil spill, i guess from one of the many boats that fly past all day, and it had made its way up the beach. I saw it when i first went in the water, and stayed away from it, but later forgot about it and it got all over me. It smelled awful. Another couple we met complained about the same thing that day. Also the vendors parading the beach make it hard to enjoy. They will stand right in front of you rambling on about whatever and won't leave you alone. There was one vendor that kept shouting at the top of his lungs for parasailing. Imagine someone standing right in front of you, shouting for the whole beach to hear.One nice thing about our vacation was that we met some very nice people. We met some people from our own area, as well as a family from Michigan and a nice couple our own age from Canada. We even met a nice couple from Germany, and few people from Italy. After reading the reviews I was surprised how many english-speaking people we met. By far the highlight of the trip was that i won $170 from the resort's casino....at least it made me feel a little better about the trip. All said and done, i will never stay at a Barcelo resort again, and most likely will not return to the Dominican Republic either. We had a much better time in Mexico.

<Content>Not a 4 Star Resort! Where do I begin? Apple rates this resort 4 star, it barely makes 1. From the beginning, we requested and were told there would be a portable bed available for us since there were 3 of us to 1 room. Not true. We had to pay a 270.00 upgrade to get a suite w/a third cot (not a bed). The suite, 10X12, had a serious leak and bubble in the tiles above the tub in ceiling of the bathroom which we thought at any time would collapse, the safe was broken and we had to carry everything with us at all times, the one time I forgot a bracelet my father gave me on the bathroom sink I came back from the beach only to have it missing. I was sick! I told the manager (same one complained about the safe to) about the theft and he asked why we didn't use our safe??!! No apology, nothing! The sliding glass door to our room would not lock, we notified the front desk of all of this 3 times and finally gave up. The maid would only give us 2 bottles of each, water, soda, beer per day. There were 3 of us in the room. No unlimited anything! The food in every area was horrible. Buffets were fly infested (horribly)and food was undercooked. Lost power and water during the 24 hour storm. Obtaining a drink at any of the 4 bars was near impossible. Minimum of 20 people at all times waiting for service from the 1 bartender per bar. Drinks were horribly watered down. All three of us had the same complaints. We're not picky or like some people can be. I'm perfectly happy with a bologna sandwich and a tent on the beach. It's just that we all agreed that the only, ONLY, thing we enjoyed about this trip was each others company and support given the mess we'd gotten ourselves into. We've all traveled w/Apple before and had marvelous trips! I love Apple and their staff who are very professional and so friendly. But this trip, this place...was terrible! So very very disappointed!!!

<Content>Barcelo` Dominican Republic Beach After reading the varied reviews, and having already booked our dream vacation it was with mixed trepidation that I anticipated our vacation at Barcelo` Dominican Republic. This is a totally honest review by someone who considers roughing it a hotel with out room service. Coming from the USA, and going into a country who's national language is Spanish; my family and myself brushed up on minimal phrases and terminaogy. After reading most of the reviews, I also braced myself for staff that was rude and uncaring. What I experienced was anything but that. Friends had advised me that since our check in time was at 3:00, to pack our swim suits to enjoy the day before we could check in; and we did just that. Upon arriving at the airport, we found our apple represenative was very easy to find. He directed us to our airconditioned bus; and our transition from the airport to our resort was very easy and stress free. Upon arriving to the resort, we found that the staff was very nice; and pre- checked us in- and invited us to enjoy the facilites while our rooms were being prepared. We found that if you attempted some spanish that most of the staff was more than willing to meet you more than 1/ 2 way. We encountered a small wrinkle the first night being given an older room in the 4th building - the room was older - no lock on the safe, the blow dyer didn't work - and the mattresses were lumpy and old - but it was rectified the next day - so not a real issue. We were then given a lovely room in the 7th building on the third floor. Very very nice. On the whole - I have to give HUGE kudos to the grounds keepers who manually kept the grounds, beach and walk ways pristine at all times - even during tropical storm Kay. While down there - we experienced a severe tropical storm. It was one day of rain - in which, the staff had rainiy day acititives to keep the guest amused. Big kudos to them for that. The beach was nice and well kept. Not sure why other guests did not enjoy - but we sure did. The only annoying issue was the vendors who were allowed to roam the beach in order to make a buck. To be fair, the security guards were very watchful; and if it appeared that someone was not wanting to be pestered, they shooed the vendor away. Small bad point - the beach bar was never stocked well - it ran out of ice, water and soda before 11:00 am every day. Also - the bartenders who worked this bar catered mainly to the spanish speaking guests only. Everyone else had to wait - a very long time - to be served. Best bar in the complex? Hands down - the main pool bar - the main bartenders Armando and Antonio are the best. They run the top side and the pool side to perfection. They were always stocked with everyting and were plesent to everyone - even the really drunk 18+ year olds..... As far as the food. My family and I are not really picky; and found something to eat no matter what. I would say, If I had to complain about anything, it is that limited ability to get a 7:00 or 8:00 pm reservation at any of the resturants. The best dinner we experienced was the Brazilian. The most mediore was the Mexican. The buffett was not bad at all. Very nice breakfast and lunches for all 8 days. As far as our experiences with the staff - they went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. I will admit that we tipped a buck or two here or there for the bartenders and our maid - but we always had our room fridge stocked to the gills and our drinks were plentyful and our service was quick. Speaking of our room fridge - small tiny issue- but as an FYI - you CAN NOT get diet coke in your room. If your are a diet coke fanatic as I am - get over it or pay for it at the gift shop - which is my only real beef with the entire complex. The entire 8 days we were there - the visa/mc machine at the gift shop was out of order - leading me to believe that they just wanted american dollers - AND be prepared - if you want to buy a 20 oz diet coke - it's going to be $2.75 ea american money. It is what it is. All in all, we had a fantastic vacation. The staff is nice, the people you meet are nice, the food is okay; and the grounds are pristine. It is after all only a 4 apple resort - so you get what you pay for. I would highly recommend the apple trip to Saona Island - it was the highlight to our vacation - and really worth the $$! For pictures, please feel free to go to flickr.com and see my Punta Cana Pics at http://www.flickr.com/photos/27701746@N06/?find=cmarano21%40verizon.net. Also - huge kudos to our apple representative Santos who was very interested in making sure that our vacation was everyting we wanted it to be. If you are on an apple vacation - and don't tell your rep any issues you are experiencing - shame on you - they are very willing to make everyting as wonderful as possible.Would I go back again - you betcha - I absolutely hated to leave. Would I recommend this resort - again - you bectcha. All I can say to those of you who had a bad time - you did not make the most of your vacation - and you only looked for the bad - which is what you would do no matter where you went. If you go with an open mind - and the idea tha you are going to have a good time - you will. If you are looking for things to condem - I am sure you will find them. One piece of advice for the latter group of people - stay home - and quit writing those bad reviews- you ruin several good nights sleep for those of us who can find the good and fun in whatever we do.

<Content>Beautiful Beach We travelled to Barcelo Dominican Beach during the first week of August. Overall we were very happy with our experience considering all the reviews we had read. We booked through Nolitours (Transat Vacations) and had a flight out from Toronto. First off we found it much cheaper to drive from Montreal to Toronto and fly from there to Punta Cana (savings of over $400 per person). Our flight was with Sky Service, the flight left six hours late but everything was smooth with check-in as well as the flight. We checked the airline web site 24 hours before departure and were aware that the flight had been delayed. This gave us more time to sleep in and relax before departure. Upon arrival in Punta Cana we quickly went through customs and were put on a bus to our hotel. The 20 minute ride to our hotel went very smoothly. Our check-in at the hotel was also fast (drinks were served to us while we were waiting in line). We had booked two rooms but were told that only one room was available. We do not know if this was the fault of the hotel or the travel agency; however the next day we got a second room though it was about a 5 minute walk away from our current room. The hotel complex is huge with lots of tropical vegetation, everything is very well maintained with lots of gardeners working throughout the day. We were pleased with our rooms; they were very clean and the AC was working well. We gave a small tip to our maids daily and this ensured that nothing was missing and our rooms were cleaned quickly. We had a small problem with not having hot water one or two afternoons but this was no big deal since it was very hot outside and taking a refreshing shower was a relief. The weather throughout the week was excellent, the beach was amazing with soft white sand, clear water (very little algae) and lots of chairs available. There were also some umbrellas available but you had to reserve them very eraly in the morning (5:30-6:00 a.m. !). The food at the buffet was quite good and no one got sick. We tried the Japanese a la carte restaurant (Wasabi) and were quite pleased. The nightly shows were also quite good. The staff in the hotel all spoke English well and those who did not still understood as long as you spoke slowly and with a smile. We did not go in the pool as it did not look very clean. We tried parasailing as well as massages by the beach and recommend both highly. Our Nolitours representative was nowhere to be seen and did not show up for the orientation session.Overall a very satisfying stay considering the price we paid. Would recommend with no hesitation.

<Content>Get what you pay for... Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach Aug.3-10. I am 28 yrs old, and my b/f is 29. I have travelled to many places before in the carribean, for my b/f it was his first time- and overall we both really enjoyed this vacation. I read everyone's reviews before left and was curious about what to expect. The bottome line is- you're in a FOREIGN country in the Carribean... of course its gonna be hot- and ppl. are gonna speak spanish- what did you expect?!? I found the hotel workers to be very nice, and always tried to help us... if you treat them like ppl. and not workers they are more than happy to try to help- and always made an attempt to understand us (english) and solve our problems. All employees who we encountered were really nice and most spoke english- or at least broken english. Even the gardeners who spoke no english tried their best to communicate. We had a problem w/ a leak in our bathroom- in the beginning it took 3 phone calls... then i walked to the front desk- and immediately someone came to the room and fixed the leak. Because they took so long, they left us a tropical fruit basket and a bottle of rum :) It was a nice gesture.  The property was georgous- and well kept. Yes, it was big, but u dont wanna be stuck staring at the same thing/ppl. day after day. Beach was amazing. There were vendors on the beach but they are NOT allowed to approach tourists unless called over. We had NO problem w/. being 'harassed' on the beach, if u walk into their territory (market) you're fair game.. and you WILL be HARASSED. The food was good- again I have many buffets to compare too- and it was above average. You have to remember everything about their food is different- cooking methods, farming methods- soil etc. So ya, sometimes things may taste 'different'- but your not in Canada anymore. You just have to take it easy in the beginning- probably not a good idea to eat a rare steak on your first day. My b/f had a poopy stomach for a bit, but again it was his first time away. We packed the imodium and that solved the problem. Never had a problem w/ food, drink, or ice availability. If you expect top notch hand 'n foot service and amazing imported food- pay the $2000.00 and go somewhere else! Overall we payed $590.00 for our trip, and it was worth every penny. If you are expecting ppl. who only speak english- and all the food is like home- go to Florida. This is a tropical paridise, if you nit pick you can find problems no matter where you go. Plan ahead- w/ gravol etc just in case...Go w/ flow, take it in stride and relax...and you will have an amazing time.

<Content>Terrible Vacation We vacationed, and I use this term loosely, at the Barcelo Dominican beach Aug 8th thru Aug 14th. Our party consisted of myself, husband and two 14 yr old sons.We booked the vacation through Apple tours and got a pretty good deal, around $700 per person. We had vacationed with apple in the past but normally stayed at 5 apple resorts. This one is rated as a 4 apple. I thought this would be okay because we had stayed at Barcelo resorts in Mexico and were always happy. This was the exception.Upon arrival we were told that we would have to wait approx. 3 hours for our rooms to be ready Not a real problem. the main problems were in the fact that the staff spoke no English and were rude most of the time. We had problems with our door lock that took 5 hours to fix and about 10 trips to the front desk, which was a long walk. By night we were all extremely tired and grouchy. The staff did not care and seeemed annoyed with us.The second day started with a trip to the beach, again quite a long walk. The beach had lots of palms and shade was not a problem. There was a lot of seaweed and boat atraffic. There was a little shanty town vendor area right next to our side of the beach and we were constantly being harassed by vendors. The hotel lets them come right up on the beach. We were stalked from day one. They were terrible, it made trips to the beach unenjoyable.The pool that was closest to our room was a nice big pool, not overly crowded with lost of umbrellas, but the water was hot, really hot, The food was fine, lots of selection, no problems.Our room had a bat and a lizard in it one night. Put towels at the crack at the bottom of your door as i found that they were small enough to crawl under.If you have not already booked a vacation with this resort, I highly recommend against it. If you have, I would brush up on spanish, and get yourself in good physical condition before the trip because the complex is huge.

<Content>No Security For Rooms I have to admit that when I read the reviews on this property before we left, I thought that some of the people may have high standards and I was very optomistic about this place, however, we found out that MOST of the people we met and spoke with got sick from the food or drink. The most severe issues we encountered were with the staff directly. We waited 4 hours to get a room just like the reviews stated. They were not going to put our party of four in the same block but I was persistent and would not accept anything less.Our first night we were in bed by 11pm and were awoke by two men speaking Spanish and had walkie talkie radios blaring as lound as they could go outside our door. They kept pounding and pounding on our door and we told them to GO AWAY! We called security since we did not know who was knocking, 5 min. later they were still in the hallway knocking and we called again. We were told they would be right up....they never came! These two men entered the room next to us after they opened the door, they said they had to fix the cable television.....at 11pm at night???? The guests never reported a problem with the tv and had not even turned it on to see if it worked. A man from Guest Services (their form of security) came and said there was a mis-understanding. We went to the Property Mgr. the next day and he assured us that they would come and find us after dinner and take care of us. I told him I did not feel safe in my room! He never came the entire 7 days we were there. Each time we asked for Joel he was in a meeting. Coincidence? I don't think so! Also the Apple rep named Santos was a real piece of work. He told my husband You piss me off! When we asked him why? He said ,because you didn't come to my orientation and that really pisses me off! We told him we are on vacation and were under NO obligation to come to his little speach so he could try to make money off of excursions. Many people complained about the language barrier and it is very true. They will only speak English when it is convenient for them to do so. Otherwise, NO Engleah We are not sure what made us so sick for the entire 7 days since we did NOT eat any raw veggies, salad, or fruit that may have been washed, nor did we use tap water for anything....we strickly used bottled water. We did use ice in our beverages when it was available....most of the time they were out of ice. I have to say that I would NEVER stay at another BARCELO resort as long as I live! I am only writing this review to heed warning to anyone going to this place. I am not a 5 star/apple resort guest...I am used to 3 and 4 star places and have NEVER had an experience like this one.We stayed in Block 5 and had a nice view of the ocean from our balcony but we literally think the walls are made of paper. You can hear everything! Traveler beware! I really had to make the best of the time we spent at that resort. Fare is fare and I want to mention that there really was some great staff worth mentioning: Nat'e was a sweetheart and our maid was fabulous! The Wasabi restaurant was GREAT! Italian and Spanish were so so. That is all we tried other than the buffett. You had to get up at 7am to make reservations for the nicer restaurants.Finally, just to let you know, the beach is BEAUTIFUL! Hope this review helps you. I assure you it is a very honest opinion as I am a firm believer that when someone goes out of their way to treat me right, I will make sure I let someone know about it, but on the same token, if I have bad service etc....I want to make sure people are informed as well. We met some great new friends while we were there! That is our reward! Never so glad to be back home :)

<Content>Nice place for the money. I agree with the reviews I have seen hear that say it is a nice place for the money. We got a good deal on an extended weekend trip through Apple Vacations. There were very few deals that left on a Thurday and returned on a Sunday from any of the vacation websites but this one came available so we gave it a shot. My family travel as a group of 8 with teens and seniors. My mother-in-law is in a wheelchair so I can say if you are traveling to the Dominican Republic, make sure you bring some strong people with you if you can not walk. The airport is small and you have to walk up and down steps to get on and off the planes there. We have traveled to most of the popular tourist places in Mexico and this place was a lot like them. It is not handicapped accessable in the same way things are here. A ground floor room was pretty much what they considered handicapped. My mother-in-law stayed in building 1 and the rest of the family was in building 7. Her building was completely enclosed so her room stayed a lot cooler than ours did. Our halls were open on the ends and the heat was so much during the mid day that the air conditioner just could not keep up. It was comfortable enough at night though. I won't go into too many details since my review is about like the rest of them here. I would say it is a you get what you pay for kind of place. It was a great price for a weekend at the beach I think. It is not a place I would spend an extended vacation of a week or 2 at. The beach was nice and we could always find a chair. There is a reef around the island so there are no big waves to hit you in the face. The water is moving enough to have fun bouncing in though. We could always find a pool chair when we wanted one too. The water in the pools was kind of warm and I think they shoudl do somthing to cool it down but the sun is so strond there I don't know how they could do that. Take lots of sunscreen with a high spf. We used a 70 and still got burned. We have stayed in lots of cruise port kind of vacation spots before and this place does not have that kind of shopping near by. There are lots of little trinket places but nothing like what you find in a port town. If you are coming for the shopping you may be disappointed. It is a beach vacation kind of place.About the hotel: I can't say much for the food since we only ate in the buffet while we were there. It was good though. I did here other people say they likes the other resturants on the site. We had the pizza by the pool and that was pretty good too. Not like American pizza but good. Drinks are stronger at the bars than in the dinning room. The dinning room staff was nice, friendly and helpful. I think they only know enough English to do their job. They just smiled when you asked them a question that did not relate to what they were there to do. We know very little Spanish but got on ok. There are people staying at the resort from all over the world which was kind of fun. My husband went scuba diving and really enjoyed it. We did not use the company that is on the hotel grounds. It was somthing I found on the internet. If we were to do it again, I would book at the hotel. It is very difficult to get from hotel to hotel unless you walk up the beach. They will not let you enter another hotel's grounds unless you have on their bracelet. Not much else to say I guess. Like I said, we had a good time. Could have been better but not bad over all. You can email me if you have any questions.

<Content>Big Disappointment My husband and I flew charted air with Apple Vacations. The air service and the hotel transfers were great - no complaints. We arrived at resort at noon. No one acknowledged new check-ins. Waited 4 hours for a room. No one speaks any English who works at the resort.First room had broken patio door and no a/c. The bathroom floor was flooded because the a/c was frozen and leaking from ceiling. Went to front desk three times the first day to get fixed. Finally got the door fixed. No one ever came to look at water on floor and no a/c. Second day, we spent the whole day trying to get someone to either look at and fix the a/c or move us to another room. Kept telling us to come back in an hour. Took until 7:00 p.m. to get moved to room #2. The first room had the whole ceiling torn out and the bathroom a mess all day long.Room #2 had a broken safe, a broken TV, no hand towels or rags, and the a/c was extremely noisy, but working. Took until 8:00 p.m. on third day to get safe and TV fixed. Never got wash cloths the whole week - finally gave up and used hand towels to wash. A/C worked 3 nights - last three nights, it was hit and miss. All our clothes smelled like mold and mildew when we returned home.The food was disappointing - same selection every day in buffet restaurant. Service was poor - no one acknowledged you. Took at least 3 requests to get anything to drink. Never any ice and soft drink was broken most of time. We both were sick by 2nd day and couldnt stomach much of their food rest of week - mostly bread and fruit and American snackes we had with us.The beach and grounds are beautiful. Hard to find chairs in shaded area. Pool area looked nice, but was very dirty.No one speaks English at resort, including other tourists.

<Content>Dominican Holidazy is a treat Hotel staff was amazing,Management was great and food was lovely.We arrived on saturday july 26 after having missed flight on friday night.Our rooms where ready,clean and the bell boy was teaching us a little spanish to get out trip started.Relaxed for a bit,went to the buffet restaurant and had a lovely diner.Met a waiter who spoke english and he became our personal tour guide on his time off from work.Florintino is the name of the waiter,he took us in to Higuey twice to see the Vasilica and other places where tourist would not venture to see the locals.The hotel manger Joel went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we didnot need anything while we where at the property.It was a great vacation and we are going back for our christmas holidays.The friendliest people we have come across while travelling.

<Content>Learn Spanish! We stayed in Bloque 6 - the suites - and they were nice. Our maid was very polite and respectful and really tried to communicate with us (but spoke little English). The staff overall spoke next to no English and many had an attitude towards us, as though they expected US to speak their language. Not very good with customer service and complaints were only given empty promises. Also, on a snorkeling tour in the 'glass bottom boat,' one guide GROPED me and made sexual insinuations at me!! I complained to management, but again, nothing was done other than empty promises. Stay away from the glass bottom boat trips if you're a halfway good looking female! Disco played lousy music! but they accepted requests. Beach was nice, but weedy and too much boat traffic all around it. Catamaran was nice, but they only had one. Kayaks were nice. Overall, this place was not very good for the price we paid. We won't be returning.

<Content>Honeymoon Filled with Disappointment I don't even know where to begin....We booked this honeymoon at Barcelo Dominican Beach through a travel agent. The flights were fine everything went well then we arrived at the resort on a Tuesday, were we stood in line to check in for an hour and half once we got to the front of the line they spoke broken english and told us oh you are with apple vacation you need to go over to that line .And in that line was another 3 couples waiting in line. So it took us roughly 2 hours to check in. once we arrived at our complex we realized we were on the 4th floor and then we realized there was NO ELEVATOR!!!!! Once in the room we put our passports, portable dvd player, and money in the save, but the save door would not lock so I called down stairs were no one spoke english and told them our save wouldn't lock. I waited about 10 minutes then I walked down to the front desk and asked for them to come and fix the save they kept saying ten minutes and walking away. Several phone calls and walks down to the lobby later,in all my husband and I waited for 3 hours for someone to fix our save. Then we quickly realized that it was not just the staff that did not speak english, all of the other guests were not english speaking. Also we were not allowed into most of the restaurants because my husband did not pack pants! AND I AM SORRY IT'S 90 DEGREES and HUMID my husband did not pack pants! I mean the list of terrible things go on and on...Our toliet ran the entire time, the rooms were dirty, and I can't stress enough how much the staff not speakiing english really ruined our time. However imagine a vacation were you can only talk to one person because no one else in the whole resort spoke english!!!!!

<Content>Right for the Price Traveled with Apple Vacations--great air service. I've been to Caribbean many times before and knew what to expect. You get what you pay for!! Tip maid up front ($5.00) and you'll get better service (and flowers). Accept that you are not in States--it's a different country. A little Spanish goes a long way. I called three days in a row because TV had no remote and simply accepted on the 4th day that I was never going to get a remote. The mini bar is free but there was no bottle opener to open drinks--$2.00 tip to maid gets you instant bottle opener. Things move slowly--four hours to check in but I got a gorgeous room right on the beach. The front desk staff are overwhelmed but if you are nice and respectful (but firm) they will reciprocate. Maid service irregular but they are overworked too.Very few Americans at resort. English rarely heard. Euro currency because 90% of tourists are Europeans. They take dollars at store but change comes in Euros. 50% topless beach--only Americans and Spaniards wear tops. Beach absolutely gorgeous!!! Beware scuba diving school, not safe. Buy phone card Claro in mini-market and use phone in lobby to call home. Don't use phones outside mini-market, way overpriced!By 4th day I was sick but this usually happens in Caribbean. Drink lots of water, don't eat for a day. Not the most luxurious place in the world, they need help mainly in training staff--but for the price, hey.

<Content>Don't go to this resort!! We stayed at this resort from July 5-12 and were very disappointed. Where do I start???Check-In - We arrived at the hotel around 10 p.m. Very slow and poor service. No welcome drink, in fact hardly an aknowledgement! Then to top it off two different rooms until we were settled. The first room noisy (Block one, not for families), the A/C was broken. When I went to complain, I got a long stare and then he walked away! No customer service. Apparently he walked away to try to figure this out. Second room he sent us to was not maid up and looked like a tornado went through. Finally he brought us to a third room! By this time anything would have done as we were exhausted! The floors, sheets and everthing was wet from the humidity and very stinky!The next day I went to complain about the mold on the ceiling and A/C vent as my daughter was asthmatic. I was told no other rooms but they would send up someone to clean it up. Well guess what, noone showed!! I was determined this was not going to ruin our dream vacation, so we just accepted it. I did however complain to the public relations manager, who appears to listen, but doesn't. I went to see the p/r manager as I wanted to make arrangements for a cake for my son's BD, She was actually going to charge us for the cake until I mentioned our issues. Again appreared concerned and said she would send the head of housekeeping to clean. Well guess what, nobody showed!! I even complained to our tour operator Melanie who also said she would look into this. Guess what, not a bit of action. They all stick together!! The beach was gorgeous, althought weedy for the last few days. The hotel also does not clean up the garbage etc. Although I don't know why adults see if fit to litter. Frustrating as to people hogging palapas! Mainly Europeans!! We were fed up. The resort also catered to the spanish tourists!! Hardly anyone spoke Eng;lish Including the wake up call we received for our day trip. Major communication breakdown. When he arrived at the door to get us up for our Outback Safari trip, what I understood was the bus was waiting!! We had to laugh after we ran to the lobby only to be told by the front desk, he was merely providing the wake-up. Brush up on your spanish if you want to go here. Kids Club- Not good at all. In fact when I stopped by one day, the coodinator told me she did not speak English. To say the least, I did not leave my very Canadian and English speaking children with her!! Day trip- Do the Outback Safari. By far the highlight of our trip!! They were spectac;ular and we met some wonderful people!!The food- so, so. Just be picky. Poor service though in the restaurant. Slow to get coffee, drinks etc........The pools- Nice, but again dirty by the end of the day. Again adults littering. I don't understand that!!Vendors- Very annoying!! Always trying to sell trips, even if you have told them five times no. They are even allowed to roam around the resort.....The grounds were beautiful! This was one plus. Another plus was the coffee house!! We loved it there and the staff there were fabulous! Entertainment - If you were a spanish tourist, then good. Canadian, not good for us.......We made the best of it, but this was not a four star as advertised!! Do your research if you are planning to go here..

<Content>Not bad for the money Just returned from a week at this hotel and must say was pleasantly surprised as the reviews were not too favourable.We had a room in Block 6 which was a Caribbean Spa Suite, two double beds, a jacuzzi tub, double sinks and separate shower. No problems whatsover with hot water or pressure. Was a small leak over one of the sinks but nothing too worry or complain about. Room was made up everyday but did have to ask for beer in the fridge!Check in was a little slow to start but eventually someone else showed up to help and that sped things up. Check out was done in a blink of an eye! Service in the buffet restaurant was slow at times and we sometimes had to catch a waiters eye for coffee, wine etc. Food wasnt too bad, about standard for mass production and there was always something you could select. (great rolls etc at every meal). We never tried any of the other restaurants as we do not like to work to a time table when we are away!Le Cafe had to have the best iced coffees and the Irish Coffee was great. Think we went in here everyday at least once! Barstaff were friendly and drinks were good, not watered down!Beach was crowded and you really had to snatch up the shade early or even the night before but if you were happy to move with the shade during the day you could always find a nice place to relax. No troubles with the hawkers on the beach, if you dont look in their direction they dont even bother you. Would recommend you get a massage, $20 for 30 mins and worth every cent!!Overall we were pleased with the resort. Nice and small and everything was easily accesable and only being 25 mins from the airport is an added plus.If you are looking for luxury this is not the place but good value for money if you are on a tight budget and are not the really picky sort. Go with the flow take the good with the not so good and you will have a great time.

<Content>cheap punta cana My wife and I wanted an inexpensive 2nd honeymoon. This place gives you what you pay for. Little for a little. Check-in was so-so. We did not get the room we booked with a King bed and gave up trying to move. The check-in staff were inattentive and could care less what we requested. Best to brush up on your Spanish if you visit this resort. The room we got was nice and in one of the older/remodeled bldgs. Plenty of hot water and the A/C was great. The little gifts for the housekeepers we brought assured that we got plenty of bottled water and soft drinks/beer restocked each day. The 2 main buffets were good. Plenty to choose from each meal. We avoided the fresh salads and uncooked veg. and had no stomach ailments. The rice and beans are a local staple and served at each meal. Lots of chicken dishes and seafood. Most of the desert choices were good incl. the ice cream bar. Get in early if you want a clean table. The waitstaff staff seemed to have a hard time resetting tables. The al-a-carte restaurants we tried were so-so. Saki was more of a show and you were left with a plate of stir fried rice with a mix of meats,seafood and vegs. The Brazilian steakhouse was OK. The meats are heavily seasoned so you don't get to taste the real flavor. Dissapointing compared to other Churascaria I have eaten at. Book a day ahead for the Al-a-Cartes at the Main Buffet reception desk. The Lobby Bar was the best choice for service during the day. The pool and beach bars always seemed understaffed and out of clean cups. Our own insulated mugs kept drinks cold and never had to wait for clean cups. The bartenders always remembered us and refilled with the same drinks we liked. The beach was nice and always busy with sunbathers,some topless, beach activities ect. If you want to reserve a palapa for the day, do so around sunrise. Leave your own towels and some personal items and you will have your shady spot for the day. Always shady spots around the pools though if the beach is not your thing. Bring plenty of sunsreen. The resort gift shop charges $28.00 USD for one bottle. The resort itself was always being looked after by staff, gardeners trimming, painters, carpenters. They seemed to care alot about appearances. We visted the week that the numerous coconut trees were being pruned and the arborists always had an abundance of fresh coconuts to offer passing guests. Watch out for the laundry vans as you walk around the resort. They will stop for you but not without some grumbling. The bellhop carts do not have horns and the bellhops each have their own Beep-beep to let you know they are coming through. The nightly shows were entertaining and fun. The pool show was sort of cirque de so laimish and seating was very limited but that show was entertaining. One of the firebreathers got a little too close and you could see the guests backing away. We deicided on the Tropical Paradise Cruise which is walking distance from the resort although a shuttle picks up in front of the resort. This trip included snorkeling in a very small area of reef and I felt very crowded out. The Sting Ray/Nurse Shark visit was in an enclosure about 1/2 mile offshore. Reccommend bringing your own snorkeling gear. It is provided but very cheap. They dance on the cruise boat and offer up a limted supply of beer and punch. It was a fairly short trip and we decided to walk back to the resort. To sum it up, if you want to vacation for cheap with mostly Europeans and S. Americans, this 3 star resort is nice. I would probably not go back to this property, instead spending a few more dollars for a 4 or 5 star resort. The property was beautiful and if we had brought our two teen daughters, they would have had a great time and we would not have to worry about their whereabouts. This was my fifth Carribean vacation but the first to Punta Cana. I would go back to Punta Cana next time. Great fun for the price.

<Content>Worst holiday ever !!!! We stayed at this hotel 31st July - 15th august 2007. Everything was going well until 3 days into the holiday I started with what I thought at first was sunstroke. After being ill for 7 days I was admitted to the local Punta Cana Hospital and was diagnosed with a tropical parasite (caught from contaminated food, poss the salads) and was seriously dehydrated. It caused amoebic dysentery (which is not pleasant). The illness lasted 15 days.Thank goodness we were staying in the Block 10 rooms ( the newly refurbished block) as I spent alot of time in there.All I can say about this hotel is that the beach (what little I saw of it) was beautiful, and the weather was fantastic. BE WARY OF WHAT YO EAT !!!!

<Content>worst holiday resort i ever been to this was my first holiday abroad with my boyfriend which he bought for my bday but the hotel was that bad we were both really disapointed and ended up stayin in on the night of my bday.i would advise anybody who has booked to stay at this hotel to try change it as it will spoil your holiday.we paid for our room upgrading and got put in block 9 which i think was the worst block on the complex.with our package we got private check-in so we thought this would mean we didnt have to queue and would get our room quick.we didnt have to queue,instead we were taken away from the queues and was sat at a table for 1hr by the time we finally did get checked in there were no queues left!these are the problems we had with our stay...you will need about an hour to read this!!roomwhen we finally got to our room it wasnt upto standards it smelt and did not look like an upgraded room(this was just the start)most days our front door did not lock ,when it did we got locked out because it wouldnt unlock,our balcony door was broke for 3days and did not close.our bed side lamps did not work(when we complained somebody was sent to tape the wires up as they were faulty)they sparked when we plugged them in! our tv remote did not not work this meant we couldnt watch the tv as the tv buttons did not work either-we complained but nobody came to fix it.we also had a large gap underneath our door which meant we werent sleepin alone at night as we had all kinds of bugs coming in our room.after going down to reception for the sixth time in 1wk we argued with the staff for 2hrs to be moved to a different room.when we finally got moved to the best block on the complex (block 6) we had the same problems and on the last night our bathroom cieling nearly fell through as there was a really bad leak with water comming through the lights! i went to reception AGAIN and nobody came to see to it for 30mins(a bit dangerous when theres water leaking through the lights) when they did come they just had one look at it and said they will get somebody to come clean it up-nobody came.food and drinkthe only restaraunt i liked was the japanese as the food was cooked in front of you but its always hard to get in that restaraunt as its always booked up.i didnt like the main restaruant as food wasnt covered up and was covered in flies and ants.everybody we met up with had a stomach bug as did myself and my boyfriend and we are both off work now as were still poorly.we booked a trip and was happy to get away from the hotel for the day but as food wasnt served till dinner time on the trip we decided to go to the main restaurant for breakfast at 7.00am,we were getting picked up at 7.30am-we were stil waiting at 7.20am because the ovens werent workin so ended up leaving for the day without breakfast.on our last day one of the snack bars was closed down as it was so dirty!the drinks in the bars are limited there is only one beer they have and its flat and tastes horrible the vodka and rum they have is also nasty it tastes so strong.we went all-inclusive and had to pay for our drinks in the disco which by the way is rubbish we only went once and the music was spanish and it fit about 30ppl in.entertainmentit states on the internet that the hotel has its own beach party wkly,i thought this would be good-i was wrong! its a party for the locals that come to stay at the hotel every wknd the party lasts most of the night and is very noisy keeping you up all night.be carefull if you do go to this hotel and want to do parasailing as me and my boyfriend got charged 90 dollars and then found out two other couples got charged 50 dollars from the same man(he calls himself the king of the beach you cant miss him)the hotel only has one bar with entertainment and it is poor,we stayed in most nights for the first wk until we met some friends,michelle,gary and goerge and margaret who made our holiday.staffthe bar staff were really ignorant and not helpful!!we went with first choice who have their own rep(melanie) living on sight which i thought is really helpful to have but when we had a problem she didnt want to know.when we had all the problems with our first room we argued with a member of staff(santa) for 2hrs for her to tell us to come back at 5pm with our bags packed to be ready to change rooms,this was at 10am.when we went back she had gone home and told nobody about the room so there wasnt one ready for us move into we were then told we had to go back the next day.all these problems in just 2wk i may sound like i complain too much but when you've paid alot of money to have your dream holiday and you get this its very disapointing.i would never go back to that hotel in fact it as put me and my boyfriend going back to the dominican altogether.

<Content>Nice Resort. We grabed this hotel as part of the cheaper expedia deals and did not expect much of it. As it turned out, this was one of the most favorable vacations we've been on. Some flaws existed of course but nothing can be perfect. As long as these flaws were minor and did not matter at all, unless you are a person with pointless complains. We travel a lot and never stay at hotels below 4 stars. However, this is only 3.5 stars and the quality of food is a well deserved 5+ !!! In buffet, the variety isn't extremely wide but everything they have is very tasty. If you're a meat lover, try the Spanish restaurant (El Meson)-sirloin steak is the best we ever had! Japanese (Wassabi)  Brazilian(Baha) are also very, very good!!!! The service is somewhat slow but you can Show them the money! and you'll be the king. There's also a cafe (starbucks style). The beach is absolutely beautiful, sandy with palm trees all over  water is clean and see-through.Resort is also very pretty, a bit old but very clean. What we did not like was the night shows (immature and not interesting at all), also the beds aren't too comfortable  so are the pillows. But the rooms are clean, bathrooms are nice! Check-in took awhile-1.5 hrs but the check-out was fast. Plenty of fun beach entertainment, nightclib and cousino are nice and fun! The spa and gym are just o.k. but not bad at all. If you wanna workout you'll be overlooking a beautiful sightseeing. We are very pleased and will deffinately consider the resort again!!!!

<Content>Never Go Back Just come back from the Dominican with my husband, we stayed for 2 weeks from the19th of June and this Hotel needs a lot of work to get it up to standard. We had a good Holiday because of the company we met but I just wanted to make travellers aware of some of the problems we encountered. Food The food is like most hotels that are all inclusive and it was good that the snack bar was open till late and also 24 hour bar however both myself and my husband had upset stomachs that lasted the whole holiday and the tablets didn't seem to do anything. The restaurants are really good and you book these at breakfast the day before but you want to eat there or go after 9.30 at night without booking. The drinks in the Hotel especially the lager was awful and I only managed to get a decent glass of wine at the restaurants the glasses don't look clean so I don't know if this caused the stomach problems but because it is so hot you have to drink.Room The room was very disappointing (we where in block 2 ) opposite the very expensive mini market (12 dollars for 2 small packs of Pringles and 2 chocolate bars). It smelt very musty and damp and the level of cleanliness was very poor. We had to wait till 11 o'clock for our towels one night, the toilet broke 3 times and the air conditioning was very noisy. The fridge if you left a 1 dollar tip was always stocked up with drinks and the shower did work however I know of other people who had problems with the water going off. I also had problems with my hair straightener's as the power is different to the UK but when you get outside it doesn't matter as the humidity just makes it frizz up any way. The main problem with this Hotel is that from Friday to Sunday they allow locals in for a weekend vacation. This meant that there were at least 300 extra people in the Hotel . You then had to queue for meals and drinks, the pool was packed and the beach and the noise levels both day and night were horrendous. I think the tour operator should warn British holidaymakers as this does spoil you Holiday. The pool had to be closed for 2 days as they were throwing pizza and chips at one another.Beach The beach is beautiful however it is far from clean. At the weekend it is full of ciggy ends and cups. As you walk along other hotels are clearing away the excess seaweed so the sea is much clearer however our hotel did not do this hence there was a lot of seaweed in the water.The trips are good to the islands and horse riding both worked out at about 45 and 30 quid.I would not go back to this hotel but enjoyed the holiday as we met such nice people George and Maggs, Jodie and Ste Leanne and Paul, Hayley and Mick who made the holiday enjoyable.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised w/Barcel贸 Dominican Beach Just got back from the Barcel贸 Dominican Beach Resort (6/26 - 7/1) and I was pleasantly surprised by the property, amenities and staff. I too read the reviews and wasn't expecting what I got. It seems everyone's experience is hit or miss and mine was very nice. The hotel is indeed a short ride (20 min max) from the airport. There were no lines when we checked in and figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for an upgrade. The desk manager said he'd try and we wound up getting an oceanfront (6702) however it was a single and we needed a double. We begrudgingly gave it up for a double in Block 5 (5202) which was also close to the beach. The room was actually more comfortable: bigger and modern. However, it faced the pool and became a lil noisy in the evening when the disco let out. It's not close to the disco at all but some folks would make a racket on their way to their rooms, the 24 hr pizza/burger place or the beach. One night they hung out right in front of our balcony and we had to call security to ask them to move. It seems the spa rooms in Block 6 are the hot commodity. They're right behind Block 5 but much quieter and more perks.I don't understand the comments about the language barrier. The staff speaks multiple languages. I speak Spanish but my travel buddy doesn't and she managed to get everything she wanted. I thought the staff was very nice and went out of their way to accommodate us. We brought a couple of singles for tip money and that didn't hurt. We were on a first name basis w/some. The animation staff is full of energy and work all day. You'll see them on the beach, by the pool, in the evening variety shows and then at the disco. They must run these poor kids ragged but they don't seem to mind. They're always smiling trying to get you involved.The food was pretty good at the buffets and a la carts. We didn't get sick but we were very regular. We're picky eaters so we stuck w/food that was prepared in front of us (e.g., omelets, grilled fish, pork chops, etc.). There is nothing appetizing about food that's been sitting out. Also, don't overload your plate w/a ton of stuff because it won't sit well in your stomach. Use common sense and you'll be fine. The Brazilian, Mexican and Japanese restaurants are a must. The Italian I could've done w/out. Note, the only place to grab a bite between 3-6 pm is the 24 hr pizza/burger place and the lines are out of control. The pizza is good but I wasn't diggin the burgers. Space out your eating time and you won't starve like we did. Btw, you'll see advertising for Captain Cook's seafood restaurant. Skip it. The food is lousy (how can you botch grilled seafood?) and they'll charge you $60. The only thing cool about the place is the free water taxi.The beach is beautiful and there are a ton of chairs. However, if you want shade, you'll have to rise early to claim a palapa (thatched roof umbrella). We got up at 6:30am and threw our towels and some clothes on the chairs then grabbed breakfast. They weren't touched by the time we returned. Yes, it's selfish but everyone does it so when in Rome...or DR. Btw, the massage huts on the beach are a must. They're cheaper than the spa and the breeze is delicious. Faustina runs the one near the beach bar. She's fantastic and the relaxing massage for $30 hr is out of this world.This was my first trip to Punta Cana and I'll def go back. However, I'd like to check out other hotels to compare. I heard the Melia and Flamenco properties are some of the best. Keep an open mind and you'll be fine. If you're expecting five stars go elsewhere. I hear the French Riveria is wonderful.

<Content>Not a good experience I don't even know how to start....well your room won't be ready until almost 4pm; *** this is not a place for tourists*** I would say 85% of the visitors were residents of the island, places like pool tables, basketball courts and big parts of the pools and bars were usually taken by residents; the food is not the best in the main diner, but I got to say, if you do reservation on the exclusives restaurants (mexican, japannies, spain and brazillian; all 4 stars) you will love it, but because everyone wants to go there, they are just looking around just to see if you finish to almost kick you out because they have people waitting, so, you have to eat in a hurry ( but the food was good ); I will recommend that your kids use water shoes to get in the pool, cuz the flood its too rustic and they may have minor cuts (mine kids did) ;room service was fine, didn't see anything fun at night, casino was empty, and the kids club its a simple play ground like the one on your nearest park, the beach was nice but I'm sorry I don't recommend or return to this hotel; I've been in 2 others resorts in Punta Cana before and I had a great experience, but this one 0.

<Content>Awful Resort, robers be aware!! We experience the most awful vacation time ever. Rooms: Our room was not ready for guests. The bedspreads were wet and so were the sheets. There were no towels in the bathroom and the minibar was empty. We were locked out of the room three times and finally maintenance came to repair the lock.There were bugs on the beds. The rooms smelled like mildew.The next day the VIP representative, Mel, came to meet with us and he spoke to the Public Relations Manager. She spoke to us and transfered us to the Elite Club. During this transfer, some of our belongings dissapeared. So another hazzle, called security and bottom line nothing was recovered. The upgraded room was still smelly, but we got a better bed.This hotel needs major repairs. The rooms are not maintain in good standards. The a/c leaks in every room. We had 4 rooms.Service:Maids, waitresses, bartenders were wonderful.Entertainment:The entertainment team was great. This hotel is not worth a dime!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>many problems first of all the trip itself was good because we made it good...my concerns were that the last 2 hours of my trip i spent fighting with the manager-joel. he charged us for the use of the internet when we didnt use the internet...we asked for proof that we used the internet and he said he did not have to show us it and when we said were goin to leave without paying he threatened us. he said  try leaving and see what is goin to happen to you we were disgusted and we were forced to pay for it because our bus was leaving for the airport. writing this gets me angry and we almost got into a brawl with them. every single employee at the front desk was rude and they raised there voices at ussecond when we got to the room there was no converter, the bed was broken on the left side, the toilet was broken, there was no towels...when we asked to come fix these things not one thing was fixedthirdly they allow locals to come in the resort on the weekends and it ruins your trip because everywhere u go it is packed and good luck finding a seat to eatif we didnt party hard this trip would have sucked i would not recommend it because of the problem we had with the manager

<Content>You get what you pay for My husband and I (both 30 years old) stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from May 31 - June 7, 2008. We booked through WestJet vacations and paid $1169 per person (taxes in) for the trip. The hotel transfer was an additional $20 per person via the website. The tourist card ($10 on entry) and departure tax ($20) was included in the WestJet vacation package.The hotel is a 20 minute bus ride from the airport. When we first checked in, we were given room 2403 (Block 2, 4th floor), which is right by the front desk. There is a $20 deposit fee to use the safety box. You get this money back at the end of your trip as long as you return the key. Block 2 and 3 are in the same building and right behind the main entertainment area so it gets quite noisy for the shows from 9pm-11pm daily. I would suggest anything in block 5 and up if you want less noise during those hours. In the first 2 days we were moved to 4 different rooms because of various problems (original room's safety box was broken, then we asked to be moved to a more quiet section, then the new room they gave us wasn't made up and when no one came after 4 hours we went to the reception desk where they upgraded us to a Tropical Junior Suite for the all the inconvenience). This made all the moving around worth it. We had a jacuzzi in the room with a king sized bed and we were 10 steps away from the beach!FOOD:There is only one main restaurant for buffet. The food was mediocre and the selection is small (compared to other resorts we have been to). The food was bascially the same day after day. The Bahia (Brazilian) restaurant offers a mini buffet selection during lunch time. There is a third buffet restaurant but it is in the Vera Club section (Italian folks) and I'm not even sure if we were allowed there, although we did not try. The a la carte restaurants:You make reservations at the front podium in the main buffet area. The only seating times available are 6pm or 8pm but if you show up after 9:30pm at any of the restaurants they will just seat you. There was no limit on the amount of reservations you were allowed. We made our reservations each day at 11am for the same evening with no problems. Japanese restaurant - There is a grill at every table so the cook makes the food in front of you. They cook up beef, chicken, seafood, cut up veggies and fried rice. Each of the meats are cooked separately then combined with the veggies and then soy sauce is put on top. The food comes out all tasting the same - just salty. The dessert that is served is the same ones that come from the main buffet. I could have done without this meal.Brazilian - I would recommend this. The food was simple but really good. The meat on the skewers were delicious.Mexican - This was okay. Most of the items were deep fried. I loved the chips and gucamole.Italian - This was good. The best part of the meal was the appetizers: meats, cheese, and the bread!! I ordered filet mignon with a grape sauce but what I got was more of a salsbury steak with gravy. 24 hour snack bar - All they ever had was pizza and popcorn. I saw hot dogs once or twice. They don't have a menu posted so you have no idea what is even offered. We ordered hamburgers once but the meat looked pink even after it was cooked twice. Le Cafe - Great!! They have fantastic frappucinos - topped with whipped cream and drizzled in chocolate sauce...mmmm! MISCBeach - Ocean/beach itself is beautiful. Resort does not take care of its beach though. There was garbage (straws, cigarette butts, cups, broken glass) all over the place. No garbage cans to be seen around the beach. I never saw anyone walking around picking up garbage either. Massages - Massage huts all over the resort. These are outdoor and in the open but there is a semi private hut near the 24 hour snack bar. They charge $30 an hour and it is worth it. We tipped $5 per person. The resort spa is separate building and they charge a lot more.Things to bring (aside from the obvious) - Antibacterial hand soap for your room, spray air freshner, an alarm clock (or just a clock as they do no have them in any of the rooms), Cortizone (for heat rashes), Benadryl (to stop the itching from heat rash...lol), face cloths (we got these one day and never saw them again). We brought mosquito repellant and After Bite but did not see a real need to use this. We did however get some anti-Malaria pills from our doctor as there have been some outbreaks in the Punta Cana area this year. Tipping - We tipped the maids $2 each day, $2 at the a la carte restaurants, and $2 per bag to the bell boys as they dragged our suitcases up 4 floors when we first got there. We did not frequent the bars so did not tip when we went up for the odd drink. Over-all the trip was okay but a little disappointing. We did not go on vacation to party and get drunk all the time. It was more to relax, enjoy the beach, and have some decent food. Personally I would not go back to a Barcelo resort. I have found that the Occidental Grand and Bahia Principe chains to be much better. We normally go around this time every year and pay about $1500....so I guess you get what you pay for!

<Content>Not Good Let this be a warning to anyone planning on booking a trip to the Barcelo Domincan Beach resort. DON'T DO IT!!! My girl friend and I just returned from a week at the Barcelo Dominican Beach and we didn't have that great of time there. When we first arrived we were optomisic that we were going to have a great time. The person at the front desk ordered us drinks to enjoy while completing the check in paperwork and the bell boy promptly escorted us to the first of many rooms we would be told we were staying in, The first room we entered was a steam bath and smelled of mold. We assumed it was because we were in a tropical climate in a room that didn't have the air conditioning on. The bell boy left our luggage for us and exited the room without giving us time to ask questions. My girl friend who had been up for almost 24 hours wanted to shower before we began to explore the resort but soon discovered that it wouldn't be possible in that room. When she entered the bathroom she noticed the dirty mess even though there we signs saying sterilized. The shower head wasn't attached to the shower it just sat on the floor of the tub which made it impossible for her to use. We also began to notice how dirty this so called four star resort room was. There were black streaks on the wall with many water stains on the ceiling that needed painted over. Under the covers of the beds and also on the pillows was black hair which we assumed were from the previous guest. I called the front desk and they sent someone to move us to another room. When we went down one floor to the room exactly below the dirty room we found it to be in the same conditions. It had a smell that would make someone with the strongest stomach sick. We explained to the bell boy what was wrong and that is when we finally got some help. The bell boy told us to call the resort manager and tell him that we were calling our travel agent. After I spoke with the manager and the manager spoke to the bell boy in Spanish we were moved again. This time we were moved to another building that met our expectations. The room was basic but nice, the air conditioning was on when we entered which meant no smell. The bathroom was clean but dark and this bed seemed newer with clean sheets on them.  Our happiness with the room was short lived, we found our that Barcelo Dominican Beach had lots of water issues. During most of our stay hot water was not an option when taking a shower. One night there was no water so we were unable to shower or even flush the toilet. Also when you did have water most of the time the smell that came with it made it so you didn't want to get in it.  We do want to say that most of the staff at Barcelo Dominican Beach was very nice to us. Most of them spoke good English and went out of there way to make you happy. But even with that said we wouldn't recommend this resort to anyone who is hoping to have a great week in Punta Cana.

<Content>what can i really and truely say this is my long and boring review i hope you find it useful and im sorry that i go on alot. AIRPORT ARRIVALthe landing was bumpy but it felt fantastic to land after a 9hr flight. stepping off the plane the suns heat hit me and it felt nice to be out of england. before entering to pay $10 to get into the country we had our picture taken with 2 Dominican ladies. the photos are available at the end of your holiday once you leave to go home. collecting our luggage was fast and easy and we were able to get out of the airport about 30mins after we had landed which was very quick.HOTEL ARRIVALwe were greeted with cocktails which tasted great. the check was fast and easy and our luggage was taken to our room very quickly. when going to the lobby to see new people arriving to the hotel they had the animators dancing for them and we did not get this treatment wither it was because we had arrived a couple hours late because of our flight we do not no but i felt very let done that we did not get this greeting.THE ROOMthe rooms were very smelly crawling with bugs and was very damp causing mine and my sisters clothes to be damp in the mornings and smell awful causing me to feel self conscience with the smell. my bed was crawling with insects causing me over 30 bites at the beginning of the holiday which caused me to keep well covered up because of the bites. i had to spray my bed with insect repellent because the maids only changed the sheets once a week. the shower ran yellow water because of the rusty pipes and had to wait a few minutes for the water to clear. the balcony was big but was crawling with ants. overall the room was a huge disappointment.THE BARSthere was a total of 5 bars that i went to which i will go into detail about each one.The Amigo Bar:this bar was always busy it seemed to me or maybe it was because i had to stand there for a maximum of 25mins even when they weren't busy. i was my 3rd day and i was standing there for 25mins having enough of Spanish and Dominicans pushing in i became angry with people constantly pushing in front of me and getting served within a few minutes now i don't get angry but i just let my anger slip and slammed my hand down on the bar walking away. going back there the next night i was served straight away even when it was busy and the bar staff never once forgot to serve me ever again. i learned that at this bar you have to speak up to get a drink don't just stand there because otherwise you wont get served.The Beach Bar:this bar is nice with a little self service with your own fizzy drinks. no quest. there is a lovely lady called Isabel who it fantastic and very helpful. she was one of my favorite bar staff on the holiday. quick service always with a smile.The Pool Bar:open from early to late this bar is fantastic earning alot if funny memory's from me like the time i had a spit ball war with another quest hitting the bar staff by accident but getting a laugh and an amused smile from them. the service at this bar was very fast as well earning them a big grin and a thumbs up from me as i spent most of my nights here at the bar until it was time to disco.The Disco Bar:this bar was never full and the bar man was very funny and always had mine and my sisters drink ready as soon a s we reached the bar he would have began pouring them. having a laugh at this bar was never hard as the bar men was chatty and served you with a smile every time and some times showed there dancing moves earning a grin from the awaiting customers.all the bar staff were extremely friendly and professional and i had only one problem at the beginning of the holiday and then it was sorted. the bar staff always greeted and served with a grin and the trainee bar man was nice and very professional. so a big thank and a thumbs up for them.THE RESTAURANTSsorry guys i can only comment on the snack bar as i did not eat any where else apart from the Japanese which was amazing especially when you have to catch flying rice in your mouth. the snack bar was ok but the pizza was always dry and tasted like microwave pizza. the sausages tasted great but by far my favorite was the curry sausage. there was a cafe near the casino which did all coffees and the hot chocolate which tasted fabulous. THE ENTERTAINMENT AND STAFFdo you love salsa? meringue? and other Spanish type of dance? well it was cool at the start but got way to repetitive it was so boring. all they ever did was dance. they had one comedy show which in no way even made a smile come to my face more of a questioning look. there was a grand total of 3 decent shows and they were; a show with all English music, a Brazilian show and a fire show by the pool. the fire show was by far the best and was so amazing i would fly back there just to see the show. me and my sister couldn't stop laughing all the way though it was funnier then the comedy show and the show wasn't even comedy! it was just small comments that got me and my sister giggling including the entertainers who kept pulling funny faces at us while performing the show. fire sword fights, jumping though a ring of fire and funny looking hats at the start of the show was what made it wonderful. there was meant to be a beach party every Friday; no beach party at all. we heard so many excuses from the animators we just decided to stop asking about it. the first friday was understandable as it would not stop raining the next Friday the excuses were; music not playing, it was going to rain (we checked the weather forecast and no it was clear that night), the boss didn't want a beach party and didn't have enough workers to set it up. the real reason was it was just not the correct season and they didn't want to have one why they wouldn't say that in the first place puzzles me.now im always annoyed that people write about a line or 2 about the entertainment staff just saying like they were friendly and hard working. i hate it because you never know what they are like so i will put abit about the animators me and my sister spoke to all good of course.kissy kissy (Lleudy i think his name was): my sister gave him this nick name because he stuck out his tounge alot. he made us laugh and was very nice but did not play any games on the beach but none the less was a great entertainer and very chatty.Pepito: if you've ever seen one on one he looks just like flex Washington. Pepito was kind and sweet always making me and my sister laugh because he said i was to sad when in fact i wouldn't stop smiling i guess that was the joke but he made the holiday a holiday.Alfredo: what a fantastic person. he spoke in a very strong London accent and no hes Dominican but has been to england a few times. he spoke so much English i felt like i really was talking to a Londoner. if you like to roll your eyes don't roll them in front of Alfredo because it confuses him which always made me chuckle because he did not understand what it meant! over all Alfredo is chatty and you will never have a dull moment when talking to him.Issac: easily the most loudest animator in the whole hotel. you can hear him from the beach to the pool. he has a saying which i have to clue what he says but its what he says most. hes funny and can dance a little as you will see at the beginning of every show. i taught him one dance move that i made up on my second day i don't no if he remembers it but it it looks like hes smelling his armpits when you see him dance then thats the dance i taught him. over all he always put a smile on my whole family's faces when ever he began to dance. Roberto!!: is amazing so friendly and sooo sweet bless him. hes a brilliant dancer and can do a better Micheal jackson then Micheal jackson himself. he was one of the only animators that actually said good bye even if he was on his way to rehearsal for the nights show he still said good bye. if i could thank him again i would because this man knows how to make a holiday for everyone. so thank you.Entertainment Manager: is very friendly and super. my little brother kept winning games and the prizes were rum. my brother is 13 and cant drink rum so the E.M gave my little brother a painting before we left and said to remember the Dominican republic every time he looks at it. also my sister was up on stage for miss Dominican beach and had a asthma attack the E.M came up to me and said that i weren't aloud to smoke around her and that he was watching my sister to see if she would smoke and told me i was in charge of her smoking or not smoking. he was very funny and i had to hide my sister when she was smoking in case he would show up. this was all in good spirit and made the whole family laugh. the E.M has a very good English vocab and said good bye to us all upon leaving. THE DISCOi went every night and the only good nights were when the Dominicans came for the weekend the whole dance floor was packed. other then that weekend it was extremely dead and almost had me snoozing and i could never stay till the end. the animators would come for a short time before leaving. for young party goers i think the going out of the disco is were you will head. if you want good decent dance music you have to ask otherwise you will be stuck with the lovely Spanish dancing the nightTHE BEACHis beautiful and is were the games our held. games start around 10ish and last roughly 30mins and then the animators either go do other things such as pool aerobics or beach aerobics and even dancing to that wonderful Spanish music you will all grow tired of by the end of your holiday. the afternoon games start at 3pm and end at about 4:30pm ish. make sure you get to the beach early to get a shady spot otherwise you will roast out under the sun.USEFUL TIPSspray your bed with insect repellent before sleeping in it.if you spray your self with insect repellent be careful because i sprayed and got bit badly. when i didn't spray i was fine just like the rest of my family.take alot of small change to tip the people with.remember sun cream otherwise you will end up looking like a lobster just like my sister did.will i go back? yes i will. did i enjoy myself? no not quite but towards the end i didn't want to leave. would i recommend this hotel? if you haven't booked what are you waiting for????thank you for reading and if you need anymore help just message me and also if you know the show song the one that goes 123 then tell me because ive not been able to get it out of my head and theres one more song which i think goes something like diamo diamo diamo im not to sure but if you no what is called i would be very thankful.i want to say a big shout out to the 2 lovely couples i met out there with my family and say thank you for your luck and that i fell asleep during it!!! :) i will be returning soon hopefully so i shall see you all real soon!

<Content>Loved this trip!!!!! My boyfriend and I just returned from Punta Cana last week and we had an amazing time staying at this resort!Checking in: Ok...We got to the hotel at 3PM and waited a few minutes to check in. The front desk staff was not too friendly but they did their job. After waiting for our room, we found out that we had been upgraded for free to a Tropical Junior Suite. Can't complain at all! Room: Wonderful!!! We had a large, comfortable bed with mattress pad that made me feel like I was floating on clouds. Slept like a baby all 4 nights we were here. There was a jacuzzi in our room (didn't use it but really nice!!) and a large balcony with two chairs overlooking palm trees and a pond in the middle of the resort. The cleaning staff kept our room clean daily..I expected less from them seeing the reviews on this site that staff don't change the towels and don't clean--but we walked in on our cleaning lady cleaning twice (and veryyy thoroughly). She even came back one night with extra towels just in case we wanted any. I don't know if this is because of our room type, but I was very pleased with the service every day. Only problem with the room was that the TV remote didn't work...but hey, we weren't there to watch TV anyways so who cares!Food: BreakfastHow many times can I say AMAZING? We had early breakfast every day at the main buffet and it was so good! I especially liked the omelet/egg station where they make eggs to order right in front of you! Everything always very fresh! There is an abundance of all kinds of fruit, breads, delicious cheeses, crepes, the most delicious little donuts I've ever had, and a full buffet of bacon, oatmeal, cereals, scrambled eggs, potatoes, etc...let's just say you won't go hungry here!Food: Lunch/DinnerFor lunch we went back to the same buffet a couple of times as well as the buffet and grill by the beach (I think it's called Bahia). Always great grilled fish, chicken, rice, french fries, lamb, sausages, hamburgers, etc. GREAT salads too I loved them! Wide variety of desserts as well...ice cream on the beach on a hot day is awesome!For dinner we made reservations at the Italian, Japanese, and Brazilian restaurants. My favorite (both taste and staff wise) was the Brazilian (which is served at the Bahia restaurant by the beach). They came around with skewers of chicken, pork, beef, ribs, sausage, and there was a buffet of sides you could go get yourself. Great atmosphere! Wine served with the meal was also quite good. The Japanese steakhouse is more the experience and not necessarily the food. It's cool to see them make the food, but I wasn't blown away by it. Good sushi and fried rice...the meats were ok. Italian place...good. Bars:AWESOME! The best bar is the one on the beach. Awesome to have any drinks we wanted while on the beach. Great bartenders...made good caipirihnas..my favorite. Self-serve soda machine at bar too if you don't like the alcoholLobby bar also reallllyyy good. The serve wine, all mixed drinks, etc. and you can sit either in the oudoor lobby where they have lush, comfy couches, or take drinks to the entertainment outdoor area where they have a ton of tables to sit at an enjoy the live shows they have every night.Le Cafe--best coffee ever. I was really pleasantly surprised by even the basic cafe con leche (with milk) they serve..really tasty. They also make reallllllyyy good frozen cofees with whipped topping, chocolate, and/or caramel..good to unwind too after a full day of sitting in the sun. They serve pastries here too. It reminded me of a true European cafe.Entertainment/Casino:Funny entertainment at night...good for a laugh or two. Don't take it too seriously but a good way to spend the evening. The staff is very energetic and there to make everyone happy. Lots of dancing, lots of high energy. Casino--don't go. There was no one there when we went...and I lost 60 dollars in under 5 minutes. Didn't go back the rest of the nights. Find a better way to spend your money!Beach:Perfection. Every day we had amazing warm weather with clear blue skies. Remember to wear that sunscreen--the sun is brutal. I'm still peeling from the Day 1 sunburn I got! We had no problem getting out towels every morning and finding our lounge chairs. not very crowded at all. There are a ton of things to do on the beach--aerobics, bocce ball, renting board games (we did backgammon--so fun!), or various other water sports. The water was also very very warm and clean--a delight to be in the water alll day! As for the people on the beach--be ready to see some skin. Lots of topless sunbathers but it didn't bother me since I'm of European nationality. Sure, you won't see anything like it in the US--but people don't see anything wrong with it and don't really flaunt their bodies so it's not really a big deal. Do what you are comfortable with--you won't be a loner with a bathing suit and you won't be a loner without one!Yes--if you take a walk you will get hassled by the locals who want to sell you souvenirs. Be nice to them--this is their living. No one is making you stop anywhere--if you just keeping walking they will leave you alone! Make sure you take the time to walk along the shore--you get to see what other resorts look like, dip into the water at any point in time, get tan, and get some exercise all at once. Really enjoyed it!

<Author>Caribbean-Sensation
<Content>Seasoned Punta Cana Traveller! Very Nice Hotel! My stay at the Barcelo Dominican Beach overall was very nice. The people were friendly, the food was good, but I did have some concerns which I did let the hotel know about at the end of my stay.The Barcelo Dominican Beach is a good size hotel. It is divided into two hotels formerly The Ocean Spa Resort and Ocean Cana Resort. I stayed in the Ocean Spa section. There were many French Canadians, and the Ocean Cana section seemed to house many vacationers from France and Italy. Not too many english speaking folks, and when I did run into someone speaking english the comments were Thank God you speak English!, Are we in Europe?.The rooms are clean and comfortable, with a kind of douvet padding over the mattress, which made you feel like you were sleeping on a cloud. I stayed in Block 7 close to the beach. The only problem I had was that my room wasn't cleaned the entire week I was there. I never noticed the mirrors clean, counter or floors cleaned. The maid only made my bed and emptied the garbage. I always had to go to the cart myself to grab 4-5 bottles of water as she never seemed to restock my fridge. I am a very tidy person so maybe the maid felt she didn't need to clean for one person. Towel service was ok. Take your own face cloth if you like one. The resort is very nice overall with pretty gardens, a resident peacock couple which roam closest to the main dining buffet which backs on to a beautiful, as the call it lake with and bridge and gazzebo in the centre. Many nights you could hear them calling out and people would look up into the rafters trying to find them.The ate at the Japanese restaurant, which is great. Also at the Italian, the ambiance is nice and Mexican, which is alright, it's like eating at Taco Bell. All were very good overall. The service by the waiters, they are all very attentive and meals were timely served. To eat at the Seafood restaurant you have to pay an extra $40.00 USD which I didn't want to pay extra for. The Japanese and Spanish restaurants are definitely worth going to. It is best to book a restaurant of your choice at 9am, and they will only let you book 2 restaurants on one given time. I ate mostly at the main buffet restaurant which the menu was always plentiful. Loved the breakfasts! Crepes, french toast, eggs, bacon wasn't so good, bread was nice, buns of all sorts, and fruit galore, loved the mango......mango shakes were nice too. Not that I drink a lot of coffee but I heard the cafe called Le Cafe had wonderful coffee, latte's etc.As for the beach, it is beautiful. The only problem there was that there weren't enough garbages on the beach. I was always stepping on straws, napkins and stirafoam plates, cigarette butts and platic cups were always left around by other travellers and then flying around due to the wind so I found myself picking up garbage a lot of the time as I walked to/from the beach to get drinks or go to the bathroom. I did see twice during the week that a couple of resort crew did walk around and pick up garbage by hand, but still you should be accountable for your own mess! Entertainment was good by the beach crew and most of the nightly entertainment was by the same people. I wouldn't call it great but you got a good laugh now and then. The entertainment I experienced last year the the LTI Beach Resort was fantastic, almost like Las Vegas style shows. It was kind of disappointing at the Barcelo Dominican Beach. Beach activites - same things every day, bocce ball, pool/beach aerobics, crazy games, volleyball. If you want to keep active, you got it. If you want to relax, you can. I wanted to go on the hobby cat sailer but very, very disappointed as you have to pay for someone to take you, unless you know how to do it yourself. One day I was quoted $35.00 us/hr, two days later $45.00/hr. What's up with that? Taking $200.00 USD didn't take me very far for the week so be prepared to bring a bit more.The best part of my trip is I went on the Saona Island tour, where you get bused 1.5 hrs to Bahayhibe and then jet boats shuttle you over to the catamaran which then takes a 1.5 -2hr catamaran ride to Saona Island for a Dominican Lunch and beach time and the Jet Boating you to a natural lagoon where there are so many star fish (take a picture with a starfish) and have about 45min. to swim and drink and then get Jet Boated back to where you started. We saw wild dophins on the way back which was great! Cost - $85.00 USD - worth it and would do it again.As a former Travel Agent with 19yrs previous experience I have been many places and and stayed at many resorts. I love Punta Cana and I will continue to travel there in the future. Last year I stayed at the LTI Beach Resort and had a fabulous time. Probably better there than Dominican Beach but I always like to experience different hotels. This was my 3rd time to Punta Cana as a single traveller.As far as the travel advisories, I took all the precautions. I had the hepatitis shots 2mths before I left - cost $165.00 CAD. My doctor prescribed Dukoral and I took the 2 doses two weeks before I left for my vacation, which if you don't know it, it's for the Travellers Diarreha and I still had the runs which started my 4th day there - cost about $25.00 CAD. I took the malaria pills which cost me $88.00 CAD, which I probably won't take the next time. I did however get bitten by sand fleas, around the 4th day of my vacation. I did see other people with the same bites. Not mosquitos. I had Skin so Soft by Avon, which is known to ward off mosquitos and I have had much success in other caribbean destinations. I also had Off with deet. But that did fend off the sand fleas.Overall, I enjoyed my holiday. Don't take all the traveller reviews too hard because it can make you crazy and then you don't know which hotel you want to stay at. Just choose one you like and make the best of your holiday as not everything is perfect no matter if you stay at a 5 Star or 3.5 Star which the Barcelo Dominican Beach was rated 3.5 - 4 Star. You'll have a great time but that's because, You will make it Great!Happy Travelling!

<Content>Won't go back Came back April 26/08. Beach was AAA, activities and entertainment was great, but all excersions were extra, please book only with reputable on-site bondable tours. Vendor's were very aggressive with unreasonable prices to start, must bargain! Come prepared with anti-diarrhea med.(imodium), even the most cautious could get sick. Room service was terrible, for all-inclusive, we still had to ask for towels, coffee, sugar, stirsticks, water, pop,garbage bags,ashtrays, and any phone calls were never answered. Our safety deposit box key, worked in other rooms in other buildings!! Room service left our front and patio doors unlocked every day, be prepared to speak spanish or french. Guest services were non existant, but $$ and patience paid off. Hot shower's only happened one day as the cold wouldn't work. Use the coffee machine with only water to shave. Gift shop prices were unreasonable for everyday stuff, ex. $5.00 Euro. for travel size tooth-paste. Bring your own band-aides, peroxide, skin-care, tan lotion (30-50 SPF) eye-care, ex. or pay!! Sexual advances from tourist's and one male staff member.

<Content>Very Impressed With The Hotel!!!!! Loved It! Me and my boyfriend (Mid-20's) stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from the dates of April 19th - 24th. We loved it!! We are from the USA, and we went with an open mind knowing we were going to a 3rd world country. I have been reading the reviews like a maniac keeping up to date on what people were writing. I have to say this... You get what you pay for and then some!FOOD: The best that it could be for eating food that is not from your country. Barcelo tries so hard at accomodating everyone visiting their resort. There are so many Europeans, Canadians, etc. Not a lot of people spoke English, but I kind of liked that. I thought it was cool, to see how others communicate. That being said, we are all accustomed to different types of food. I am a true Italian and I have to say the pizza was really good... We did go to the Japanese and that was awesome! That was my favorite, great dessert as well! The buffet's breakfast was soo yummy!!! So many different options, and for those that don't like to try anything new, there was always, fruit and yogurt available. My boyfriend did get very sick on the 2nd to last day. I was worried about him, but at the gift shop you can pretty much get anything you need. We got immodium and pepto bismal. PEOPLE: Very nice! Everyone: travelers, entertainers, workers.. Great! Very accomodating! I was impressed at all of the different languages they spoke!POOLS AND BEACH: This place is the best! Always chairs available on the beach, little huts for those that like the shade. 3 different pools, in which we went to all of them! Our biggest decision was should we go to the pool and if so which one? The beach had so many activities going on at all time. The boys that entertain the beach are hysterical. I pretty much laughed all day at them. The water aerobics was cool too. Soccer balls, volley balls, ping pong, pool tables. There was just so much to do!Drinks: Very good, if you tip them they will make you a frozen margarita, if not you get a mix. They were yummy as well... Oh and there beer (Cerveza) was sooo good, and I dont even like beer! ROOM: I loved our room. Loved it! High ceilings and nice balcony. We did not pay money to upgrade we were happy as is. I was very happy and I am sad that I am writing this review because I am home! Overall I am very impressed with Punta Cana and the Barcelo Dominican. I truly believe that they try very hard and they want everyone to always be entertained!!!!!!Please contact me if you have any questions.. Otherwise... ENJOY!!!!

<Content>Relaxing holiday, good for families We went with First Choice and the company was marvelous as well as the Rep at the hotel (Jacki). They can't do enough to help you and try as much as they can to ensure your stay is enjoyable. We went to Kenya with first Choice and appreciated their customer service so much that we went with them again this year. Didn't even bother going with anybody else. We had dietary needs that were linked to medical conditions and they were really good.Hotel is under new management and the Barcelo group have spent money already making improvements. Unfortunately, the hotel has three blocks that are very old and run down - Barcelo have plans to refurbish these but if you get one at present - yuck! We were moved three times during our two weeks stay and this was the worst part of the holiday. Blocques 2,3 and 4 are horrible. They are damp, mouldy, old, small. Our room had cockroaches and the water was dripping down the walls.The hotel do help by sending in the fumigators and cleaning but it is made worse by the fact that some of these rooms do not have extractor fans in the bathrooms. Damp central!The air con smells and if you are asmathic you will suffer. They came and sprayed something in the air con vent and it seemed to help. If you can afford it - book a Caribbean spa suite room as these are of the size that you would expect in a regular room elsewhere in the caribbean. Unfortunately these are not assigned at the regular price (which is already not cheap). Beach is beautiful, sea is clear and warm. Beach bar and beach cafe with snacks. Pizza all day long. Really good buffets. We are strict vegetarians and were never hungry - quite the opposite. We have all put weight on in two weeks! Chefs and waiting staff are really helpful and work hard.People were tipping all the time. We didn't do this and tipped at the end of the holiday. We took a suitcase of old clothes and toys and gave them to the staff - they were very grateful. Hotel has good systems in place and you just sign a form to say that you gave them stuff.Do not expect things to be done immediately - it just won't happen. Not because they are lazy but just because that is how it is. The hotel has lots of staff and has a nice safe resort feeling. We are all relaxed and have had a good holiday. We met lots of nice people from all over the world and learnt some Spanish too! Lots of Canadians, French, Belgians come as well as Brits. Everyone enjoyed the entertainment programme. Kids club is good and in the shade. Lady who runs it is very good and the kids love her.Lots of people that we spoke to had been moved two or three times - the same as us. Unfortunately, many said they would not return - BArcelo need to bear in mind that lots of people agreed with the comment that the rooms are small for the price that you pay. Also the fact that Blocques 2,3,4 are horrible. Bearing in mind that for the same price, families would get two interconnecting rooms in other places e.g. Southern Palms, Kenya - you don't get much space for the money you pay.We would go back because the resort is lovely apart from the rooms in the above mentioned blocks. First Choice rep was amazing but she is moving on to Greece for the summer. Food was great as was the landscaping and beach.

<Content>if you dont speak french dont GO!!! this being my 3rd trip to the dominican, and having travelled to cuba and mexico i would say that this resort is about average. the grounds like most other resorts is well kept and maintained. the rooms are like most others. nothing special but who cares. the food at the buffet tasted great and was one of the better i have had in the dominican but that being said i did have stomach issues the next day everytime i ate at it. on that note the al cartes where above average for most resorts. the italian was decent stay away from the cannelonni as it is just a big mess of cheese and when i say that i really mean that. we were a group of 10 travelling and even the biggest cheese lovers couldnt eat it. we ate at it 2 times and the filet mignon is great, also if you want to try something else order another dish as they have no problem serving additional dishes. the brazilian was not to bad some of us didnt like it but i found it pretty good. u get to try all the meat so if you dont like it just push it aside. the japanesse is just like any other japanesse anywhere else you stay in the D.R it is a great show and good food. the only thing i can complain about the japanesse is how salty it is. the mexican was probably the most dissapointing of all as the salsa was super hot and the chicken fajitas were subpar. also if you want the japanesse you have to be at the buffet for about 6:30 in the morning to be able to book it. not to freak anyone out but we did see first hand a WORM found in one of the buffet dishes. the staff picked it out and just moved the spoon around in the dish and left it there to be eaten. maybe that is why i had stomach issues i have no idea. the beach is great and there are alwasy lots of loungers to be had anytime of the day as well with the pool area. nice big pool with a great swim up bar, and the water is very warm in the pool and in the ocean. the ocean is very calm here and great for swimming. the beach has lots of palm tress so if you want some shade pretty much not matter where you are there is alwasy some to be had. the nightly show / entertainment is by far the worst i have ever seen in my life absolutely terrible. the only good night was thrusday and friday as these were probably some of the better shows i have seen in the carribbean. so 5 terrible nights and 2 great nights. the only good thing was the band that plays every night from about 6 to 9. every friday they have there beach party! it was pretty good but have fun trying to get a drink on the beach as they allow the locals in with day passes and they all get served first and flood the bar like sharks. if you want a drink go into the brazilian restaurant they serve drinks till early in the morning. it is just off the beach. if your younger and looking for night life this is not the place for you. the disco is massive for resort standards but is usually dead and all they play is local music. they say they have a 24hr bar but that is pretty much a joke we had to tip the manager and bartender very hansomely the first night there to get this option and they only guaranteed us drinks till 5 am and that was basically only beer and rum drinks. the pizzeria is open till i think 6 in the morning and is alright but gets old pretty quick! you can also get some drinks here aswell it is attached to the brazillian where we partied every night. if you ask the bartender in the brazillian he will put on any of your own CD's. one last bad thing. when we went to check out they tried to charge us 6 US bucks for calls apparently we had made. yes we made one so i agreed to pay 2 US now this took me being a jerk to get it reduced. but please dont put up with them bullying you as all they see us tourists as is money. i know it was a whole 4 bucks i saved but it was the principal of the whole issue. for first timers if you do venture out of the resort or when they set up there little flea market in the resort they will try and get every penny out of you. barter like crazy. if they want 40 bucks for a necklace offer 8 and if they say no just walk away they will chase you and you will get it for that price. dont every pay more then 25% of the asking price. so all that being said this resort is alright dont get me wrong. i have stayed at alot worse 4 star resorts. the staff were alright maybe not as friendly as other resorts but still this resort is definetly a 3.5-4 star. the only reason i will never go back to this resort or any other barcelo is because they cater to french canadians and europeans. i love the europeans actually we partied with them all week but the french canadians are so rude, ignorant and wont talk to you or even give you the time of day if you speak english. it is really sad when people here you speak english and come up to you and say wow it is so nice to hear english. this resort was 95% french canadians, and the rest europeans and english speaking nations. all i can say is thank god we were a group of 10, or this would have probably been the worst vacation ever! go and have fun this resort is not near as bad as others i have been to. matt

<Content>Clappy Clappy! SO much fun! I went to the Barcelo Dominican Beach with 3 friends for a Spring Break trip. We had a GREAT time. We loved everyone at the resort and didn't want to ever leave. The food was good, we especially like the Japanese and Spanish restaurants. The buffets were also pretty good. The staff doesn't really speak English but we never had a problem getting what we needed. The only problem we ran into was that our room keys deactivated a few times.I know that people put bad reviews up here, but you just have to remember, you are in a foreign, third world country. The staff was great and if you smiled and said hello they would remember your face and talk to you whenever they saw you. The entertainment staff was great as well, they loved my friends and I and would come and find us on the beach and before the shows at night. The beach was beautiful and the entire resort was clean. I loved it so much there! I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great Value! The Good:- wonderful beach. Sea weed is collected daily and sand raked each morning- very few vendors to bother you, unlike Puerto Vallarta which is over the top in that area- 3 pools. One salt water. One combination kids and adults activities and one mostly adult. All great and kept clean to the best of their ability. There are alot of trees and foliage on this resort so leaves and twigs undoubtably get in them, especially with the steady ocean breeze we had each day- best and quietest pool in the resort is the one closest to the ocean. Water is also the coolest of the pools so you get nice relief from the heat.- Rooms spacious and clean. Beds aren't bad..a tad soft..but sure better than the hard ones in Mexico. Lot's of hot water and pressure. Yeah!- A/C is awesome. Always left on by the maids so when you return after a long hot day..the cool air is fabulous.- Of the restaurants, try the Italian and Japanesse for sure. Both awesome. - Overall, the buffet food is typical of a 4 star resort. Nothing too fancy or mouth watering but certainly acceptable- If you're an internet person or like to bring a laptop, wireless is available in your rooms for $40 for the week. Decent enough signal strength but a lot slower than home. Remember where you are after all.- Loads of other things available here...including sports bar, an awesome cafe, casino, pool tables, table tennis etc. etc. One really can't get bored here if you're a on the go type of person- service is overall very good and staff mostly quite friendly. They really do work excessively hard. So don't be cheap!A tip here and there goes a long way in getting even better service especially...with the housekeeping people. We left $3US a day for the maid and our room was wonderful, always loads of towels, extra beverages in the fridge etc.The Not-so-Good:very little really, unless you're terribly picky but here a few observations they could improve upon- beach towel service needs an upgrade, as the towels you receive are the only ones you get for your stay. No exchanges. I've not seen this before at any resort we've been.- the grounds are nicely trimmed and kep't but they must of had a very dry winter. Much of the grounds appear too dry and parched...unless that's becuase they economise with water usage- not a biggy..but at most resorts usually the most sociable and friendly staff are those tending bar. Not so at this one..at least thats how we felt. They were efficient enough, did what they had to and acknowledged you...but that's it. They just don't look happy as so many do at other resorts.- no elevators, buildings are three storeys and some four. This is not uncommon in the DR, but be prepared if you're someone who hates stairs.- while walking around this large facility, every once in a while you would get a wiff of an awful stench...like a sewage smell. Comes and goes immediately but I have no idea the cause. - If you have issues at all with the room you're in, I would avoid the front desk and go directly to your tour operator rep. They get results immediately and its a lot less hastle than dealing with poor speaking english staff.Be sure to bring:strong light bulbs for reading in your rooman air freshener block or candlesface clothesbug spray (although..we saw no biting bugs at any time during our stay here in April..but I can't vouch for other times of the year.Recommedation to owners:All this or any of these resort owners need to do..is follow a checklist of items in each room once the guests have left to see if all is working propertly. The TV, the lights, toilet, doors, safe, bugs, etc. etc....just the basic things. This would save a lot of headaches for both the staff and the visitors and would elinimate so many of the complaints that one reads in these reviews.Hope this review has been helpful. I'm writing this while still in the resort so it's fresh in my mind. If you have any other questions about things I've missed, don't hesitate to e-mail me at : bdalz@hotmail.com.

<Content>great vacation, great resort great vacation, great resortMy husband and i just returned from the barcelo dominican for a 7 night stay. March 30-April 6. It was our first time to the dominican and i was a little nervous. We had a terrific time, no problems at all. The food was good and the resort was so clean. It was amazing. We ate at 3 a la carte restaurants. The spanish, italian, and Mexican. The last was our least favorite. We ate at 3 different buffets. All of them were very good. The beach was very nice. The sand was super soft and no problem getting a lounger at 11:00 am. The pools were also very nice but more crowded.We never saw a bug or mosquito inside or outside our room. We would definitely return again. There is a 24 hour snack bar which is very convenient. We arrived at 11:30 pm on sunday night and had some pizza. It was all good. Go and enjoy.

<Content>Cheap, not much more. Just spent 2 nights at the Barcelo Beach and here鈥檚 my take. Let鈥檚 make this simple with the good, the bad and the ugly.The good:The hotel has a great location. It鈥檚 on the beach and because there really isn鈥檛 a 鈥楶unta Cana鈥?town your hotel compound is very important.The casino is within walking distance. Please ask them to give my money back.Disco is within walking distance.There is a train that runs around the compound and it鈥檚 easy to get on and off at the other resorts.You can use the other facilities at the other resorts including some restaurants.The rooms were clean.Plenty of hot water and the water pressure was excellent.Golf is good. The course is the first one built in Punta Cana and the greens are well kept.Some of the food was good.The bad:The hotel is old and shows its age. The staff really tries to keep it clean and neat however it really needs a crew of full time painters.The rooms are spacious but because of the age of the hotel not everything works. We had two rooms and in one the toilet didn鈥檛 flush and the air conditioning was hit and miss, the other room had problems with the t.v. and sliding doors. This is not the place to go if food is important to you. Don鈥檛 get me wrong they will feed you plenty but it鈥檚 not anything I鈥檇 EVER pay for. The buffet is your best bet as it has a choice of many mystery products including some that taste kind of good. The Mexican restaurant is pretty decent considering this hotel is not in Mexico.The staff is underpaid and really overworked. You can not believe what a smile and a couple of bucks in tip will do for your service level. These people are making $150.00USD a month and working 12 hours a day. If you like to drink beer don鈥檛 go to this resort as they only have Presidente on tap and it鈥檚 flat and gross. Drink rum and you鈥檒l be happy, happy, happy.The Ugly:The steak house. Please save your energy and eat a pair of your shoes as they will be more tender than the meat here. The front desk staff.Summary:All in all you get what you pay for. You won鈥檛 starve or go thirsty but you will not come away saying what an amazing culinary experience you had. That is unless your best meal to date was at Burger King.The staff can be lovely if you treat them with respect and give out a few extra Pesos for a job well done. All in all the place is a good 鈥榮hort鈥?getaway at a cheap price. It is not one of those 鈥榤agical鈥?tropical destinations that you鈥檒l never forget. In fact I鈥檓 writing this the day we left otherwise I would have forgotten I was there.

<Content>Bravo Barcelo Dominican Beach My boyfriend and I and some friends decided to spend 5 days and 4 nights in Punta Cana. We were attracted to Punta Cana b/c of the all-inclusives, the beach, and most importantly, the price. After booking the Barcelo Dominican Beach, b/c we somewhat trusted the Barcelo name, I was a bit dismayed to read the poor reviews on tripadvisor.com. Fortunately, our experience was totally the opposite. It was amazing for the price that we paid. The room...We stayed in the Spa Rooms in Block 6. Luckily, we got a free upgrade b/c there were no more king size bedrooms in the complex when we arrived. Our room had a jacuzzi, day bed in addition to the king sized bed, large bathroom, and a closet. The only downsides about the room was that the first night we did not have strong hot water pressure, but that was rectified later on. Moreover, we had to request extra towels, but I can understand that the resort is trying to conserve water (re: save the environment) so it wasn't that bad. My suggestion, bring at least one towel with you for your bathroom, so you have an extra.The beach...Beautiful and very well-kept. It was not hard to find chairs at around 11.30/12 Noon. Lots of sunny spots and shade spots as well. There was some seaweed in the water washing up to shore, but the resort can't control that. Overall, the water was fairly calm and rather clean.The pool...We had a swim up pool bar and three pools. I didn't go into the pool, b/c I'm a beach person, but the pool area from what I saw was well kept as well.The food...The breakfast and lunch buffets were tasty. Your best bet for breakfast is an omelette from the grill and for lunch, the grilled meats. I did not like the dinner buffet, however, we went a bit late (at about 9.30 PM) so perhaps that explains it. For dinner, you definitely need to book reservations for the restaurants on the property. We tried Wasabi (Japanese), Bahia (Brazilian), and Meson (Spanish). Other guests told me that the Italian restaurant was very tasty as well. Out of the ones I visited, I liked Wasabi the best with Meson a close second. Wasabi is a hibachi style restaurant. The 24 hour snack bar was eh...it just gave you more incentive to eat on time.The drinks...Free flowing and strong.The staff...Friendly and accommodating. I practiced my Spanish. Many spoke English, but don't go there expecting the Queen's English, nor should you b/c you're in the DR.I also went to Mangu one night and had lots of fun and we took a snorkeling excursion. Barcelo Dominican Beach is a pretty good hotel and worth the price. We walked down the beach to neighboring hotels and just from looking at them on the beach, they did not look as nice as ours. Overall, I definitely enjoyed my vacation and it was quite relaxing. I was sad to go.

<Content>More than you could ever need My daughter and I just spent 1 week at this wonderful resort, and we were a little leary after reading some of the reviews, but every aspect of our stay was excellent. We had read that check in can be a real night mare but our check in was fast and curtious, we also read that some of the rooms were old and run down. Well our room was great, it was all new tile with an updated bathroom...always cleaned and we had fresh towels.The pools were very clean and well kept, the grounds were beautiful and the people were so kind and helpful considering we did not know their language.There was a very large selection of foods so I'm sure you will find something you have never seen before and you will find somthing to really enjoy.i would definatly go back to this resort, when I get the chance.

<Content>Cockroach Resort This was my second time going to Punta Cana (love it) but would never again stay at this resort.I like to stay at diffrent places to get a feel of something new and I did research on this place and it had it's share of ups and downs just like most of the places, so we took it as this place will be fine ~we just wanted to get away from stress and enjoy the beautiful beach/warm weather. Unfortunatly we had more stress from staying here.From the day we arrived to the day we left, we encountered so many problems and spent most of our vacation speaking to managers, guest services, our travel agent. If your American and don't speak Spanish then they will not treat you with Respect. The staff are not that friendly and harldy speak English. I will be happy to assist anyone who has questions regarding this place, but I just wanted to pre-warn anyone who is thinking of staying here... deft pay the extra money to stay at a nicer/clean/upscale resort then this place that is a cockroach pit.

<Content>Barcelo beach premium We stayed for a week and had a great time. We were going 100% for the beach and to just sit and relax. The hotel was nice, clean and the all inclusive meant we didn't have to carry a wallet around and think about how much we were spending. The beach was beautiful. You had to arrive early in the morning at the beach or the pool or else most of the cabanas could be taken. But that's fine, plop your stuff down and eat some bfast in the shade. The ocean temperature is perfect to walk right into the water. The food is OK. We would have prefered more typical Dominican food than hamburgers and such. Lots more Canadiens and Europeans than Americans. Speaking Spanish helps but not necessary. We never felt slighted for not tipping. For a la carte dinners we took cash and usually gave a small tip. The various tours operated outside the hotel, like horseback riding, dunebuggys, etc were very cool also. Those were expensive. $40-60USD, which in the Dominican is like a million dollars. Anyway, for those you need to negotiate a price. If you speak spanish it helps, but most speak some english anyway. Also, the resorts say there is no town outside puna cana, no reason to leave the hotels. Jump in a cab and go to the little town. It's not pretty, but it's not scary or bad either. At least you get to see a little bit of the DR that isn't a huge hotel. Plus if you are like us, it was a chance to eat a real Dominican meal. We'll return. Maybe try another hotel and see if we can get better food. Oh yes. Pay extra to be Premium at Barcelo. It gives you a private loung with internet, drinks, snacks, etc.

<Content>Persistence Pays! I stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach in Feb of 2008. I went with a group of 15 friends, and all of us had a great time, with a few exceptions. Out of all of us, the only complaint we had about the rooms was the lack of hot water. We found this problem could be avoided however by returning from the beach early to shower. We also had a very difficult time with the front desk staff. We tried four different times to get a key for our safe, and eventually we just gave up. That was my biggest mistake of the trip, as I had cash and a bank card disappear from my wallet that I had kept in my room. This also happened to two of the other three girls I was sharing a room with. Now although my vacation was somewhat overshadowed by this theft, I still had a wonderful time. The beach was absolutely gorgeous, there were plenty of chairs available, and there was always lots to do. The entertainment staff at this hotel are awesome. They grabbed all of us out of our lawn chairs to play beach games each day, providing for some of our favorite memories from the trip. The band that played each night was entertaining as well, and all of us loved the nightly 10PM shows. The food left a bit to be desired, but I definately would make reservations for the restuarants on the property. I have to admit we weren't thrilled about having to get up at 7am to stand in line, but it was well worth it. The italian restuarant was even able to accomodate our entire group. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a great vacation at a great price, but no matter what, make sure and get the key for the safe no matter how many times you have to go back and ask for it!

<Content>Awesome trip!! Don't believe the negative reviews... This was my second time in Punta Cana. The first time was at a 5 star resort. Barcelo Dominican Beach is a 4 star. I would even go as far as saying that Barcelo Dominican Beach is better than the 5 star I went to. The food was better, the staff was friendlier, the ground were cleaner and over-all the look of the resort is superb. I cannot believe the reviews I saw of people bashing the staff and this resort. I have travelled a lot and am very fussy of the service I receive. But this resort surpased my expectations. I did not see any unhappy travellers during the week. Obviously, if you go there with a negative attitude, you will not enjoy everything Barcelo Dominican Beach has to offer. The only thing I found different on this resort, was the beach water. It was not as clear as the other beaches in Punta Cana. We had a windy week, so it might be due to that. There were a lot of fun activities on the beach as well as around the main pool. I would recommend bringing your own face cloths though. The maid only put two a day, but sometimes that is not enough if you're a girl wearing make up! The towels can be as rare as the facecloths too, so hang them to dry on your balcony when you're done. You might have to re-use them. They are trying to conserve water over there, so this is why they do not offer towels galore!The Japanese restaurant is a MUST. You won't be eating anything weird, I promise. It'll just be Tofu soup for appetizer, Sushi and then the HUGE plate of stir-fry the cook makes right at your table. As per buffet, we found the buffet attached to the lobby to be the best one when it comes to variety. If you want to make a reservation to A La Carte, I suggest you go early in your week. They pack up fast, since they do not hold many tables in them. The reservation table is right next to this buffet. The lobby has the best drinks! If you like tropical drinks, you might want to try Banana Mamas, Dirty Monkey, Coco Loco, Pina Colada (of course), Miami Vice, and Cuba Libre (fancy rhum and coke!)....Oh and the beer is also excellent. For wine enthousiasts like myself, you might get disapointed. But wait there is hope. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the Palma Real Mall. This mall is amazing. It also has a nice liquor store with a variety of wine. So you won't be stuck drinking their Italian house wine. Overall, this was a great resort. We were very satisfied with the service, the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere! We would go back for sure. I am still shocked by people who go there and complain about everything. Obviously some people just don't know when to really take a vacation.

<Content>Two Thumbs Up I have traveled extensively and have stayed at resorts ranging from 3* to 5*. The Barcelo Dominican Beach is rated a 4* resort and I believe this rating is suitable to this resort. Please see summary below:Check-In: The line-up was quite long but the check-in process was very quick and our luggage was brought to our room immediately.Room: Our room was in Villa 91 and it was great. Our fridge was stocked with beer, coke, sprite and water. It was replenished daily. We had a very nice view of the main pool from our balcony.Pools: Nice, clean, plenty of chairs, swim-up bar.Beach: Absolutely beautiful and a lot of activities to keep you busy if you desire.Grounds: Very lush, well-kept, nicely manicured and clean.Food: Excellent and a great variety to choose from. We loved the buffet restaurant and received amazing service. We found plenty of food to choose from and we have no complaints whatsoever. We ate at the pizza place a couple times and although we usually had to wait approximately 10-15 minutes for pizza, it was well worth the wait. We only ate at one a la carte restaurant (Italian) and it was just wonderful. There is a caf茅 on the resort opened from 10 a.m. til midnight and the lattes were just great 鈥?they served wonderful desserts also.Bars: Once again, great.We are two females (27  38). We would highly recommend this resort to young singles, families and those looking for a lively resort. The service we received from everyone (front desk, bartenders, waiters/waitresses, maids) was top notch. We find if you treat the staff well you will get treated well in return. As they say 鈥榶ou catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.鈥?We would definitely return to this resort once again.

<Content>We got a great deal and were pretty happy! We got a great last minute deal and were pretty satisfied; it was our first time in Punta Cana.Here is our review in point form:THE HOTEL-we got to the resort at 1 am and were in our rooms within 10 minutes-we were upgraded to an Elite Club suite, 50 feet away from the beach at block #6 on the ground floor-2 queen beds, plus a single bed, jacuzzi - we thought it was an excellent location-shaving cream, shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, toothbrush and toothpaste was all there although I would recommend bringing your own just in case-if you want fresh towels everyday make sure you leave a tip for the staff-we heard about potential problems with the safes but luckily we did not have any issues-there were no bugs in our roomTHE BEACH-beach was awesome but there was some seaweed-lots of lounge chairs on the beach and it wasn't too crowded-you have to get beach towels early in the morningFOOD-not enough choice of fruit-buffets were pretty good for a 4 star hotel, you can always find something for yourself-we didn't go to the a la carte restaurants because we didn't want to be restricted to certain times for eating as you have to make a reservation for dinner early in the morningSTAFF-tips are included in the price but we recommend tipping (even just $1) then the staff tend to remember who you are and give you better service (especially if you hang around in the same areas or the same spots in restaurants/cafes)-we found that if one is understanding about the fact that English is not these people's first language and you are friendly they will be friendly in return-some staff did not speak perfectly in English but we managed just fine and even picked up some Spanish and they loved that!OTHER POINTS:-there were lots of 20-somethings at the resort, lots of Canadians and Europeans and sometimes it got a little bit noisy in the evenings but it didn't bother us

<Content>Be Fair I really wasn't going to write anything but honestly some people are just really mean about the resort. You have to understand when going you are not in Canada or in U.S.A you are visiting the Dominican, they arent in a rush like we are here they relax and enjoy their time, and its something that should be done when your there. I really don't have complaints about anything other then the front desk, they could have been a bit more helpful but the workers the atmosphere the restaurants and the rooms were really nice. The beach was beautiful and no locals bothered you which was great, and the night entertainment was good. I really didn't have a problem with the workers they were all so friendly and made your stay more enjoyable, I just reccomend you to know a language other then English so you can communicate with them (french, spansh, italian). All in all its a great resort if u want to relax or have fun theres enough to do to suit everyone'es need.

<Content>Fun in the sun.... Just had 7 days/6nights @ this resort. Hubby  I had a good time overall-we loved the richness of the hotel-the beautiful cobblestoned floors-palm tree lined roads-humming of latin music in the background while walking along the resort-engaging activities-friendly staff-great food presentation  variety and great tasting food! This was our 1st time to DR and we had a great time. We didnt feel like doing any excursions but we heard that they were all really great!The main thing that we didnt care for much was the room. Let me start first by saying that the room was functional-it was cleaned daily-AC worked great- and they had a tv in room.If youre looking for a little luxury-look into upgrading BEFORE you get there as this hotel gets PACKED QUICKLY!We had a standard room- 2 full sized beds (we arrived late due to flight delays-so didnt have a chance to get a better room) and the beds had deep grooves down the middle of them as though everyone sleeps in the middle! The bathtub had a whole on the inside of the it and the shower head was a old  at times the water pressure was a bit low. The room was stale smelling when we 1st walked in. There were 2 times where we came to our room and they cleaned it but NO towels left for us... so that was annoying.So if youre not worried about the luxury of your room-standard is ok.What we did love:1-They had many restaurants within the resort-all a-la-carte and one big buffet and once you made reservations earlier in the day for either 6pm or 8pm you were set. The food was really good and they had SEVERAL varieties of foods! If you're not the type that likes to have reservations you could go in w/o reservations at 9pm to any a-la-carte restaurant or you can always try the main buffet which offers a HUGE array of foods for bfast, lunch and dinner. They also have a 24 hr snack bar that serves really good pizza-burgers-hotdogs-coffee and other beverages! They even have a coffee house (my fav place) that serves delicious cappuccinos/ lattes/other coffees  desserts til late!!!! (They also have a casino  sports bar but we didnt use those very much).2- The beach was clean everyday and there were always enough lounge chairs to sit on and they had little huts if you didnt want to tan which provided maximum shade-but you had to get those very early in the A.M. They also had activities all day everyday on the beach and a DJ.3- The staff is exceptional! We loved the fact that they were all so friendly and helpful and fun fun fun! Especially the entertainment staff-they were very engaging and made us want to participate in the beach activities! We made friends with a few of them-and are excited to go there to see them again!4-Nightly shows provided us entertainment after dinner and allowed for you to get to know others easily. They had a band that played live every night as well and they were REALLY GOOD! They also provided the kids with entertainment before the main show started-kids would dance with the staff each night to children songs for about 1 hr and they LOVED IT!5-Pools were always very clean  many lounge chairs. The swim up bars were stacked @ all times with premium liquor!6-Their night club was a lot of fun-especially for us as we love to dance. They provided an array of music everynight and on our last night there (friday) they had a beach party/bon fire!!! We had sooo much fun doing that as we were dancing the night away on the sand with the warm carribbean breeze from 11pm to 2am! Definitely something to experience!7-They also had vendors who were invited by staff in the hotel who sold art, jewlery, liquor, cigars! Many of the prices were just too high-so we stayed away from them....I'd strongly advise to take a massage in a cabana on the beach-the aromatherapy massage for 30 mins was $30 and it was SO worth it! You can have a full body massage for $60 but the back massage was sufficient! They rub you from head to toe and the price is right! My hubby  I had a couples massage in a cabana right on the beach-soooo worth it!!!!I'd also strongly advise to stay away from the beach vendors....they love to walk up to you all day to get you to do excursions with them or hair braiding but most of them are not part of the resort-so be aware  make sure you book your excursions within the hotel if you dont want to get ripped off. Europeans  Canadians made up about 95% of the tourists of the resort. The staff was sure to speak in English, Spanish, French and even Portuguese! So everyone was able to join in on the activities. The taxi ride from airport was about 1/2 hr just as we thought-and he charged us $30 which the average is about $25--but we advise for you to get the taxi via the hotel instead of on your own @ the airport like we did b/c theyre like vultures there and it was very scary as we arrived at night and the road is very deserted! If we had a better room I believe we could have rated this EXCELLENT. Make sure you request bottled water at every meal b/c if not they'll serve you their water and you may wind up sick! They wont serve you bottled water unless you ask-so save yourself! We would definitely go back and I'd recommend it to EVERYONE!

<Content>First Choice - Last Resort !!!! THIS IS FROM OUR COMPLAINT LETTER TO FIRST CHOICEDuring the holiday we suffered the following problems:We booked a Caribbean spa Suite for 5 people which according to your brochure states: Caribbean Spa Suites sleeping up to 2 adults  3 children, 3 adults  1 child or 4 adults with 2 double beds. All facilities are as Junior Suites (Jacuzzi, coffee maker, mini-bar (inc. national alcoholic beverages), hairdryer, table and large balcony. Junior Suite guests get a VIP package with private check-in, fruit basket, concierge service, bathrobes  slippers, iron  ironing board, motorised water sports (1 hour per stay), 24 hour room service) plus living area with sofa bed and bathroom with separate bath  shower. VIP service also includes daily in-room tropical fruits and special Spa package.1. On arrival in the resort, there was no representative to meet us. After a fraught long check in (supposed to be VIP), we were given our room. We booked a Caribbean Spa Suite for 5. When we got to our room it had one king-size bed and a sofa bed. I immediately went to reception to report this and was told I should be happy with the room as it has a nice view. I was informed by the desk that the hotel had overbooked. I explained it was not my problem and they must sort it out. I was told that we could move to another room in a couple of days, but it would be exactly the same as the one we had 鈥?Pointless. After explaining that one bed and a sofa bed was inadequate and probably illegal for five persons, they just shrugged. I had to insist that they put another single bed in the room for the children 鈥?(a job that took several hours). Even then I had two girls sharing on sofa bed for the entire holiday.2. On 14th we immediately went to the First Choice Representative to express our concerns, he tried to help but was given the same brush off by reception. He explained we could move to another room of the same size but as already stated this would be of no more use than the one we had. We were only told 8 days in when I spoke to Mauro from guest services after I insisted she come to see how we were living that they had rooms with two double beds and a sofa bed and that is what we should have had from the start!3. Upon arrival, there was:NO VIP check in, NO Tropical Fruit Basket in the room. NO tropical fruit platter in the roomNO alcohol in the fridge.NO separate bath and shower, they were together. The airconditioning had leaked all over the floors 鈥?that bad that the maid had actually left a towel on the floor to soak it up. Our bedroom door was smashed and broken. The bath plug was broken. NO slippers with bath robes.4. All of the above faults were reported to reception immediately (30 minute wait at reception) and then on a daily basis (at least 20 minutes each time), but I will expand on these further.5. We only received two towel vouchers for five people 鈥?had to request further vouchers (at least 20 minute wait to speak to someone)6. The children鈥檚 wristbands came off and we went numerous times to have them replaced 鈥?they still never had them by the end of the holiday.7. The sofa bed was not made up on our arrival and despite asking every single day for bedding, we did not receive bedding for eight days 鈥?my girls, already forced to share one sofa bed, had no pillows just cushions of the sofa bed, no sheets and had to huddle under a blanket taken from our bed for eight nights.8. Every Day we went to guest services as we did not receive the correct amount of towels in the room, they only left for two persons, despite being repeatedly told there were five of us.9. Every Day we went to guest services as we did not receive beer in the fridge.10. Every Day we went to guest services as we did not receive the tropical fruit platter.11. Every Day we went to guest services as we locked our patio door every day and the maid kept leaving it unlocked 鈥?this issue was never resolved so we had to carry valuables with us because of the risk of leaving them in the unlocked room.12. We went to take the children on the banana boats only to be told that the children were not included 鈥?this is not stated anywhere in your brochure. If five people are in the room then they should all be included in the vouchers. This is very misleading in your brochure.13. Our bath robes were taken away for no reason and it took eight requests and four days to get them back 鈥?no explanation but again even more time spent at guest services.14. After 7 days the room keys stopped working 鈥?at least eight visits to reception (20 minutes wait each time) and even then only one of them ever worked again.15. After not receiving the alcohol in fridge every day we spoke to guest services about ordering a bottle of wine for the room using room service. We were told that this was absolutely fine and just to call them. It took numerous attempts and forty minutes to get through to room service only to be told no 鈥?wine/alcohol not included in room service. Again guest services clearly don鈥檛 know this 鈥?and your brochure is misleading to this fact also.16. On 21st December we had no hot water in our room, reported this immediately to guest services they said they would sort it. The problem persisted on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th December. Reported every day to guest services 鈥?nothing sorted. Our children were forced to sleep in cramped conditions and not even have the luxury of a shower or bath. On 21st and 22nd December we had no cold water either.17. On 23rd December I waited over an hour for your representative to attend where he should be, at this point I was in tears as once again guest services had failed to sort out our issues. I was told when he finally arrived that the First Choice book had the wrong times listed 鈥?again just an example of the ineptitude of your organisation. I missed my Spa Package waiting to see him and still nothing got sorted out.Altogether it was the worst holiday and worst customer service we have encountered anywhere in the world. Your representative had lines of people every day just complaining about the service and hotel. A fact that you must have recognized as on our second to last day we were told that he was only now dealing with our hotel and no others. Testament to the fact that you must be fully aware that there are major issues with this hotel. Whilst I appreciate that the hotel has recently changed hands this is no excuse for the abysmal time we had. If faults were reported then resolved then fair enough. But I was told daily that they would deal with and sort out our problems and all that would happen was that something else would go wrong! This was despite assurances from your representative.From your brochure: With a totally tropical taste, the 24 hour all-inclusive Ocean Bavar贸 Spa  Beach Resort has its own resident pink flamingos. If you're wanting to unwind it鈥檚 a perfect choice, with its three pools, swim-up bar and beachfront spa, where you'll be pampered as you look out at the crystal-clear waters. We certainly did not get a chance to unwind and be pampered and there weren鈥檛 even any flamingos!!All in all I must have wasted days of our holiday just trying to get the holiday we paid you for 鈥?our dream Christmas holiday was nothing short of a nightmare thanks to this hotel and your company. You only need to look on the holiday watchdog sites and trip advisor to see how bad this place is.

<Content>A-mazing, Feb 15-20TH...Despite nasty reviews This trip was such an incredible experience. The resort is very beautiful and well-kept. The staff was friendly but were even more friendly when given tips, one dollar bills go along way with service, and a beautiful smile. The food was in abundance and a variety, I never tired of it. However, bring some chocolate for real chocolate cravings because their sweets are not very sweet and sometimes your sweet tooth isn't satisfied. We were kind of concerned if there would be a limit on the reservations for the restaurants besides the buffet (brazillian, japanese, spanish, etc) but there wasn't. We were able to enjoy all of them and they usually had 3 seatings, with the last one being free seating at 9:30. The italian and Japanese restaurant were the best. The brazillian was okay, but the turkey meat they served was excellent. It was 7 of us and no-one got sick, but we did bring along lots of medicines just in case. The worst physical ailment was mesquito bites, bring repellent. The store on grounds is ridiculously high. Metamorphisis spa was incredibly accomodating and serene, however, the prices for massages were rather steep compared to the massage people soliciting on the property. I had a reservation with the spa until I found out the same spa cost over half less with the massuese on the beach, so I opted for them. It was a wonderful experience. I did use the spa for a spa pedicure which was relaxing, especially the paraffin wax deep at the end, to die for! The entertainment staff was full of energy and very friendly. The shows were a variety, some I wasn't expecting such as a musical performance in the water (fire shows, dancing, acrobats, dueling, etc), and the Micheal Jackson review that we had to miss cause we left the same day. However, the team provided a variety of games, shows, and activities on the beach everyday (such as yoga, darts, bingo, dance lessons, etc). They were awesome. The rooms were good for the occassion. I wasn't expecting Four Seasons status, only some place clean and comfortable to sleep and wash. I got that and more. Tip, leave little extras along with your monetary tip to receive faster and friendlier service. My roommate and I left little hand lotions for our housekeeper and we had no problems getting our room serviced quickly and receiving extra towels. However, if you don't mind, keep your towels after only using them once to avoid waiting for new towels. They try to conserve energy here. The refrigerator was always overstocked with sprite, coca cola, water, and beer. The only downside of our room was the tv that decided when to have volume on certain channels, however we didn't watch much tv anyway so it wasn't a huge concern. In our friends room their floor kept sweating, we could never figure out why but they just rolled with the punches. In another one of our friends rooms they had a leak in the ceiling that maintenance came and fixed that day and they didn't have anymore problems. We stayed in Bloque 5, 2nd floor. We didn't use the safe because we brought our own lock box. Nothing was stolen or taken from our room. It felt pretty safe. However if you want to use the safe it is a 20 dollar fee that you get back upon returning the key. Our apple vacation rep, Vladmir was very very useful and helpful, he suggested the Bavaro Runner excursion which was amazing. We toured the town, visited sugar cane fields, coco/coffee bean plantations, horseback riding, a nice lunch with wonderful native food, and a time at the beach, That excursion cost 85 dollars and was well worth it to see the country and have all that included. Vladmir did a great job accomodating all of our requests! The beach was beautiful and I never became fustrated that I could not find a lounge chair, there was plenty. The main tip I would give you if this is your first time is make sure to read the orientation materials around you and figure out all the possibilities of the trip, and negotiatie when buying items from vendors. You can get most stuff lower than 50% of what they ask. OMG! I forgot to say, locate the pool area in the Italian section of the resort (apparently Barcelo is a Italian family that owns resorts all over the world) because that pool was gorgeous with a beautiful waterful and dark blue water tint, and the grill over there has plenty more variety than the grill by the other two pools. The saddest part of the trip was that I didn't get to use the swim up bar which was the main attraction I was looking forward to enjoying....so do that in remembrance of me. Have a great time, you will love it. Go with an open mind, a gracious attitude, and tip money. Our group didn't have many compliants if any, and a hotel manager came to share with us how others our noticing how much fun we are having and how nice we were. This trip was for a reunion of friends, young adults, and to do a photo shop, which this resort has great photo ops. An amazing time was had by 7 amazing people, from 4 different states in the US. Feel free to contact me for any other useful information. I will try to post my pics...we shall see.

<Content>Unforgettable Punta Cana February 11-19, 2008Calgary, Alberta CanadaThe way to the hotel was really dark; Punta Cana does not have lights on the road. Everybody from the bus driver to the hotel staff expect tips, if you don't give them, you will be resented. This we don鈥檛 understand because when we book our trip (the tip and gratuities was included in the package price), but they are still expecting more. If they want tips above and beyond what we paid for, staff should render an exceptional service above and beyond their duties and for exceptional service why not we are very much willing to give them tips, only if they deserve it, but the service is lousy and they still expect tips, which I don鈥檛 get. We understand that life in Punta Cana is hard, but if they want tourist to come back yearly, they should concentrate more on service and give tourist a good memories to take back home so they can recommend this hotel to their friends who is thinking of visiting Punta Cana. Word of mouth is more powerful than the tip they could get for a weeks. Obviously if the tourist is not happy with the experience, do you think they would recommend it, I don鈥檛 think so. We went to Jurassic safari excursions, beware the road for this trip is full of potholes, the terrain is so rugged not develop at all. Fasten your seatbelt; it鈥檚 not enough to keep you safe, you still need to hold the jeep handrail just to be safe. For an 8-hour trip, this is unforgettable and your butt will never be the same after this trip, you need massage and my husband, and I was sore after this trip. If you are ready to be shock and want to step out of your comfort zone, take this trip.Overall, our experience was good, 40 miles of white sand beach, what else can we ask for. Staff tried really hard to communicate, we don鈥檛 expect them to speak English in a heartbeat, because they had been speaking Spanish all their life. We encounter some tourists who were demeaning to the locals because most of them don鈥檛 speak fluent English. However, try to understand their situation, would you learn Spanish in one week, obviously not. When they come here in North America, they try very hard to speak English, so now that you are visiting their country, try to learn Spanish, not demean them in any way, they are human. If you were treated, the same you would not like it too.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation and Honeymoon This trip was definately all positive. I have NO complaints. the grounds, food, entertainment, staff, rooms, ALL of it was way better than I had expected from reading the reviews.  I don't understand why you woud not have fun and be overwhelmed with the trip. One would have to go with a negative attituded and look for things to complain about. I was there for my honeymoon. I would highly recommend this spot to my friends and family.

<Content>Barcelo Dominican. 2.5 stars a 3 star is a stretch The grounds and layout of the hotel were beautiful along with the beach. This I would rate a 4 star. Food was one of the worst buffets I have had in all my travels. Edible but boring. Rooms were below average, ours was clean but very basic. 2.5 stars tops.Many guests complained about the rooms with mold and such but we did not have this issue. just very plain. service at the hotel was below average. felt like most staff resented us, unless we had a tip in our hand. The best place was the coffee shop, as the coffee and treats were good and the staff there were friendly. Lost power for a full day at the resort, it came back on the next morning and went out again. the resorts on either side of us never lost power so it was a hotel issue. would not go back to punta cana in general.

<Content>Everything but the room was great This resort was recently taken over by Barcelo and perhaps some of the problems we encountered were a result of the transition. Most of the problems had to do with the maintenance and condition of our room, which needed updating badly. The first problem we encountered was the lack of hot water in our room. We discovered this the morning after we checked in and it took 2-3 calls to get this repaired. The second problem was that they did not have any safe keys when we checked in, and we had to wait until the following morning to get a safe key (which required a $20 deposit). Then, although they stock the mini-fridge with 2 bottles of water, 2 Cokes and 1 Sprite, we did not have a bottle opener! We had to track down a housekeeper on the second day to get one (she took one out of another room, so I'm sure someone else later encountered the same problem). The general housekeeping was hit and miss; we had 2 washclothes when we checked in, which were removed when used, but not replaced. One day, the bath mat was removed but not replaced. Another day, the toilet paper was not replenished and we ran out! Also, there was some sort of stain on the wall above the beds that was not cleaned (don't even want to guess what it was). The rooms and bathrooms generally needed updating. The grounds were nice - 3 pools and lots of chaise lounges on the beach. One downside: not a lot of bathrooms close to the various pools or the beach. We didn't get to try all of the restaurants, but those we tried were good. There was usually some concert or show in the plaza for a couple of hours each night, and one night there was a beach party. Other than that, not a lot of night life at the resort. There is a disco, but it was only okay. One nice thing was that you could pay at the mini-market (and in the surrounding little beach stores) in U.S. dollars and receive your change in U.S. dollars. However, the front desk would not make change for you (i.e., give you 2 tens for a twenty or what-have-you). Everyone there was very friendly and welcoming. I wouldn't go back to this particular resort - I spoke with lots of people at the airport on the way home, and there are lots of other good options, from the sounds of it.

<Content>Fantastic Time My fiance and I went to Barcelo Dominican Beach Resort to get married Jan. 29th-Feb.5th with 24 of our closest friends. The resort was absolutely beautiful and I would definately recommend getting married at this resort. The staff could not do enough for us. The beach and the pools were fantastic and our wedding pictures are absolutely beautiful. The drinks were great - not watered down and the food was good. I had read so many horrible reveiws and was scared to death but so pleasantly surprised. If you do go get the honeymoon suite - so beautiful!!!!! Definately recommend it for the price!LaurieBradford, ON

<Content>905 Crew Punta Cana Jan27-08 to Feb 3-08 This hotel was not our first choice. But we were 4 of many people who got bumped from Sunscape, or Dreams or whatever its called .The hotel had overbooked Ive heard alot of this over the last 3 weeks This was the choice Nolitours gave us,that or cancel and rebook at another time. We had planned and saved for a girls weekend for a year and we were already to go! So we took it!There are 2 resorts on one. The Barcelo Cana, and the Barcelo Dominican Beach. We were on the Dominican Beach.After reading some of the reviews I wondered where some people had stayed! We stayed in block 98 and were on the third floor. The ceiling was atleast 16 ft tall!! Our room was clean and cool!! I dont know if all the third floor rooms were like that, but if you have the choice, stay on the third floor!! The other half of the party had stayed on the first floor, with low ceilings. This made the room warmer then normal. We had no problems with running water,our fridge was stocked daily,our room was cleaned every day. The grounds were clean, the beach was fantastic and we had no problems getting a seat at the beach or pools! No problems with sand fleas or mosquitos. But then again,maybe they only come out after a rain fall? Kinda like at home?? There was lots of food to eat! Lamb,chicken,pork chops,fish,turkey, hot dogs,hamburgers, and the pasta at the buffet was made to order and you could put in it what you wanted! Fresh fruits, veg,desserts and no problem with getting pop or coffee during meals. I dont even remember having to line up at any of the services.The a la carte resturants were wonderful!! The Japanese is a must!!! The Cafe was great for fancy coffees!The pizza place made pizzas to order! And the was even stuff the the kids would like! Its no wonder people get sick from all the food and booze!!! I dont normally eat and drink like that everyday!The general staff was fantastic! Maid service was fantastic! The grounds keepers were always cleaning,or pruning the plants and always said hello. If I had to complain about the staff, it woud be with the front desk. The didnt make it a point to go out of their way to help you,but the rest of the staff made up for what they lacked.-Calling cards are needed, but pick your times to call home. The phone lines tie up quickly not the hotels fault-You have to ask for a safe key or tv remote. People leaving the resorts tend to think they own them and take them home.-The pools were cleaned every day. -There are lots of palms trees on the beach for those who want to sit in the shade,and at the other side of the beach there are none for those who want to suntan!-Tours are not cheap on any resort! Bring extra money for these-There is a bus that will take you to the local mall,buy your souveniers there or barter on the beach. The gift shop is expensive! Plus they list their prices in Euros. They will take American money,and if they have to Canadian. There is no atm machine on the reosrt,and the one just outside the resort only gives Pesos.-Bring a beach towel or reuse your towels. They are doing their best to save the environment by doing less laundry.- Volleyball,beach excercise,basketball court,tennis court,bikes,big chess boards,playground,We had a great time! Would I go there again? For sure!

<Content>fantastic We were going to Kenya and was cancelled two days before due to leave and we chose the Dominican Republic. The hotel was fab. Very clean comfortable and the choose of food at this hotel is really good. The site is very big and takes ages to find your way around easily. The beach was lovely and clean and lots going on every day. Went to the beauty spa and enjoyed being pampered. Nail technician not very good though. We went to Ocean World and swam with the Dolphins, fantastic experience. Also went to Saona Island which was very beautiful and had a lovely relazing day eating, drinking, walking along the beach and enjoyed the boat ride out and back. We only booked for a week but wished we had booked two in the end. I have never been back to any holiday destination before but I would go back to here again.

<Content>Good Enough! My husband and I stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Beach and Caribe from Jan 27- Feb 1 2008. While the hotel looks old and a bit worn down it was very clean. I was a bit nervous at first when I read other reviews and people wrote about roaches in their room. I'm glad to report that I found none. The room was nothing fancy, but it served its purpose, for us to crash and go to sleep at the end of each day. The housekeepers swept and mop the floors each day (rooms there are ceramic tile, no carpets). The bathroom was clean to perfection, the towels were always replaced with clean ones.The staff at the hotel was not the friendliest, but they were polite. The food was not at all bad, they defenitely had a great spread for breakfast, lunch and dinner at their main dining room. Their Steak House Restaurant was not bad, however, you must get there as soon as they open for dinner (6:30pm) or otherwise you will be waiting for a while. The Mexican restaurant, which my husband was very hesitant to go to, and only did so to please me, was surprisingly good. This place was great for us, since all we wanted out of our time there was to relax, and we definetily accomplished that. The weather was not too bad, it rained here and there, and some mornings were overcast,but that was mother nature, not the resorts fault :).So if you are looking to just laid back, relax, eat and drink until you fall asleep again, this place may just be right for you.

<Content>great to be back it will only get better. formerly ocean bavaro, now known as the barcelo dominican we can see big changes for the better. same great staff ask for kelvin who works at the morning buffet, and jorge at the pool bar. it is the staff who make this resort top notch. they remembered our names which I thought was amazing. It was our third time in a row to this resort and were a little apprehensive because of the name change but nothing to worry. Food was good and we had the carribean spa room which over looked the ocean . wonderful. The nightly entertainment great only though if you hadn't seen it before. I was pretty sure we saw the same shows last year.The beach was groomed every morning and lots of lounger chairs to be found. Make sure to take the outback jeep safari trip as this was our 2nd time to do so we love it. If travelling with signature vacations jackie the representative was very accomodating. Would I recommend this resort? absolutely

<Content>Great holiday :D Im writing my review with several subheadings so it is easier to read... just want to say to all the people reading the bad reviews on the website ignore them !!!!! the resort is beautiful..Airport: the airport was easy and traditional alot of people waiting to help you with your bags give them a small tip as they wrokvery hardReception: Check in was quick, we were given juice while we were waiting........were given room 7219 and a safe key!!( but more about that later)Room: rooms were large and clean, air conditioning amazing and two double beds.. overlooked the water fountain which was nice but a lil noisy, had a safe but no bumpin? the bellboys sed we needed to get one from reception !! after two days of trying we gave up and carried on our holiday without a safe at all which isnt very practical but hey !!! we managed Food: We ate at the buffett restaurant every morning, noon and night we didnt want to spend all morning queing to book restaurants, the breakfast was normally great, the lunch ok, and the dinner good, Every day there was a different county theme my favourite was the mexican ( the nachos was awsome) i think i ate cheese for every meal as well...... they say eat a yogurt every day to stop you from feeling ill i did this most days and was fine all holiday :DCoffee Shop: I loved sitting in there it was soo cool and smelt wonderful and the girl serving in there was always smiling... try the macademia frozen if u go in there. you wont drink anything else Bars: there are loads and loads of them scattered everywhere my favourite was the beach bar near the little pool....they serve bannamamas the pink slush drinks they are lovely grounds : grounds were beautiful so well kept and grean.. just walking out of your apartment block and looking around you made you smile it was so beautiful, they constantly played music around the resort which was annoying at the time but now i kinda miss it .Beach: beach was also beautiful have never seen anything like it was like a dream.... sea was always warm and clean pools: there are 3 pools all nicely kept and warm well liked the main pool best as we could just swim upto the bar when we were thirsty EXCURSIONS......................................Saona island: we traveled to bayhibe on a coach and got a speedboat to a natural swimming pool in the middle of the sea and looked for starfish, we then got back on the speedboat and went to the island where we ate a gorgeous bbq and sunbathed we then got on a catatmaran and sailed back to bayhibe i loved this trip :DEl Pat Ranch: we travelled about 30 mins into a village andarrived at a large stables we got given our horses and set off onto a beautiful deserted beach... ive ridden befor so i got to canter off and be free.. you dont have to have ridden before and you can go as slow or as fast as you like we stopped for a coconut befor swapping horses and heading back... this trip was wonderful and was my boyfriends fav Bavaro Splash: this was next to the hotel.. we were taken out in a large boat to all the speedboats we then had to follow in our own speedboat.for about 30 mins till we came to a platform we could go snorkeling from... snorkelling was amazing, wasnt so keen on the speedboats cos they were really hard to drived and water was going in our eyes and we couldnt see.... i sure they are fun for alot of people tho.Overall i loved my holiday to the dominican republic and i would definately go back and stay in the same hotel.......i miss it so much and didnt want to leave... so to all you people waiting to go out there and reading all there reviews.. trust me u will have a brilliant time xxxx

<Author>traveller101ottawa
<Content>quite the trip !!!! We stayed there from January 14th until the January 21st. It was a last minute decision just to get some rays before going back to work. We figured for what we paid for, we should not expect too much....Staff: very very friendly and helpful, nice people and hard working. So tip and do not be cheap!!The hotel was recently taken over by Barcelo and compared with other Barcelo hotels it does not qualify as a 4.5 star, more like a3.5 Star.Amenities :Well, as we got into the tropics around 1pm our rooms were not ready and we were advised that there is a water leak in the building. So for now no room with no water !!! We finally got the water back but it was cold most of the time. The 3 days of rain and heavy winds did not help much and with no hot water to take a shower things took a pretty rough turn.Rooms: TV barely worked, not a big deal if you spend the day on the beach, but if the wx turns then i like to watch a show once in a while, fridge was not stocked, always had to request water with the maids, beds too small for 2 people ect. ect....lol :), so if you decide to spend your honeymoon there i would suggest to think twice of going into that hotel or request a suite. Also no working telephone and oh...bring a ringer if you do not wanna sleep in every day.Pool: 3 pools clean and plain nothing spectacular copared with other hotels.Food:Buffet style has 4 a la carte restaurants , in my oppinion the spanish restaurant was excellent.Stay away from the mexican restaurant, you are after all in the dominican republic and if you expect real mexican food then jet over to the mayan riviera.Buffet : After 2 days of buffet we already had enough ...ouch!!! 5 more days of buffet. We are not picky eaters and it was a bit like hit and miss some days it was very good and some days less. Every day Pizza and Pasta in the italian corner.... Not much variety and is very much geared to North Americans and not much local food. Clientele: families with kiz and tonns of elderly people.Beach:white sand but it is not very shallow in front of this hotel and gets deep pretty quick. Can not compare with the maldives or the canary islands but further down towards the Palladium the beach gets nicer and more shallow, but that is also a 30 minute walk on the beach.Animations: The animations team works hard but if you are expecting club med standards that is not the place to be. In this hotel the activities are not on time or do not exist at all even if it is advertised.Shows: The animations team does also the shows at night and the costumes are beautiful as well as the dancing. But once you have seen one show you have seen em all. No variety either like Karaoke ect.Nightclub: was a nice layout lots of latin musicWe got what we paid for and just for a week to lay on the beach and do nothing it is ok, but i personally would not suggest this hotel nor Punta Cana for people who are looking for the trip of a lifetime or honeymooners.Spend the monney and maybe choose a different island in the carribean like turks and caicos, the bahamas or aruba where there is less mass tourism, smaller hotels and a bit a different clientele.ds/ck ottawa

<Author>the_bruja_is_back
<Content>relaxing vacation, great if you like illness this was my first time in punta cana, and I had a lot of fun, relaxing and swimming and drinking everyday. Then after about 6 days, I got diarrhea, so did both my parents. we tthink it was the food preparation or somethign we're not sure, but we all got sick and coudlnt get rid of it for more than a week! I also got an ear infection from the pool, which I will suspect is not treated with any chemicals, although it should be. It was a nice resort otherwise, friendly staff, an actual * 24 hour all inclusive* many hotels claim to be, but if you wnat something to eat at 4 am, youre out of luck. this one will feed you at the hamberger and pizza place. they also have a nice place where you can fill up on purified water. my father was very satisfied with it. I was not , due to the illnesses it caused me. i guess I might say stay here, have fun, take antibiotics! ? LOL

<Content>What a lovely property! One week of heaven! This is a very picturesque property, grounds are excellent, pools are beautiful and the beach...ahhhh the beach.... First night of arrival at 11pm we stayed on the beach until after 4:30am and the beach restuarant bar was an all night...gave the bartender a couple of tips and next thing you know he is meeting us at our lounges with the next round! That's customer service! First breakfast in the Italian section buffet was okay but much preferred the main buffet and spent the rest of the week having breakfast  dinner there with the exception of 2 a la carte...Italian  Japanese......one HAS to do the Japanese experience. The waiter was very entertaining, had us laughing and LOTS of food! An addition to this might have been to been offered sake. In the main buffet, we had a SUPER waiter, called him SUPER MARIO, although his English isn't excellent he is great in his service, he ensured we could be seated in his section (because we didn't want anyone else). He had a great sense of humour!. The food in the main buffet was abundant, flavourful,  SO MANY choices...if you can't find something you like, then you are TOO PICKY. The shows every night were different and very good. The preshow band were quite good, even played some English tunes ie LIonel Richie for one  sang lyrics in English too! The show MC, Julio, does an amazing job of translating in 5 languages for everything that came out of his mouth. HIs side kick that helped out on occasion, Richard, has a wonderful command of several languages also, would hesitate to say his is better. Lots  lots of loungers so really never had an issue with getting one despite the size of the resort. Our onsite tour operator Valerie was from Quebec  spoke English very well. Gave us the run down on what not to do/what to do...no complaints with her. Libby from Ontario, Canada

<Content>Loved It!! This place is well kept. Everything is clean and the service is wonderful. The A' La Cartes are delicious especially the Mexican and the Steak House. Lots of drinks flowing and entertainment nightly. Beach is beautiful, long and soft. Go to the market just up the beach about 1/2 hr walk. No water shoes required. We preferred lounging on the beach to the pool. WOULD DEFINITELY GO AGAIN!-

<Content>Just as Great Second Time Around We just returned from our second visit to the Dominican Beach. We were there in Jan 2006 when it was the Ocean Bavaro. We really like this resort for the fantastic beach, great pool, beautiful grounds, the general convenient layout of the buildings, the friendly staff, and, of course, the price. Apparently some of the rooms need repair, but we have had fine rooms both times. This time we requested and got a room in Block 100, which is the newest. We enjoy the activities during the day and the entertainment at night. The food this time was acceptable, but not quite as good as the first time. The guests were generally young and not American. There were large contingents from Quebec (French), Italy, and Germany. We are 65-year-old Americans, but we enjoy the excitement of the young people and the cultural diversity. If you need older English-speaking people around, you should probably go somewhere else. We will be keeping our eyes open for a good deal to return next January.

<Content>Never go back (My Fiance  I stayed for 5 nights) They did not have our reservations, we had to buy a calling card, ended up not being able to use this card (only can use the cards in your room, not on the pay phones), used our credit card to call our travel agent to clear this matter up. Finally we got our room.The customer service was awful with this woman, and most of the other workers. I have never met a receptionist at a resort, that didn鈥檛 care about there guests. She obviously did not care if we stayed or left. Once getting to the room we noticed some problems with it. The remote for the TV was broken and two lights were out. We made many phone calls to fix these problems. We called three days in a row and kind of gave up. Each time they said they would come right away. They even had a card that hung on the door, for anything that needed repairs. We were to check off the problems and hang it on the outside of the door. That sign remained on our door all five nights we were there. They never came, and never fixed the problem. On the night before we left our building only, had lost all power from about 9:00pm-6:00am. So that night we could not leave our room because we had to use electronic keys and would be locked out, as well as being very hot in our room with no air conditioner. Finally on the day of check out, check out was noon, so we were there at 11:45 to check out and get a taxi to the airport. There were two people ahead of us. We waited in line until at least 12:30 to finally get waited on. I have never been anywhere that check out took at least 45 minutes. We simply couldn鈥檛 get out of that resort fast enough. I ended up getting bites all over my legs, I thought it was mosquito bites, but later found it was more like bed bugs!! Gross, how dirty. Please protect yourself and do not stay here. We will not stay at the Barcelo ever again, and will not be back to D.R. any time soon!

<Content>Stay away!!! Where do I begin? The rooms, although air conditioned are damp. Cool but damp, with that marvelous musty odor. In a room with 2 double beds, you get 2 threadbare small bath towels, 2 hand and wash cloths. Oh, and only the bath towels were replaced. Despite numerous calls to the front desk, we never again received hand towels or wash cloths. The plumbing is falling apart, but functional. The floors are greasy, must be whatever cleaner they possibly occasionally use. The refrigerator in the room is supposed to be stocked with soda and beer, but you don't get beer if you don't personally grab your maid and ask for it. The bottles are the kinds that use a bottle opener, and one wasn't supplied. When I asked about it at the front desk, I was told that they didn't have enough, sorry. We wound up BUYING one at the gift shop.A good portion of the umbrellas around the pool don't have the necessary peg to stay open. No one opens them for you. You're on your own. Pool towels can only be exchanged at very particular times. You may return them in the evening, and receive towel cards and can use the towel cards during the day to get dry ones. Unfortunately, no one told us this until we were caught in a sun shower during the day, and they wouldn't exchange towels for us.The food at the buffets is inedible with the exception of great bread and good strong Dominican coffee. Foods are greasy and fatty and overcooked to the point of gumminess and cardboard. Desserts are beautiful, but just sweet, with little flavor. The specialty restaurants, which require reservations and which are nearly impossible to get, serve decent food. Not good, not great, just decent, with the exception of the seafood specialty restaurant and which cost an additional $40 per person plus gratuity that served a beautifully grilled Caribbean lobster and other shellfish. (we were the only ones who chose to partake the night we were there, probably due to the extra cost.)On the plus side, there was constant beach activity, games, contests, volleyball and soccer. No other real activities such as arts and crafts or other specialty interest items unless you go on an excursion. There was a nice boating trip, but it was $100 per person, and about 90 minutes each way by a cramped van that stops at multiple hotels to the boat. So it was 3 hours in travel time for a 4 hour boat trip. The trip itself was quite nice, but far from worth $100, especially considering the long commute.We have stayed in the Dominican Republic before (in Romana) and were used to a decent percentage of English speaking workers. Here, they acted like it, then you realized afterwards they had no idea what you were saying. They also said yes, yes a lot, then ignored you. A totally frustrating trip. NEVER, NEVER to return. Unfortunately for them it also means I will never try any other Barcelo resorts.

<Content>English visitors BE WARNED We stayed at the Dominican Beach from 20 Dec to 3rd Jan 08. Our holiday was booked with FIRST CHOICE, my husband and I and my elderly parents at a total holiday cost of 拢7,500. Booked almost a year in advance with a 拢300 upgrade charge each for a Tropical Junior Suite and 拢250 charge each for premium flight seats. Having stayed at several places in the Caribbean in 3/4 star hotels all with good standard room accommodation, thought our upgrade to a suite would be the icing on the cake and be a treat for our elderly parents!!We were placed in Block 6 which it transpired were the Caribbean rooms and called the Elite Club!! We were given 2 rooms on the 1st floor Nos. 6110 and 6113, both rooms overlooked building site/jungle tour parking area and staff rooms.Rooms dark, dank and smelt rotten, certainly not what we were expecting. Both bathrooms leaked from the base of the toilets and shower cubicles. Loud music until 6.00 AM.Went to our Welcome meeting next morning and met our First Choice Resort representative. Stephane totally useless if you are English. He is French Canadian and it appears only helps his guests with Signature vacations from Canada. WHAT A SURPRISE (see below **)We told him that our holiday was important to us and that we were certainly not happy with our rooms. We offered to pay more for either a better room or a transfer to a better hotel. His reply was NEITHER COULD BE DONE AND THAT WAS THAT!!Upon walking around the hotel grounds (gardens nice) we realised that we had not been given the rooms for which we had paid First Choice. We found smaller Blocks with what looked like the rooms we were expecting from the details on First Choice website, also, blocks called Villas.So to Guest Services to get this mistake rectified. They told us that they only put english guests at the far end of the complex where there are no Tropical Suites and only either ground or 1st floor rooms! (Why? not explained to us) and they refused to show us a Tropical Suite for which we had paid!!The Guest Services office is the busiest part of the hotel.Finally got moved to 2 more rooms Nos 6104  6105 (3  4 days later) in the same block but ground floor overlooking beach. Rooms exactly the same quality. Both bathrooms leaked but this time from the ceiling (wary of electrics). Tried to use Jacuzzi, emitted foul smelling and discoloured water, clearly not cleaned or maintained. Never went near the bath again. Patio doors, loose, eroded, locked via a crude centre pin and not at all secure. Took 2 people to open/close to ensure stayed on runners. Sofa bed smelt so bad that you could not sit on it (we even walked to a supermarket to buy air freshener) but it failed to improve the stench.Note, young couple in Room 6109 (4 rooms along) had their room broken into whilst at breakfast, entry made via patio doors apparently lifted off runners from the outside. The couple made a point of telling everyone on the ground floor about the vulnerability of these rooms.Also, my parents room was without a lock for their safe for the 1st 4 days, however,** INTERESTING THIS POINT, WE NOTE FROM A REVIEW POSTED FROM A FAMILY FROM TORONTO WHO STAYED HERE THE SAME DATES: That Stephane got them an UPGRADE FOC from a Standard to a VILLA because they had also had no lock for their safe. **Beach is very beautiful but not looked after. Rubbish, cigarette ends etc. Not enough umbrellas on the beach and all beds filthy and stained. Beach shop vendors hassled you every time went for a walk. Constant noise either from loud music or from fleet of helicopters that flew over our hotel every 30 minutes during the day (felt like a war zone).All staff friendly and polite except in Guest Services who listen and do nothing.To book at a speciality restaurant means queuing at 7.00 am to ensure you get a table. Food mainly acceptable but lukewarm and buffet food in main restaurant bland. However, much better food and cleaner at the buffet restaurant in the Italian section, which they like to keep a secret.Overall we chose this hotel because we were looking for a relaxing holiday to unwind. Not at all possible here. We all returned with flu like symptons which we think could be attributed to our damp rooms.In conclusion, expect no help from Stephane or Guest Services. All the bathrooms we experienced were damp and leaked. Rooms very poor, all fixtures  fittings very tired.If you book with First Choice do not waste your money by paying for a suite which is the same poor quality as a Standard Room.Beware if given any ground floor rooms due to security of patio door.We are of the opinion that this hotel requires a total refurb.We suggest that First Choice check all the accommodation offered to their customers.We suggest that Stephane be re-trained and understands his part in the hospitality and service industry.We have travelled fairly extensively around the World and this is the first time we have felt the need to complain/comment on a holiday!!

<Content>Lovely resort but beware of rooms and expect no help from First Choice This is a lovely resort and we had an enjoyable holiday eventually, however, British travellers's be warned, if you are travelling with First Choice, maybe think again!Our family two adults, one sixteen year old and an eleven year old, spent two weeks from Boxing Day through to 10 January at this resort. Flight with First Choice very disappointing. Yes there is plenty of legroom, but service is terrible when compared with Thomas Cook or scheduled airlines. Only two tea and coffee runs during the 9 hour flight. If you pay for un upgrade then drinks are in abundance, but I would have expected basic's like squash and water during the long flight.Arrival at Punta Cana airport, very fast once you get past the bottleneck where each person is photographed for purchase of a keepsake. No surprise that you don't look your best after a long flight and in our case 15 hours from door to airport! Transfer to hotel very quick and arrived at Barecelo resort where we were checked in and given a welcoming drink. Lobby large and spacious, with a beautiful christmas tree and all the bar staff wearing santa hats! We together with the other British holiday makers were allocated rooms in block 2 and this is where are problems began. The room allocated (2103) was on the ground floor, the front door overlooked barbed wire and the patio which ran straight into shrubs with nowhere to hang towles, overlooked the main street. The room was dark, dingy, smelled very moldy, and there was insufficient space to unpack luggage. Only two draws and about 4 coat hangers. So we left our stuff in our cases and went to find some food and drink, and decided to speak to rep first thing in morning. We attended First Choice welcome meeting and I must say the rep Stephane was pretty useless. He did not really give any information and as all the arrivals asked for new rooms he told us there were no rooms available in the resort as fully booked because of New Year. One couple actually changed resorts there and then. We asked him if possible to move us the following week. At 11pm on the 2nd night however, our bathroom developed a leak from the ceiling with water pouring through the light bulb. This put the bathroom and toilet out of order and made us somewhat nervous of using the electrics. My husband reported to reception and within 1/2 hour a maintenance man arrived and dismantled the ceiling. As he only spoke Spanish somehow we managed to determine that he could not fix it and that it was actually foul/contaminated water coming through. At this point, I asked my husband to pack our cases and get the kids out of bed whilst I went to reception to request a room change. As the manager, and assistant manager were not available, I insisted that someone deal with me immediately. A chap called Julio took on my case, and assured me he was working with me to resolve the issue. I stood firm in the lobby (in my pj's) and refused to move until he took action. It was really quite laughable and I don't think he really knew what to make of the mad English woman in her pyjamas refusing to move away from the desk. He kept saying please Seniora, I do not want you to be tense, go to bar and have a drink and relax. I assured him I wasn't tense, and was feeling relaxed but no chance was I going back to the room and if necessary would move in with him! The end result was that he located me another room in Villa 92. So at midnight, in my pajamas, myself and the bellboy scooted round on the golf cart and moved into our new villa room. This was a lovely room. Far more spacious, plenty of room to unpack, with a pretty, raised balcony complete with clothes airer, and a much nicer view. Feeling now much happier we were able to fully relax and enjoy the holiday. Note however when we went back to First Choice to tell them we no longer needed a room change, he said there was no way we could have moved because there are no rooms avialable! The rep did show me the First Choice room allocations, and they are all on ground floor at the top end of the resort, and are the really basic crappy rooms unless you pay an upgrade in the UK. We made friends with the other few Brits and they were all left in block 2 for the entire duration, and all suffered smelly rooms, cockroaches, and leaks. One couple's room had to be fumigated twice. When I mentioned this to rep, they said it was nonsense. Pretty sure the rep didn't understand that we all speak to each other!Maid service was good, but sometimes had problems getting enough towles for four people (tip - leave a note towels for quatro persona por favor and this should do the trick. I gave the maid a dollar every couple of days and some makeup at end of holiday and she was very happy.Gardens are absolutely beautiful and well maintained. The gardeners work so hard and really do appreciate a bottle of water being given to them discretely. (Take the label off the bottle before you hand over so they can't get into trouble). Pools were lovely and never really had problems getting sunbeds. The beach is outstanding, and the sea was clear and the waves were quite high so we had great fun. We never had any problems with vendors and a smile and no thankyou was always enough. Note however, my sixteen year old son and a friend he made were offered marijuana and cocaine on the beach. Fortunately both boys extremely sensible and walked away. Main buffet was OK - good selection of food, and you would have to be really fussy to go hungry. The buffet down by the pool was not very nice, but there is a 3rd buffet in the Italian sector which we used and this was quieter, and the food selection more to our taste. (I think this is kept a secret, but is definately worth finding). The speciality restaurants were OK. Food nothing special, but makes a change to be served. Our only complaint is the service in all the buffets was very poor. On one occasion we asked 3 times for coffee but after half an hour gave up. We did report this to guest services, and the following day a coffee maker was delivered to our room. You are able to help yourself to tea and coffee in the buffet in the Italian sector so we used this one more.Service at the bar no problem, all a bit slow and they did tend to serve staff/Spanish before the English speaking guests, but really not a problem. Seemed to make no difference whether you tipped or not. There is a sports bar which was pretty quiet throughout our stay and the barstaff were far more efficient and we were always served quickly by friendly staff.Coffee bar is brilliant and lovely place to spend time. Coffee is lovely and they have selection of cakes and pastries. Onsite shop - includes a pharacy where you can buy all the essentials at not ridiculous prices. Even included amoxicillan, ibuprofen gel, painkillers, tummy settlers, toiletries, sunblock, etc. so this was really good to see, just in case you need emergency supplies. (For you gents, they also sell Viagra!).Entertainment was OK but bit Butlinsish for our taste. During the day lots of organised activities such as water workouts, aerobics, volleyball, water polo etc. We only actually watched one show in the evening and it was enjoybale. The entertainment staff do work hard and are not pushy.We only done one trip there as have done all the other tours at different islands. We went on the Outback Safari and this really was one of the highlights of the holiday. Up into the mountains, learned about coffee and cocoa, saw fantastic scenery, lovely lunch at a ranch, learned loads from our tour guides Nacho and Wendy, then down the mountain to end the day boogy boarding on a picture perfect beach where the Atlantic meets the Caribbean, so the waves were very high and it was great fun. This tour company are so professional, want you to enjoy yourself, have your safety in mind and also contribute to local schools, hospitals, etc. so definately worth spending a few dollars with them.This was our 2nd trip to Dominican and first to Punta Cana and we agreed that we actually did prefer the south east corner to the North. Not quite as developed or commercial, and the beaches are fantastic. Definately worth a holiday here particulary before it becomes too developed, but we all got a little bit bored after about 10 days. Also, the climate during the winter is lovely compared to the summer months as it is hot but not humid. We did have some rain but not enough to spoil the holiday. Our recommendations:Don't book with First Choice!Take plenty of insect repellantTry to get room allocation before you travel so you know what you are getting (avoid Block 2)Take plenty of sunblockLearn to speak SpanishRelax and enjoy

<Author>11321024
<Content>Stay away - I'm very serious Folks, I am not from New York and I'm not your typical cluless American traveling abroad, in fact I'm quite patient and laidback but for the first time since I have been traveling beyond the perimeter of the USA borders for over 30 years, I have never, ever been as disappointed by a place like this hotel, this resort and the management. I will try to be as open minded and brief as possible in categories:CHECK-IN; there is absolutely no control or knowledge of checking customers in. It is almost like what is available we'll give you. Forget making any specific reservations, they'll give you what they want. Also it would be nice if the personnel within there own complex knew the rates and availabilty of rooms within there own complex.BEACH: I have to admit that this has one of the nicest and most spread out beaches that I have ever seen. Of course there is hardly any management of the beach. Who in there right mind would start sweeping the seaweed at 1:30 in the afternoon. Also there is no where to hide in case of a passing rain cloud.FOOD: The same, the same and the same. We were there for New Years eve, supposedly special evening, the same food as in the restaurants and as in the buffet. The only nice restaurant was the Mexican, it's air conditioned and run very efficiently. By the way, the long pants for men thing, they don't care, you can show up in shorts, they don't care. Food is the same every day.ROOMS: lets see, first room had ants, toilet didn't work and door didn't close. Worse was that there janitor signed off that he fixed the toilet. I took the front desk manager and had to show him personally that it wasn't fixed. Gave us another room, on another floor and one of these take it or leave it attitudes.PERSONNEL: I always liked the Dominicans but at these Barcelo resorts either they are uneducated, untrained or haven't been paid in a while. They were rude, not helpful and hardly any of them spoke English. I realize its there country I am in but if you are a 4 or 5 star resort then your key personnel should speak, English, French, German and obviously Spanish.COMPLEX; Barcelo complex is made up of 5 resorts I belive; Palace (there God resort), Beach is next, then there is Caribe, Golf and Casino. Each resort is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from each other or you can take there ever slow trolley system. I belive this complex was once the jewel of resorts but management is cashing in on there investments. There aren't any capital improvements being made and the grounds are starting to show that.MANAGEMENT; On one of the evenings one of the directors from Barcelo was surrounded by angry customers who had valid complaints, what does he do, he calls the probably paid off local authorities and surrounds himself with police bodyguards. Trust me that is there crisis management. There was a female attorney from Venezuela laying into this guy, but with his Latino muchismo he just blew her off. Isn't the customer the one who is suppose to be taken care of, THEY DON'T CARE, as long as you have planeloads of people coming from France, Columbia, Venzuela, Eastern Europe and some Canadians, they really don't care.CONCLUSION; I have to admit that we were in the minority. I could have counted on one hand how many Americans there were. Now I know why, please don't try to be a contrarian, save your money and go elsewhere. Unfortunately I started at the top, which are the Iberostar resorts, that to me is Number 1, then you have resorts like the Gala's, Paridisus, Catolonia, but stay away from Barcelo. There are many more small details like internet service, there shows, housekeeping, refill of the fridges, etc. Email me and I'll fill you in, however, stay away from this resort complex because in all honesty they want your money and they do not provide any service and there accomodations are dated.

<Content>Value for money, with great potential. My husband, 8 y.o. daughter and I stayed here over Christmas and New Year. We flew with First Choice and the flight was okay (service was poor both ways). We were greeted at the airport by bands and dancers and extremely efficent immigration staff; we were on the coach to the hotel within 30 mins!First impressions were good, a big airy lobby with plenty of seating. Unfortunately check-in was slow with the staff wandering off midway through checking in the first group and only reappearing 15 mins later. This was a sign of things to come in regards to guest services and reception staff.Our room was a standard double, with two double beds. There was a lack of wardrobe/storage space, but we managed. The room intially smelt musty, but we put it down to the air conditioning. A lot of people complained about dampness and condensation, but it seemed that most of these guest had their a/c on continually. We rarely used ours and had no such problem. Where we did have a problem was in the bathroom- the toilet cistern starting leaking and though it was reported to reception 3 times it was never fixed. I also reported a leaking ceiling; the man on reception didn't really seem that interested.The rooms were cleaned to a high standard though there was an ongoing issue with towels not being put in the room till late in the day, sometimes early evening. The grounds and pool areas were spotless; though the beach was a bit messy, littered with cigarette butts and plastic cups. Unfortunately we never saw the sea at its best because it was very windy and lots of seaweed about, but the water was clean. Beach towels weren't available on several days, which was slightly annoying.The bar staff were good, though you always get at least one miserable one. The problem was with other guests- some had no understanding about waiting their turn and it seemed that flashing a $1 bill got you priority service, no matter how long others had been there. Drinks were good with a wide range of cocktails available at all bars. Le Cafe was great with nice lattes and frappachinos and delicious pastries available all day. The sports bar was okay- slightly cold and noisy.The animation team were brillant. The worked non stop with activities during the day and shows at night and they always got the audience involved. They mixed well with guests (not just the young females!) and were always joking round, laughing or dancing about. At times we would just sit and watch them lark about with guests, that was entertainment enough! The food was the most disappointing aspect of the holiday. there were two buffet restraunts and 6 a la carte. We dined at the Mexican and Italian and were extremely disappointed at both as there food was bad. We weren't expecting authentic cuisine, but edible would've been nice. The buffet was okay with a wide variety, we just found the food was generally served lukewarm. However, I cannot fault the hotel on New Years Eve, the food was exceptional and instead of serving dessert in the restaraunts, they were presented in a marqee in the plaza area, and the display was fantastic.All in all, we really enjoyed the holiday, and didn't want to go home. The problems we found weren't major, but stopped it from being a truly fantastic holiday. That said, the Barcelo group have only just taken over, and you can see the improvements already. It was also value for money.

<Content>Nice Resort, but Terrible Service The resort was nicer than I expected in most areas...including the pools, pool bar, and beach proximity to the resort (try for blocks 5 or 7 first, then 2-4 next if those are full. don't settle for 92-100 as it's farther from the beach). However be aware of one important thing...the customer service there is terrible. And I am definitely a very laidback traveler, having been to Haiti and other places where I expect little in service. However when paying more than $100/night, you expect a bit more and the hotel absolutely did not live up to this. Never call the front desk, always go in person to request something...and even then you're lucky if you get someone to care about what you want. Also, upon checkout, we had about $5 in phone bill charges although we hadn't used the phone. They refused to take it off, saying we must have used it. While the amount in question wasn't a big deal, it really irked me that we had to pay for something that must have been fabricated on their end. The Japanese Restaurant is by far the best food at the place...the Brazilian is pretty good too. I'd say the Mexican is 3rd and we didn't try the Spanish. The only one we really didn't like was the Italian. Overall, the resort was very nice but if you go, be ready to fend for yourself once there. It is not run responsibly or professionally.

<Content>The good (not much), the bad and the UGLY Dec 1 - 10, 2007My husband, sister-in-law and I traveled to Punta Cana in search of beautiful beaches, cold drinks and relaxation. The resort we booked 鈥?the Barcelo Dominican Beach 鈥?unfortunately did not deliver! Having stayed in a few all-inclusives before, I was really looking forward to my biggest decision being what I would drink next.Apologies in advance for this lengthy report but I found them very helpful when I was booking and hope you will too.The Bad.....Starting at the beginning, our flight arrived in the evening, around 10pm. The first room we were given....the air con did not work. We re-packed our bag and hiked back to the front desk with the intent of changing rooms. They said the hotel was very full and we would have to come back at 10 the next am if we wanted to change rooms. We indicated that it was simply not possible to stay in a non air conditioned room in such heat and we could not wait until the next morning. The whole time we were at the front desk, there was a constant stream of people coming to complain that things in their rooms wouldn鈥檛 work etc. and all of them were told that nothing could be done that evening, they would have to return in the morning. It was evident that in the morning there was going to be a long line up of disgruntled customers.They finally relented and in summary, they took us to at least six other rooms. Two of which were occupied by sleeping people and all the others either had no air con, broken TV, broken fridge etc. etc. In the end, it was after 2 am when we were finally settled in our room.The next day we awoke to a flooded bathroom. Just great, we thought, and off we went to the front desk. They argued again that no rooms were available (so much for coming back the next morning鈥?). We met with our Air Canada Vacation rep and if not for her, nothing would have gotten done. She set us up in a nice room (giving me the room no.) and we were to come back at 3 and it would be ready. Promises, promises. Of course, when we returned to the lobby at 3 no one knew what we were talking about and I had to get our rep on the phone to straighten it out.I know I'm going to come off as super picky....but I'm really not. I've stayed in very rustic places in the Philippines and Thailand. But there were just so many issues with this resort. The beach was never cleaned (plastic cups and garbage lying everywhere), the pools and grounds were not well kept nor clean, the food at the buffet was not good at all (the restaurant food much better...and tip the guest services staff to get you reservations for every night...it is well worth it.) But these things did not ruin my vacation....the worst was yet to come....The Ugly.....According to all the stories we heard from other travelers, theft was certainly a concern at this resort. Even worse, I did not feel safe in my room at night. I came out of my bathroom at 1:30 in the am and found a hotel staff member and two other people in my room. Having been given the keys to at least two occupied rooms myself, I was not surprised but certainly not pleased. My husband had to barricade the door with a stool each night just so I could sleep. It was evident on a daily basis that our room was thoroughly searched for cash or other items (my husband left test items, hidden around the room and they would be moved). On one occasion, when we returned to our room in the afternoon, the sliding doors to the veranda had been left open. On another occasion, when we dropped off my sister-in-law at her room late one evening, her card key would not work. We were about to head up to the lobby yet again when a hotel staff member conveniently arrived with a replacement key. This seemed very odd as it was about 1:30 in the am. We checked the room and sure enough, some of her clothes had been placed on the bed. Going to bed at night and not feeling safe in your own room is not a pleasant feeling.Oh and did I mention the power outage that lasted for 8 hours. Which also affected ALL the toilets as they run on pumps. Yikes. Bring a flashlight....it's apparently common in the DR.The Good? Hmmmm.....Punta Cana is apparently the area to go in the DR (vs. Puerto Plata) and the beach was beautiful (unfortunately it got dirtier and dirtier throughout the week.) While the front desk staff were not overly helpful, some of it is language and the rest is they were trying to make the best of a resort where all the rooms have problems and all they hear are complaints all day. All in all, the people are very nice and friendly, especially at the bar where customers are generally having a good time and have no complaints. The resort was a good size and easy to navigate. If you're already booked, just stay in an alcoholic stupor as we did and you'll meet plenty of great people from Canada and abroad and have a good time despite the resort.In conclusion....I don't think we'll go back to the DR. If we do, I will book at the Bahia Principe which I've heard from several people is good. The Bavaro Beach looked nice too, when the bus dropped people off there from the airport.Our rep told us to stay away from all the Barcelo resorts....I just wish we had have known that beforehand. As my husband put it鈥︹€漷his resort is bush league鈥?and I wouldn鈥檛 recommend it to anyone.

<Content>OK Resort but had problems We stayed at this Hotel in Dec 2007. We made reservations for 2 nights 3 days. When we got there our reservation was not in the system under the correct spelling. It took them 2 hours to figure out the spelling the reservations office used. Check in was 3 pm we didnt get our room until 8pm. We were told children stayed free but at the counter we were told they werent free. There were no dry towels to use at the beach. Breakfast buffet was large lots of variety but I didnt like the taste of the food. The steak house was good. The pizza was good. The Barcelo CAribe Italian Restaurant was a nightmare food was awful.We got stomach problems for 4 days.. I dont know if it was the hotel food or what but be aware.Lots of European tourists, and some loud tourists. Not sure I would recomend this hotel to anyone. Price was good though but you get what you paid for. We stayed 3 days and 2 nights in Casa de CAmpo Dominican Republic the following week.. that was more expensive but definately worth it.

<Content>Watch the food and leaks Arrived at the resort on December 23/ 07 and left on the 30th via Air Canada from Winnipeg. Flight was exceptional, with less than 50 passengers on board. On arrival to Punta Cana, the trip through customs was quick and the Air Canada people were very efficient in the arrangement with transportation to the hotel.Arrival at the resort was uneventful and the checkin was expedient. We met some people from Canada behind us who said we were given the same room they had (I guessed they moved, and we found out why later).The room was OK, however, it is an older resort as evidenced by the old painted wooden doors to the rooms. The room appeared to have been redone and painted. The rooms (at least ours) are very exposed to noises from the pool and the entertainment areas which does not promote good sleep. The Dominican music was very loud ALL the time. The toilet didn't work very well and we experienced a huge leak in the ceiling from a rainstorm (and a burst hot water tank upstairs?). Complaining to the front desk was ignored and attempts to get relocated went unheeded, however, at least the sleeping area didn't get wet. Aside from a worker who mopped out the water, nobody came by to check on the leak or fix the ceiling. The availability of even warm water was kind of a hit and miss affair.Another interesting problem was getting a key for the safe in the room. After repeated requests to the front desk, a clerk (Carlos) finally gave us his personal key. THANKS to Carlos. In general, the front desk staff simply ignored any complaints / requests by looking at a computer screen and jotting down your room number.Staff at the restaurants were efficient and friendly, especially (Super) Mario at the buffet. The food was OK at the buffet and especially good at the Brazilian a la carte. However, my wife fell ill from something she ate at the Christmas eve dinner at the buffet (probably the lobster / fish dishes) which lasted for four days. Fortunately, I don't like fish so I had no problem.The beach was nice, with the exception of the beachfront shops adjacent to the resort where we were constantly harassed to buy.We did one excursion, the Marinarium. Had lots of fun.The rating on the travel brochure is somewhat misleading. At best, the resort is a 2.5 star. If going, beware of the food you eat and the room you get.We won't be going back to this resort.

<Author>TownTerrierToronto
<Content>Had a great family vacation!!! We stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach Resort from DEC 20 - 27 2007. My wife, myself and 2 daughters 12  7. I will try and break this down so it is easy to understand.Toronto Airport.A big bonus booking with Signature Vacations was the family Check-in. 2 desks dedicated to families with children. The line up was huge and to drag kids through that can be a chore at the best of times. It took no longer than 5 min to check-in.We were delayed for 4 hours due to plane problem but was supplied $15 per person food vouchers very quickly.The flight took 4 hours which is normally 4h 20min.Punta Cana AirportThis is a breeze. Bags off quickly and on bus in no time. These are modern buses with air conditioning.There are lots of porters waiting to grab your bags, a polite No is all thats needed if you prefer not to. A small tip is expected if they do.The resort is only 25 min ride.AT THE HOTELCheck in was relatively painful as there was just our flight with being delayed it was 2.30 am. We were allocated a room on the 3rd floor of block one. The bell boy carried our bags to the 3 rd floor and earned his tip. The room was basic and had 2 double beds in the same room. One for the wife and I and my 2 girls shared a double bed. They were very comfortable pillow top matresses.The bathroom looked tired but I will say the Barcelo group are actively working on this resort. We apparently had a safe in our room which was a barrel style lock and they didn't have the barrel. They are getting new safes delivered end of JAN.It took my wife a couple of trips to the front desk to find this out. This is where you should use your tour operator representative. Our rep. was St茅phane (Male French Canadian) and he was very helpful. (Don't think the orientation is a waste of time it is very informative). Due to not being able to use the safe which is by the way FREE at this resort (Usually $20 US at most) St茅phane got us upgraded to a Villa suite for our inconvenience. I have just one word for these rooms WOW. This suite was ground floor which had a living area with pull out couch, dining table, TV with bar fridge and a seperate bathroom. Through 2 double doors was the Master Bedroom with own TV, walkout balcony and ensuite bathroom complete with Jacuzzi Tub, seperate shower, his and hers sinks, toilet and bidet. AMAZING.RESORT GROUNDSThis is not a huge resort like some we have visited. It is compact and everything is accessible. A bonus for those who either can't walk a long distance or those who just don't want to. The gardens are spectacular. The palm trees on the walkways were all lit up at night (may be due to Xmas? Don't know) There are 3 pools on this resort. Main pool with swim up bar. A salt water pool with mini-waterfall and a pool close to beach. All are kid friendly. They clean these at least once a day. Bars are everywhere. Lobby, Sports bar, Swim-up, and even on the Beach FOODGreat selection at main buffet restaurant. Christmas meal was excellent. and very well presented with ice sculptures. Only tried one A la carte ( the Brazillian) which was great, (lots of food) due to the variety at main restaurant. They do have a 24 hour snack bar which serves Hot dogs, Pizza and burgers. (all good food although ask for burgers well done)Alcohol is abundant. Copius amounts of Presidente (Beer) consumed. Not really a short drinker so can't comment.ENTERTAINMENTThe animation team are tireless. Richard (the supervisor) and the rest of the crew go non-stop. The shows are well put together, the dancing is amazing and the parts with the audience participation are hilarious. I would have to say this entertainment team made our choice to visit this resort well worth it. The last show we saw before we left was the water show in the main pool. Fire eaters dancing on rafts and again hilarious Tarzan gig with audience participation was so funny.RECAPSorry to have gone on but there is a lot of good things to say about this resort. Value for money was 5* in my opinion and we have been to the DR 4 times now and we had a blast. Some guests were very rude to the front desk, screaming and shouting. Relax, use your tour operator Rep for communication that is what they are there for. We will consider returning next year, should this resort be available.

<Content>Give the Barcelo time I am going to start off we travel every year and stay at all different * resorts in different countries. We are not fussy people what we look for is clean, good air conditioning, decent food, everything after that is a bonus so when I do have a complaint it is justified. We believe you can break a holiday quickly by complaining so we just let things slide and enjoy ourselves.Check-in was long and we only had two families get off our bus. 1 1/2 hour later we did get a room, with the maintenance man fixing our patio door. We arrived after 5 pm so that wasn't the problem they just told us to sit and wait so we sat at the lobby bar until they found rooms for us. Room was clean and decent, bathroom had mold on the shower curtain and on the shower wall. Oh well the air conditioner worked great. My sons room had mold also and water leaked from light fixture in bathroom he had problems with his patio door but didn't bother maintenance with it. We couldn't get a key for the room safe for three days this was an annoyance because we carried our money and passports with us and that isn't safe also. They don't have enough keys for the amount of room safes so we had to check back every day until they had some. Same with remote controls(no big deal for us) The Barcelo is still getting things done when we were there we were the first ones with new pillow tops on our mattress it was wonderful. They also were changing furniture. I loved the fridge and left notes for the maids what we wanted in our fridge (beer, water and diet coke) they had it right all week. No face cloths or clocks( not a big deal for us but some people were very upset) Towels were a hit and miss thing sometimes we got them when they cleaned the rooms sometimes later in the evening sometimes we were lucky to get a bath towel (yes we did tip)Beach- nicely kept up and lots of lounges. Punta cana has wonderful water and sand.pools- nice clean lots of chairsGrounds- Again Barcelo was adding more flower beds, painting and cleaning the ponds. Very nice. Food- Ok like I said we like decent food our first night at the buffet the choices were lamb, blood sausage and pork trotters(yes pig feet) the sauce for the pasta was a fish base. So I did have salad and the cream sauce for pasta. My son and husband would have liked meat. Every night I checked the buffet one night it was a hamburger bar. I don't mind a hamburger for lunch but not for supper. One night it was seafood and they BBQ lobster the one I had was great my husbands wasn't cooked long enough. Watch all your meat lots of the hamburger is not cooked thoroughly same with chicken. But the a la carte restaurants were great we ate at all of them and all four of us had only good things to say. In the morning for breakfast we always had trouble trying to get coffee and water you can't help yourself you have to have an employee help you. The pizza snack bar the workers were great and the pizzas good. We loved the coffee house and their desserts were great. My son and girl friend loved the sports bar and met lots of the bar tenders he had a great time in there.Bars all were good.This is the forth time to the Dominican our second to Punta Cana and I think the Barcelo will be a wonderful place in a few months when they get it back to there standards. We have always loved the Dominican people and found them friendly but not so at this resort it could have to do with them changing over and some people were loosing there jobs for Barcelo people. Don't get me wrong we met some wonderful friendly people but not as many as we usually do at a resort. Lots of time I felt like I was bothering them going to the buffet.I wouldn't recommend this resort to friends and family because of the buffet but I really do believe it will get better.

<Content>Flooded bathroom and no wash cloths The Barcelo Dominican Beach Resort was a beautiful place. We had a ground-floor room and loved sitting on the terrace. Fortunately, we had had the foresight to take bug repellant spray, which was needed in the evenings. With three or four exceptions, we had a great time. First, we could not make the maids understand that since there were three of us, we needed three towels. On one occasion, I even counted each of us for the maid and pointed to a towel to emphasize that we needed one for each of us. This was ineffective because she still left only two towels. The maid there the first day was great, but she did not return until the day before our checkout. Then we finally received three towels. Second, in an attempt to get wash cloths, I finally asked Wendy at Guest Services if people in the Dominican Republic did not use wash cloths because we could not get the maids to leave any -- not one. Wendy assured us we would be given wash cloths. Her assurances meant absolutely nothing. We did not receive wash cloths until the first maid returned the day before we checked out. She left three wash cloths. Hallelujah! We had been using hand towels or an end of our given towels for wash cloths. The major problem, however, was that the toilet leaked, the ceiling leaked, and water poured out from under the wall -- all flooding our bathroom. We had to place the bathmat next to the wall to absorb water. Once we had to use one of our two towels, which was disastrous because by then we considered towels to be sacred. At that point I did persuade Wendy to send us a replacement towel for that one. As far as the food went, there was a great variety from which to choose. I loved trying the various dishes even if I spent lots and lots of time in the flooded bathroom from doing so. (Whoever in a previous review said to take Imodium and Pepto Bismol was not kidding.) The a la carte restaurants offered good food, too (unfortunately, with the same effect as the food on the buffets). MThe male waiters were very friendly; the females ignored people.The Christmas Eve dinner invitations (which were slid under the room door) added a festive touch. The buffet area was beautifully decorated in what must have been a Dominican Republic tradition. The dolphin ice sculptures were lovely. It seemed as if every kind of food imaginable was offered Christmas Eve. We loved the Cafe. We ended up there quite often for espresso or latte or some frozen coffee concoction and desserts, all of which were delicious. The workers there were terrific. They were friendly, they dramatically sang along to the music being played, they posed for pictures. We thoroughly enjoyed time spent in the Cafe. Administrators of the casino should learn that people would spend a lot more money at the blackjack table if the dealers were friendly. They talked to other employees and did not even look at us while we played. One of them ignored my confirming I wanted even money for my blackjack. The dealers are rude and do not give players a chance to ask for another card. They just do their thing with no regard to the players. I definitely would not recommend the casino to anyone.One of the entertainment staff (Richard) looks like Will Smith. He does a great job and so do the others. In the lobby lounge, entertainers ask guests to dance, which was fun. We went to a couple shows at the theatre, and they were entertaining. After one, Will told everyone to go to the beach for a party there. We followed everyone, and the DJ and bartenders there were great. They all put on quite a show. Drinks were abundant and good. Bartenders were friendly and entertaining. Check-in took about a half hour because a room was not ready. The maids take their time and seem to do one thing in the room, leave for a while, come back and do another thing, leave, come back. I think the last thing they do is bring the two towels. No wash cloths, just two towels. Walking up the beach to the little shops was an experience. The vendor in the first shop closest to the ocean was very nasty because we did not buy from him right then. I went back in to ask about something after we had visited other shops, and he screamed and acted like a mad man because he said we bought from others. I do advise people to stay away from that shop. We walked by the next day and he started screaming and yelling again. A couple days later my 6'5, 300 + or - pound son accompanied us, and the man kept his mouth shut. We found this funny because my son simply wanted to see in the shops, but this man must have been afraid. He was all mouth when it was only two women, but quite quiet when a large male was with us. We found the taxi drivers very nice, too. They were quite helpful with luggage and with taking us wherever we wanted to go. Rates were fair. Overall, we had a good time. For the money, with the exception of the bathroom problems, the place was pretty nice. We would, however, not go back (unless we won an all-expenses-paid trip).

<Content>Bring your Immodium AD I visited between 12/19/07 - 12/23/07. The Barcelo Dominican Beach hotel definately is geared towards French/Latin Americans - make sure you know some spanish before going or you will have difficulties, no matter what the travel agent tells you. I felt like out of the few people I encountered who spoke English, they were reluctant to do so. Ok so here goes: 1. Food - I saw roaches crawling underneath the metal trays on the buffet and found a hair in my eggs. Thanks to the food, I got traveller's DIARRHEA which I'm still recovering from back here in the US. Bring lots of Immodium AD/Pepto Bismol. It's expensive at stores there if you do not, and you will most likely need it if you eat or drink at this hotel (make sure you don't drink anything that has ice in it). If you don't mind that then it was fine, good/exotic selection and variety of things. DO NOT DO NOT DRINK THE WATER FROM THE HOTEL. IT IS NOT SAFE. Drink only bottled water, I also learned this the hard way as they don't tell you this during check-in. I overheard a lot of conversations in the lobby of people who also got severe traveller's diarrhea.2. Room - I'm a very easy-to-please traveler.It wasn't that bad. No bugs inside, it was clean. 2 full beds seem standard in most of the rooms here. The floor was curiously perpetually wet. And there was no water for a half-day because the generator needed repaired. Luckily I already showered before it occurred and they fixed it by the evening. Make sure to LOCK ALL VALUABLES. Word to the wise - use the safe and rent a key, no matter how long it takes you to wait in line at the front desk. Do not leave valuables out unlocked during the day EVEN IN THE HOTEL ROOM. And try not to use your credit card because crime is very very common in developing countries like DR. Bring small bills.3. Beach - The beach area at the hotel in itself was small. I took a stroll several blocks down the beach and saw a lovely DR policeman with a shot gun in tow. All in all however, the scenery was beautiful. The white sand is almost as white as vanilla ice cream. Beautiful turquiose water. However, the scenery was somewhat marred by the constant daily peddling of solicitors for hair braiding, tours/services, etc. On several occasions I pretended to sleep but they continued to hound me until I awoke. They came around daily every 2 minutes. You won't get a lot of peace/tranquility here. I couldn't snorkel much at the Barcelo Dominican beach because the constant boats (every 5 minutes daily) running right by the marked off swimming area kept making waves, ruining visibility and scaring away fish. If you want to see fish you'll have to book a tour or go to another beach.4. Customer service - Geared towards French/Latin Americans. Not many English speakers at the front desk. It's slow. Be prepared to wait in line around 20 minutes to check in. 5. Tours - 1. Snorkeling tour - I did the snorkleing tour with the nurse sharks/stingrays, I don't recommend. They keep these animals in a small area blocked off in plastic construction nets, they looked very distressed and people kept touching them and the tour guides didn't care even though they told everyone not to. It looked wayyyyy too small for the amount of stingrays and nursesharks put in there. I felt bad that I sort of endorsed this mistreatment by paying for the excursion after the fact. Also, the snorkeling tour guide didn't seem to care that he constantly kept destroying living coral with his swim fins. Aside from those things, the open water snorkleing was ok, saw some pretty fish.  2. Safari - The tour was nice but seeing the children constantly begging for food/candy and all the poverty-stricken areas was disconcerting and saddening. It's sad to see children with no shoes and appear malnourished keep coming up to your tour buggy begging for stuff, which happened at practically every stop throughout the whole tour. All in all you can say that it was an adventure. Back to my pepto bisbol and Immodium AD, good luck!

<Content>Other reviews were right... Summary:Good vacation, great weather, great entertainment, swimming, tanning, excursions. Bad service in hotel, bad food, local people are lame and lazy.We were staying this hotel December 17 to 24, 2007Bad things:1. Check-inSpent 3 hours to get the room. The staff at the front desk wasso busy and trying to help everybody all together so it was messy.First room I got - keys didn't work (and it was the most far building from all facilities and ground floor even the hotel guy told us that it is 2nd floor and near the beach).So went back to front desk, found another person, gave him $10 and ask for another room. He gave a better room, 2nd floor and close to amenities like pools and restaurants.2. FoodThere are total 7 restaurants in this hotel. But the food wascrapy. Even I can describe myself as a guy who 鈥渆ats almost everything, the food was bad. Badly cooked, badly served...(at least I didn't get extra kilos)3. Bugs in the bed.Everybody I see in the hotel had bites on their feet. Thisbugs a really small so you can't see them. I hope that didn'tbring it back homeIf you want to improve service you have to tip - otherwise it doesn't work at all.Good things.In general, hotel is OK. You can walk on the beach line and look at the others. I walk about 10 kilometers to both directions and found that most of the hotels are pretty same.Even hotels that have sign like premium 5 stars don鈥檛 look fancy.The weather was excellent! No rain at all during 7 days.The sun is great for tanning, the climate is soft even moist.Excursions! Take them and you will not be disappointed. We took only two, but they were amazing (ATV riding and swimming with sharks).

<Content>Overall deserves a 4-star rating Stayed at this resort from Dec. 14-21. I must say that I was very concerned about what this resort would have been like given the many previous negative reviews. In the end, the resort exceeded my expectations.Many of the previous criticisms seemed to stem from the change in ownership from Ocean to Barcelo in September 2007. Ocean, knowing that they were going to sell, likely ran the place down with very little commitment to quality. Barcelo, however has a very strong reputation, and it was very evident that much was cleaned up within 3 months of taking over and we saw a lot of improvement work taking place while we were there.I have stayed at various 4-star resorts in DR previously, and Barcelo Domincan Beach does meet that standard, and will without any doubt continue to be a 4-star given the ongoing improvements.On the negative side, I share some of the similar complaints as others. Customer service at check-in and reception is poor. Typically there were only two people serving long line-ups of people checking in and checking out, plus others that were not lining up to be attended to for various reasons. There seemed to be other staff running around reception not seeming to really be doing anything. Someone may be attending to you at one moment, walk away, then not return. It is very easy to lose patience at the front counter as they were very disorganized. If you can carry your luggage to your own room do so. We have learned from experience that you can easily be waiting a long time for your luggage to arrive from one of the bellboys. We were assigned a room in Block 5, near the beach, which is where we wanted to be. Block 5, 6, and 7 are closer to the beach 鈥?the others can be a bit of a distance if you plan to be going back and forth regularly. Block 5 and 6 are also close to the pools. Upon getting to our room our door lock (access by card pass) did not work. After going back to the front desk twice to have them program then change the cards, we ended up waiting for almost 2 hours since arriving to have our door lock fixed so that we could get into our room. Not a good start to the vacation. The room (rate at 2-star) showed a lot of wear 鈥?very basic, old furnishings, rust on bathroom fixtures, leaking from ceiling, poor A/C, patio doors did not work well, TV remote did not work. Nice that there was a stocked fridge which we loaded up with water from the cleaning lady, safe (ask for key at check-in), and hair dryer for the ladies. During our stay we also saw that furniture in many rooms were being replaced. While the room was not great, it did meet our needs, and we were only there for sleeping and changing 鈥?thus very little impact on vacation experience. Overall property was very clean and nice. Many staff working throughout day to keep it pristine. Pools were great. Food was good at buffets and we really liked the extensive choice of various restaurants for dinner (be sure to make reservations early in morning as they fill up quickly) 鈥?particularly liked Japanese, Spanish and Brazilian. Did not like Mexican and did not try Italian. Caf茅, Sports Bar and Lobby Bar (entertainment in evening) were nice additions that you would not typically get at a 4-star. Entertainment shows at night in main theatre were of good quality generally and often fun. Great disco club on property to go to from 12am-2am. 24 hour pizza/hamburger/hot dog station was great to fit in a bite when needed, especially after club. Service at various restaurants and bars were good. We made sure to tip everywhere, but saw very few ever tipping, especially at the restaurants where you should be tipping. Don鈥檛 be cheap, these people work hard to make your vacation enjoyable.We loved the fact that there were many activities and things to do to enjoy around the clock. The entertainment team there was the best that we have ever experienced. Beach and water was very nice, as we expected in Punta Cana.For shopping, there are a couple stores on the property that are expensive, but immediately next to the resort is a little area of various vendor shops where you can get all the souvenirs and gifts you need. The vendors will pressure you to go in their stores but are generally nice. Probably best as a courtesy to go into each for a short visit. Be sure to bargain 鈥?you will usually get them down about 50% or more. Shop around first before buying as the prices will vary significantly from one shop to another. For additional shopping continue up the beach for about 10 minutes and you will get to a little shopping village with various larger stores and vendor stands. It was nice that the resort was close to shopping, as it gave us a nice break from the resort to get out for a couple half-days.Barcelo Dominican Beach is a typical 4-star resort, nice, has everything you need and some, but a few improvements are still needed. I would recommend this resort and expect that it will continue to improve under Barcelo ownership.

<Content>Some good, some bad Stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from Dec. 8 to 15 and had a pretty good time. I had read many complaints on this site, and though I saw many negative ones, I figured no matter what I would keep a positive outlook.RoomHad to wait about an hour to check in, but they let us go to lunch while we waited as we got there at about 2 p.m. (check in at 3 usually). Once we got our keys, we headed off to our section. I was hoping for something decent, and at first look I could not complain. We were in Block 6 (Elite Club section) and were treated to an oceanview room on the first floor. We were quite surprised since we hadn't made any special requests and were just supposed to get a standard room. It had a king sized bed, a separate day bed in the tv area and a huge bathroom with shower and separate jacuzzi tub. We were essentially a 10 second walk from the beach! Though we were quite pleased with the room, it did show some wear... peeling paint, a few mold spots near the patio door, and more mold on a few of the cushions on the day bed. It was extremely humid so I imagine it's quite difficult for things to dry properly there... hence the mold. Other than that, we had a mini bar stocked with beer, pop and water (left the maid $5 the first day and asked for additional water - she kept us fully supplied with the latter!). My bf tried the tub, which he very much enjoyed. That said, our upstairs neighbours also tried theirs and it leaked into our bathroom. It wasn't the end of the world since the water dripped into our tub, but it was a bit alarming that the water was coming from a light fixture in the ceiling! Ah well, we just kept the light closed and laughed it off! Everything else in the room was fine.BeachAbsolutely beautiful! It was a bit small compared to other resorts I've stayed at in Cuba and Mexico, but the water was pristine. There were also plenty of chairs for everyone.FoodI'm not really picky so I thought the food was fine as did my bf. I was a little disappointed at the variety of fruit for the most part, but I always found something yummy to try at the buffet. I also tried the Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Brasilian restaurants. For meat lovers, I would highly recommend the Brasilian. Apparently the service can be a bit slow, but we were very well served there. You go to a mini buffet first for your side dishes and the servers bring you cuts of meat (shish kabob style) directly to your table. My next favorite was the Spanish, which had great selection and atmosphere (note that the drawback to the Brasilian was the LACK of atmosphere - no music, glaring lights). I also enjoyed the Japanese where the cook prepared the food in front of you and does a little show off routine. Right off the bat, ours got so carried away and the salt shaker smashed into my water glass spraying shards in my sushi. Something else I laughed off... they just brought me another plate of sushi. The main course was tasty, but I found the sushi wasn't extremely fresh. On to the Italian. Awful - and like I mentioned, I'm not picky! I ordered risotto with mushroom with slivers of parmesan. I was served a bowl of RICE drowning in a watery cream sauce with parmesan and canned mushrooms. If you can't make an italian meal, don't advertise you can!ServiceNo complaints here. The lobby bar was a bit slow in the evening unless you asked for rum and coke, pina colada or beer. I tried ordering something from their menu and gave up after repeating my order four times (I was at the bar 10 minutes!). All other spots were great. Awesome coffee shop you have to try too. The place also offers massages in little huts by the pool and beach. I skipped out, but only because we ran out of time.PoolsThree on site, but one was closed for repairs at the far end of the resort. The others were nice and clean... especially liked the one with the pool bar!Would I go back? Probably not. But for $875 taxes in, you can't complain too much. Some of the people who were travelling with the same supplier were really negative (one even complained about the wind being too loud and needing ear plugs!), so I think when you read these reviews, you have to take into consideration that everyone sees things differently. The resort was just bought by the Barcelo group and has been branded a four star. It is definately not a four star. When it was under the old name of Ocean Beach, it was considered a three star. Obviously, it'll take more than two months to get to the four star level. The place has a lot of potential, so I think that once they actually start renovating the rooms it will be a great place. Can one have a good time here and enjoy their stay as the resort is now? I think so - just keep an open mind and remember that the mentality is very different from what you may be used to.

<Content>Worst vacation ever We got there on Sunday Nov 18th. We were very anxious to get there as our flight was arriving early in the day...we thought we would start enjoying our vacation early!!! Boy were we wrong! I will make my review short and sweet (compared to the four-page complaint letter I sent to Barcelo 2 weeks ago that hasn't been addressed yet!!!).-Our rooms weren't ready for our arrival, we were asked to go eat and come back 2 hours later, there was only one rep at the front desk. (we were a busload of people arriving at once!)-When we got back, the rooms were still not ready, they started calling us by name as our rooms were made available.-To get to our rooms, we had to hop into the golf cart used to carry the luggage. The bellboys piled up the luggage behind us in such a way that they fell on us, and instead of apologizingm the simply continued their work as if nothing happened.-Got to our rooms, the TV picture on ALL channels was snowy and we were in a room with 2 double beds instead of one king size as requested. Tried calling for room change, we were told to contact Guest Services, who never answered the phone. Had to walk back to the front desk.-The rep at Guest Services promised me we would change rooms the next day and that he put in the request in the system.-Finally went to join my wife and sister-in-law at the pool for the few minutes I got to see the pool that day. Going back to our rooms, the keys weren't working anymore. Had to go back to the front desk.-When I got there, I was told I must've demagnetized my card!!! Yeah right!!! I hide my cellphone in my swimming suit so I can talk on the phone in the pool!!! And managed to demagnetize it in a matter of 4 hours...-The gave us new keys, and when we were on our way back to the rooms, a guest ran after me saying they want to speak to me at the front desk, went back...The guy asked me if my room number was XXX, I said yes, he then called me by a name, I said that wasn't me...hat's when the other guest said it was him...I guess I know why my key didn't work anymore!!!-The next day, we had our meeting with our tour operator's rep. I explained to her my issues and she went to speak with the reception supervisor, then ended up talking to the Director responsible for the rooms, who told her to have us come back at 3pm to get the keys to our new roomS (the upper case S is intentional) and tried to buy us with a 20 min massage.-Went back at 3 as required, and the guy at the front desk told me that we will only be getting 1 room (hence the issue with the capital S) and that they are doing me a favour because normally we have to pay extra to get one king size bed!!!-I obviously asked to speak to someone else, he made me go see his supervisor who tried to find a solution by explaining to me that they never got the request for 1 bed from the travel agency even though I explained to him that who's fault it was had become irrelevent by then. Anyways, we finally decided to stay in our rooms as they couldn't accomodate us, but on the condition that they fix the things that were wrong (TV and toilet that wouldn't flush everytime).-Neither happened, TV was still snowy (even though we saw other rooms with cristal clear image) and the toilet was not fixed.-By wednesday evening, when we went back to our rooms in the late afternoon, the pipe leading to the toilet in my sister-in-law's room was pierced and the bathroom was flooded. We called front desk at 5:30pm, and again at 6pm, and twice more at half hour intervals. We got fed up and went for dinner and figured we'd talk to them there since the restaurant is next to the reception.-At close to 10pm, they finally tell me the maintenance person is in the room and it's fixed. I get back to the room to verify (by then I didn't trust a word they said) and it was true, he did fix it. Up to then, he was the nicest person in the hotel. I asked him at what time did they tell him about the problem and he said it must've been around 9-9:30 and it was a maid who told him, not even the front desk that I called 4 hours eralier!-Thursday I couldn't take it anymore and wanted to speak to Barcelo head office. I will skip the front desk episode about getting the phone number, but in essence I was given the number of another Barcelo in DR instead of the head office. It seems this had some kind of impact because later that day they offered to change us to 2 suites. Obviously forget about the bellboys being there to move our luggage, after 4 calls and half an hour of waiting we went ourselves.-Then the part I like the most is the checkout. We had made a phone call to Canada, for which we were told by the tour operator's rep it costs 1.50$/min. At checkout, the guy (who had told me about paying extra for king size bed...I already didn't enjoy dealing with him), asked me if I made a call because he sees a charge but doesn't know what it represents. I answered yes, and it seems for a 5 min call, we were charged 21$...he told us it costs 4$/min not 1.50$. I aksed him for the details of the charge as I wasn't going to pay without it, he seemingly got offended by it and said: what, you think I am going to cheat you?!...I let it pass...Then the tour operator's rep arrived to the front desk, I asked her again and she confirmed she had read it in their pamphlet 1.50$, they spoke for a few min, then he waved at the guest behind me (completely ignoring my presence) to proceed with his request. That's when I raised my voice for the first time during the trip and asked to speak to someone else.The story about the charge ended with me not paying ebcause they couldn't produce a detailled bill.So far, everything I said was negative (to say the least!), however there were a few good things about the hotel: Angelo the maintenance guy, a few waiters (not all of them and not most of them) and the entertainment was amazing!Hope this helps you decide whether you want to spend your money in that hotel (or hotel chain)...good luck!

<Content>Don't Plan a Wedding HERE When we got to our hotel the room was not ready. We had lunch and relaxed alittle bit. Once we did get our room, we had a veiw of the parkinglot! We had a weeding planned prior to our trip, that never happened!!! My TA faxed in all the required Documents in advanced. We picked out the date and a picture package. AWHEN WE GOT THERE THE WEDDING PLANNER WAS ON VACATION !!! I tried to stay calm b/c she was due to return on Monday(our planned wedding day). When she returned she acted like she knew nothing about us. I had seen emails between her an my TA and she clearly knew we were coming. Then once we planned it for a new day she explained it would cost $1,000 american dollars!!! We were under the understanding wedding packages were included with any 7 night stay...LIERS!It was a nice place and the peopler were nice, there was alot of good food and fresh fruits. The beach was great, but we did end up spending a ton on extra things to do.The hotel to this point has refused to make right out of my non wedding. My TA has made several contacts, but I don't think they really care.

<Content>beautiful country horrid resort after a 9 hour flight from the uk we arrived to find our room to be un-useable, damp, terrible electrics and a bathroom that not even a pig should be put in. we complained and our rep mel got us an up grade, to which we accepted but would never have paid for. it was a junior suite with jacuzzi tub. we stayed 13 nights and during that time we had no water for 3 days and no hot water for another 4 days. during one of these non hot water days, we were assured by the reception desk that our hot water was avialable and after a 7 hour wait we gave up, this was our last night and we were not happy at all. 90% of the staff have no time for the english speaking guests. during our stay, only 2 out of 20 entertainment staff actually had any contact with us, over the 13 nights. when we finally managed to book a table in the italian restuarant, after trying every morning for a week, there was no decorum with the other patrons, being a'la carte i would expect some kind of dress code but there was none, and when over meals arrived they were cold and when we mentioned this to whom we presumed was the maitre 'd, his response was that the food left the kitchen hot, no offer to replace our order, htis is not good enought. whilst on our holiday we met may other couples from the uk and all of them had at least 3 items to complain about. on our final day we had a meeting with our rep to express our selves and the guest services manager also attended. i do hope and pray that she listened to us and has taken our veiws to her boss so that in future british guests are not treated as badly as we were.

<Content>Fab Hotel for families and folk all ages :) I went to the hotel with my boyfriend and his family, we are both 19  we were with his mum and partner and four children aged 16, 14, 13 and 10. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by two men who loaded little buggies with our bags, we signed in and were taken to our rooms in block 5. As the guests before us flight had been delayed our rooms were not yet tidy, however we told the staff who were extremely apologetic and tidied them asap!:)The view from our room , which was room 5210, was lovely. The beach and bluen skies welcomed us. The rooms were always cleaned thoroughly and the fridges kept stocked with cool refreshments. There are three pools in the resort, we spent our first day in the pool nest to the bahia resturant,it was very clean and had mostly children and families using it. My boyfriend and I ventured to the pool bar pool and found that this was the best pool of the resort. It is the biggest and busiest, yet has the most atsmosphere and is the epitome of a relaxing holiday as you just go up and order your drinks and relax in the pool :)The bar's are excellent.The mesure of alcohol are very strong - and rum is the local tipple which goes with everything....EVEN COFFEE! :)If you ask for a cocktail, the staff are happy make you a 'special' which consists of anything and is exciting to try.The food is real good to.I three of the A'La Carte restuarants - Spanish ( very nice), Italian (Okay but a bit plain) and Mexican ( fun; family restuarant). I personally thought that the buffet restuarants are better, as they offer more choice and freedom to eat when you want.the pizzeria is 24hours and is fab for a late night snack.The night life is excellent. :)The entertainment staff produced fun shows every night which envolved all guests. The Theatre hosts excellent performers and performances.The disco is fantastic too, starts at 11 and finishes at 2, i went with my boyfriend and his 16 year old brother and they play excellent music - both English and Spanish and has an excellent atmosphere. The beach is lovely and clean and the water was like a bath. A range of watersports are available such as Kayaking and bannana boats.The spa is lovely too. The massages are heaven sent, set in little huts near the beach it's perfect! You have to bargain for prices, we got four massages for $100. The staff work on comission and like you to know their names and want you to use only them. We had a delightful lady called Helana and she was very sweet.Most of the staff only speak Spanish. But this is fun. You pick up some lingo and I personally enjoyed having to use spanish!!Some locals do come for the weekend , but they are fun....they love the music and create a great atmosphere. I would recommend doing the 'Outback Safari' trip, gives you a wonderful chance to see the real side of Dominican .... yes it is a third world country but the people are lovely. The children are so sweet and it really makes you appreciate what you have got.:)All in all a great trip - even if we did get poured on by the Tropical Storm Noel towards the end of our holiday. :)

<Content>we will go again My wife and i have just arrived back from Punta Cana, where we stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Beach and spa complex which has just been taken over and is now the Barcelo Dominican Beach. That was a surprise because no one had said anything to us and we thought we were at the wrong place.The reception is a big place and the roof of the building is a real eye catcher, We were greeted at reception with an ice cold fruit drink and an ice cold towell both of which where very welcome indeed,especially the towel, we were then shown to our room which was in block 5 number 5218 opposite the beach bar right by the pool and right by the beach ideal just what the doctor ordered, 20 min's later a knock on the door and there were our cases delivered by two guy's in a golf buggy who looked as if they had just arrived from a safari into the amazon with their white uniforms and pith hats.The beach----- stunning more than enough sun-beds and yes there is some seaweed but u would expect that after all you are on a beach.. one critisism they could do with some free standing sun shades because the fixed ones are usually coverted at about 6 in the morning,one good thing is you are left in peace because the security there are a deterent to any beach sales people, there is a small market on the beach far to the left (as you look at the sea ) and they can be a bit of a pain if you go there as is the market that comes on a friday night to the square but a sharp but polite no usually does the trick, after all they are only trying to make a livingRooms---- Air con can be a bit noisy but welcome be aware that if you turn it off, because of the humidity the room will start to steam up and the floors will become wet .the patio doors can be noisy to open because they do not slide to easily.but you are only there to sleep and shower and then you are out again,we did hear of one or two couples who were not happy with their rooms but for what we wanted they were ok basic but ok.Food---- Main restaurant big choice enough of a choice for everyone,and plenty of it .Italian--- Great help ur self starters lovely pasta the lasagne was very good so was the lemon chicken 8/10Japan Wasabi----- exellent fixed menu and the main meal is cooked in front of you and that is a show on its own you have to eat there it is a must 10/10 Spanish--- we were told dont go so we did notMexican---- we did not goBrazillian---- we did not find it untill it was to late and when we did find it guess where it was-- yes-- opposite our room by the pool.People----- The Dominican people are some of the happiest friendliest people we have met and most of them can speak a little in English /German/ Italian and french but it does help if you can try and converse in spanish after all you are in a Spanish speaking country and if they see you are trying they think all the better of you for it. Tip Tip Tip and you will want for nothing the 1 dollar hand shake with a hola senior thrown in works wonders believe me you will want for nothing your coffee cup or whiskey glass will never run dry and for the hard work these people do they deserve it.Coffee Shop---- This is a must see place if you like coffee Tea Chocolate 10/10Shows ------ Well worth going along to see.Over all we had a fantastic time hear and will be going again next year it will take a year to get over this one.What to take----- Mossy Repellent--- 1dollar bills----After sun with repellent in them,(the little buggers get you when your legs are under the table )Last but not least when you go for food to the main Buffet Restaurant do your self a favour FIND MARIO this guy is briliant give him the one dollar hand shake and you will want for nothing and as soon as he knows what you want he will have it for you before you sit down and be prepared to have your name changed to Senior Mafia.Thats all from me hope you enjoy as much as my wife and i did because we are going back next year to enjoy it all over again Adios Amigos......................

<Content>Nice place First, please know that the name has changed to Barcelo Domincan Beach. Make sure your cabby knows this too.Next, know that the good reviews on this site have gotten it right. This is a very nice place. Top of the line? No. But we were well pleased with the beach, the room, the staff, and the overall experience.As this is where the Atlantic and the Caribbean meet, the water is not as blue or calm as other spots. Expect a bit or current.Japanese Resturant is tops. Italian is Very good (stick w/ traditional pasta dishes) Buffet: great breakfast, other meals mostly good. Snack bar is good.Most staff extremely friendly and engaging. Some spoke ONLY Spanish, but hey, it's their language. Met interesting people from all part of the globe. Great atmosphere from casual drinks in the spacious lobby lounge to energetic shows and contests.Also know that while the resort is very nice, the surrounding area is mostly construction sites and a 3rd world town with a few places (nice mall, larger casino, some resturants) established. Also, no public transportation and taxis can be a little high. But do take a few of the tours.I'm sure some of the neg. reviews here reflect bad experiences but I'd also bet it reflects more on the reviewer.

<Content>Get your money's worth! Hi,Just back from 2 weeks away to this hotel with my husband and kids, 4 and 3.As the reviews on this hotel are very mixed, I would like to add mine to reassure anyone due to go there and offer tips where available.Flight out from Gatwick with First Choice was enjoyable, nice spacious plane, friendly crew and most surprisingly, good food served on board.Immigration at Punta Cana was fast and we were arriving at the hotel within 1 hour of landing.Were welcomed with a freezing and oh so good towel and a cocktail. Check in was swift, admittingly, not much information given by the staff but you get an info sheet on the services offered which you may want to read.Took us about 5 mns to walk to our block (5) where our room on the ground floor was thoroughly checked (refering to previous reviews). Our luggage arrived shortly after and within 30mns, we were in the delightful sea, warm, clear water.Note for grumpies: yes, there is seaweed on the beach and algae in the sea - big deal!Notes about room: The climate in Punta Cana is very humid and you will need to keep your air con on as much as you can bear, especially the first few days. The tiled floor gets very slippery after a shower.The sliding doors leading to the balcony can be tricky to close hence you may hear other people struggling with them at ungodly hours.Our cleaning lady was fab and our room was kept spotless ( I used to be a housekeeper so I know...) and she was rewarded for her hard work - please before you leave do not forget to pack a bag of cosmetics, samples.. and sweets for her.Super shower with hot water at anytime at all.Restaurants:The main restaurant or canteen as we liked to call it, is situated by the main lobby. Good choice of food, to the standard of other carribean hotels that we stayed at with special themed nights: chinese, dominican, italian..Service very slack at breakfast time - but a firm look should get things moving.There is another restaurant on the italian side of the resort where not many people go but we got into the habit to have breakfast there. Self service for tea/coffee. Staff was quite grumpy and avoided all eye contact but they were only there to clear up.Thirdly, there is a restaurant by the beach serving a buffet lunch and doubling as the Brasilian themed restaurant (good) at night.Attached is the Snack Bar where burgers, hot dogs and pizzas are made. The pizzas were quite good, the burger hit and miss (insist for a fresh one to be cooked).A La Carte Restaurants:Japanese - very good Spanish - also goodMexican - did not go but did hear negative commentsItalian - did not go and heard no commentsBars:Lobby Bar - good in the eveningsSports Cafe - lacking atmosphereLe Cafe - coffee house serving excellent coffeesBeach Bar - Open from 10.30am to 6pmPool Bar - Open from 10.30 am to 7pmThe service at the pool and beach bars can range from good to very poor, my husband had to help himself on a couple of occasions when the barman was on the phone for at least 10mns and ignoring queues forming.As I mentionned earlier, sometimes a firm look goes a long way and if you are being too nice, you might end up frustrated.A good command of spanish also helps.Please note that the main languages spoken in the hotel are Spanish and Italian as most customers are from spanish speaking countries and Italy. French is a close third and English is last.Shows:Only went to 2, but as in previous reviews, I would recommend the Michael Jackson show.Cons:The few problems we had were with some of the waiting staff rudeness but nothing that would spoil your holidays.Our biggest complaint was that the Disco (10pm till 2am), held in a separate building, closes on Fridays and the party is held on the beach. Block 5 being situated 20 metres from the beach, we felt the beds and walls shake with the bad sonos until 2am. No warning was given that this would happen and we were very angry, especially for our kids. We complained on the night and again the next morning but no satisfaction came out of it.Mosquitoes - I left with about 20 bites, first time ever but my fault for staying by the pool after 7pm.Pros:You will meet people that you would never talk to in your normal life and who knows maybe make new friends.First Choice Rep was lovely and friendly.The sun is shining, the sea and the pools are heavenly warm, the rum is flowing. Relax Relax.The environment is ideal with families with young kids.If you go as a couple. you will get bored and run out of things to say unless you take part into the activities on offer and open your mind to meeting new people.Lastly, enjoy the mamajuana rum, the dominican viagra apparently.Have a good Holiday. It is after all what you make of it!

<Content>We'll never go back food is ok and there's much choice. hotel is not well accommodated to keep the guests busy. you're quickly boared if you're not fond of reading in the sun all day. staff is not friendly. airconditioning makes a lot of noise in room 4408 and the guest service doesn't take action if you complain about that, not even after 3 complaints. some rooms have mold on the ceiling or walls. hotel got a new management and the name changed into Barcelo Dominican Beach without telling the guests. if you want quality, book another hotel!

Fridge stocked with Pepsi, 7up and water. 2 bed side tables, table and chairs inside and table and chairs on balcony. Air con with controls and separate fan 鈥?all worked fine. Safe $20 deposit and $20 per week.First week tried all the restaurants apart from the Japanese, Mexican was a buffet style starter than choice of menu 鈥?starter was good but mains seemed very bland. Waiters friendly 鈥?never seemed to have a empty glassItalian 鈥?No pizza! 鈥?but hey the pasta again seemed bland the steak was covered in gravy again I鈥檝e eaten in Italian restaurants and this wasn鈥檛 Italian 鈥?passable but not great again very bland.Brazilian 鈥?you go up choose the salad, rice, potatoes etc from the buffet style area then they come around with meat to the table 鈥?I personally didn鈥檛 like this but my better half did.Spanish 鈥?I couldn鈥檛 quite work this one out; menu seemed rather strange 鈥?for me again very bland.Main buffet restaurant near the reception 鈥?I had mixed views on this; the first week we were there it seemed 鈥渙k鈥?definitely a gearing towards the German/French guests with a VERY strong continental slant of the food. Breakfasts 鈥?you could always have an omelet made to order (I didn鈥檛 try this), yoghurts, freshly made smoothies (Very nice!), fruit, yoghurts then cold meats, salads, cheese and the hot buffet which again seemed to air towards the French/German/Spanish taste.. but there were when I stayed very few Brits staying there.The menu for lunch and evening to me seemed to be the same, I would echo the views of others that it is NOT a nice place at times to eat in the main buffet as it has open walls thus it gets VERY hot in there and it makes eating rather uncomfortable in that heat. Also the amount of food that is left out even though they are in/on chill cabinets is I feel not healthy, especially as lunch can start at 12:00 and still have people in there at 15:00.The second week of our stay the main menu in the evenings seemed to get worse from a British perspective 鈥?the slant seemed even more towards French/German style 鈥?but that鈥檚 my opinion. 2 bouts of stomach upsets and other Brits I spoke to also complained of upset stomachs. 鈥?I鈥檓 not that naive that you don鈥檛 get this 鈥?but from speaking to the few other brits there they ALL seemed to have got this 鈥?problem?.....The snack bar 鈥?Pizzas could be nice at time 鈥揵ut often undercooked (dough not cooked through 鈥?unless that is the style?!), the hotdogs 鈥?well what was the meat 鈥?was it meat?...You can guess I didn鈥檛 rate the food.The Caf茅 was good 鈥?good choice of Teas, Coffees, Hot Chocolate and smoothies 鈥?but why didn鈥檛 they have a menu up!? Good selection of cakes in the cabinet but I didn鈥檛 fancy the ones in the jars on the counter 鈥?I was there 2 weeks and I swear they were the same ones in there.The little shop was basic 鈥?fairly priced but ALL priced in Euros with an exchange rate of 1 Euro to $1.30.The pools seemed most of the time to be clean often being cleaned by staff.The beach was clean 鈥?often being raked first thing in the morning, plenty of litter bins etc and staff always tidying up 鈥?but why do people leave cigarette butts all over the place then complain the beach is dirty!!!! If the staff went around raking it up when you were sun bathing I鈥檓 sure they would then complain.The water was clear 鈥?warm like a bath and Hardly saw any beach traders wasn鈥檛 pesteredWeather was excellent the odd 10 min down-pour at night Staff were friendly polite 鈥?nothing stolen from room or damaged or lost.Week 2 saw the Barcelo (I think spelt like this) take over signed painted over and managers wandering around 鈥?but nothing seemed to change apart from I thought the food got worse 鈥?but hey that鈥檚 probably because I felt like crap I couldn鈥檛 face eating the food.Many people went on before we went about tipping the staff 鈥?I hardly saw anyone tip anyone!.The resort was always being cleaned/swept and gardeners in every day sweeping up etc.Never had a problem getting a lounger anywhere!Never saw an 鈥渋nflux鈥?at the weekends when the locals turn up 鈥?though on the plane back another couple said they suffered this at their hotel.My only comment 鈥?Brits be warned he food will no be to your taste, if you do go take a good medicine cabinet and forget factor 50 鈥?get factor

<Content>Pro's  We arrived in Punta Cana Sept. 6th and met by our driver with no problems. We thought great way to start. Off to Ocean Bavaro.Got into massive lobby and right to desk. Greeted with a smile and nice cold drink. Again no problem.They even took us to a Villa #67 before check in to see if it would be ok  all looked good at first glance so we were off to our rooms.The room was hot so went to turn on the a/c-BUT it was on and not blowing air-not a good thing, so called reception. After 3 calls and 2 trips to Reception -they finally came. Seems housekeeping turns units way down and on fan and unit was frozen. So after a defrost time and much water running into room we got cold air.This was at abt.10pm and I was able to unpack. Since I worked up a sweat I went to get a shower-BUT the towels in the bathroom were the only 2 towels and I had use them to collect a/c water on floor. So another call to reception and another and yet another. 2am a man knocks with 2 towels! Thats it ,no washclothes ,no hand towels, nothing.So I left a note for housekeeping with a small gift and some cash asking for more than 2 towels and washcloths. Off to the buffet for breakfast. When we returned-the note, gift and $ was gone and I got 2 towels again.I went to reception and asked for the extra and was told there was an issue in that area and they would get me what I needed asap. So I thought great and off we went to explore the resort.by dinner still no towels so back to reception and requested towels in Spanish so there would be no mistake. Nothing!!next morn. left a note in Spanish for housekeeing and cash and a gift -and we got 4 towels this time. That afternoon 2 washcloths.But she turned the a/c down and the room flooded and guess where the towels went........ and when I say flood I mean river from the a/c clear under the bed over to the closet. So here we go again -needing towels and leaving note to not touch our a/c unit and all would be ok.The food was not bad-ate breakfast in small buffet as it is cooler with the breeze in there. Big buffet is way too hot. Neither had a/c.The Brazillian rest. was not good in my opinion. The Japanese was good, The Italian was ok, the Mexican didn't like but thats my taste and again to hot in there. The pizza wa ok if you had nothing else, the hot dogs-not sure what meat they are so thats a no no. The hamburgers are not good either.The pools were ok-not real clean. The seaweed tends to build up on the beach. The vendors are very pushy when they are allowed in. The little store is expensive. The casino is ok-small. The coffee shop is good.The activity staff work hard at the shows at night-10pm. Didn't catch much in the daytime.Be very careful if you take a taxi and have a clear understanding of where you want to go and price up front. We wanted to go to an area just down the street and told price was $10. He went right past that to where he wanted us to go and refused to let us out of cab till we paid $35 to him. Being in a strange place and concerned we did pay him and walked back to resort and told them.Barcelo resorts took over while we were there and we saw alot of management about the last few days so I think there will be changes to come. I sure hope so. Would we go back... Never again. We will go to Puerto Plata where they welcome the tourist and treat you much better and understand you better.Bring lots of small bills-they never have money at desk and you need to tip etc.

<Content>My Dog "Bud" Deserves Better Than This Resort!!!!! I have traveled all over the Carribean and even have been to Domincan Republic before and loved it!! This is by far not decent enough for my yellow lab Bud!!!! We booked the trip through Apple Vacations and they knew I had been to DR before and stayed at the Iberstar Bavaro and loved it - how in the world they thought I would be happy with Ocean Bavaro is beyond me!!!!! I will NEVER use Apple Vacations again!!!!!!!!!!We arrived and DID NOT get put in the Block I had requested 3 months prior to going. We stayed in the new Block 100, which is a block farthest away from the beach. Upon arriving at our room, the key did NOT work and we had to return to reception for a new key. We were traveling with my boyfriends adult children and had 2 rooms. We requested the $20/US weekly fee for a safe key and again our safe key did NOT work. I called the front desk and was told it would be fixed manana!! That was Thursday afternoon. On Friday morning, I went back to front desk and mentioned it still was not working and was told they would send someone within the hour. To make a long story short, it never did get fixed and upon check out they did NOT want to refund my $20 or the $20/US deposit fee for the key (which by the way, when you return the key you ALSO have to return the receipt where you paid for the key, or your deposit is GONE)!!! I had to get VERY pissy with them. Although new block, don't expect much - a very SIMPLE room with no thrills. I did expect that but we at least we did have good A/C.The hotel is in NO WAY beautiful grounds to me!!! I don't know where these people have traveled to before, but it must have been down under (and I'm not talking about Australia)!!! The pool was more dirty than the ocean!!! There were TONS of locals on the weekends and they were extremely drunk and playing games in the pool and pouring their drinks as they stumbled around - VERY NOT COOL!!!!! Which by the way, they had NO PROBLEMS getting service - imagine that!!!!!!!!!! Then to top it all off, a lady took her son out of the pool, removed his swim diaper, returned to the pool and proceeded to clean his butt in the pool. Needless to say, we did not step foot in the pool after that, which was our 2nd day there - what bad hygiene!!!!!!!!!!!!! At this point, I thought maybe the Apple Vacations representative was my ex-husband's new wife!!!The main buffet was very average - no thrills there. We ate the 1st night at the Spanish restaurant and I could not even CUT my meat. My boyfriend then tried and he almost died at the toughness of the piece of meat!!! HORRIBLE, Bud's dog food would have been a better meal than this place. Our 2nd night was Mexican - not much better. At this point, I tried to get us moved to another hotel with no success!!!! We did finally get a decent meal at the Brazilian restaurant and had good service - WHICH WAS A 1ST SINCE ARRIVING AT THIS RESORT AND THIS WAS OUR 4TH DAY!!!!! Even the pool bars had horrible service. I was thankful that I speak a little spanish, because if not, THIS WOULD HAVE ADDED TO OUR HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AT THIS RESORT!!! If you plan to have American guests, I would think at least a minimum of 25% of your staff should be able to communciate in english - in my opinion of course.The beach was no better than Galveston, TX, which is NOT a compliment!!!!! I took my boyfriend and the kids to the beach at Iberstar Bavaro which is about a 15 minute boat ride and they were amazed at the difference. The beach there is crystal clear and way nicer!!!!!!!!Overall, on a scale of 1 to 5, I would rank this resort a -3!!!!!!! Do yourself and your traveling companion a favor and spend the extra money and stay in a decent place. THIS RESORT WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE - THE WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE EXPERIENCE FROM WAY DOWN UNDER (and again, I don't mean Austrailia)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Author>Traveler8703
<Content>A wonderful end to the summer!! Where should I start? First of all, i'd like to start out saying that i will give you some of the good and the bad... and the everything in between.My family and I arrived at Ocean Bavaro on the 20th of August, 2007 (Monday). We were a party of 14 (all of us had different oppinions on the resort - i will get to that later). Like many people have said, on the weekends the locals arrive so it is only natural that they check out on a monday afternoon as was the case when we arrived. This i found to be the ONLY frustrating thing about our vacation. It was very hot and the lobby was extremely over crowded. They did not have many people working at the reception desk to help the locals check out and help the new commers check-in. I would recommend checking in (or out) on a different day or on a monday evening (if you arrive on a monday). One of the ladies at the desk was extremely helpful. Her name is Alexandra. She made sure that our luggage was in a safe location, checked us in and told us that we could go eat at the buffet that is near while our rooms were being prepared. After lunch we went back to the lobby and our rooms were ready to go. We were walked over and our luggage was brought to us by two men who were very nice and pleasant.The rooms were very nice. We stayed in Bloque (Block) 5, which is near the beach. The only complaint about the rooms were that they got wet... Although the A/C worked wonderfully the floors would be a little wet. It was nothing to get upset or worried about especially since it did not make the tile slippery. Some people complained about the furniture but to be honest, you really only sleep in your room and shower. I'm sure that if you want to relax, you would go out on the balcony and read or just converse there. The rooms have a nice view and they are all peaceful. A negative, our keys did not work all the time. It was nothing that became an annoyance. We probably went to the front desk 3 times at most to have this fixed.I found that the food was excellent. We ate all 3 meals (except for one dinner) at the main buffet. Many people have said that one of the smaller buffets had bertter food to offer but as a meat lover I can say that the main buffet is fully stocked with everything you could possibly want and need - I had about 3 different types of meats per dinner each night, pastas, rice, vegetables, everything you could possibly want. Since we found the food to be fabulous, we did not go to the other buffet. We did try out the italian restaurant one evening. The food was good but i had the pasta - the same pasta that they serve at the buffet so it wasn't too exciting for me. A few of my family members had the filet mignon and it was very tasty. The only negative i could say about the buffet is that their breakfast was not as good as i thought it would be - this might be because i normally do not eat breakfast when i am home. But other than that the food was outstanding.I found the pools were beautiful, particularly the one by the Bahia restaurant. It was very clean and nice. People on reviews have said that one of the pools was dirty and nasty. This is only due to the fact that there are A LOT of palm trees so things fall into the water from the trees but you see men coming and cleaning on a regular basis to ensure that everyone is happy. And by the way, even with all the stuff from the trees inside, IT WAS NOT DIRTY OR NASTY!!The beach water is wornderful and warm, and the sand is amazing! Just what you would expect from the Dominican Republic. Again people have said, The beach is dirty.. This my friends is only because people put their cigarette butts in the sand, and even then it is not a disturbance. And the seweed... YES it exists, its part of the ocean. Nothing to be alarmed about!!! There is not that much anyway.The shows at night are awesome! The staff really works hard each night to give it their all to entertain their guests and they do an amazing job each night!! They really do. After the shows, the disco is open until 2AM where you can dance and drink the night away. I found this to be very fun! They try to play a variety of music to appeal to everyone! The entertainment staff can always be found at the disco after the shows trying to entertain everyone yet again!! They are all amazing hard working people and if could give them money or something to show them how greatful i've been for their entertainment then i would!!! The bar tenders at the disco are very nice also. There was one in particular who helped us every evening, and as bad as this sounds, I do not remember his name. He was however the older of the 2 bartenders. He always smiled and helped in any way that he could which made our stay even more pleasant.I absolutely enjoyed every aspect of this vacation. As for my family, they all, with the exception of 1, loved this hotel. The 1 that found it difficult was my sister. This was only because she has 3 children under the age of 5 so it was a bit difficult for her to travel from place to place with the kids. She found that with 3 kids the grounds in the hotel may have been too big but other than that she enjoyed herself and the kids had blast in the pool and beach all day!!The vendors... what can I say? They are a bit pushy and do get upset if you dont buy from them but you have to understand that they have to travel a long way to get to the hotel to sell their goods and they also need to make a living. I agree they could lighten up but please do not feel obligated to buy from them if you really do not want anything!!! Just walk away and everything will be okay.What I think I loved the most about this resort is their Dominican Night!! They have wonderful typical Dominican food and music. I have been to different places and hotels and I found this to be the best Dominican Night ever. The music was nice and lively and the people, like always, are so pleasant! And the beach party that follwed the show that evening (Friday the 24th) was nice. What more could you ask for?!? It was marvelous! On Saturdays they have what i suppose can be called an excursion. Some of the entertainment staff along with guests who sign up go to a club near by. I did not attend because the disco was still going to be open that night. I do not regret not going because it was the most fun i had at the disco and there were plenty of members of the entertainment staff there always looking to make people happy!I would LOVE to go back to Ocean Bavaro!!! I am actually thinking about returning in January for my 21st birthday in January!As a final note, I would like to say that I too, along with other reviewers, have been to different parts of Dominican Republic and stayed in different locations. Every place will have its good and bad moments - its only natural! So please take the time to read reviews carefully and if you do decide to go to Ocean Bavaro I wish you the best of luck! It is a beautiful resort located on beautiful grounds in a beautiful country and it is unfortunate that some people regret having gone there. I hope it works out for everyone and I LOVE OCEAN BAVARO!!!!!P.S.: Check out on Sunday the 26th was easy and painless!!!

<Content>GREAT TIME My Grandson, Granddaughter, wife and myself spend 2 weeks at this resort. At first the entrance to this resort looked uninpressive compared to other hotels we have stayed in the area, ( Bahia principe, Melia tropical and Caribe and the Fiesta) but the place grows on you. One thing that I liked is that it is an small resort compared to the other ones so there was not much walking to do. Wooho!We were put in Bloque 100 room 10218 ( one of the newest building ) and it was very clean and nice. Our Room maid was excellent!. We stayes for 13 nights and not once we saw the same show performed and we did go every night. We loved it and we are planning in going back.NOTE: During our stay we saw representatives from the Barcelo coorporation so do expect a new owner pretty soon.

<Content>For All Those Brits Out There..... Me and My girlfreind stayed at this hotel arriving on the 10th August 2007 with First Choice from Manchester.Flights very good however we did pay for the extra legroom,transfers as they normally are,it took about 30mins from airport to hotel.Hotel checkin,Met by a non-alcoholic drink upon arrival,Then all passengers were asked to sit down were we waited about 20minutes,this was a little confusing because we wondered what they were actually doin,however it was a whole flight checkin,all room cards were given to each party from that flight at the same time.so not to bad in the end.Right This is the worst bit of the holiday....please read.....Alert Bloque 7 room 7137 we were given.(i Used to work for Virgin Atlantic and have stayed in at least 30hotels in the caribean and sort of know the typical standard)The room yes was a typical standard,However the room smelt really really really Bad of MOULD be aware........of this room.Me and my girlfreind thought we would give it chance,However the next 2 mornings we were waking up our skin smelt of MOULD,Our clothes smelt Of MOULD it was really bad folks....I know its really humid out there however this was beyond no joke.The Changing room process,well my girlfreind speaks spanish and this is the bad news for those brits who dont speak spanish,it will be a very painfull process for you if you do not,because it was painfull for us and we spoke the language.It took 2 days and six visits to change rooms!!! Go strait to Guest Services next to the reception desk try and get the manager normal a lady....the reception staff are to busy to really care etc and sort of pass it off with a smile.WE CHANGED TO BLOQUE 100.....A BRAND NEW BLOQUE....yes furthest away from the beach still 1 minute walk,however like staying in a different hotel and very peacefull,the room was very light alot more spacier and a huge bed,plus fan and aircon...*****my biggest tip to all brits try and stay in bloque 100 in this hotel you will have a completley different to holiday to most other folk...****The beach is fantastic,even tho there is seaweed however it aint that bad and the beach is cleaned every morning...The pools nice but not the cleanest ive gotta say...ive seen alot cleaner...The food,well if you like puddings you will be well pleased its fab,The Spanish,Italian and Japenese are excellent.The Mexican and Brazillian I would give a miss....The Buffet food was overall good but try and vary were you eat so you mix it up.ala carte restraunts are booked at breakfast time.Breakfast was really good all you could want smoothies were great..english breakfast for all those dads very good.The Entertainment.....The Entertainment staff put alot of hard work into there shows however its all about them and there dancing really....dont get me wrong its very good,and there good,however alot if not the majority is just dancing and pretending to sing songs.The other down side is the theatre, is away from the main barsso guests were having to walk 300 metres to get a drink...not great especially for the kids,the humidity heat was incredible.the casino there in the hotel dont use it.its pants.Lecafe coffee shop 1 of the best things in the complex.very much like starbucks........Hurricane Dean passed through,beaches and some pools/bars were closed for 1 day other than that not to bad.Last word it is very humid and hot constantly in the dom rep be aware if you dont like constant heat dont go...Overall its not that bad if you get in bloque 100 or upgrade to a junior suit/caribean spa room.......I would say this was an average hotel.......Happy Holliday.....

<Content>Can't wait to go back!! Just like many of you I was nervous about my stay at Ocean Bavaro- especially with some of the horror stories written on here. Me and my girls were not sure what to expect but let me tell you- this resort exceeded our expectations! Our check in was smooth. Took maybe about 15 minutes tops. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We were checked into Block 5 - top floor with a beautiful view of the ocean from our balconies. Due to the reviews on here- I INSPECTED my room!!! LOL...I checked the beds, bathroom, and corners of my room and they were just fine! Our rooms were clean and spacious with twin beds.The beach is lovely! Yes there is some seaweed but it didnt prevent us from enjoying the warm clear blue water! There are enough beach chairs for everyone. The pools are big and clean. I'm more of a beach girl so I only spent one day in the pool and it was lovely- not crowded at all.The food was great! The buffet was always filled with numerous choices and everything I tasted was fresh and well cooked. The best waiter at the buffet is MARIO! He is extremely attentive and courteous. He was missed on his days off. You should ask for him- and I guarantee you top of the line service!Our favorite restaurants were the Brazilian and the Spanish. The italian was alright. The mexican was our least favorite. Unfortunately we did not get to go to the Japanese restaurant- maybe on the next round. The bars were always open with drinks- we favored the strawberry daiquiries- which of course were no way near the delicious daiquiries you get out here in NY but they were pretty good! The bottled water is safe to drink. Actually none of us got sick not one day...The entertainment was awesome! They work so hard to give a good show...I loved them. A nice variety of shows and events happened every night. Richard is the best MC ever and they were always around making sure people were having a good time- whether it be at the beach or in the theater at night. There is always something to do.The coffee shop by the lobby was good too! The best drink is the caramel mocha- very tasty. They close till 12am.The best thing we did was purchase a transfer service from the airport to the resort through Prieto Tours. We avoided any problems with getting to the resort and didnt have to deal with pushy taxi drivers. We also met with their rep at the resort, Cesar, who was a lovely person and informed us on all the trips we were able to take. He gave us tips and inside info that was useful for us during our stay. We did four of their different excursions. We went to Santo Domingo- loved it, just a very long day and ride!!!, Altos de Chavon- gorgeous place but didnt like the tour guide too much, Jeep Safari- awesome!!!! enjoyed this one very much and the Carribean Festival which was also a favorite! The people that work these activities are what make it enjoyable!We went on the resorts disco tour with Pinky- which was fun!! It was safe - keep in mind we were 4 single girls- but we never felt unsafe with the treatment and activities. The local club at the resort was ok...the dj wasnt all that but it was fun.Our housekeeper was a doll and kept our rooms clean and neat. We left her gifts and stuff to let her know our appreciation. One advantage we had was that we all speak spanish fluently. However, not everyone there that met us knew that so they would all greet us without expecting us to speak spanish- but a smile goes a long way. We were friendly with all the staff members and even took pictures on our last night with many of them. We came back home on 8/19 and we still miss Ocean Bavaro!One last thing- take cash with you....I ran out of money and could only access the atm that gave pesos not US dollars. So just make sure to take enough cash at hand. The gift shop in the resort does not process credit card payments and the resort itself exchanges US dollars to pesos but for a much lower value so in the end its not worth it. Take lots of suntan lotion because you will get tanned out there! Take more than one bathing suit and have fun. Enjoy yourself- you are on vacation!!!!! We hope to go back to Ocean Bavaro soon! Even after a 10 day stay- we were willing to hang around an additional week if we could! :0)

<Content>tips go a long way The grounds are lovely and the beach is excellent. the complex sits on the beach, where there is always a team of entertainers doing crazy stuff. we found that to get any quality of service it was necessary to tip. Particularly in the restaurant. Look out for a guy called Mario, a few dollars a day goes a long way. he's a nice guy who kept us swimming in coffee at breakfast and alcohol at night. He made our holiday special for us and treated us like royalty just for a couple of quid a day. lots of spanish visit this hotel and do seem to get preferential treatment, but dont be put off. Our kids 14 and 12 had a great time, we hardly ever saw them. They were free to eat and drink what they wanted when they wanted. The 24hr snack bar did amazing pizza's and here you could help yourself to soft drinks and tea and coffee. reception are not very friendly but most other people were. Some people suffered with tummy ache, but I drank and ate so did the kids and we were all fine.the monster truck safari and the carribean festival are two great day trips I would recommend.monster truck takes you into the mountains to discover the real Dom.rep and its people. This trip is a charity organisation and funs the local schools.Carribean festival, a catamaran take you out into sea where you snorkle with sharks and stingrays. First time snorkelling for me I was scared but its very safe and I enjoyed the experience. on way back boat becomes a party and rum and coke flows freely.I'd do both these trips again.

<Author>HUBBLES
<Content>Do Not Waste Your Money!!!! We arrived on Friday, August 10, 2007 to the Ocean Bavaro Resort and Spa in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We waited approximately three hours before receiving our first room, which was Room 5201 in Bloque 5. The air conditioner was leaking, floors dirty, beds too small, room smelled of smoke intensely and the furniture was in deplorable condition. The reason for having a non smoking room is the fact that my husband is a chronic asthmatic and this smoke filled room could trigger an asthma attack. There was a big chip in the tiled floor making the room look in very poor condition. In addition, the refrigerator was not working therefore all the water and soda was warm upon our arrival. The bathroom had water pouring down from the ceiling in two areas both by the mirror and the toilet area. Please note that we were a party of 7 and we needed four rooms to accommodate our family. After being extremely disappointed with our rooms and knowing this is not what we paid for, we spoke to guest services to have our room changed immediately. GUEST SERVICES decided to change our room to VILLA 6603, which was worse than Bloque 5. It seems this may be common for the Ocean Bavaro to move folks from one room to another and they acted as though they were doing us a favor. This Villa Room 6603 was again disgusting and in deplorable decrepit condition. The floors were dirty, the closets old and dirty, the bathroom moldy and not clean along with two windows located in the bathroom over looking the shower had no covers over them so, one could see into the bathroom. The furniture was old and not clean as well as the furniture being in poor condition. During the 24 hours in this room we of course did not have any towels or toilet paper unless we tipped the unfriendly maid or basically took it ourselves. I believe at one point I went to the front desk demanding towels and toilet paper. These workers could not care less about us and our requests. After feeling physically sick over this second move to villa 6603, where I was now away from my family who was still in their disgusting rooms in Bloque 5; I was even more upset knowing I had been moved to this horrible location and away from my family. I decided to speak with the Apple Vacations representative on site who set up a meeting with Mrs. Maroa Parada, Guest Services Manage at the Ocean Bavaro Resort and Spa. We met with her on Sunday, August 12, 2007 two days after our arrival to Punta Cana. At this time, my parents in Bloque 5 were unfortunately in a room where the soap dish fell off the wall, the air conditioner was not working properly, the beds were too small, the furniture in deplorable condition, no remote control and the toilet bowl that ran constantly. In addition to this, once Guest Services moved us out of 5201 in Bloque 5 they had the nerve to move my friend in that room and said they could not give her another room. This room was deplorable and she had to use the horrible dirty moldy unsanitary shower for two days. She had to shower with shoes on since the condition of the bathroom was so unsanitary and possibly hazardous to her health. We informed Mrs. Parada, the Guest Services Manager of the Ocean Bavaro Report and Spa the following items of disgust:飪楽HORTAGE OF TOWELS飪楬ORRIBLE FOOD飪楽HORTAGE OF TOILET PAPER飪楴O REMOTE CONTROLS IN OUR ROOMS FOR THE TV飪楤ROKEN AIR CONDITIONERS飪楴O STAFF TO ASSIST AND SPEAK ENGLISH飪楧IRTY BATHROOMS AND RUNNING TOILETS飪楴O RESPONSE AT THE FRONT DESK 飪楤ROKEN REFRIDGERATOR飪楽MOKE FILLED ROOMS飪榃HEN CALLING GUEST SERVICES 鈥?NO RESPONSE- OR TOLD SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO US BUT NOONE EVER DID.飪楻EQUESTED WAKE UP CALL AND NEVER RECEIVED IT.飪榃ATER BROKE IN SHOWERS DAY BEFORE LEAVING AND HAD NO WATER IN OUR ROOM TO TAKE SHOWERS-FOUND OUT ALL THE OTHER ROOMS IN OUR GROUP EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING.飪楽MOKE DETECTORS DID NOT WORK IN THE ROOMS-NOT EVEN ON WHICH MEANS NO BATTERIES WERE EVEN IN THE SMOKE ALARMS.飪楴O BAGGAGE HELP- HAD TO MOVE OUR BAGS OURSELVES THREE DIFFERENT TIMES.飪楻ESORT WAS APPROXIMATELY 800 ROOMS AND APPROXIMATELY 1200 GUESTS WITH ONLY APPROXIMATELY 300 STAFF PERSONS. 飪極NLY TWO GOLF CARTS TO TRANSPORT AND ONE GOLF- CART WAS BROKEN. NOONE TO MOVE BAGS FROM ROOM TO ROOM OR ACCOMMODATE MY FAMILY.Mrs. Parada worked with us and decided to move all four rooms and 7 people to the ELITE CLUB. This would have been our third move and quite exhausting to keep moving our belongings across the resort in the heat. We all moved to the ELITE CLUB ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 12, 2007 AROUND 2:30PM. The appearance of the rooms seemed slightly better however the bathrooms were still moldy and the service left much to be desired. I felt that I HAD TO TIP in order to get toilet paper, washcloths, large towels and water. This seems unacceptable to me as I already paid to be at the resort with all these included items. You would think being located in the Elite Club would have made our stay that much better but quite honestly this room was just a regular room and just as unpleasant and unacceptable. The same occurrences happened in the ELITE CLUB as the two rooms we had before. The list above covers the same horrible environment that we had all week long on our vacation.My husband and I noticed in Room 6311 of the Elite Club where we were residing that the air conditioner was leaking. We immediately called the front desk only to be transferred to Guest Services and then to be hung up on. In addition, the person who answered the phone originally claimed he could not understand me as I told him the water pipe is broken in our room. After being extremely frustrated I walked from the ELITE CLUB on the third floor to the front desk to speak with the manager at 1am in the morning to resolve this leaking AIR CONDITIONER. The next evening the leak got worse and now the room was flooded in the entrance way and I slipped on the water. After calling again to the front desk and having no luck with anyone to help me or understand ENGLISH, my father was able to find two young men roaming the property and they looked like maintenance men 鈥?they were kind enough to fix the air conditioner. This was unacceptable as I should have been able to call the front desk and ask for assistance and know that someone would arrive and fix the broken appliance. Please note NOBODY showed up at all which tells me that they never intended to help me and luckily my dad found those two men to fix it.OVERALL, This was a horrible time at the OCEAN BAVARO RESORT AND SPA. Apple Vacations should not be promoting this resort as a special to anyone as it is an unacceptable resort for anyone. I am putting in writing that I want a refund for all expenses incurred for this trip that is not what was advertised Apple Vacations. In addition, Liberty Travel should not be sending any of their clients/customers to such a place that is in deplorable condition. All expenses and incurred expenses should be refunded to my credit card for this horrific and unacceptable experience.

<Content>Don't sweat the small stuff! After reading some of the awful reviews, we were unsure of what type of place Ocean Bavaro was... we ended up loving our hotel and having a great time! The beach is just gorgeous...the water is the color of Windex cleaner!! The staff was friendly, tons of food and drinks to choose from. Our room was very clean, neat, and cool w/ AC. Was it perfect? No, but don't sweat the small stuff. We didn't have a remote control in the room and had to ask twice for one. The safe didn't work in the room and a guy had to come and replace the battery in it. The bars were a bit understaffed so service was sometimes slow. Please do not be upset with them, they are trying to do the job of 4 people. It's the new management, we hear, who is trying to cut corners. These are small things that shoudn't ruin your vacation. Please remember that you are in a very poor country with a laid back attitude. Things are quite different. If you are looking for an experience that you'd get with a NYC penthouse hotel room, this is not the place for you! However, if you want a beautiful place to relax, a beautiful beach/pool, and lots of fun activities for a great price, you will have a great time!!

<Content>Worst Vacation EVER Service, badRoom Condition BADCleanliness BADNo towels, staff inadequate. Pool area filthy. Poor quality food, actually pigs got better food. If you have a person you want to get even with for a dastardly deed, send them there. A/C leaking water from condensation. Had to change rooms twice. In addition there were 7 of us and had 4 rooms and all were bad. When calling with a problem whom ever answered the phone would say help on way, but no one ever showed up, so down to the desk and get into a fight. When moved required us to sign a document NOT TO SUE, but we will, except we'll go after Liberty and Apple. Furniture all beat up and broken, such as draws falling out and doors on cabinets broken or hinges pulling out. Only 3 bell men available and 2 golf carts to carry your bags, and 1 golf cart broken so the place only has 1 to use. Shortage of towels. Had to steal from carts. OH by the way we were moved to the ELITE SUITE, which was no different than a run of house room, except a little bigger with the same problems and dirt. All in all it was a DUMP, a couple of steps below a bad MOTEL 6

<Content>Mixed feelings We have stayed in the north before so we did have another hotel to compare with.At first thoughts of the hotel were excellent the reception and grounds are beautiful and after a small mix up with the two rooms we had booked we were reallocated rooms next to one another and they were both excellent and clean throughout our stay. The grounds are very big and it took us some time to work out where to go to find everything.As said in previous reviews there are 5 restaurants plus the buffet. We found the Japanese to be excellent, and made two visits to it plus the Mexican and Italian, we were a bit disappointed with the Spanish but perhaps we ordered the wrong things. We didn't go to the Brasilian. Unfortunately my husband and myself were disappointed with the buffet although our kids ate there every night. The food didn't seem hot and my husband was ill twice so you immediately wonder if it is something wrong with the food especially as it was luke warm.The hotel has 3 pools although we only used the one nearest the beach and the main one which has a pool bar. We enjoyed using it until the weekend when a huge influx of locals came to the hotel. A lot of people spent all day at the pool bar getting very drunk and again we started to wonder if this contributed to my husband getting ill. There didn't seem to be any control over what happened in this pool, ie some people eating pizza on side in pool.The beach is lovely and not crowded. You are guaranteed a sun bed but if you want one with a parasol you need to get up early. Our kids made loads of friends there who were lovely and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.We were a bit slow in finding the nightly entertainment as it is in a separate theatre but what we did see was very good. We went on one excursion the monster truck safari and I would thoroughly recommend it. It is excellent and well worth the money. Bring some gifts for the children in the villages, pens, small toys, clothes, shoes will all be very welcome and it is lovely to see their faces.This is a beautiful hotel and in fairness my husband was the only oneto be really ill so it may have just been the heat. The service however is not good overall which is a shame. Especiallyin the buffet restaurant where she could wait for ages for the staff to relay your table or offer you what you would like to drink which was frustrating. We did tip but it is hard to get a regular waitor/waitress as it depends where you sit.We probably would not go back to this hotel unless we could be guaranteed the buffet and service improved.

<Content>Horrible Experience I have been to several resorts in the Domincan Republic for I have family and friends in this country. I would always recommend vacationing in our country but......This is one place I will never recommend. Upon our arrival there our family a party of 11 were not greeted properly. We had to ask the bell-boy about four times for help. When we get to the front desk the staff was not friendly at all. We had to wait on a long line even though we had arrived 3hrs prior to check-in. When we got to our rooms the AC in our room was not working, there was hair in the tub and sink, the sheets on the bed looked worn out and had holes on the sides,and last but not least the bed looked as if was being pulled from underneath it sunk in in the middle. I called the front desk to ask for help and I was transferred to three different individuals. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told I would get a call back in two minutes......I'm still waiting.I called Travelocity which is where I booked this hotel. They had a hard time getting through to the hotel also. When the customer rep got through we were offered an upgarde to a Honeymoon Suite this sounded great!!! Wait it gets better we get to our section the Elite Club. The bell boy leaves our bags downstairs when we were assigned a room on the third floor. We get upstairs and the room looks good. When it came time to use our shower it leaked all over the floor I slipped and bruised my arms. The sink had a leak also. I didn't want to make a big deal of it for my husband had never been to Punta Cana before.I wanted to show him a good time I did not want to disappoint him. We came back after dinner and decide to walk on the beach that night. Trying to put past us the bad experience upon our arrival. When we tried to wash off our feet by the beach there was no water by the hose there. We decided to just walk upstairs and wash up in our room. When we opened the shower there was no WATER AT ALL!!! They had closed the main pipe down.I had to wash up with cold water from the refrigerator. I am normally a very easy going person and make the best of every situation. The staff here was not helpful at all. My family will also post their comments for they had other issues to deal with when they were transferred over to their suites. My sister had a leak in her bathroom from the upstairs bathroom. My cousin and his wife had no lock on the front door for one night and on top of that the room had condensation issues from the AC. They had a leak and the sheets felt so wet. We all tried to laugh about it and said let's just make the best of it. We are not uptight people believe me when I say this. I tried to have us moved us to a different resort all together. There was nothing anywhere else. We dealt with our rooms for 4 days. The food was not all that great. We were not even given a map or told where anything was disco,restaurants,cafe,bars,etc...We had to search for things on our own. I guess this was because we are Hispanics(Dominicans). It's a shame that they would be prejudice against their own kind. I just want to relay this message to them...Our monies are as good as anyone elses. We are born AMERICANS and successful in our country U.S.A. We love to visit because this is where our parents came from. It's a shame to leave with such a bad taste of what we call a friendly place. Hopefully your experience would be a better one. I recommened The RIU resorts totally different ambiance and friendly staff. SO SAD from Upstate NY

<Content>the good and the bad Just returned from trip to Punta Cana, we were there aug 3 to aug 10. The hotel was beautiful.. We didn't want any problems with rooms such as I had read about before leaving... We saw yoel, the apple guy when we got there and told him so. He got us our room in block 10. The room was beautiful. Cathedral ceiling... If you want to be close to everything stay in 5 but it can be loud and we had heard of lots of problems over there in the rooms, no ac no hot water. etc... we didn't have a problem with any of this...The Italians have there own section ifyou go Apple you can use there facilities. buffet, pool etc. The food was good for the first 3 days then everything tasted the same... Easy to get reservations at restaurants, ate at Bahia, Italian and hibachi, not our hibachi here in the states but it was good...Take the Sanoa excursion, it was beautiful.. and LOTS of fun...Get a room safe and be sure to keep the receipt, or they will not refund your deposit.. even with the key... We left 2.00 a day with candy and stuffed animals for the maid, and had no problems... No problem with finding people to speak english... my spanish is very limited and had no trouble w/communication. All staff except maids and security guards speak very well. We also took Safari trip, very nice but not enough time at Macaw beach only 45 minutes but it's very beautiful... The beach at hotel was nice, though lots of seaweed... Be sure to bring a pen to fill out immigration papers, you can get cigarettes for 25 a carton you can bargain for everything... Friday nites, they have locals in hotel selling their works..be sure to see the Michael Jackson show on Weds nites.. Very funny. shows were good but very warm in the theatre...if you want a chair on beach get there early about 7am if you want shade, no one bothers your towels, if you save a seat. be sure to bring plenty of sunscreen lotion etc, it's expensive in giftshop... If you go to beach you can walk down left to a small town, which is where the bike tour goes from the hotel... there is a grocery store and other shops... great bargains..also bring something for constipation, as the food there could cause problems... I'm sure I'm forgetting somethings, but if you go with an open mind and want to have a good time you will...If your expectations are not too high. very poor there, staff makes about 10.00 a day US. and they work from morning till nite...hope this helps

<Content>We had a great time!!!!!!!!! I have been back now almost a week after being at the Ocean Bavaro. I went with my sister and two friends and we had such a good time. The grounds to this place is huge we got a little tired from walking around but all in all we had a good time. Yes, the beach has a little seeweed but it won't kill you and then you have a huge pool which extends all the way to the other side of the resort. The food was okay we only got to go to one restaurant and that was the Japanese and it was amazing. The whole habachi theme was exciting and fun I even had food tossed in my mouth (smile). We went on the Carribean Festival excursion and when I tell you I had so much fun I still miss the entertainment staff, Eduardo and Jose. They made the 4 hours alot of fun. At night the staff is even amazing, they had a disco on the beach on Friday night. We danced until about 2am in the morning, fun!!! I definitely give this place 4 stars but I give the staff including our cleaning lady 5 stars. Don't listen to the uptight people who have gone and have not enjoyed themselves. It's definitely what you make of it. We would definitely go back, if you are planning to go please say hello to Richard and the others. Oh the only issue I would say is the buffet could have been better but I had no problem with the food. I just would have loved to have a really good burger because the burgers they had there were not good...We weren't sure where they get the meat. All in all we had fun and would definitely go back.

<Content>Don't expect too much and you won't be dissapointed. 1) The good. The room was clean, the beach was okay, you can get a reservation for any a la carte restaurant the same day and the food there is excellent.2) The bad. The food a the buffet was bad most of the time, there's loud music until three AM in the morning and the pool was dirty.3) The ugly. The service was so horrible, it's was frustrating.

<Content>Just an 'OK' vote from Wisconsin - would not go back  My wife and I just wanted a quick getaway without the kids and we read most of the reviews on this site. Some were helpful and some were not. Most people have different opinions about different things, so we decided we were going to form our own and took this trip.We are from Wisconsin and booked our trip through apple vacations. I am happy that we did that. When we got to the resort, we were checked in at the VIP table right away, while other guests were standing in line to get checked in. Also, if there was any problem at the resort, we dealt with the apple representative at the resort. This was a God send, because the lines at the front desk were long. We were assigned to Block 100 in the resort, which is the furthest from the beach, but we were told one of the newest. The room was fairly large with very little decor; no big deal to me, but my wife commented on that. Yes, the TV did go out a few times, the tap water did not work for part of one day, the drain in the tub was very slow, we were advised to brush our teeth with bottled water, but over all, the room was not bad.After we were established in our room, we took our trusty map of the resort and went for a walk to the beach. When we found the beach bar, I tried ordering a drink. I do not speak Spanish, so there was a definite language barrier. Finally I pointed at the Bahama Mama machine and asked for Rum. I think the bartender was as frustrated as I was. If I were to do this over, I would make a list of a few drinks and get them translated into Spanish so I could at least order some tropical drinks. If all else fails, the cervasa (beer) is pretty good: Presidente - really not bad. We decided to walk back to our room. It is a very large resort, and we tried following our map, but it did not have block 100 on it. We spent probably over 1/2 hour trying to find our room. While walking through the resort, we did smell septic system issues. I would not walk through any standing water that's for sure. This was very isolated, but when you walked through it, it did stink pretty bad. After we found our room, we decided tomorrow was another day, and we were going to keep an open mind in the morning.We went to the breakfast buffet - very typical of every other all inclusive, except there was never any diet pepsi: breakfast, lunch, or dinner; not a very happy wife over this (minor problem). When we got to the beach, it was very nice, and yes there was a little sea weed on the shoreline - it is more like sea grass. It is floating in the water also (one more minor problem). That is nature - no big deal, it looked like it was a clean beach every morning, and as the day progressed, the sea grass just built up on the shore. We ordered our Bahama Mamas with rum and were as happy as could be. We were told this resort is 85% European and 15% American. That sounds about right. If you want to find Americans, look for the orange bracelets: this is the apple vacation bracelet. Every once in a while you will see the French wearing them, but if you say, Hi, and they respond back, you know they are American. I never thought I would be so excited to hear the English languge.We went on two excursions: the Marinarium and Saona Island. The Marinarium is a party boat - snorkeling excursion. Not bad snorkeling - lots of fish and water clarity was very good. The sting rays and nurse shark were pretty neat too. Saona Island was beautiful, everything you would envision a tropical island to look like. The bus ride was 1 1/2 hours, but you drive through the country side and one city - this kept our attention. I would definitely recommend both trips.We met a couple from a different resort on the La Romana side of the island, and they said the waters there were calm like pool water and no sea grass. Saona island was just outside La Romana, and we did not see any sea grass and the sea was very calm on shore.We tried the Japaneese, Mexican, and Italian restaraunts and we like the Japneese and Mexican the best, could have done without the Italian - everyone has there own tastes though.There was a review posted about tipping. We brought a lot of singles with us. We were told maids made about $200 / month. We left a few dollars on the bed every day, tiped the bartender a dollar every visit to the bar, and left a couple of dollars on the table after eating. I think only the Americans were tipping. I honestly did not see anyone else leave a tip. To be honest with you, I think the workers appreciated the tip, but it did not give us any better service, so it is up to you. If you want to help them out, they are nice people, and it does make a pretty big difference in their life having a few extra dollars, but do not expect anything extra for the tips.In a nutshell, I do not think I would go back. The resort was clean, nicely landscaped, food was ok, the staff was nice, but I think there are better resorts with better waters in La Romana. I would also try to find a resort with people from our culture, the Euorpeans (Italians) did not care if you were wating in line for a drink, they would yell over your shoulder in Spanish, and get served before you. I am not a small man, and they still did not care - very rude.I would go back to the Dominican Republic, just not this resort or Punta Cana.

<Content>Mixed emotions This was my first all-inclusive stay so I don't have anything to compare it to. I did have an enjoyable stay here but we did encounter some problems. If you have high standards and are very picky then this isn't the place for you but if you want to have a good, relaxing for cheap this is the place to go. Despite the problems, I would go back again.Rooms: For two nights in a row, our toilet would not stop running. Our tv stopped working several times. The tv remote needed batteries. The toilet's flush handle fell off and we could not flush the toilet. We weren't given enough towels for the three of us in the room. One day my mother left a note and money asking for 4 towels. When we came back the money was gone but we did not get any clean towels. When we asked the housekeeper for towels, she said there was a problem in laundry and we finally got clean towels around 7pm when we all had showered. Other than all that, the room was fine. It is not like you spend a lot of time in the room anyway, just for sleeping and showering. We heard from other guests who had worse problems such as broken air conditioning and a leak in the bathroom ceiling that was streaming water. They also seemed to be having sewer problems in our building because for several days it smelt awful near the doors to the building.Inconsistency is the problem here. Some mornings we would be served coffee right away at the main buffett. Some days we had to wait for clean silverware and cups. Twice we were served coffee when we were almost done with our meal. If you go expecting fun tropical drinks, forget it. We got several completely different versions of a strawberry daiqiri. Once we got a good one and the rest of the time, it was nothing like a strawberry daquiri. At the lobby bar, they had a list of drinks and a list of drink specials so we figured it was safe to order a drink from the list. My father ordered a manhattan right off the list and the girl took the list and had no idea what to do. My father took one sip and threw the rest of the drink away. Some days we got 4 clean towels, some days we got 2. The housecleaning staff also kept setting our ac on the lowest temperature so that we froze to death when we came back in from the beach.Food: The resort has 5 restaurants that are included and you can make reservations for dinner the next night. I suggest you make reservations at there. I enjoyed the Mexican and the Japanese restaurants the best. The buffet's food was edible but not that good. I ate a lot of white rice and muffins. We were told there were 6 and 8 oclock seatings but one night we were kicked out from an 8 o'clock at the Japanese restaurant at 9 because there were a group of people waiting to come in. We ate at the Japanese restaurant twice. The first time was great. The second time, we did not get the same service, we did not get served soup like the first time, we were not offered coffee or anything before being asked to leave.Beach/pool/activities: The beach, the landscaping around the resort and the pools are very nice. There were plenty of chairs around the beach and pools. After it rained, the staff would sweep away large puddles from the sidewalks. It was kept clean.We did not do any of the activities such as bocce ball or mni golfing but every night at the show they awarded the day's winners a bottle of rum. If a child won, a parent had to come get the rum. Once a member of the activity staff invited my mother and I to do aerobics on the beach.Guests: There are people from all over so don't turn to the person next to you and make a comment in English because it's likely that they will look at you funny and walk away. We had some guests who came back from the bars/disco wake us up at 2:30 in the morning with their shouting and banging down the hall. We did meet some nice people and a guest who spoke Spanish helped us buy from vendors on the beach.Excursions: We took an excursion to Saona Island through Apple Vacations. It was a very bumpy hour and a half bus ride to the boats that take you to the island. My mother got sick from the bus ride but the bathrooms were atrocious at the site where you get on the boats. No seats, no doors, a lady handed you some toilet paper before you went in. We took a speed boat to the island and managed to avoid most of the rain clouds. The island was very nice. We took a party boat back and people were really enjoying the endless rum and cokes.Weather: It rained almost every day. Just for short bursts but they were sometimes unpredictable. There were a few thunderstorms too. We got soaked by the rain a few times while walking back from a show or to dinner.Entertainment: The shows each night were enjoyable. Below those of a cruise ship for sure but still entertaining. The entertainment staff was energetic but sometimes annoying. The music was sometimes too loud. The last night, people around us had their fingers in their ears.

<Content>Service was awful only good thing was the beach...... My family and I recently spent 7 days at the Ocean Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic between June 30th to July 7th. There were 10 people in our party.I've never written this kind of review before, but I feel so strongly about this that I had to so as to prevent others from having their vacations spoiled.I can honestly say it was the worst resort for service that we have ever encountered. I have traveled to Europe, the Hawaiian Islands, Mexico (Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Mayan Riviera, Acapulco), and Margarita Island-Venezuela and was never treated as poorly as we were treated at this resort.This was our first trip to the Dominican and it may very well be our last. From the moment we arrived we were treated as if we were an annoyance. Although we arrived early at the resort and didn't expect to be able to check in until 3:00 pm the front desk was not ready for anyone checking in. They were completely disorganized and left us waiting for 1/2 hour in line in the lobby while they looked for bracelets.They finally gave us bracelets, told us to go have lunch and then come back at 3:00 to get our rooms. We were not provided with a map of the resort and had to pretty much figure out where to go on our own. Since we didn't even have towel cards we couldn't even go swimming to cool down.We returned to the front desk at 3:00 only to have to wait another hour while they figured out who went into which room. We finally just asked them to give us all four room keys and we would figure it out on our own. They didn't have enough room keys for us nor enough towel keys and just told us to go to our rooms and come back at 5:00 when they would have additional card keys and towel keys. What resort doesn't have enough keys for it's guests is beyond me.When we got to our rooms we found that we did not have enough towels (in some of our rooms we had 3 guests to a room), we had no remote controls for the TV's, the reception on the TV's was awful and the safe had no key. When we went to the front desk to ask for a remote and a safe key, the charge for the safe was $20 plus a $20 deposit, but they didn't even have any safe keys to give us nor did they have any remote controls for the TV's, we were told to come back on Sunday afternoon after other guests checked out to get what we needed.On Saturday and Sunday the resort was packed. We later found out that this resort has weekend special's for locals. I don't have a problem with this, but then staff your resort accordingly so that all guests can be provided with the service they have paid for. I would have appreciated knowing this before having booked into this hotel. On Monday the resort was literally half full and the service was a little better at the restaurants, but the beach side bar was a joke. This bar was busy all day and they only had one bartender, yet at the poolside bar they had two bartenders, but the pool was empty most of the time.The service at the beach side bar was horrible. I recall waiting at the bar with my niece who is only ten for 15 minutes while this bartender served everyone around us expect us. I finally left and went all the way to the pool side bar to get a Pepsi for my niece. Maybe I shouldn't have worn a t-shirt that said Canada on it because this certainly meant you would get served last. People who spoke Spanish would just scream out their orders from behind me and they would get want they wanted first before I was asked what I wanted. Maybe I'm just a polite person, but I believe in waiting my turn, but when my turn comes I expect to be served.The entertainment was crude, rude and in very bad taste. The activity co-coordinators were very annoying and were only interested in picking-up the girls at the beach and not in the well-being of their guests.We had several days where the air conditioning broke down in all of our rooms and the rooms became so wet the floor was covered in water and the ceiling was dripping water as if it was raining in the room. In addition, my room was not cleaned on two separate occasions.The only really positive thing I can speak to was the treatment we received at the medical centre. My son got very ill, he was throwing-up for 18 straight hours. We finally convinced him to see the doctor on staff and she was excellent. She got him started on IV right away because he was so dehydrated and sent him by ambulance to a local private hospital. The hospital was great and the treatment and care he received at the hospital was fantastic. He spent a day in hospital where he was treated for an ameba (parasite) that he probably picked up from shaking someone's hand and not washing his hands before eating.I recognize that the first language spoken in the Dominican is Spanish and since I can speak Portuguese I can get around the language OK. What was very evident to all of us was how the people in the resort served their own kind first and then everyone else. Most of the staff spoke very little English, the vendors on the beach spoke better English then the people who worked at the resort.And just to add a little more salt to our wounds, on Friday, July 6th the locals started to arrive again for their weekend special, but the interesting thing was that they all got their rooms at 12:00 and yet we had had to wait until 3:00. This is also one on the days my room did not get cleaned, I guess they were too busy getting other rooms ready for the locals arriving.The only thing that made the trip bearable was the beach and the weather.

<Content>wonderful vacation!! Well Folks, after viewing so many negative reviews prior to my trip, i was nervous as all heck!! But my trip was better than anyone could have expected.  Check In: Fast, and on time ! we had to wait all of 6 mins. and we took advantage of that every second, while waiting at the cute lobby bar. Rooms:  This was the only negative, not because the rooms were ugly or anything, but because me and my best friend( who was my partner in crime the whole week) were taken to a room with no sheets, and no working light. That wasnt gonna fly with me! so we asked our guy (Elliot) who drove us to this room, to get us something else. Atleast a room with some sheets!! He made a phone call, and before we knew it, he was taking us to the Elite club!! thats V.I.P folks!  Food:  The Food was nice. Dont be afraid of gettin sick, if you take care of yourself and use good judgment, youl'l be fine. Eat your heart out, you'r gonna be on vacation!!! lots of meat for you meat eaters, and tons of veggies, and fruit for anyone on the eating light side. they even have a pizza bar open late for all the night owls. Bars\Clubs\ Entertainment: Now this is one of the best features of this resort. Tons of bars, if one closes down for the night, you just hop 10 feet to the next bar. the drinks were on the weak side, but we decided to do shots and other fun, strong drinks! its not a party resort by any means, but if you know how to have fun, you will be just fine. 3 pools, and they do close early. 7: o clock.  They had Shows and Fun everynight of the week! the animators are lots of fun during the day and at night. there is also a disco club for anyone who want to dance the night away! Police:  They are every where 24 hours of the day. i could not have felt any more safehere! They even protect the beach during the night, incase you want to take a late night walk on the beach. Beach:  Beautiful. Soft white sand, Tall palm trees. The Seaweed staff do a good job of cleaning everyday. The water is warm, and the weather is humid. not too hot, and of couse not chilly. Pack many T shirts and shorts. you wont need pants, and at night a nice linen shirt works wonders in the humid, windy night breeze Excursions:; We did the Santa Domingo trip. one fulll day of sightseeing. its worth every penny. You shop till you drop, Visit a old cave, explore the Christopher Columbus house, Take in the sights of an old cathedral, AND still have time to grab a bite to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe! 60$ We also did the horse back riding excursion for my 22 birthday! so nice and relaxing. 30 $  Staff:  They are all so kind, so helpfull, and enjoy being there. always throw a smile, and a how are you today, and they will go out of their way to assist you with anything. Guest:  Well i have to tell you the truth... alot of the guest were rude, dont like to smile and look like they are unhappy. I was having such a good time i naturally made friends with all of the fun folks. 60% European, 20% cuban/latino, 17% italian/ german/ and American. 3% african american. And thats very accurate. lots of newly weds, tons of family vacationers, and a wide range of young and old single daters.  to sum things up, it was a week of relaxation, Laughter and fun, an all around good time had by all!

<Content>Good and bad Background...Mom  2 daughters (14  16), 1st time to DR, have visited many Mexican resorts in the past, booked with Apple, we can speak Spanish, wanted to book a 7 night deal for less than 1,000 pp.Most of the reviews reflect what we experienced July 11-18.Pros...beach, not alot of walking involved, the plaza area outside the lobby with coffee shop, sports bar, and live entertainment, gift shop was small but very well stocked, book and magazine exchange, 30$ massages by the pool, internet also by the pool 5$ for 30 minutes with AC, vacation price (900$ pp including air from Chattanooga TN) .Cons...drinks, bartenders, rats, lack of garbage cans  ashtrays, cable tv down for 2 days, crowds of Dominicas on the weekends, all games are on the beach  none by the pool. I had to keep my eye on my daughters ALL the time, tuna and corn pizza at the snack bar, dated furnishings in rooms, the casino. Tips...take a float for the water (gift shop will blow them up). Donate your books/magazines to the game room by the pool snack bar. Use the coffee shop for breakfast when you are tired of the buffet. Take an umbrella. We might try the Dominican again but, we think it is difficult to beat the resorts that we have visited in Playa del Carmen Mexico. All of the other Apple visitors we talked to agreed. This hotel really lacked focus as far as the type guests it is targeting.

<Content>Which Resort Should I Choose? One of the funny things about these resorts was comparing their amenities with other travelers we met on excursion. Some people at different resorts got better perks, it seems, compared to Ocean Bavaro. Everything was cool but no one from any resort appeared to be in a hurry to do it again. Ocean Bavaro was a fairly good choice. I read the mixed reviews on this Web site and they're all true by my account and the ones I heard, but my agent said they're all negative. Not true! Yes, the food was good  plentiful. However, my girlfriend and I saw a cucaracha in the Japanese restaurant. Yes, the staff was helpful, but there was a un raton running around the lobby one night while we sat socializing. The drinks were free as advertised, but if they make them using the premium brands we all know, you have to pay. If you speak a little Spanish, you have an edge in communicating what you want. Ocean Bavaro staff are conscientious, but have a hard time understanding all but the simplest English phrases. The Guest Service office and your travel agent kiosk do speak English well. They would not switch our two full beds for one king. They only issue bath towels, not face cloths. I think maid service works its way from one end of the resort to the other, where our room did not get cleaned until afternoon, even with the please-clean sign put on the doorknob each morning. There are two pools: the big pool was warm, but could have been cleaner. I could not see beyond 6 feet with my goggles under water. They also need to clean that pool ledge more often; after all, it is one part swim-up bar. The workout room was sufficient It's the only thing in the spa building that's free. Everything else--I toured, but did not use--was not included. You would have to pay US$5 for sauna and therapies. Massages are US$30. The entertainment was tops. The performance we went to was energetic and very funny at times. I was advised to buy mosquito repellent: good advice if you're prone to getting bitten. My Ocean Bavaro dining favorites were the Italian buffet (a little hidden from view) and the Spanish restaurant. The Japanese restaurant, with the tableside chef, was fun and tasty--the sushi appetizers were dry (we went during the free-for-all, after reservation-time) and the chef was a little too generous with the salt. The coffee hut made decent cappucinos. If you have a sensitive stomach, be on guard. My girlfriend got sick every day. Our fellow tourists were friendly, some nationalities were more friendly than others. The beach is topless-optional. The beach's souvenir merchants were pushy. The canvas paintings they sell are not unique to them, nor are the sculptures and cigars. You may find them elsewhere for less. Ocean Bavaro's surrounding neighborhood looks like a ghetto, or as I call it, the hood. I saw this firsthand when a merchant walked me a mile to the most reliable cash machine--one, unlike the one in Ocean Bavaro, did not swallow my girlfriend's debit card. Nevertheless, the stories you read here are the same ones you'll hear from the guests. How should you choose? Read a few of the the good and the bad, but don't rely only on what your agent says, then go for it. I think you'll still end up satisfied.

<Content>We were not impressed....even though we are simple people!! Where do I begin. We arrived early, had to wait 3 hours but spent it at the Pool...which was refreshing. Grill food average for lunch.When we did check in....our room key did not work. We had to wait to be let in. Our room had two double beds....we are a married couple with NO kids....go figure. The ROOM was very cold...just like we like it. The furntiure was old.....but who stays in the room anyway...just to sleep and change clothes. THE BUFFET WAS HORRIBLE. But you are in luck...the Ocean Cana buffet is worth the walk over. We were also thankful for the many different restaurants. We went to them all. You have to get up early around 7 am to make your reservations...and you can only make 2 at a time. One for your current night and one the next night. So every other day....you gotta get ahead of the game. There is a restaurant down the beach....Captain Cooks....it is pricey but.........OH so worth it.....be....aware of Haitians along the beach...they will try to con you.....so be firm and never look back.The excursions were fun.....The outback safari was informatve and the day trip to Santo Domingo was HOT but historical. Book you excursions in the states....it is cheaper. Apple vacations will charge you higher at the resort.If you are there on Fridays nights.......AVOID the vendors....they are brutal haggers. If you like coffee or smoothies....YOU WILL LOVE LE CAFE...it was so nice and romantic every time we were there....try the Cararmel Mocha Frozen....and Smoothies.....Heaven!!!!!DO NOT USE ATM CARDS.........You will get them eaten up by the local machines.........So take Plenty of cash....american money is fine there. Suggest $1, $5, $10.Be aware in the Airport. Once you find your bags....unless you want to lose a few bucks....just find your way out and contact the person telling your what shuttle you will be on.....just tell them the resort you are going to....and they will tell you the bus number. Go out in the parking lot and the number is written on the bus and there will be an attlendent telling you if you are on the right bus.We are very simple people...but unfortunately we would not go back there.....if we had to....we would book the Ocean Cana right next to Ocean Bavaro...the buffet is nicer...and we were told the rooms are bigger and up to date. And you want to be sure both share the Restaurant usage.OH BEFORE I FORGET....IF YOU BUY RUM....PUT IT IN YOUR CHECKED BAGGAGE...OR IT WILL BE CONFISCATED.!!!!! I had to learn the hard way.

<Content>Europe on the Caribbean I spent a week at the Ocean Bavaro (6/27-7/4) with my adult son. After reading some reviews here I'd like to offer some perspective on the complaints I've read which almost scared me away from staying at the Ocean Bavaro.I asked for and received, at no extra charge, an upstairs room in Bloque 5 near the beach, ocean view. The rooms were very clean and I left my maid a tip each day which meant the one day I left the do no disturb sign on the door, I still got clean linens and refills on the water and soft drinks. She was very friendly and thanked me graciously when she found out we were leaving. There was a condensation leak in our ceiling but I noticed if we were in and out of the balcony a lot and not careful about closing the door tightly, it leaked as it was incredibly humid there. No biggie. One night the water pressure was low getting ready for dinner but so what?There is somewhat of a language barrier but I heard most guests speaking French, German and, of course, lots of Italian. The bartenders and the guy at the towel exchange spoke to these guests in their language so how many languages should they be expected to learn? I would say the ratio of Europeans to Americans was something like 85% to 15%. Also, some people thought there was an anti-American bias. I think service depended more on the color of your bracelet than anything. I work as a bartender so I know the VIP guests get the VIP treatment. Copper bracelets were the big spenders so they were always served first. I have no problem with that. Also, I've been to Europe several times and Europeans don't have the same concept of personal space that Americans do, so I didn't find them rude like some people did. Chalk it up to cultural differences.The buffet food was good but repetitive but there was no reason to be bored. We ate at the Spanish, Mexican and Japanese restaurants and all were quite good. We also ate at a restaurant called Capitan Cook's which is down the beach a ways to the left but you can get a taxi to take you there. For $110 American dollars we had a seafood dinner for two that could easily have fed four. That included taxes, tips and all alcoholic beverages. We got a huge lobster, some langostinos, lots of shrimp and mussels, mahi mahi and calamari. They make the best appetizer of homemade potato chips and bring a complimentary shot of Mamma Juana at the end of the meal and some fresh fruit which was delicious.The Cafe was Starbucks quality and free!Oh, and catch the Michael Jackson show while you're there, both my son and I laughed until we had tears rolling down our faces.For the price, we had a wonderful week in the Caribbean. The Ocean Bavaro is an incredible value for the money, and I found nothing to complain about during my stay.

<Content>Affordable but definitely not luxory I did not have a bad experience at the Ocean Bavaro, but I would like to share my trip to the hospital with potential guests. I became very ill on my fourth night at the hotel. I still don't know exactly what caused it, but I ate at the Spanish restaurant that night. My best guess is that I got a parasite from the garden salad served with goat cheese. The doctor at the hospital said it was common to get sick from unclean lettuce. I had a chicken dish as well. I guess it could have been that too. My advice is to avoid cold food that would have been cleaned with the local water. As for the doctor at the hotel, he was extremely kind and helpful. The hospital was very clean and I received very good care. After one night on iv antibiotics I was released with about two weeks worth of antibiotics and other anti-nausea medication. I was completely back to normal after about a week and a half. I also brushed my teeth with the local water which could have made me sick as well. So, be extremely careful not to ingest any water that is not purified. On our last night we paid the extra money for the lobster dinner on the beach. The service was great and it was very romantic. The food tasted good, but it did not sit well with either me or my date. It was the kind of meal you really wished you hadn't eaten about 5 minutes after you finished and for the next two days. I would not reccommend spending the $40 per person to have this meal.The rooms are satisfactory considering how affordable this hotel is. However, if you have a problem with average cleanliness, this is not the place for you. The tub and shower is extremely small and very old and not so clean feeling. Having a private balcony was a very nice point to the room.The entertainment is very fun, and the beach was just amazing.There is another buffet besides the main one. It is on the Italian side of the resort and it is 100 x better than the main buffet. I definitely reccommend it.

<Content>Priceless Experience!!! Just Great!!! Took my two sons Matthew and Nicholas and two grandaughters Cassie and Missy to Ocean Bavaro for seven nights...booked using an online service auction...got an ocean view clean room with huge jacuzzi tub and clean cold air conditioning...due to this being my fourth trip..i knew what room to ask for in advance:)What made our trip special were three things! One was the ocean..every day it was hot and the beach was clean and fun to be on with the girls, my sons and the people we met there! The 2nd thing that made Ocean Bavaro was our bartender at the beach pool...his name is Santiago or just Santy...tremendous..wonderful person who instantly made us feel welcome and who was our good friend there at the resort..if they-- Ocean Bavaro only knew to hire a few more Santaigos....who could not be happy!!! The third thing that made Punta Cana special was the Jungle Safari trip we took the girls on to see the countryside. We visited the sugar plantation and met the people working there from Haiti...as close to slavery as i would ever want to be....BUT I had brought from the USA..many things to give these people as we drove at a fast clip past their homes made of tar paper and card board....I had asked the guide...Michael to please allow me to give my gifts..I had an entire LARGE suitcase...to the kids there..so in a safe area he pulled over and we just sat for like one minute and waited and ..all of a sudden here are so many kids..I opened the suitcase and gave them Baseballs, baseball gloves I had bought at yard sales or begged from the baseball coach at home...baseball cards, crayons pencils, tablets and notebooks....yes candy..(forgive me)...soap, shampoo and toothpaste...my students had given me(I teach 9th and 10th grade us hist at Warwick High School)...so many happy kids....we left them all happy and i STILL had some more things in my suitcase and we went a short distance and saw a man on a mo ped..fishing with fish hanging from his cycle and hes carrying like four people with him!!! My guide smiled and said..watch ...and we stopped at the next farm..it was the fishermens house...and..he had TWELVE kids...out went the suitcase and we gave everything away....even the people on the safari trip were helping to give gifts to the kids..all of them got a baseball and a baseball glove..someday maybe we will see them in Philadelphia????So yes there are issues with the language..gee sorry you are not at Wildwood Crest, New Jersey...tqake a look at the water???---you are in a FOREIGN country..hello?????....there are one million motor boats that buzz the beach nearby..thats their life!!! They need those boast for transport!!!! The food? Wow,..it was great and like five or six different restaurants to choose from every day? What did you want more than that? Oh one more thing that made Ocean Bavaro special:) The Spa there is to KILL FOR!!!! A Massage for one hour or work out there...even out door massages....wonderful!!!!!!What made all this priceless you ask Maurice? The sixth day on the beach little five year old Missy Blose comes up to grandpa..(thats me Maurice) on the beach and says..Grandpa...we are going to stay here! Everyone else can come here and visit us..ok? Finally please say hello to Santiago at the bar by the pool and tell him he is a great friend and missed by Maurice, Matta nd Nick!!!

<Content>Save your money We just got back this past weekend and for the first time I have never been so happy to be home from vacation. The beach vendors spoke better english than the hotel employees. The two semesters of Spanish I took in college only got me so far. Had my boyfriend not been multi-lingual we would have had a real problem. When we asked for an iron, we were told they were all broken. One of the pipes broke and the whole outside of our bloque smelled like raw sewage for days. I lost count as to how many times we were without water and the night before we left, the hot water shut off in the middle of my shower. The bufftet was average. The meat looked a little suspicious but the rest of it was ok. The service was absolutely awful. I live in NY and have gone to both upscale restaurants as well as holes in the wall and have never seen such poor service. Most of the wait-staff was very pleasant, or so I assumed because I could not understand what they were saying. I think that they were just so understaffed that they did their best. The pools and beach were beautiful, the grounds well maintained, just lovely to look at but not someplace I would ever return to.

<Content>Amazing Trip and Beautiful Resort Well, this trip was my highschool graduation present from my family. I went with 14 other people all between the ages of 17-25. Reading some of the reviews here before going, I was shocked and very afraid. It was to be my first trip and the resort sounded like a nightmare. However, it was totally the opposite. I had the time of my life. The grounds were beautiful and very clean. The resort was huge and all facilities were kept clean and in order. The buffet food was good but the a la carte food was delicious! My favourite was the Japanese and the Spanish. It seems that many people complained about the staff but personally I had absolutely no problems with them. In fact, I became very close with and spent a lot of time with the entertainers/animation crew. They were very funny and always kept me and my friends smiling. The rest of the staff such as bartenders, cooks, waiters etc were also very nice. People complained about that fact that many do no speak english but they should remember that they are in a different country and it is difficult to be expected to know so many languages since tourists are coming from all over the world. Even if they didnt speak english, they were always pleasant and I foundways to communicate with them anyway. The shows were great and the clubs were so much fun. The entertainers always kept things very lively. The best entertainers were Richard, Pinky, Isaac and Peppito. If you go, find them, very funny guys. The outside club they took us to was also sooo much fun. It was $10 US to get a ride there and back, entrance to the club, and first drink. The beaches and pools were beautiful and there were always activities going on on the beach. The rooms were very clean and air-conditioned. I had no problems.they were cleaned everyday and drinks were refilled. Our tv had over 60 channels but we were too busy to use it.I would definitely go back to this resort. The place itself was beautiful but i have to say that the tourists and staff made this trip very memorable for me. To all those that complained, honestly, when you go on vacation, your supposed to relax, not find little things to pinpoint and complain about that are really irrelevent and ridiculous such as seaweed. Keep in mind you are in another country so the lifestyle is different. Be open minded and relax and you will have a great time!

<Content>Good time, but average resort We've been to other carribean places, but this was our (my husband and myself) first time to Punta Cana. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations. Overall, we had a good vacation, but would probably not return to the resort.FLIGHT/AIRPORT - The chartered flight was fine(but the snack for purchase was horrible). Shuttle from/to the airport was prompt with no problems.RESORT (GENERAL) - we found the resort to be nice, clean, and friendly. People were constantly cleaning up and for the most part and the staff was friendly (in spite of the language barrier). Except for the front desk, most of the staff do not speak English so if you speak Spanish, Italian, or French, it can go a long way. My high school Spanish was really out of date but I managed to say a few words here and there in Spanish and was able communicate with the staff. The resort caters to a lot Europeans so everything is in Euros, etc. There is a whole section of the resort that is dedicated to Italians. The week we were there, lots of groups with young Italians. This is what we found frustrating at times: for the most part, we did not find the Italian guests to be friendly or even considerate of others. They smoke everywhere, even if you've been sitting at the couch before them they came along. They cut in front of you at the bar without regard to you being there and politely waiting your turn. Fort the most part, we shrugged it off as difference in culture and tried to have a good time. ROOM- Ocean Bavaro was clean and nice. We stayed in block 5 (had a good view of the beach from our balcony). We thought the room was clean and properly furnished. We paid tips everyday for maid service and they gave good service. We did not find the rooms to be musty or smelly. Overall, no complaints on the room.RESTAURANTS - Buffet was okay, A La Carte Restaurants were better. We enjoyed Spanish and Italian restaurants the most. If you are a meat lover, Brazilian restaurant is a good place to eat. Japanese restaurant was too salty for my taste bud (and very not Japanese).BEACH - was wonderful, clear warm water. There are some seaweeds but nothing to really bother you.ENTERTAINMENT - the light show was nice. the people seem to put alot of effort into the show and it was nice but most of it came across as an amateur talent contest.WEATHER - We stayed a week in the middle of June. Some showers but they were sporadic. The water was always warm!For English speakers (especially Americans), I would recommend a different resort.

<Content>Loved the Beach but don't feel the same about the resort Booked this because it was a cheap getaway for a few days. Four of us from work spent 4 nights. It was my 2nd trip to Punta Cana but my first to this resort. We didn't arrive to the resort until late in the evening (with no luggage--all 4 missing until next evening). Upon arriving my first impression of the lobby was how nice it was. Our room was in building 5, which was a prime location to the beach. The 4 of us are in our 40's  50's  I guess when we planned the trip we didn't think ahead that because of it being such a good deal that many high school kids would be there. Our room was very musty  our luggage after returning is still being aired out  may have to be disposed of. I guess we got used to the smell while there because we didn't realize the mustiness until we were sitting on the airplane onthe way home...our cloths smelled horrible. The food was just average..nothing special. Although our Apple representative was extremely helpful alot of the staff need to learn that a little smile  friendliness could go a long way. The 4 of us put together $30 each for our tips for the 4 days..many times we didn't use it because the bartenders/waiters didn't deserve it. All in all, we had a good time because of the great company we kept but the resort is definately below average. I read other comments  wasn't sure what to expect  since we were only going for a few days, it wasn't such a big deal. I do agree with the previous comment that the frozen drinks weren't frozen...they rarely were..I even ordered a bloody mary one day  watched the bartender make it w/out Vodka! When I asked for Vodka, it was like putting him out. I really feel like they didn' tlike Americans at this resort. Although the grounds are nice, the crowd of people were slobs  left a mess every day. I saw mice at night walking around. The food wasn't anything to write home about...the Italian was my favorite but the service there was horrible. The coffee shop was great. If you like to gamble, don't get to excited about the casino...it's a joke. The dealers actually smirk when you lose. I was glad this was not my first trip to Punta Cana but it was for my friends. I stayed at Melia Caribe  the two resorts can't compare. I would not return back to Ocean Bavaro again.

<Content>Had a Blast! We booked this stay through applevacations for 6 nights at an amazingly low price. Apple reps are all over the airport so we were promptly picked up and taken to this hotel which is not that far from the airport (~15 min). Upon arriving we checked in and were given a room in building 5 w/ ocean view. I had emailed the hotel a few weeks ago requesting building 5 or 6, as the are next to the beach. The hotel GROUNDS are beautiful, palm trees everywhere very lush. The hotel has a tennis, basketball court, archery, ping pong/pool tables, 3 beautiful pools 1 w/ swimup bar. It also has a sports bar, coffee shop, and 5 restaurants in addition to the main buffet located next to the reception.The BEACH is beautiful. You'll see...We did the kayaking which is free and had a good time. We ate at all 5 RESTAURANTS, it's not difficult to get reservations if you are flexible w/ the time and where you want to eat that specific night. Our favorite was the Italian and Japanese, followed by the Spanish. The main buffet offered good food too, dinner always better than lunch there. THe brazilian restaurant by the pool turns into a buffet at luchtime. It has less selections than the main buffet but very good views. Right next to it is the 24 hr pizza place w/ pizza and hot dogs, burgers, drinks.The hote has TOUR OFFICE next to the main pool. ENTERTAINMENT was good, the night shows were nice, and the contests w/ audience participation were hilarious. On tuesdays and fridays the show is at the main plaza next to the reception instead of the theater. The entertainment staff is always cheerful and very friendly. the hotel has a DISCO CLUB above the mexican restaurant. During the weekdays there weren't that many people but on the weekend it was PACKED and i mean PACKED so we had a blast. You also have the option of going to outside clubs like Mangu and Tropicana which the entertainment staff organizes. We didn't do this. There are activities throughout the day organized by the staff i.e archery tournament, beach volleyball,etc.On fridays there is a BEACH PARTY, but also sometimes they have music and drinks and bonfire and the beach on other days. We took the SAONA ISLAND excursion tour and had a blast. The speedboat ride was amazing, and the sandbar in the middle of the ocean w/ starfish was incredible too. You also drive through the town of Higuey on the way there. We paid $80 and thought it was worth it. That was the only tour we did.In general, we thought this hotel was a GREAT value for the money. We had an AMAZING time (my husband and I-we're in our 20's) and would love to return especially w/ some of our friends and family.

<Content>Worst hotel experience ever!!! We stayed at Ocean Bavaro for a few hours before we were so disgustedthat we went to another hotel. We arrived around 12pm and our rooms were not ready, so we decided to find a place to eat. The buffet was the only open restaurant and the food was disgusting. We then decided to try some frozen drinks- again disgusting and NOT frozen! We are not normally people who complain about service/cleanliness and are not picky, but I feel compelled to warn people before they waste money/time on Ocean Bavaro. We proceeded to the pool area and after walking around for a half hour trying to find towels (none of the staff speaks English, so communication is impossible) and went for a swim in a dirty pool thatwas filled with unsupervised children who were purposely splashing us as the parents laughed from the sidelines. The beach provided moreunsavory behavior, with a near naked couple lying on the same beach chair in front of their small child. On the walk back to the front desk to check in at 3pm, hotel staff was cat calling us and we also witnessed hotel guests crowded around taking pictures of a wedding that was taking place at the hotel. We were told to wait (along w/ 50 other guests trying to check in) and our room was not ready until 4:30 (supposed to be ready at 3pm). After we finally saw the room (dragged our bags by ourselves), we knew it was time to leave. There was pubic hair on the bathroom floor, glass ring stains on the bathroom sink and the front door lock was broken. I鈥檝e traveled all over the Carribbean and Mexico and have never felt unsafe as a 20 something single woman. I felt very unsafe at this hotel, and was uncomfortable staying there. After expressing this to guest services,we were told they did not have a phone book and could not make outgoing calls!! We complained about the rude staff and the Ocean Bavaro guest service staff never even asked what happened or apologized. We had to purchase $30 in calling cards to speak with Expedia (who told us there were no available rooms in all of Punta Cana) and have the hotel charges reversed. I called the Melia Caribe Tropical (I had stayed there on a previous trip, and knew how great it is) and they immediately offered us a room at a decent rate. We finally arrived at the Melia and had a great, relaxing vacation. Whata difference- Pleasant, respectful staff; great food  drinks; clean rooms/beautiful grounds; and socially acceptable guests! The pictures and descriptions of this hotel are completely inaccurate. I have stayed at nicer Motel 6鈥檚!

<Content>Had a great time Me and my fiance just got back from our 2 weeks holiday at the Ocean Bavaro.Quick note: It was our second time at this resort in 2 years.I'm not quite sure why people complain about some of the smaller things like, seaweed on the beach????? or that other guests (no matter what nationality) are abit rude, does it matter? ignore them, you're on holiday, anyway you remember those you make friends with not those that you dont. Although May is known as a rainy month over there, the weather we had was great, yes it rained but only a couple of evenings. I brang an umbrella and I'm glad I did cause if it rains around dinner time then at least you can get to the restaurant or buffet without getting totally drenched. Cause believe me when it rains over there it chucks it down.The entertainment staff are fantastic, they're great with kids and they really make an effort with you.I found all the restaurant and bar staff really attentive and friendly.I dont speak Spanish only alittle French (which helped at times) and Fluent English but I learnt a couple of phrases in Spanish and it's appreciated. If you've got a problem or have a request the go to reception because they speak English.The food at the Spanish, Italian, Japanese and the Bucanero (seafood place- the only one you pay extra for) is fantastic, generous portions, tastes great and again the staff are great.Le Cafe is good too, all different types of tea, coffee they have biscuits, cakes, smoothies, iced coffees aswell. Our favourite was the Cafe Mocha. The cleanliness of the resort is very good, the pools are cleaned daily, the pathways swept daily, the restaurants and bars were always clean.The last time we went to this resort it was February/March time and the weather is good then but the resort is very busy at that time of year. This time round going in May/June the resort was alot less busy, which was quite nice. Age groups, nationalities etc are varied there so you're never on your own.All I can say is it's great value for money and like many others I would return.

<Content>Ecellent Currency  accommodationBooked the Ocean Bavaro Spa  beach resort as a 50th birthday present for my wife. Having little knowledge of the Dominican Rep I was alittle concerned as to the standard of service, as everything I read indicated that there was a big difference between the star ratiung as compared with the UK. I was advised by the travel agent to take a combination of US dollars  Dominican Curreny paso, wrong. My advice is just to take the US dollars, as everything is priced  quoted in dollars. We arrived late on Thursday the 17th after an uneventful flight. I booked only a standard room through First Choice (they only have rooms on the ground floor of this resort). As it was my wife birthday I decided to get an upgrade  luckily they had the honeymoon suit available for an additional $420 (拢210) which I payed (you should haggle !) . I was not disappointed. The room was excellent, overlooking the beach on the second floor with a jacuzzi.FoodThey have several resturaunts for you to choose from, Japanese, Brazillian, Spanish, Mexican, Italian. I found the spanish to be the best of them, ensure you book an early seating (18:00) although all resturants except the Brazilian I found to be of a good standard.Snack BarThe snack bar, is the main eating area  has a wide selection to suit most palets. When you first visit the snack bar, make friends with your waiter  try  find out if they will be on duty for the rest of your stay, if so give them a good tip (couple of dollars)  keep on going back to that area of the snack bar, you will always get excellent service as soon as you arrive.Cafe BarYou must visit the cafe bar which serves an excellent range of coffee,  is very cool in the evening, try the Mocha its excellentThe BeachEnsuring you get shade on the beach will require you to get up early circa 07:00  do as everyone else does  put your towels on the sun lounger of your choice, there are not very many canopies to take shade so if you have young children  want to stay on the beach all day this is a must. If you like to get involved with the beach activities sit close to the DJ stand  they will pull you into every activity they do, from the Samba, beach games, beach darts  a whole host of other activities.Things to Check Before You BookWeather, check you are not booking in the hurricane seasonDon't book an expensive room, try  upgrade on you arrival, please note you may not be successful, but it is cheaper to upgrade on site.Beware of the guys trying to sell you holidays, its not as good as it sounds.ExcurtionsI went on the outback safari  was surprised at the level of knowledge  passion the guides have for the country. Its an excellent trip  well worth the money. Deep sea fishing at $109 circa 拢55 was good although there is no gurantee of catching as anglers will know, but it is exciting ^ if you get a take, it is amazing.I was told that a visit to Saona island was well worth the mony although there was little or no shade on the beach, so be aware.SummaryI would recommend the Ocean Bavaro Spa  Beach resort anyone looking for a relaxing holiday, with no stress, good beach  with I think is an excellent choice of food. The evening entertainment is Ok with the entertainment team working very hard to make you stay enjoyable, its a place I will be re-visiting !

<Content>Poor Service, Economy Resort We just returned from a trip to the Ocean Bavaro in Punta Cana. The price was great, $530 for 3 nights, from St. Louis. This was the grand total, and included everything. The beach and landscaping were great. The food was very average. The a la carte restaurants had very limited room, and were closed on some nights. The Japanese restaurant was the only really good food we had there the entire time. At the Spanish restaurant, our reservations were for 8:00 P.M., and we received our food at 10:00 P.M. The service at the resort was horrible! I do not think that the staff likes Americans. There were other U.S. guests at the hotel who said that same thing. The cook at the pool side snack bar sneered at us when we asked him for a hamburger, the waitress in the spanish restaurant gave us a dirty look when we asked her for some wine, and the girl that took a la carte dinner reservations in the daytime was not friendly at all. The last morning there, our friend had her foot on the chair tucked under her at the main buffet, and the waiter with the bad complexion came over and slapped her on the leg for her to put her foot down. There were numerous people at the resort who had problems with their rooms. We lost power all day in our room. Two other couples complained of their rooms flooding, one couple complained that their ceiling collapsed from the room above them flooding, and one couple stated that they had no air conditioning in their room for 2-3 days! We tried to borrow an iron to iron our clothes, and they told us that they did not have one. We had to beg and plead to borrow an iron, and we finally got one. Pants are required in the a la carte restaurants, and pants get pretty rinkled in suit cases. There are no alarm clocks and t.v. remote controls in some rooms, and we requested a wake up call from the front desk the last morning, and never received it! The guests there were mostly europeans, and they were mostly rude. They would cut in line in front of you at the buffet, and would not step to one side at all when walking towards you on the walkways. I would move to my right when approaching them, and they would not kindly move over an inch, forcing me and my wife off into the grass! The staff at the resort spoke little, if no English. My wife and I have been to the carribean at least 9 previous times, and this was the worst resort that we have been to.

Be careful, the sun is very strong and u can get burnt very easily. the is a beach party once a week . they have many activities by the beach in the morning and afternoon. POOLS: they had 3 pools! the main one was huge with a swim-up bar. the pools were always clean!STAFF: all of them are very friendly. some people wrote on the reviews that they were rude but i think they are making up stuff. we would even hang out with the staff at night when their shift was over! we had so much fun with them, amazing people!Overall this resort was GREAT. i dont see why some people complained. i would recommend it to everybody!!!!!!

<Content>Better than others i've been to I stayed at this resort from February 10-17. For a four start resort it wasn't bad, but i wouldn't give it anymore than that.FOOD: Food was good, there was always a variety that changed from day to day. During the day there were 3 buffets, in the evening there were 2 and there were 4 a la carte restuarants. There was also a 24hr snack bar which always had pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers. We only tried the Italian restaurant and it was very good. The operating hours of the buffets were actually off compared to what the brochure said they were, it said they opened for 6 for dinner but didn't actually open till 7:30. But i must say they did have fairly long hours.STAFF: staff for the most part were good. It helps that i speak basic spanish. For those who didn't speak spanish, french or Italian i could see them having a hard time. Staff was also good by not demanding or constantly sticking out their hands for tips. Maid service was good, they would always leave fresh towels and arrange any clothes that were left out neatly to the side.BEACH: Beach was amazing and gorgeous, but packed. Go early if you want a lounge chair.BARS: There are tonnes of bars, and the liqour is always flowing. They are very generous with the amount of liqour per drink.ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment put a lot of effort into their performances and they could be quiet humerous. There was also what we thought was a second entertainment pavillion. Turns out it was, but it was strictly in Italian. There is a Vera Club located within the resort which is a group of Italian tourists that have a portion of the resort to them, they even have their own Entertainment staff. You are able to join them, but it's of no use if you don't speak or understand Italian. They also have their own water sport equipment and life jackets, so make sure you don't accidentally use them, we did this and they were not very pleased with us.EXCURSIONS: There are plenty of excursions to go on, and they are all very entertaining especially the 4 wheeler excursion and the 4 runner tour, but be warned bring money with you because they are not cheap.We also liked the fact that there was a town nearby. We took the bicycle tour offered by the resort which is free and they took us through the little village, it was quite interesting. Also the nearby village is connected down by the beach and you can walk through. Just be forwarned, when going into town, or even for a walk down the beach line, you will be harrassed by the locals selling things... my favourite line was hey Canada, no pst, no gst.ROOMS: well this is where we were frustrated and annoyed. The first room they gave us was in block 99 we put our luggage in and then went back to the front desk to get a saftey depost key, when we got back our key card wouldn't open the door, so we went back to the front desk and then they re-programmed it, we went back and forth 4 more times with the door still not opening until they finally sent someone to fix it. The next day after breakfast the same thing happened. Luckily we were on the ground level so we left the sliding door open so we could hope in through the balcony if it happened again, and it did. The room in block 99 was also very damp and musty smelling no matter if you left the windows open or the air conditioing on. We complained again about the lock and they sent another guy out to take a look at, after about 2 hours the guy finally showed up and said that the lock was broken and we would have to switch rooms. Sick of the non-sense we made the man call the front desk to explain the situation directly. Front desk said they would send the bell boy to pick up our luggage in 15 minutes to transfer us rooms, needless to say it was 3 hours before he showed up. We got transferred to block 98 which is directly off the second smaller pool. This is also the block that belongs to the vera club. This room was 10x better and came with complimentary rum and fruit. We did have a problem with having no water but only one day for about 2 hours, and the only reason we noticed is because the toilet wouldn't flush. 2 days after being in this room our t..v. quit working. We went to front desk to tell them and they brushed us off saying that the satellite wasn't working we would have to wait. I knew that what he was saying was bull so i got a maid cleaning a room on our floor to let me try the t.v. to see if it was working and it was, i went back to the front desk fuming and nedless to stay within 20 minutes we had a brand new t.v. delivered to the room.Overall besides any situation we had to involve the front desk in we had a great time. Front desk is not helpfull at all, they actually make situations worse which is odd considering they are the only ones that can speak proper english.Our second last day we got a call from the front desk saying that they had over booked the hotel and were offering certain guests to transfer to a 5 + star hotel for their last days stay, bavaro paid for the accomodations, as well as gave each person $150 american per person just for taking the offer. Needless to say we took the offer and were transferred to the Melia Tropical Caribe. It took us 2 hours to get settled there because Ocean bavaro were late confirming the arrangements. Once we got settled it was definatley worth it. The hotel was AMAZING. Next time i'm in the dominican i will be staying at the MELIA CARIBE TROPICAL. It made the Ocean Bavaro seem like a 2 star.

<Content>Perfect Visiting Punta Cana and staying at the Ocean Bavaro was the best vacation I could have ever taken. My boyfriend and I have five children and needed to get away so we could connect. Staying at this resort was the perfect place to do it. The room was great and if we needed something at 2 am they were right there to help. We always had fresh towels and hot water. And the beach had beautiful white sand and the ocean was a beautiful color of blue. The food was also good you just have to order the right thing. If you don't like what they have go to the buffet and you can pick about anything. I would suggest to anyone to eat at the Bucenero. It is totally worth the $40.00 a person for all the lobster you get. I just want to say that we had a great experience. The entire staff was there to help us with anything. The only thing we really didn't care for was the included spa features in our package like a massage and a facial. We got a pat on the back and lotion rubbed on our face. We didn't feel we got what we payed for there. All in all it was a very relaxing and beautiful vacation.

<Content>Best Vacation ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed a the Ocean Bavaro from Feb 11 for 7 days. It was the best trip I have ever been on. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. Our room was a five minute walk to the beach. The view from our room was this little pond with a gazebo and also had flamingos in it. Unlike some other reviews there was absolutely no smell at all. The food was great the buffets were my favorite...also the japanese restaurant was amazing.Also the 24hr food stand had the most amazing pizza. The staff was great. We loved them and have never been treated so well by all the staff. The beach was gorgeous there was a little bit of seaweed but nothing that would bother anyone. The beach was pretty clean. The water was turqoise and the sand was white. We also went on the ATV trip and that was lots of fun we got to see the town and went to a quite beach. I have traveled alot and have never wanted to return to a resort as much as this one. I recommend that everyone go to this resort.

<Content>Some Good Things, Some not so Good April 11-15 New Jersey This is our third trip to Punta Cana, our first trip to Ocean Bavaro. We had a nice time, but some improvements could be made. First the good, the beach is beautiful and the water inviting. The weather was terrific the whole time we were there. This resort is a 4 apple so it wasn't up to par with the place we previously stayed. The room is average, definitely no frills. No coffee maker, no tissues, no remote, some leaky ceilings in the bathroom. The toilet had a leak, but they fixed it promptly. The Mexican restaurant we really enjoyed as well as the Japanese. The Spanish restaurant was not good at all. The buffets were average to below average. The employees didn't speak much English, but we managed. We go for the beach and water so we had a great time, but we do like good food too since we are paying for it. We will go back to Punta Cana, but not this resort.

<Content>Very relaxing and fun vacation place My name is Paul. I went to Ocean Bavaro April 2nd through the 9th. I was with 4 other guys, it was our Spring Break time... My over-all expectation of this resort was great. The resort, beach, water, and scene is great. No complains about that. You have a breakfast in the morning, lunch in afternoon, 24 hour pizza, burger, hotdog shack. At night you go to Dinner of your choise. People get up around 8am to make reservations for 6pm and 8pm. But you dont have to do that or wake up early, just show up at any dinner place around 9:30pm without reservations and they'll sit you down. My top 2 places to eat was the Japanese Hibachi place and the Brazilian place was delicious. If i had a choice, i'd rather come there with my girlfriend or wife instead of just a bunch of guys. Because there are not so many singlegirls there. And if there is then they are not English speaking. Majority of the people are from Canada (French speaking only), Italy,France, Germany. Was a bit hard to find someone English speaking but we managed. If you arrive there in the morning, you will have to wait till 3pm to check in and get a room. Me and my friends spoke to someone there to get us a room right away (around 11am) and to add an addition bed AND get us a room in the building closest to the beach. We got it all, and all gave $10 each ($50 altogether) as a tip for that service. As far as tipping for drinks and etc it was a bit weird. Me and my friends were like the only one's tipping for drinks, no one around us at the bar or anywhere else gave any tips. Then again we rarely got a thank you or a smile for tips as if we just gave them blank paper or something. The food over all was just OK. Nothing too crazy good. Our typical day was like this: Get up around 9am, get breakfast and go straight to the beach, tan and swim in the ocean while drinking Rum and Coke's(Which were off the hook, they give you anything you want, you can even order straight liqour as much as you want). then after a few hours we all went to the swim up bar. Sat in the pool while at the bar ordering more drinks. The entire vaca I was mostly buzzed, which was awesome. At night we get dressed and go to eat around 9:30pm, followed by going to the theater to see a show..then go to the disco place. Also bring OFF the anti-masquito bite spray or anything for the bites. I was covered with bites like crazy. They opened up a casino there the last 3 days we were there and only had Blackjack and Roulette there which was ok. If buying anything from Souvenire or Gift shop please do most of it at the resort because if you think you will go to the airport there before leaving to save money on Duty Free or Gift shops there, you will not find anything or save much money. If you want to know anything else, please dont hesitate to email me. Thanks all!

<Content>Had an awesome time This my 2nd time here w/ my sister and it was awesome. Check in was quick we got there around 6pm. We stayed from 2-19/2-28. We got to experince canival time, we learned about the history of Indepence Day. Alot of the workers remembered us from last year. This time around we went with more of an open mind. You know when you go to another country you kind of limit yourself to alot of things because of other things you here people say. But I guess that all depends on the person. To start off with the animation team are wonderful, they are so freindly, they make you feel welcomed. Same goes for the other staff members, a simple hello(hola) makes them feel real special. They're shows have gotten better. There grounds have also improved as well adding a couple of new things. The maid was such a sweet heart always adding special touches to our room. You read alot of these reviews and some of the things that people complain about are kind of stupid. This is a 3rd world country these people put a lot of effort to please people. Go with an open mind, relax , have fun, your on vacation.

<Content>Wonderful vacation! Never wanted to leave.... My husband and I stayed at Ocean Bavaro March 28-April 2. Everything was perfect from the moment we stepped into the lobby. We had a honeymoon suite in Bloque 5, right on the beach. Our room was beautiful and everything worked just fine. The wind on the beach was quite strong during the time we were there, but it is so beautiful there. The beach is clean and the staff work very hard. This was our second time at Ocean Bavaro and we try to go back as often as we can. The buffet isn't bad - not as many spices as we like here in the US but you can always find something you enjoy. We also had massages on the beach everyday for $30 US dollars each (1 hour!!). Please do not let the negative reviews keep you from enjoying this resort. Keep in mind, you are in a third world country - they work very hard to please you and want you to enjoy yourself. The resort is wonderful and you will not want to go home!Steve  Lori EssmanLawrenceburg, Indiana

<Content>The Good, The Bad, The Ugly We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro for our honeymoon, and it had it鈥檚 up and it鈥檚 downs: The Good: The beach was great. There were a good amount of chairs (we went in the offseason) and the sand and water were very nice. The pool was also very cool as it was very big and a lot of places to lay out. The restaurants were very nice and top class. There are 6 to choose from, and we were able to go to one per night. The food there was great, and we never got sick from it. The buffet was a little subpar. There鈥檚 plenty of food to choose from, but it gets a little old after a while. The show was also pretty cool.The Bad: We stayed in a Caribbean Spa Suite. Although it was spacious, there were many problems in the room. The ceiling leaked, and when they came to look at it, they simply drained the water and didn鈥檛 fix the leak. Getting hot water in the afternoon was a crapshoot, and the locks were broken. This could happen with any room though so I鈥檓 sure they鈥檙e not all this way. Other than the room, there isn鈥檛 too much that was bad. There are plenty of activities but we never knew where they were. The Ugly: The staff was horrible. First, if you don鈥檛 know Spanish, you may have a tough time. With our package, we were given 30 free minutes of Internet, and it literally took 3 days to get that from Guest Services. When I finally got it, I waited in a room while the staff talked in Spanish about me behind my back. We were also given free use of the spa facilities for the day, but when we got there, they said we had to pay. They say that tip is included, but they expect you to tip every time. If you don鈥檛, you鈥檒l get scowls left and right. Lastly, one day a week they invite vendors to come in and sell their products. Do not go near them. They鈥檒l suck you in and pretty much force you to buy something. Last but not least, half the people that go there are European, so you鈥檒l definitely see some topless women (which could be good, but could be ugly), and men in Speedo鈥檚.

<Content>Paradise. An Excellent Hotel with an excellent staff to match!! All that I can say is WOW!. This hotel is by far one of the best if not the best resort that I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. Let me explain.....I stayed there from March 25th to March 30th /07and my brother and I were greated with nice drinks from the door. I know that is normal in the hotel business but the way they did it they did it with style and class. The hotel staff was extremly polite and was very attentitive to our needs. They welcomed us with open arms. The only problem that I had with the hotel was when we first checked in our A.C. did not work that night so our room was extremly hot in Bloque 8 but we delt with that for that night and even then it wasn't a big problem because the woman in the customer service office right by the front desk (I forgot her name but she was a very very nice woman I guess she was a front desk manager) had no problem switching us to another room which was in Bloque 7. The A.C. worked extremly well in that room. Room 7226 it was to be exact. The room had a nice pool view and I was just amazed. Okay enough about the room being that I didn't stay in there long enough. The beach was clean and filled with white sand.The water was clean and blue. Most of the guys that try to sell you an excursion was cool but evry now and then there is one that didn't take no for an answer. But after me telling him I'm just here to relax he respected that and went on to the next guy .One of the most coolest guys that I had met there was the bartender Pedro. This guy could make a drink and he also give you service with a smile and he would try to talk to you in english the best way he could but still keep working in the process and will not mess up your drink. But luckily for me I'm a African American that speeks spanish a little so we were cool. Thank You Pedro for showing us a good time while we were there.Another gentleman that we had met was Leonardo.He was one of the recruiters that you will see when you get there. Very nice guy , professional and just plain cool...Leonardo thank you also for your hospitality and looking out for us on a daily basis. Leonardo would give suggestions to my brother and myself on what to do and totell us about the other hotel poperties. This gur was nmot rude or too pushy if we didn't want it he knew how to step back and change the subject without getting on our nerves. Thanks again Lenardo!!!!!Even the housekeeping lady was excellent , the massage women were nice to talk to as well. And guys don't be cheap tip anyone that is servicing you keep in mind our dollar goes a long way and they really appreciate tips no matter how small or large.Take care of Pedro and his crew.I cannot see how people was talking very bad about this place. I'm quite sure the people that had something bad to say about this place had to have been......how may I say it?mmmmm......very irrate people themselves or their competitors.The whole hotel treated us like stars and I like that.!!Two thumbs up Ocean Bavaro and I'll see you soonChauncey Shearin Bloomfield N.J.

<Content>Winter holidays in the sun The room was spacious and tidy, the meals were what you can expect with a buffet style: enough food, but without any spices, and little variation. Of the special restaurants, we appreciated the Japanese very much, even just for the show that goes with the meal.The beach was clean, but very noisy in the centre (calmer at the edges). The only sailing boats are hobbycats, which you can only have for one half hour a day!The shows were very noisy and amateuristic, the internet connection 5 times more expensive than in the nearby hamlet.The archery is done with prehistoric material, only one hour a day, you may hardly shoot 10 arrows each!We disliked very much the fact that the resort is partly reserved to an Italian club.You can make trips inland from the resort, e.g. to Higuey and Altos de Chavon: very nice.

<Content>Excellent Vacation! My husband and I and two other couples just returned from the Ocean Bavaro and we had a wonderful time.Just to clarify things about Ocean Cana and Ocean Bavaro. It is one big resort. The Ocean Cana side is a little quieter. We stayed on the Ocean Bavaro side, which was more lively. I read quite a few negative reviews about the resort but we had absolutely nothing to complain about. The resort was just right. It wasn't too big or small. There was adequate entertainment/ activities and the food was very good. There are three buffets. The main buffet had the most variety but the one on the Ocean Cana side was good too. We tried the Italian, Brazilian and Japanese a la cartes. They were all very good and if you went hungry, it was your own fault.Our rooms were in block 2 right by the lobby and main buffet. It could get a little noisy but nothing to get to hung up about. We sat on the balcony and people watched. It was quite entertaining at times. The rooms were pretty basic but for the amount of time we spent in the room, it was just fine. We had hot water all the time, our patio door did lock and the safes worked.The beach was absolutely beautiful. There were always lots of chairs. Although, if you wanted a cabana, you had to get up pretty early and put towels on the chairs. The beach was quite wide, so you had your choice of where you wanted to lounge. We sat by the bar and entertainment mostly.All in all, I would say this hotel was one of the best ones I've been to and would definitely recommend it. So, if you're concerned about bad reviews, take them with a grain of salt and keep an open mind. Remember, you are in another part of the world.

<Content>If you want a five star service, stay in a five star hotel. I'm not going into detail as I feel the holiday me and my partner went on , we got what we paid for.The staff work as hard as they can, can you blame then if they seem a little tired, they work for 拢22 a week 52 hours a week!The rooms are simple, you only sleep in them, if you spend a lot of time in your room, don't bother going on holiday.The food is pleantyfull, if you don't like the look of whats offered, don't eat it, it's a buffet, eat something else rather then moaning of being sick.The hotel grounds are beautiful, we watched three weddings while we were there. The falmingos, peacocks and ducks are a great touch.Checking in and out of the hotel is fine, if somebody offers to take your bag, politely say no. Thats all you have to say.Shopping is great, don't be afraid to venture out of your hotel. A simple no is acceptable and they will leave you alone. If you don't feel safe going out of your hotel, they bring the local market into the hotel twice a week.If you don't smoke and don't like people smoking near you, move a bit further away. Not every single person in the hotel grounds smokes. People are on holiday to relax, if they want to smoke they will, if you don't smoke, just move, you're on holiday, chill out.The cleaning staff as as friendly as they come, if you have valuables keep them in your suitcase, common sense. Dont panic, relax and remember your traveling to a third world country which operates differently than England. All I can suggest is please do not visit Manati Park, the dolphins are wild captured dolphins, overworked, ill and very ill treated. 13 dolphins died last year due to the poor conditions. One of the lovely ladies who works in the coffee shop told me they are in the process of getting shut down due to the disgusting conditions the animals are kept in. If you decide to go, remember you are only putting you money in some carless guy's back pocket.

<Content>It all depends on your expectations About us: Middle aged midwesterners, have travelled to Jamaica and Cancun, 1st time in Punta Cana. I took my fiancee here Feb 21st thru Feb 28th. We knew that this would not be perfect, but for a thousand bucks per person for seven nights it sounded OK., and it was.Don't set your expectations too high or you'll be disappointed. I think that's why you read so many negative reviews. I would probably not go back, I'd spend more money next time and go somewhere nicer, but we got what we paid for, and if this is all you can afford it's not a bad gig.So here's what I think...Getting there went smooth, as most Apple trips do. Check in also was fine. The room was a little disappointing at first, but we just reminded ourselves that we did this on the cheap, and we didn't come to spend time in the room. Our room was clean, but very outdated and blah, no color or wall hangings,. Who cares? The safe worked (extra 20.00), the locks worked, the a/c worked (but it was noisy). Think of it as a 49.00 per night room at the Red Roof Inn, no frills. One minor annoyance was not getting clean towels every day, you sometimes had to ask for them. DON'T DRINK THE TAP WATER!The beach was beautiful, better than any we've seen anywhere. Every morning the grounds crew are out there raking up the seaweed, bagging it and hauling it away. It's fantastic. The ocean is great too. Watch out for the under current if it's wavy, it can pull you out to sea. I recommend staying out of the ocean if you can't swim as the bottom really drops off in some spots. Other than that the beach and ocean is perfect. The food is hit or miss, but mostly miss. They have 5 restaurants, but they aren't really much better than the buffets. If you have trouble getting a reservation to a certain restaurant give the hostess your room number and a 5 dollar tip and tell her to look for an opening for you. Tell her you'll stop back in an hour to check. She will find a cancellation that you can have. It worked for us. Don't bother eating at the Brazilian place, the food is horrible, especially the meats. This was the worst, the Japanese was the best. The buffets are pretty bad too. When you read about the food being terrible, believe it, that part is undeniable. The drinks also leave a lot to be desired. Most tropical drinks we ordered sucked. They somehow figured out a way to screw up a Pinacolada. They only use the cheapest rail booze. If you want call or high call liquor it costs you extra. They only have one beer, Presidente. If you're the type that thinks beer is beer, then you'll be ok. But if you like quality beer, you'll tire of these fast. There is no night life here, and no real entertainment. They had a band playing in the lobby bar one night, otherwise they had some guy playing a keyboard on a stage on the courtyard. We were back in our room before 11:00 every night. In fairness there is a disco, but we didn't go there. It would be nice if they had a couple more bars open until midnight with different bands. The stage shows sucked too. If you're from the USA, good luck trying to find new english speaking friends. We did run into a few Canadians, but most of the guests were European. Lots of Italians and even more french. We really felt like minorities there. No problems with anyone, just can't communicate with them. If you can't tolerate Europeans, don't go here. Maybe all of Punta Cana is like that? As far as security, they do have a lot on the beach, but not on the resort. We never felt like we needed it though. We never felt like we were in any danger, although I did keep an eye on my fiancee when she went to the bathroom, etc. but that's just me.Overall it's not as bad as some make it sound, but we've had much better, at a higher cost. We do not feel like it was a mistake, we had a blast. Your vacation is what you make it. If you're a spoiled snob go elsewhere. If you're budget is tight go here and enjoy all the positives it offers and do your best to ignore the negatives.

<Content>Ready to go back My husband and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro February 11 thru February 17. We booked this trip for our 25th wedding anniversary and we have NEVER vacationed like this before, not even our honeymoon! Yes, there were a few snags at check in, but we were there to relax and enjoy and eventually everything was taken care of. We found the staff to be most accomodating and apologized up and down for the inconveniences. One thing I do advise, upgrade to a Carribean Spa room. You are considered VIP and do get better treatment. You need to hook up with one of the staff when you check in. Give them a nice tip and they will take care of you for the rest of your trip. We didn't have to wait in any lines to make reservations at the restaruants. You will be in block 6 which is very close to the ocean. The 2 weddings we saw take place, are right there off of block 6 on the beach. You have to realize that this resort hosts a wide variety of nationalities. You just have to get used to other people's cultures. It's so beautiful there, the weather was absolutely perfect, don't let the little things bother you.We didn't try the Mexican restaurant. The Italian was just OK; the Brazilian was our favorite, went there twice; the japanese was fun and the food was good. We did room service one night and it was very prompt. We ate breakfast and lunch at the main buffet and there's something there for everyone. My husband has a queezy stomach and he did fine. If you're worried about getting sick, just be careful the first couple of days. Water pressure is a problem, especially late in the afternoon when everyone is coming in from the beach. You just need to time it right and you'll be fine. The a/c in the room worked great. I'm so glad that I didn't let of the negative review get to me before I went. Just keep an open mind and RELAX.

<Content>Have been to better This is going to be the worst review that I have ever written about Punta Cana as it was my 6th time down. We are the type of people who make a party where ever we go. We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from January 29th - Feb 05. Check is was a nightmare. Knowing ahead that we would have a 4 hour wait for our rooms (12 of us went - wedding anniversary) we had a nice lunch and walk. We went back at 3 and waited over 2 more hours for our room listening to other people say that they were even shipped off to other hotels the previous day because they were over booked. I had contacted the hotel before hand explaing that one person in our party did not walk to well and needed to be as close to the beach as possible. He was in the furthest building and it was like pulling teeth to get him moved. We were moved to block 5 with ocean view but the shower knob was broken, the safe did not work, but we did not care. In comparison to the other beaches surrounding this resort, yes, it is very nice. BUT, I have seen nicer in PC. There is NO snorkelling right off the beach off the resort. Reading previous reviews I was hoping this was wrong as we like to snorkel every morning after breakfast and were not able to do. It is ALL stired up sand, no matter how calm the wind. We did have beautiful weather every day, only 20 minutes of rain the night of the Superbowl.The staff are unlike anything I have seen down there. The animation staff were great!!! Bring them candy and you will be their best friend. Most of the bar and resturant staff had no personality and we are used to becoming best friends with everyone down there. We are the type of people that drink with the bartender, get him drunk and take over his job while he tries not to fall off the bar stool laughing his head off. There are SO many rules here for the staff they cant have fun.The resturants are all good. We usually dont do the a la cartes but for some reason we did them all here and preferred them over the buffet. SHOPPING: Here is the best tip I can give you with 6 years of shopping there. If you go to the beach and turn left you will walk about 10 minutes and come accross a BUNCH of shops, all who run onto the beach to bug you non stop. BUT . . . . . . . .SHOPPING  IMPORTANT: IF, you go to the beach and turn RIGHT, walk just past block 6, (through the volleyball court) literally, and you will see 1 shop there only. They have everything you could want, the prices are WAY better and they are really nice. If you see a lady there in her late 40's, she owns the shop. Please tell her - the girl who bought the small GUITAR and gave her pizza sent you. She is so nice and one of the nicest shops I have ever been to. She does not speak the best english but she usually has someone there who does. Everyone in our party shopped there and I know more people would if they knew about it. Everyone just thinks they get the better deals if there are more shops to chose from but that is not the case. The pool bar is rowdy but fun, usually someone dancing on the bar.Could not really find a place to hang out at night to party like we usally do. Not a lot of english speaking people vacationing there.Cigeratte smoke EVERYWHERE. (except the a la carts) Even the non smoking in the buffett stank. I am not a person to lay on the beach for more than 30 minutes a day but could not find a place where it did not stink of smoke.Play the all games on the beach that they do twice a day, if you win you go on the stage for a bottle of rum. The games are fun, especially the cooking one. Even if you dont feel like it you will be happy once you played.The bike tour is fun, very short but interesting.I am sorry if I have discouraged you. Things that bothered me may not bother you but I am not usually bothered.

<Content>A common sense review After reading the reviews for weeks prior to our visit Feb, 18 -23, 2007 it appeared this resort was either paradise or hell. Since it can't be both most reivews simply confused or scared us. We are well traveled, 13 yearly trips at 8 different resorts but first time at Ocean Bavaro or Punta Canta. We booked it because it cost us only $1k per person for 6 days, 5 nights so we managed our expectations going in. To tell you the truth all the horror stories you read happen everywhere if you are not careful. We had had worst times at 5 star resorts so toss our the star rating because it is simply peresonal impressions and nothing more.. Thinking this was a 3 1/2 star going in, we were thrilled with what we found.  Before we get too far into this let us first address all the horror topics from other reviews.  1. No good water pressure at any resort in the Carribbean. 2. Security is always an issue. We were robbed years ago at a 5  star and learned to be careful. Dont pack electronics and dont be careless. Everyone has a key to your safe. They mainly will try and rob you the day of your departure since they know you  have to leave soon. 3. Salt water works on all buildings. Its a natural thing 4. Be careful what you eat. Food is not the same was back home 5. Relax, slow down and dont be rude to staff. They work on  a different service level than you will be use to. 6. Dont get 1st floor rooms. Safety and humidity always make them worst that upper floors off the ground. Ok, with that junk out of the way we arrived at the airport. Straight foward, clean and simple to get through. Bus was not ready so we saw a chance to beat the crowd and took a cab. $28 US dollars, 20 minutes and we arrived an hour before the rest of the tour group. Greeted nicely, offered drinks, smiled a lot and very polite staff. Room was not ready so what the heck, spent 2 hours in the lobby bar and enjoyed the start of vacation. Breathtaking grounds as good as we have ever seen. We could have gotten upset but what the point. We were on vacation, sun, warmth, free drinks so we kicked back and waited.  Asked for upgrade and got ocean view honeymoon suite facing the ocean for $200 more. Well worth it and thanked them for it. Room was spotless, tile, marble, balcony, etc. Granted not everthing worked but good enough considering we were in tropics and not in Floriday paying $500 per night. Cleaning lady was the best and we tipped her well. By end of our stay she hunged us each day as did many of the staff. Just thank people, smile and enjoy yourself.  This resort is huge and very European. Even the gift shop is priced in Euro's so be aware most guests don't speak English. WE found the pools clean but the focus of the resort was clearly the beach. Second best we have ever been at other than a 5 star luxury in Jamica a few years back. Food was average but then its alway average. You have lots of choices and will not go hungry. Something always tasty to eat.  We walked the entire resort a few times and saw hundreds of guests sitting on their balconies all seemingly happy with their rooms. We asked many and most said the rooms were clean, and worked well. Entertainment at night was a bit lacking so dont expect professionals. Just relax and enjoy the tropics. No schedules or time frames so accept what they offer and enjoy yourself.  Worst aspect of the trip was the weather. Being so far East of the rest of the islands when it is sunny its great but when it rains here it can rain for a week. We had 2 terrible weather days out of 6. On islands farther west the most it rains is for 2 hours and then the sun comes back out. So if you book it you do risk the rain issue.  Tips. 1. Bring 50 or 100 singles for tipping. We never waited for a drink even once.  2. Bring gifts, lotion, bandaides, candy, etc for cleaning lady. She will appreciate it and work extra hard for you. Ok so take from this what you can and hopefully go prepared and be expected to be pleasantly surprised. Dont panic, relax and remember your traveling to a third world country which operates differently than the US. Great trip, nice hotel other than the rain. Enjoy!

<Content>Good vacation We had stayed at this resort Feb 13 - Feb 20. 4 of us at the age of 24. After reading all of the reviews I was kinda scared of what to expect from the resort. But after being there I thought it was great.The first day we arrived it was around 11:00pm and we got checked into our hotel room right away. Block 96. It was not a bad room at all, it had all we needed. 2 beds, shower, tv, and a toilet. We also had great airconditioning. Later that night we got wasted and went to the resort disco, which wasnt bad at all. It was packed full of people, who were all dancing and having a great time.The buffet was good, kinda different but was good. There is a italian side to the reort, make sure you go to there buffet because the food was a bit better.Getting drinks was no problem from any of the bars, and we always had a great time sitting at them during the day.The beach did have seaweed, but didnt bother me at all. The sand was very soft and nice ( white sand ). If you like to look for shells and stuff like that, you wont really find anything here. The ocean was a nice color, but was kinda rough. You couldnt really do any snorkling, because of all the boats and because of how rough the water was. We had very good and hot wheather all week except for one day we had a bit of rain, but I liked it.The restaraunts we checked out were the italian, japanese, spanish. We all hated the italian. Loved the japanese and the spanish though. Snack bar was good as well and we always went there late at night.The shows were great and I enjoyed them alot. Some of them were soo funny. One night we payed $10 U.S. to take a bus off the resort the a disco called trpicana or the cave. You get 1 free drink and entry into the disco. It was soo cool, because it was in a huge cave with bats flying around. Beers were $4 , but I was ordering vodka and redbulls which were about$13 U.S. It was safe and alot of people were there from different resorts. The had two rooms, one played rap, dance, resort music. While the other room played techno. All in all it was a great night.Another night we went to a beach party, where they had a huge bon fire. We drank and partyed all night.If you were looking to buy something go down the beach a bit and you will find a row of shops, make sure you dont pay full price as you can bargain down alot cheaper. There is also a little town off the beach were they have a grocery store and alot more shops. The shop workers were soo anoying and always wanted you to see there shops. I also heard about some peoples rooms being broken into, soo make sure you get a room were there is alot of taffic. Also lock your balcony doors and close the curtains with the tv and lights on. So it seems as though someone is there.There were alot of couples , but I met a couple of single guys and girls. We all had fun and partyed together.I only got sick one day, in the middle of the night. Luckly I brought some pepto bismal , and some diahria pills. Or I would have been in trouble.By the last day I was ready to go home. I was getting sick of eating the buffet and all I wanted was mcdonalds. haha.There is probably alot of things I didnt missed in this review but thats because there was soo much to do and see. It was a fairly big resort, and definitly a 3.5 - 4 star resort.We all had a great week, and would do it again.

<Content>Dont Go!!! I booked this holiday back in 2005 as my 40th birthday treat from my parents... I travelled with my 12 year old son... To say the least we were very excited about the holiday, the main thing was to swim with the dolphins.When we arrived at the hotel it looked quite stunning, the grounds were beautiful. I had read quite a lot of reviews about this hotel up til the time we were due to leave. Some of it good. Some of it bad. The one thing i remember people saying was Avoid block 97!!!The people on reception werent very helpful and rather abrupt. I got my room key, only to discover to my horror i was in block 97!!!!!!! I wasnt very well when i went on holiday, i had been suffering from bronchitis for 3 weeks and were taking antibiotics. When we got to our room it was dark, damp, mildew in the bathroom and water coming through the ceiling. We were on the ground floor. Our patio doors didnt shut. I went to reception to ask about a room change.. they said come back tomorrow 2.30. Later that evening i spoke to quite a few other couples who travelled with us on our coach. One family had 5 children (there were 9 of them in total), they had a nightmare with their rooms and eventually paid for an upgrade to block 6 but apparantly that wasnt all it was cracked up to be either!!! I awoke one morning at 4am to the noise of my patio doors rattling...someone was trying to get in!!!!!! just as well i had a safe! A lot of people we spoke to had been robbed in some way or another... One of the reviews on here is a woman who stayed with her husband and brother in law in the next room to me in block 97. The family of 9 who we became very good friends with had had a pair of shoes stolen and perfume and hair products tampered with!...They even had someone try to break into their rooms one evening while the young children were in bed!!! They were the ones who upgraded to Block 6!I went back the next day only to be told speak to the rep. I said to the guys on the reception that i had booked this holiday in 2005 and i had requested a room with a sea/pool view. Before i left i spoke to the travel agent who i booked the holiday through and she said to me that because i booked it so long ago i would take priority! WELL THAT WASNT THE CASE!!!! i found out that people who had only booked a few weeks/months before the trip had got better rooms than i had!!!!!!I saw the rep she told me that she would sort it...Her name was Catherine, she was lovely and very very helpful, along with a guy called Freddy who was available from 9.00am til 6.00pm every day. She told me to go back to reception the following day and ask for Clay. I went back the following morning to see Clay...he was at the reception desk but another person told me he was at lunch!!!!!!!!!!! to say the least i wasnt happy about that!...i was in a queue for having my room changed. Eventually they offered me block 100! i SAID NO WAY!!! then i got offered block 3 with NO VIEW...then finally a beautiful room with a sea view in block 5.. i was told i had half hour to pack. My son and his new found friends helped me pack. We got to the room in Block 5, 4 flights of stairs up only to be told... oooops sorry problem...this room taken!!!! by this time i was mad. we finally got a room in block 4 on the 4th floor. This room was lovely... overlooked one of the pools and a minute from the beach. FINALLY I COULD RELAX AND ENJOY MY HOLIDAY!! or so i thought!!!!FOOD: The food was awful! my son hardly ate a thing for 2 weeks... during the day the buffet restaurants catered for children... chips, burgers, fish fingers etc BUT NOTHING LIKE THAT IN THE EVENINGS!!! if you liked tripe and pigs trotters you were ok!!!! i lived on pizza and salad every evening. The restaurants were a nightmare to get booked into. We ate VERY WELL ONE EVENING OUT OF 14 which was in the Japanese restaurant!!!!!! GOOD LUCK IN GETTING BOOKED IN!!!! A lot of us who had all made friends (about 15 of us in all) had experienced the STOMACHE BUG! some of them actually being physically sick and in bed for 2 days too!TRIPS: before i went i decided that it was a MUST for myself and my son to swim with the dolphins. In the brochure it said a maximum of 拢60 per person. I also wanted to do the Trip to Saona Island as i heard a lot of good reports on this island.The rep put everybody off of booking trips to Dolphin Island and Mananti Park because of animal cruelty and hygiene. So at the beginning we were told there were no trips available to swim with the dolphins. To say the least my son and i were gutted!!!! At the end of the meeting we were persuaded to book Ocean World at 拢340 for the 2 of us it was the bulk of my spending money gone. The reason it was so expensive was because you had to get there by 19 seater plane as it was in the North of the Island. We decided to do this trip the day before we left. The day that day came we were quite excited about it... Got up for breakfast (early) to make some rolls to take with us as we were told you did NOT GET LUNCH!!!!!! a full day trip from 8am til 7pm. We went to get the coach only to be called out by Freddie. He said, oh i have to tell you your trip has been cancelled!!!!!!!! They didnt get enough people apparantly. For that type of money im not surprised! He asked me if it was important that we swam with the dolphins! I SAID.. ERH YES!!!!! its what we have been looking forward to for nearly 2 years!!!!! he said....oh when do you go home. I said in the morning!! he said.. oh....erm....let me make a phone call....He asked me if i would like to go to Dolphin Island! i said.. the one accused of animal cruelty and bad hygiene you mean????.. He said... there is NOTHING WRONG WITH IT... WE HAVE TO PUSH TO SELL OCEAN WORLD!!!! I was FURIOUS to say the least!!! The trip to dolphin world cost me 拢90 for the 2 of us!!! it was just down the road.. it wasnt dirty and the dolphins were well looked after..a very big enclosure for them!We got back about 11am with all our friends saying..UR BACK EARLY!!!! then i explained what happened. My son wanted to go and swim with the sharks and sting rays. The husband and father of the family of 9 we were friendly with were going and said they would take him with them. I went along for the ride!!! NOW THE ENCLOSURE IN WHICH THE SHARKS AND STING RAYS WERE IN WAS UNHYGIENIC!!! IT WAS FAR TOO SMALL!!!! Having said that my son loved it!.... POOLS: I didnt spend one day around any of the pools. The day i found out that another couple we were friends with had a rather nasty THING float past them!!!! yes you guessed it!!!!!!! Im sorry to have bored you all with this review. THE ONLY GOOD THINGS TO COME OUT OF THIS HOLIDAY.... WAS TO SWIM WITH THE DOLPHINS AND THE FAMILY FROM NORWICH WE MET WHOM WE HAVE BECOME VERY VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH!!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! GO TO PUNTA CANA BUT DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Would never stay here again!!!! My mother and I went to Ocean Bavaro from 2/6-2/12/07...Upon our arrival the check in took for ever...Noone took us to our room or told us anything about any orientation. We stood in Room 10102, which was ok, but kind of far...(Tip) be prepared to walk as there are many rooms and you have to walk a lot....The food is ok, but after 2 days of eating the same thing you just dont want to eat it...The restaurants are ok...The best one is the Brazilian...The beach was nice and so were the pools...The entertainment was probably the best thing they have at the hotel...There was a guy named Pinky who helped us with all of that...On our second day at the hotel as we were eating at the main buffet by the reception desk, a guy approached our table and sold us 2 excursions to the Safari and another one to go on a boat and have lobster etc..the next day we get up to go on the boat to find out that noone knew who the guy was, so we were basically ripped off...The day he sold us this he sat with us for about 2 hours and the waiter saw him selling this to us...We went and complained to the guest service, who basically took no interest...they did inform us that no one was allowed to sell anything to anyone in the buffet or any restaurant...Wierd since the waiter saw him selling this to us...They called the waiter and he said that he had never seen him before and did find it kind of wierd but did not say anything or call anyone....We asked for a manager and noone was ever available...The people at the guest service would pass us and act as if nothing happened...we complained for a couple of days and then decided to leave it alone and try to enjoy the rest of what was left of the vacation...Their service there is the worst and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone because once you have a problem they basically just brush you off...You would think that they would try to compensate us since this happened on thier premeses..But they did not even care...

<Content>You Get What You Pay For This review is from a seasoned traveler, with lots of experience staying at all-inclusive resorts over the last 10 years or so. Went down to OB Punta Cana from Jan 28-Feb 4 2007 with a group of 5 couples including my wife and I. We have spent a lot more $ on week-long all inclusives; so we sent into the trip expecting a 3 star vacation. That is pretty much what we got. Most of what I will state here are things that are just the facts that others have not posted here or that your travel agent will not tell you.Here goes:Language Barrier- Worst place I've ever been, and I took Spanish for 3 years in high school. Without it, you'll be lost- so learn some basics before you go. You'll be better off and the staff will appreciate you trying.Rooms- Much of what you've heard, but keep on top of them to get a key for your safe. They do not have enough for every room, so you've got to stay on top of it until you get one from the front desk guys(remember-spanish not english). We did not get a safe key til the third day, but also did not get anything stolen- so take it for what it is worth. Also- do not be afraid to be put in block 100. Yes it is on the back of the resort, farthest away from the beach, but it is quiet at night, balconies are somewhat private and rooms seem to be less run-down than other parts of the resort.Food- Very cheap for all-inclusive food. Not to say the food is bad, but all of the other resorts we've ever been to serve you more premium foods like lobster, shrimp, steak, lamb etc without you having to pay a premium $30 surcharge. Also- al a carte restaurants here are about getting you in, taking your order and getting you out; they are not about catering to you and serving you until you are through. Eat at the Itialian buffet-you may not know that this is a 2-resort resort. It has an Italian side called Ocean Cana and the other side which is the Ocean Bavaro. The buffet on the italian resort is often filled with better foods with better selection and taste than the buffets on the Ocean Bavaro side.(this is a secret-shhh)Pools and Beach- Pools are nice, clean and slightly cooler than the ocean is. Beware that if you want to play water polo or volleyball in the main pool you should wear water shoes or sandals. Half our group scraped the soles of their feet and toes off or raw playing games in the pool because the bottom is rough like sandpaper. Just be prepared for it and you'll be fine.  The beach is DIRTY. With all the Euros and Canadians smoking a lot, the beach is like one giant ashtray. You cannot step anywhere near the chairs or papalas without unearthing a half dozen cigarrette butts and half as many used straws. This problem is as much due to inconsiderate guests as it is that the beach is too crowded with chairs for the staff to keep it clean--WORST PART OF THE TRIP/RESORT!Excursions- DONT BOTHER! We got talked into the outback safari by one in our group. Big mistake. It was a long day. Most of us could not wait for it to be over. Food was not so great, most of the time you just sit on the truck and look at each other. The trip promised boogie boarding at the best beach in Punta Cana at the end of the trip, but that was much less than expected too. The tour guides do try to make it fun and entertaining, but there is only so much they can do. Save your money, or buy yourself a nice lobster dinner after walking down the beach to the north about 1/4 mile.As stated earlier, you get what you pay for. If you want 5 star don't come here, you will be disappointed. If you just want a relaxing, tropical vacation with perfect weather, food to eat, drinks to consume, all for a great price- THIS IS THE PLACE. I wont be back, but it made for a nice, cheap vacation.

<Content>Great Vacation TIPS First of all, for everyone visiting this resort, keep an open mind and remember where you are travelling to. You are not in the United States, Canada or Europe any more and you should not have the same expectations.People should not really be complaining about such dumb things like seaweed! Come on, you are on the beach, and no there is not a ton of seaweed! And yes the resort does do what they can to clean it up but it is part of the ocean .THINGS TO BRING:- Underwater Camera- Large Thermal mug for drinks (Resorts cups are very small)And yes the bar staff does not mind filling them up, they are use to it.-Sunscreen and Aloe Aftersun product (I usually wear oil to tan but that was a huge mistake....by the third day we were all using sunscreen and looking for shade-$100 USD in dollar bills for tips-Bring ImmodiumPepto, advil.... They came in handy for the both of us a few days!!! Thank God we had them!Rooms:We were in block 100-which was in the back near the main buffet. The room was large and like new. The view from the balcony was gorgeous and relaxing. Everyone says they want to be in block 5 or 6 and if you really want to...then just offer a tip when you check in and money always talks! But i did hear some say that they didnt like block 5 beause it was by the late night bar and they heart noise and partying all night long. But really it was not a big deal to have to walk through a gorgeous resort 3 minutes (Not even) to the beach. Most people can use the exercise anyway! The room was quite cold but we could turn the temp up and the ceiling did not leak as others stated. We had a safety deposit box that does cost $40.00 to use but you do get $20.00 back when you check out. Nothing from our room was stolen and we did leave things out. If you are worried, then put the sign on your door to not clean your room! Food:Food was fine, pizza 24 hours that was alright (Some say, they even served corn pizza, which is not my fav but you are in Punta Cana) The buffet was similar all week long with small varaiations throughout the week. But there was always something for everyone. My husband likes to try new foods all the time but i like to stick to normal food, so they have pizza, hotdogs, french fries, salad, fruit..... We did eat at the main buffet for breakfast and lunch every day and at one of the restaurants for dinner.Restaurants:-You have to make reservations for the restaurants BUT if you tell the reservation lady that you will give her a tip....you can get into any restaurant the night of. We gave her $5.00 to get into the Japanese restaurant and it was well worth it! We also liked the Mexican restaurant. If you like meat- then you will also like the Brazillian Restaurant as that was my husbands favorite one. And no you dont have to wear pants to any of them. My husband work beige cargo shorts and a collar shirt and that was acceptable.Nightlife:The first three nights we stayed out late and partied lots. The is a disco on the resort, there was maybe 20 people in it. They serve drinks all night but by middle of the week, we were in bed by 10:00 every night because the sun kicks your butt! Plus we were always up early to get a spot by the pool or beach. This is not a huge party place but we were not looking for that anyways!Excursions:We booked through Apple Vacations and have only good things to say about the rep. At the info session we booked our excursions. We did one every other day. Mon, Wed and Friday and that was awesome!Mon-we did the Outback Safari- This was my fav excursion. They pick you up in an open truck and take you into the countryside. You get to see the real like of a Dominican. It was such an eye opener and also alot of fun! Our guide Nacho was sooooo funny! TIP: Bring school supplies for the children. Just to see a smile on their face, makes your trip so rewarding. I spent $25.00 at the dollar store and it was like i was Santa Claus! The kids were soooo excited! Anyways, you go to the plantations, a school, a house, a nice lunch (Dont expect the KEG Restaurant but it was good), and then you go boogyboarding, which was alot of fun! And did i mention all you can drink beer, run, coke, water, 7UP. It was a great time! No one i met had one complaint about it. You can even visit their web site. They are non profit and some of the proceeds goes to help the schools.Wed-we swam with the sharks and stingrays.It was ccol to say we did it but i was very scard. I know they are nurse sharks but seeing several 8 foot sharks swimming around you as well as stink rays....wells its hard for your mind to handle this. Truthfully, i lasted 2 minutes but my husband swam with them for about 30 minutes. He thougt it was awesome. He even took pictures of them. I enjoyed the partying afterwards, and again there is an open bar with all you can drink!Friday-We went to Sauna Island, which was a tropical paradise! It was a very nice place for our last day to just sit in the shade and relax. We bought some gifts for our family on the island, danced salsa, ate a bbq lunch and just relaxed. On the way there we took a speed boat, which was a thrill, stopped and snorkled for star fish, and on the way back it was a relaxing open bar catamaran ride with lots of partying. It was a great trip! The only thing i can say about going on the Friday was that we were in the sun all day and you are gone from 7am-6:30pm so we were sooo tired when we got back. And on Fridays at the resort, they have the Beach party, but because we were soooo tired, we skipped the beach party. But really it was not a big deal to us! The island was gorgeous!!!Have a great trip, take things slow, remember you are on the other side of the poorest country in the world, so chill out and relax and dont worry about the small things....you are on vacation!My husband and I have gone cruising, cuba, mexico....and this vacation was one of our best! We would reccomend this resort to anyone and come back with our children!

<Content>Violated Ok, so I went away with a girl friend for a nice week away and that is how it started. The rooms were alright. I mean, don't be expecting anything spectacular, yes they are cold and they are pretty standard. You will hear people in the next room if they sneeze. The food was good. Again, not spectacular but good enough and I didn't get sick from it and always found something good to eat. We loved the breakfast omlets. The resort offers (with a fee) some excellent excursions and I highly recommend the outback safari. I read on other peoples trip advisory responses that the check in and front desk people were not very helpful and figured that they were maybe just impatient people and that I wouldn鈥檛 mind waiting in line or whatever. For standard check-in and out they were fine. Not friendly but they were fine. They became a problem when we were robbed. Yes we were in block 96 on the first floor. A site map will show that we backed onto an 鈥榚mployees only鈥?area of the resort and nobody would see anyone going into our room. We were watched because we only went out late one night and that night we had approximately five hundred dollars worth of stuff stolen from our room. Immediately we went to the front desk who basically told us to go to bed. They would not show us how to dial out of the resort to call home to Canada or to the local police or our signature vacations representative. They told us to go to our room to make a call and then when we called through to them they hung up, put me on hold or didn鈥檛 answer the phone. Then I would go back down to reception and they would tell us to call from our room. This happened for a couple of hours. After we were so exhausted and had to give up, me and my friend were forced to sleep in this room for the remainder of the night. Two young girl, fairly terrified that these people would be back. Pretty much all the door on all the rooms in the whole resort are faulty. I strongly recommend you DO NOT go to this resort, and if you do go there be sure that your room is on the second or third floor. Oh, and the stuff that was stolen from our room wasn鈥檛 even stuff that would go in your safe. They stole sunglasses, running shoes, ipods, cellphones etc. Oh ya and something we didn鈥檛 read about on here is that none of the rooms have clocks so be sure to bring a watch. The majority of the people at this resort are French Canadians or from France, some Spanish speaking people and some English, Americans, and a few English speaking Canadians. It was a mix of all ages young and old is there is a significant amount of walking at the resort, no hills but be prepared to walk around. I recommend going to your orientation because that is when your meet your rep in case you have any problems.

<Content>Beware I recently spent two weeks in this complex with my husband and brother in law. I wasn't expecting too much as this was rated as a 3* by our travel agent and that is exactly what we got although in some respects it was barely that.Our first room was very basic and in need of basic maintenance and or refurbishment. The room next to ours had water coming through the ceiling and they could not lock the patio doors. Our patio door would not lock either and was secured by a bolt through the frame where the two doors met. It also took six hours to get our badly leaking toilet repaired The fact that the security guards on the beach carried rifles should have alerted me to the fact that security was a problem. We had 2 cameras stolen from our room and the management of the hotel did not want to know they kept referring us to our rep and refused to change our room to a more secure one without the rep making the request. Begs the question who's running this hotel? Our rep was on a day off so we saw someone else who tried to deal with the situation for us, and he admitted that theft is a problem in this complex. We eventually got taken to a police station to report it but this was a joke as they said they would not come out for 5 days to search our room and we were leaving in 4 days. It was also not until the morning of our departure that we were told that we needed to pay 500 peso to obtain the police report for our insurance.We were eventually given another room where the patio doors locked but the front of the safety deposit box was missing and could not be used. Room number 3 had a safety deposit box but again the patio doors could not be fully secured but by this time I could not face a further room move so elected to stay. This room was in the Elite part of the hotel, which you pay extra for, so you would expected something extra but it was no better than the other rooms we had been in. It was sadly in need of repair or refurbishment. We were not able to have a room above ground floor due to one of our party being disabled and there is no lift available.We spoke to a number of other people who had all moved rooms at least once and were aware of other robberies throughout the complex.Other than the security issue if you want cheap and cheerful and do not expect too much then this complex is ok.

<Content>True and honest view A little about myself first, I am not one for complaining but if something is wrong then I will say so. I will always try and make the best of something, at first then if that doesn鈥檛 work then I will complain. Our holiday was between the following dates 24th Jan-7th Feb. We choose the Ocean Bavaro at Punta Cana. After reading all the reports about this complex we had some reservations, as you do about going to a hotel for the first time. There are some very good points, but there are some bad ones as well. So I shall start with the good ones first. The star rating for this hotel 3+ is about right. Starting with the beach, it is true they do get a lot of seaweed here, member of staff with his tractor and the sand sifter working on the beach every morning at 7am clearing the seaweed, he has been seen cleaning the beach in the evening as well, the only trouble the tides have a habit of bringing it all back.All the Staff seem very friendly and most of them speak a little English, and they all have a smile on their face.so it seems. Food is ok as well. Especially after all the reports that we had read on trip adviser.O.k I agree after two weeks the food does seem to become very repetitive, but then you do have the choices of using the other restaurants, but you do need to book them at the buffet entrance(main Restaurant) early.I was told by the family and friends that we made on holiday that the Japanese resturant was the best. The settings of this complex are very good, the one thing that amazed us was how green everything is plus the grounds are kept to the very high standard.One of the reasons we booked this was so we could go snorkelling,altough this wasn't the only reason.The only trouble with this is you have to pay to be taken out in a boat and then you can snorkel, you can snorkel from the beach but the sea is not that clear, it鈥檚 murky and sea weedy. I do think you should be able to snorkel from going out via the beach, but the only trouble with this is you would be hit by the speed boats going up and down. You see the boat lanes are just outside the swimming area, (rather convenient) which are above some nice reefs, so would be good for snorkelling. The trip we went on was to swim with sharks and stingray plus a swimming around some coral reef. It was very good the only thing is I don鈥檛 agree with how the sharks and stingray are kept in rusty wire fenced pens, they should have been better and not that sure if it鈥檚 that legal in this day and age.When we first arrived at this hotel it looks very inviting, but then we went to our room that鈥檚 when the problems started, first room the bathroom ceiling was all over the floor then went to the second room and that was no good either. So we had to upgrade at a cost of 拢200 pound per room and we had to have two. By the sound of it the best blocks are 4, 5, 6, 7, and trust me they are not that brilliant either.But the amount of people you meet and talk to that had to upgrade to get to what they would like is unreal.Could be a con!!!!!!The bad thing about this holiday is that any of the trips you would like to go on is so expensive that we decided that we wouldn鈥檛 be ripped of. The wife did treat me to the swimming one for my birthday though. Also there was a few people who had things taken from there rooms, plus the daughter in-law had shoes pinched from the room plus people trying to brake in while they was asleep. My wife had all her perfume taken from her scent bottle; it was made to look like she had used it all. They had security on the beach what for hasn鈥檛 been decided but after the attempted brake in they was seen pacing around our block. The hotel wasn鈥檛 very forth coming, and didn鈥檛 do anything about it. So we thought it was a total waste of good money for the holiday and would not return under any circumstances, if you go to this complex hope you will have a good time because we never. Don't be fooled,you have to pay $10 going in and $20 coming out and that is per head.So be warned.!!!!! One other thing take euro's everything is priced in euro's,and it's cheaper to use euro's.

<Content>Had a Great Time!! Beautiful beach Stayed at Ocean Bavaro Jan 27-Feb 3 2007 although there were a few problems still had a great time. There were about 22 of us that went down because my sister was getting married there.We booked thought signature and flew thought sky service鈥?(I鈥檓 not too impressed with sky service) the flight seemed to take forever鈥?first of all the entertainment system (TV鈥檚 and radio wasn鈥檛 working for trip there and back) and the food was terrible (I鈥檓 not one to really care about the food on the plane but when they serve the same crappy meal on the way there, then I start to complain鈥?at least offer something different!). Airport: No problems at the airport. It was pretty hot so make sure you at least have something light on because we were there for awhile waiting for our luggage.Hotel: check in took along time and we didn鈥檛 get the room that we requested from the travel agent (which was block 5 or 6) instead we got put in block 100 which is way at the back and probably about the furthest you could be from the beach. They told us to talk to our rep the next day to try and get a room change.Rooms: When we got to our room the door was wide open, made me kind of uneasy about it then noticed there was no deadbolt or lock on the door but we weren't too worried about it because we knew we were changing rooms the next day or too.The Meeting with the signature rep was a little helpful but pretty much a waste of time, they could of handed out booklets and given us a card with her name and number on it so we could reach her鈥?everything she told us we pretty much already knew. We eventually talked with her and she got our room changed (there was about 6 of us that weren鈥檛 happy with our rooms) to block 7 which I found to be pretty good. Day Trips: Did a trip to Catalina Island though the dive center which was on the beach near block 7. Had an amazing time!! Drove to a boat dock in La Romania where we were picked up, stopped in the middle of the ocean and went snorkeling and diving鈥?saw lots of fish, then headed to the island were us snorkeller鈥檚 were dropped off at the beach and the divers continued for one more dive. Had lunch at the beach, drank, and danced. The staff tried really hard to get everyone involved. Had a blast on the boat driving to and back, the staff got everyone up dancing and were always filling up our cups with alcohol or pop (a warning: be careful on how much you drink because it is an hour and a half bus ride back). Went on a helicopter ride, it was amazing!! only did the 10 min ride.Outback Safari Adventure was a lot of fun!! (check out the website). Had the best Tour guide鈥?Omar鈥?he made the trip a lot of fun! Defiantly bring school supplies and treats for the kids, because you stop at a school and it pretty rewarding to be able to give the teacher something because they really need them鈥?And the money from the trip goes to the schools. This is a trip to defiantly go on if you want to experience the culture and country side of the Dominican. They serve you drinks the whole time too.Wedding: My sister wasn鈥檛 too happy... the wedding planner didn鈥檛 end up meeting with her when they had planned she kept canceling and didn鈥檛 meet with her till the day before the wedding. Then they were suppose to have the wedding at sunset but couldn鈥檛鈥?it had to be at 12:30 but didn鈥檛 happen then because the lawyer was stuck at another resort鈥?soooo the wedding ended up being at 2:30. A couple pointers鈥?-Remember everything is in 鈥淒ominican Time鈥?which happens at a slow place so you have to be patient-Tip the maid! You don鈥檛 want to make her mad (someone鈥檚 money got stolen in their room on the day of their wedding)-Buy a safe key!!-Tip the gardener鈥檚 and brings them a drink鈥?they work very hard in the hot weather and deserve it.-Be careful what you eat (boyfriend and a couple others got sick the last day鈥?and think it was from the sushi)-Book at least a couple of dinners at the a la carte鈥檚Overall I had a great time and would go back again and stay at Ocean Bavaro. Although didn鈥檛 get to stay in block 5 or 6 but I wasn鈥檛 really concern about it once we got into 7 because we were only there to sleep, and shower and the room really wasn鈥檛 that bad at all.

<Content>Stayed at Ocean Cana Jan4 to Jan11 , 2007 My husband and I stayed for a week at this esort. We have good and not so good things to say. The airport and customs went very smoothly. This is our forth all inclusive and unfortunately this one is far by the worse. There are some positive things though. Very family oriented. Lots of fun stuff to do. Kids club, water sports and more.Most of the staff were friendly and helpful.The a la cartes Japanese and the Brazilian( a fair amount of meat served here) were excellent.The buffets were okay,The not so positive was that our first room was not ready and our second also left alot to be desired. Having to clean a disgusting toilet to start the night off after along travel day was not my idea of pleasent. The security of the sliding glass door left alot to be desired.The evening shows were late for us and were very loud.I would definately recommend getting a safe for your important papers and money. Book early for the a la cartes.One of the highlites for me was the Jeep Safari....a real eye opener for the real life of the Domincans.There were other great excursions but we did only the one.

<Content>Had a good time, but rating was a little high My parents, my 3 sisters and I were at Ocean Bavaro for 5 days in early Jan of 2007. We booked through Apple Vacations and they were outstanding! All their representatives and services were excellent, I would highly recommend them. The 1 big negative with Apple was our flight down...it was freezing on the plane and their water lines broke so there was no coffee or tea available with breakfast.We arrived on a Wed so did not have a long wait to check-in. If you want your bags in your room when you get there or shortly after then take them yourself. Their 10 mins can usually be expected to be 2 to 3 times longer than your 10 mins. Once you realize and accept that you shouldn't have any timing problems :)The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Unfortunately, we did not have an ocean view and instead were put in Bldg 100 in the far back area of the property. My room was fine, but my sisters' room the AC did not work and they put my aged parents in a 3rd floor room....with no elevators. To request a room change we talked to Client Services, the Front Desk Mgr and the Apple Rep. After much discussion and persuasion on our part we did finally get these 2 rooms changed to new rooms, on the 1st floor in Blg 7 which was nice, but still no ocean view and we did have to wait till 3pm the next day. The ocean view rooms are limited so good luck with that!The beach and pool areas are clean and very nice, plenty of chairs. There are beach  pool activities for those that want to participate, or you can just kick back and relax. We wanted quiet to read, relax and catch some sun so we spent most of our time by the pool behind Bldg 7, also called the Italian side. I guess cuz they stay in that bldg or one nearby for longer stays and most of the staff working that pool etc spoke Italian. They also have their own theater for evening entertainment....in Italian. If you like massages definitely do a beach/cabana massage. You can negotiate and get an hour massage for $30-$40 and they are excellent!The food was for the most part just ok. The buffet had variety, but none of us thought it was above average fare. Although service was good. We ate dinner in the Mexican, Italian and Japanese restaurants. My suggestion, skip the Mexican, not very good at all. The Italian was good and the Japanese was excellent so it's well worth getting up early to get in line to make reservations. These dinner reservations can only be made between 7am-3pm. We found (with 6 people) that we should be there at 7am or shortly after in order to ensure seating. They have 2 seatings, 6pm and 8pm. I recommend the 8pm, especially if you want to stay up for the evening entertainment which doesn't start till 10pm. Each of the restaurants has very limited seating.Tours: we did only 1 tour, it was the 1/2 day shopping tour. We went to a cigar factory, rum factory and a shopping plaza. We all enjoyed this tour and felt it was worth the $20 and the time. If we had been there longer we would have taken the Santo Domingo tour as we'd heard good things about it, but from Punta Cana it's 3.5hrs one way! It did rain a little each day, but nothing that interfered with our plans and it never lasted very long. We all agreed that the evening show was outstanding. The costumes and choreography were very professional and the entertainment team did a terrific job. It was fast paced, high energy and we enjoyed every show we saw...can't say enough good things about that part of our stay. I suggest you get there no earlier than 9:30pm cuz there's not much going on before that other than loud music. Be prepared for a blaring sound system. After the first night we routinely sat as far back as we could get because they really keep the speakers turned up to max. Hopefully, they'll correct this! I think the Punta Cana area in general is a nice place to visit for an economical location, but there isn't much else to see or do outside the resorts. I might go back, but I'd wait a few years till there's more infrastructure developed.

<Content>Absolutly Amazing! I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro over Christmas and it was the best trip I have ever been on. The beach is beautiful and even though the resort was filled to capacity all ten of my extended family and I were always able to find a spot. The food was amazing, I couldn't help myself, I was eating all day wheter I was hungry or not! Of course we did have a problem with the roof leaking one time but we just called the front desk and the quickly came and cleaned it up while we were having a great time at one of there fabulous shows. By far the best part about staying at the Ocean Bavaro is the staff. They go WAY out of their way to make sure everyone feels like the only important person there. The 'entertainment team' always seemed to be around playing rediculious games and just acting crazy. The staff there difinitely went the extra mile to make sure our stay was perfect.

<Content>Not A Four Star Resort! I travelled with my boyfriend and his family to the Ocean Bavaro Resort and Spa from Dec. 30th - Jan 6th. We booked through Sunquest who rates this Resort as a FOUR STAR... they are very very wrong! This resort should definatly be rated a THREE STAR! Since though it was rated as 4 star I am writting this review as such (if we had choosen this resort based on a 3 star rating I would not have many complaints)CHECK-IN: We arrived at the resort around 10pm with only a few other people checking in at the same time and so were lucky enough to only have to wait about 10mins to get all of our rooms (four in total) THE ROOMS: here's where the problems began, out of four rooms, three of the toilets were broken and would not flush properly. After a call to the front desk they assured us that someone would be there to fix it the next day needless to say by the time our 7 days were over they still were not fixed. The ceiling in our room had huge water stains on it and if you turned the AC down during the day to a warmer temp. the ceiling would drip water. Otherwise the rooms aren't bad although for a four star I would have expected much more. THE BEACH: the water is warm and the colour is amazing to look at. We didn't ever have a problem getting chairs which is impressive when trying to get 8 all together BUT I found that the beach was not kept very well maintained. Although they had a grater come through each morning it only raked the bottom half of the beach. The top half where the chairs all sat was never cleaned and we found some disgusting things such as used condoms and syringes in the sand where the children all play. NOT ACCEPTABLE! The other problem at the beach was the seaweed. Okay I understand that there is seaweed in the ocean and while we were there it was fairly rough so i'm sure more then usual was coming up to the beach but not once during our stay did they have anyone clean up the huge amount that had washed up onto shore. If you walked down to either side of the resort other resorts beaches had cleaned there's up. Again this is suppose to be a four star resort.POOL: We really enjoyed there pools. It was easy to find chairs by the pool anytime during the day. They have one really big pool which has a shallow area for the kids to play and then goes into a deeper section to swim/lounge as well as a volleyball net set up to play. We never found the pools over crowded. FOOD: The a la carte restaurants are all faboulus. I'd have to say the Japanese and the Spanish we're my favorite but you have 5 to choose from and there all good I would strongly recommend making sure you make reservations at all of these as the food is MUCH better then the dinner buffet. As for the buffets they were mediocre and were not replenished. I suggest you get there early if you want to eat and have selection as once they run out of things they are not usually replenished. The snack bar was great (24 hr food) but you need to be careful as three times the burger I got was NOT cooked. They also have a Cafe on site which is the best part of this resort. They serve all types of coffee and smoothies which are to die for they also have baked goodies too it's set up just like a Second Cup or Starbucks it's sooooo good.If your booking this resort thinking that you are going to get a four star I would strongly urge you to reconsider. It is a good 3 star but that is it. In its hayday it would have been a beautiful resort but now it needs some work. If they were to do some reno's and some touch ups I'm sure it would be back to it's 4 star rating in no time. We did notice that some of the restaurants as well as the cafe and sports bar section all seem to be newer buildings and are very nice they are also putting in a casino so hopefully they will do some additonal renos and the place will be a much nicer resort. But as is I would not go back to the Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>Pretty good Here is the good and bad about this resort.The transfer from the airport to the resort was pretty straight forward and easy. Once at the hotel (we arrived at noon local time) we had to wait 3 hrs to check in. Its not bad though as you can get a wrist band immediatly and began drinking or eating. Your bags however have to stay at the front entrance as they are not allowed in the front lobby.The grounds of the resort are beutiful and pretty well maintained. You actually have to go exploring as the grounds are bigger than they appear.The beach itself is big and beutiful, but I dont know how different this would be from any other resort in the area. The sea-weed can also become a problem as some days are worse than others. The water is amazing in colour and temperature.The Rooms - This was the biggest dissapointment of the whole trip. Between myself and the 5 people that accompanied me on this trip we had 3 rooms. 2 suites in block 6 and one room in block 4. Every room had something wrong with it. For a 4 star resort the rooms were more like that of a 2 star in Canada....if that. The sliding door to my suite in block 6 couldnt keep out the rain so we had to be careful of where we put our shoes and luggage. The shower had no door to it so water ended up all over the bathroom floor. The bathroom ceiling was leaking so bad it was almost like a light rain. The safe didnt work the entire week. And to top it all off the maids keep the temperature set at 50 F so it gets quite uncomfortably cold. When I turned the temp higher the room ceiling started to drip. I called the front desk about all these problems and they said nothing more could be done to fix it for my stay.When you arrive you get 2 towel cards you exchange to get a beach towel. If you lose these cards or the towels you have to pay $15 - $20 to get a new one. If you take the towel to your room do not leave it unattended as the maid will take them. I had to chase her down the hall and argue with her to get the towel back.The a la carte resteraunts were all fantastic with the exception of the Mexican. The buffet was also pretty good. I was never hungry the entire trip.The shows were very good but are all pretty simialar in my opinion. The comedy was really funny but I think you have to have a U.S./Canada sense of humour as I found a lot of the Europeans didnt like it.Once we had checked out I found that the staffs kindness dropped off. I am assuming because they no longer are worried about tips from those departing.For the exception of the last 2 hrs and the rooms this was a very relaxing vacation. I would probably go back if the rooms were kept in better repair.

<Content>Super! This resort was great! Couldn't have asked for more. At first my family was worried because we read some bad reviews online. The only problem we had with this hotel was at the front desk. They are SLOW and sometimes downright ignore you. Most of the staff speaks very limited english, but others speak it very well. The beach is great and very large. One nice thing was that it is illegal for beach vendors to talk to you unless you approach them, so you don't get harassed like in mexico! The pools are very nice also. Please note that the beach IS topless and it seemed that most everyone was topless! When we walked along the beach it appeared that most of the other resorts were topless as well. Our whole family thought that the food was great! The buffet is good, we only ate dinner there one night. Make sure you make reservations fairly early to get your pick of the restaurants. We went to the italian restaurant first, you order off of the menu and it was pretty good, you can get lobster that is very good, but you have to pay an extra $15. The steak is pretty good, you can get some noodles with plain sauce if you are less adventurous with your meals. They will even give you two meals if you ask for it! My dad got both the lasagna and calimari, both were pretty tasty. Next we went to the brazillian place, it was very good, we went back twice. You get many different kinds of meat along with a buffet with potatoes, rice, beans, salad and so on...The Japanese restaurant was very cool, they have flat top grills that they cook on at each table. the food is alright, just fried rice and some meat, but it is a must do because the atmosphere. The Spanish restaurant was pretty good, you order off of the menu, the steak with blue cheese is very good, but the rest of my family was kind of disappointed. They have a lot of different types of fish you can order along with lobster for the $15 extra. The Mexican place wasnt very good...you order off the menu here too, no one liked what they got. I would recomend not going here, the other places are far better. It is not on the menu, but I asked for food without meat at the mexican restaurant and got an interesting cooked veggie arrangement, I would assume that you can do this at the other places too if you don't eat meat. We got hour long massages for $30. If you go to the massage place that is near the snack bar you can get this deal, but if you go to the other ones, it is $30 for a half hour. There is a little store at the resort, but it is VERY over priced and all of the souveniers can be bought from vendors that have little shops next to the resort, if you walk along the beach there are many clusters of shops as you go. They have beautiful paintings and wood carvings. We got a very large painting that they took off of the wood frame and we rolled it up and it got kind of flatened and now there are some cracks in the paint. I think that if it had been carried on and not gotten so cold or flattened it would have been fine. On the west end of the resort there are some vendors that sell boat trips, they are good guys. One of them speaks 5 languages! Their trips are fun and a lot cheaper than what is offered by the resort. We went on a private snorkeling trip for 2 hours for $35 a person. The snorkeling is very good. The natural pool is really neat also! The shows at night are pretty good, other than the comedy show I am not sure what they were thinking with that one....save your time and go to bed early and get up and watch the sunrise instead of going to this show! The lobby bar is pretty busy at night, you can meet a lot of interesting people sitting down there! The night time bartender, Edison, is a great guy! He speaks perfect english and is pretty funny. The only thing i didnt like about this vacation was that there is really nothing to do outside of the resort...we had plenty to do, but I am used to traveling in mexico where you can go out at night all around town! It is a very relaxing place to visit! I suggest you do it!

<Content>Truely Fantastic Arrived back from our holiday just over a week ago and i'm still gutted that we had to come home. everything about this hotel was FANTASTIC, the staff are wonderful they cannot help you enough but please don't expect all things done straight away.....you are running off a dominican clock from the minute you land....we never found this to be a real problem as when your on holiday there should be no rush anyway its about being relaxed!?!?Transfer from the airport was fine, check in no problems or waiting at all, room......eeerrrmmm it was ok it was no palace but it was clean and comfortable and clean towels and bed linen daily.....our maid was a little sweetie, she used to make animals out of clothes we had left on our beds (nice touch i thought!!) bless!!the food was great, i'm an extremely fussy eater yet always managed to find something suitable....we tried nearly all the restaurants while we were there too and they were all delicious....wasabi the Japanese had to be the best though, there are 8 people to a table and you have a chef cook your food infront of you and the food was FANTASTIC....i dread to think how much you would pay for something like that back here!!!Entertainment is also very good, theres a different show to watch each night, you can see how hard the staff work putting these shows together. The animation team to me are fantastic, they are out there from like 8 in the morning with stretching classes till 11 at night when the show ends then off they pop to the disco on the resort to keep entertaining guests and entertain they do!!!....they smile constantly lovely lovely people!!!We went on quite a few of the excursions too (word to the wise....book with Fredy at the Coco tours stand next to the main pool) well either him or Andy....they are lovely.....i used to go and book tours with them and find my self still sat chatting 2 hours later ha ha, they were both stars!!!we went to Saona Island, Catalina Island, Horse riding, Buggy adventure, Swimming with dolphins and snorkeling with sharks and stingrays there isn't 1 that i could say oh you must try that because to me they were all equally good!! and none of them that expensive either!!!i could ramble on forever about my holiday....but i'm sure you get the gist that i had an amazing time!!if you are considering going to this resort my advise to you is GO GO GO.....if you are after a big chill out or if you want action packed you really will have the best of both worlds here!!x

<Content>Had a great time My best friend and I just came back from Ocean Bavaro approx a week ago. We had a blast. The resort is sooo big and there are lots of different things to do if you get tired of lying on the beach all day. (It was kinda hot though so don鈥檛 overdo yourself). The hotel rooms were standard鈥︹€ut always freezing for some reason. And, if you turn off the A/C, then the room sweats and water starts to drop from the ceiling. What kinda sucked is that the floor was always wet in the room so don鈥檛 walk around it socks or anything like that.The buffet was ok, but the separate restaurants were even better and I strongly recommend that you book them for dinner. The Italian was great, and so was the Mexican. The beach was great too. It鈥檚 was pretty clean. And, there was lots of shade too when it gets to be too hot. There was some seaweed but it IS the ocean. It was just nice to sit back and relax. And, the bar was pretty close when you got thirsty and needed beer etc. Overall, I would go back. I really enjoyed it. And, the people working there were nice and funny.

<Content>had a lovely time read several reports about the hotel before we left home and spoke with client services prior to arrival to ally our fears.We had booked an upgrade to the VIP carribean suites which proved to be an excellent move as we had a superb room right on the beach with a breathtaking view, plus a jacuzzi which we were able to sit in and relax after a day on the beach.The staff throughout the complex were all very friendly and really appreaciated a beunos dios, and all attempted to respond. My only gripe being that the managers who wandered about with their radios and mobile phones did not try and communicate with the guests. With a large main restaurant the choice of food at all times was good, and the five theme resaurants were there to be used for special occasions, but we ended up happily using the main dining room which had the best choice. The new swimming pool at the beach and Bahia Restaurant was was just being finished as we were leaving and looks beautiful. the grounds are extensive, well laid out and maintained with flamingos and peacocks strolling about.We used the spa and massage facilities but much preferred the spa and gym which is superb, although the prices are geared for the US market and I thought a bit steep compared to that which we are used to paying in Edinburgh - treatments are just excellent.Our room service was great, and any odd problems we had were quickly resolved by Guest Services.There was finishing

<Content>Great Time, Go With a Sense of Humour Our trip was Nov 19 - Nov 26. We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Resort, 2 couples age 29 - 30. One couple had been there before and convinced us to go. Overall, we had a great time.I honestly think, the trip will be what you make it. You want to have a great time, you'll have a great time. You want to whine about every little thing, start whining on the plane.We scanned a lot of these reviews on this site before going, and I was amused to see the varied reactions by people. All over the map as per their experience. So I went with an open mind expecting anything. All I can do is supply our experience.We arrived about 11 am at the airport. I enjoyed the ride to the resort - about 15 minutes - because this is your chance to see the actual Dominican lifestyle outside of the resorts.At the hotel, we left our luggage at the curb, and it was there hours later. Check-in was reasonably smooth, although as many people have pointed out, you can't get in until 3pm. So, perhaps put your bathing suit in your carry-on, or prepare accordingly. Help yourself to a tropical drink as soon as you arrive. There are bars everywhere, if that is your thing. Washrooms are around the resort, but you won't be tripping over them. There is one small one by the main pool, one by the buffet restaurant, and another by the main plaza. These are all that I counted - there may be more tucked away. All were in very nice, orderly condition. Each restaurant doesn't have one.The pool is great, and the resort seemed quiet when we were there - no problem getting chairs anywhere. The pool isn't terribly deep in any parts, so don't think you'll be diving. Swim up bar is a fun gathering, although it is in constant shade. They're happy to get any drink you would like. We became quite addicted to pool volleyball, and it was a common sight to see a player wading back to the game with a tray of 15 beers. All beer is draft Presidente. Otherwise, there are mixed drinks, or wine, or straight liquor.The food is food. It can be quite tasty if you select the right things. Will it win awards? Maybe not, but I found nothing wrong with it. In fact, some of the ala carte restaurants had really enjoyable meals. I would list them as follows, favourite to least favourite: Japanese, Italian, Brazillian, Mexican, Spanish. There is also a lobster dinner on the beach we didn't try. It is $35.Re: people selling - they're doing their job. They certainly didn't hound us, they were friendly, and certainly took 'not today' for an answer. In fact, you may want what they are offering - horseback riding, ATV trips, etc - probably not the 'timeshare' deal, but again, they weren't hounding us. Also - you can really get on their good side by discretely sneaking a drink from the bar.The room - how much time are you going to spend there? Our air worked fine, too good - it was like a meat locker after the maid had been through. Beds are comfy, shower has no pressure but hot water most of the time, 'massaging' showerhead will probably break off, it's cheap, but deal with it. Pepsi, 7up and water in the fridge daily. TV had many channels, mostly english with spanish subtitles. Some French, some all Spanish. Nice balcony.Bring: lots of US $1's for tipping, and lower bills ($5 max) as it is hard to get change. I would recommend only getting change at the front desk, and they frequently are strapped to break a $20. You don't need a lot of money once you're there, depending what you want to do... we did parasailing for $80, great time. And you need $20 departure tax.If you plan to windsurf, bring water socks - the board is like glass and very hard to stay up on. The water sports times are very erratic, as well - be patient.Contrary to what we had heard, stuff isn't cheap, aside from liquour. We ventured out to the market just outside of the resort, and they have nothing but broken crap to sell you, and they want top dollar. I needed sunglasses after I lost mine (they probably turned up in the market the next day) and I settled on a broken scratched pair for $10. He initially wanted $35. KEEP FIGHTING down the price. They will throw a gigantic number at you, to see ifit sticks. Particularily with cigars.Our number one complaint, if we had one: THE (---) MUSIC. They have piped music from 8:30 am until about midnight, everywhere. EVERYWHERE. AND IT IS THE SAME 50 MINUTE CD, OVER AND OVER AND OVER. And, every bar has their own blaring loudspeaker, presumably controlled by the staff, so they don't lose their minds because of the mind controlling 7 song set endlessly spilling from the 'rocks' and torturing their souls. The beach is quieter, until the 'activities' start. Don't go expecting a silent vacation.That was really our only complaint. Overall, we LOVED our time and would go back no problem.

<Content>My best friend and I loved our stay at Ocean Bavaro!! Well my best friend and I just got back from Punta Cana yesterday night, but we really wanted to write this review to let everyone know we had a great time!! First of all both my friend and I are seasoned travelers (mostly in the Caribean), we booked this vacation about a week before we went, and really had little knowledge about Ocean Bavaro. When we got home from booking our vacation we were a little worried about some of the ratings and comments people had made about our resort, however we were optimistic and went ahead. First I will get out of the way the FEW complaints I did have. We arrived at the hotel at around 12 o'clock in the afternoon exhausted. We were informed that we would have to wait until 3pm to check in, however our room and most others were ready around 1:30-2:00pm. In the meantime we were told where to change and given plently of drinks and food. Our room was very very cold and if we turned off the air conditioner the ceiling would drip from the condensation, but we found a happy medium and that problem was resolved. The rooms themselves were ok, no peeling paint, but the shower heads were a little flimsy, and the water pressure dies off in the afternoon, so take your shower or bath at night or in the morning. Some of the male staff were a little to flirty, but that was tolerable and...expected. Now for the postiives, the food was amazing, DEFINETLY book the resturants, espically the Italian (get the steak it's amazing!) The pools were very nice, no construction on either of them when we arrived, but there is construction near the ocean, out of the way. The ocean is beautiful the sand very white and clean. No peddelers to harrass us, and many many loungers with shade if you want. Lots of activities to keep you busy if you want to stay out of the sun for awhile. The staff is very very friendly and we made lots of friends even though we speak very little Spanish. There is a small store to buy more sunscreen, chips, souvenirs etc, but it's a little on the expensive side. The resort itself is spectacular very clean and beautiful, day and night! I would definetly suggest this resort for anyone who wants to have a good time relaxing or partying, this resort offers the best of both worlds. We are definetly going back next year!!!

<Content>Honeymoon in Punta Cana My husband and I traveled to the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort in Punta Cana for our honeymoon for 7 nights from July 10 鈥?July 17, 2006. We live near Chicago, Illinois (USA) and traveled from O鈥橦are Airport in Chicago. I (Sarah) am 34, and my husband (Mark) is 43. We had never traveled to the Caribbean and were happy with our first trip there. For our honeymoon, we were looking for a place to completely relax, but were also looking for something with options should we want to do something more active. We normally love to be active in the outdoors, but this time around were looking for more relaxation. The Ocean Bavaro met all of our needs. We booked the trip with Apple Vacations and were originally scheduled to stay at Natura Park. We received a call about 3 weeks before our trip informing us that Natura Park was over-booked, and were asked if we鈥檇 like to be upgraded to Ocean Bavaro. After much research of internet reviews, we decided to take the offer.One of the reasons we originally chose Natura Park was its manageable size. We had no desire to stay at an over-sized resort where you had to take trams to get from your room to the restaurants and beach. We chose Ocean Bavaro for the same reason, and were very happy with our decision in this regard. The size was absolutely perfect for us. The grounds were beautiful and felt spread out, but it was never more than a 5-10 minute walk, even if you went from corner to corner of the resort. It allowed for leisurely walking, but we never felt like anything was too far.AirportIt鈥檚 comical looking back on it, but our experience at the Punta Cana airport was a bit crazy. We assume your experience really depends on how many airlines arrive at the airport at the same time. For our trip, many airlines arrived at the same time, causing a mass of people trying to get through customs at the same time. There was absolutely no sense of a line, and no-one working at the airport to enforce a line 鈥?eventually this large mob of people just starting filling in on the sides of the crowd and pushing their way forward in whatever way they could. We really needed to be aggressive in keeping our place in line and forcing ourselves forward. I can see how some would be intimidated by it, it was mass confusion.You first need to buy a tourist card, which you purchase at a desk situated as an island in the middle of the lobby. Once you get your card, you proceed to the customs 鈥渓ine.鈥?br/>Once we were through customs, we found our Apple representative and bus very quickly and without problem. It was an efficient process. We had read in many reviews to be cautious of people posing as Apple representatives 鈥?they will sometimes wear floral shirts and try to imitate the look. We took the advice to look only for official Apple reps who could be identified by their badges, which only the Apple reps would be wearing.We found that things moved very quickly at the airport once we were through customs. Someone grabbed our suitcases to carry for us as we walked toward the bus, and we weren鈥檛 sure if it was someone working for Apple, or someone looking for a tip. We had to walk fast to keep an eye on the suitcases to make sure they got on the right bus. There wasn鈥檛 much communication, so our best advice is to just be smart: know where you are going, keep your eyes open, be aware of your surroundings, and be firm. We did not feel unsafe at all; it was more a feeling of confusion with so many people and buses surrounding you at one time.Check-inThe check-in process was really the only complication we had during our stay, and thankfully it happened first so we got it out of the way, and enjoyed the rest of our stay. The hotel says check-in is at 3 pm. There is a desk marked 鈥淰IP鈥?check-in, which is supposedly where Apple guests were supposed to check in during our trip. There literally was no communication as to how our check-in process would work. Several of us sat at the desk for some time without any word about a check-in process, and finally we took it upon ourselves to enter a customer service office adjacent to the lobby reception desk, and found that this person was responsible for checking Apple (and other) guests in. I think we would have sat for many hours more had we not taken the initiative. We arrived just before 3 pm, but there was no word on when our room would be ready. We specifically requested a room in Block 6, since this was the newest block of rooms and considered the nicest in the resort. A room in Block 6 was a condition we set for accepting a transfer to this resort. We were immediately promised a room in Block 6, and were told the room would be ready in 15 minutes. We got some food and a drink (a nice thing to be able to do while you were waiting; we were able to access the bar and food immediately). We waited and waited, and with no word from anyone, 15 minutes turned into an hour, and finally stepped back into the office. We were then told Block 6 was no longer available, but they could offer us a large suite immediately. We knew the room was in the building next to the buffet, which we had read was very old and noisy. We refused, and since we were promised a room in block 6, remained firm on the promise they had made us. We quickly found it required a lot of POLITE firmness with the customer service representative to make ourselves heard. We stopped back into her office frequently during our waiting time to check on the progress; otherwise we felt we were just set to the side and forgotten. She was trying her best and was gracious, but there was obviously a lack of communication about the assignment of rooms, and when they were cleaned and available. It was several hours of frustration for us and many other guests before we finally got into a room in Block 6 as we were promised.Despite the frustration of traveling all day and not being able to get into a room when promised and start your vacation, we knew the staff were working hard and trying to accommodate us. We witnessed some rude behavior by other guests when their needs were not met. We were all frustrated, but angry and negative behavior really gets you no-where. It is possible to be polite and firm at the same time; the staff at least deserves this respect.RoomOnce our room was ready, we were transported by golf carts with our luggage to our building which was a nice convenience. Block 6 is considered the Spa building, and we found it to be the most luxurious of all the blocks.On your first day of arrival the staff delivers a big basket to your room with wonderful fruit, cheeses, and meat. They also deliver water and beer; though the beer was never delivered to our room.The room in Block 6 was a suite with a large bathroom 鈥?2 sinks, a shower, and Jacuzzi, and it was all very clean, every day. We had a king sized bed, and two steps down led to a small area with a daybed, entertainment center with TV, and mini bar. The bar contained bottled water and Pepsi. We had read the fridges were to be stocked with beer, but that was never the case. I鈥檓 sure we would have gotten some had we asked, but there was really no need. There was a very nice small balcony with a plastic table and two chairs, and the view could not be beat. The balcony looked directly out onto the ocean and the beach. Just stunning. We really enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the evening after a long day at the beach. Block 6 is literally on the beach 鈥?you walk out the side door, and there you are on the beach.We learned from other reviewers the idea of bringing small gifts for the maids. They work so hard and for so little, and seemed to really appreciate these gifts. We brought make-up, slippers, socks, crayons, pencils and pens, and things for children. We left several of these gifts on our pillows each morning with a simple thank-you note in Spanish (we don鈥檛 speak Spanish but picked out basic phrases from a book), along with 2-3 single dollar bills every day. If we needed more water, we left a note on the pillow asking for more, and by the end of the week our fridge was stocked full of water; more than we needed. The response from the staff cleaning the room was wonderful. In general, learning a few Spanish phrases will get you far. Everyone on staff was so friendly and interested in saying hello, an 鈥渉ola鈥?as you walked by someone was very appreciated and a huge smile was always received. We found the staff to be incredibly friendly, warm, and helpful. Naturally, most speak Spanish only, so go there knowing this.BeachAbsolutely gorgeous; this is what we went for. Beautiful sand, not too hot to walk on. We rarely had a problem getting chairs. If you walk to the far end of the resort where it borders the vendor huts there were typically more chairs to be found. Most of the time we were able to find sunny spots as well as shady spots under the wonderful thatched roof umbrellas. Only one day did it rain, and we sat under our umbrella the whole time and didn鈥檛 get wet, it was beautiful. The beach was very large and there was plenty of room to spread out.There was a wonderful constant breeze on the beach. We never felt overly hot or stifled because of the breeze. It was very humid while we were there, but being on the beach was so refreshing.There is a roped-off swimming area in the water, which was incredibly warm. The waves were not very high, and the swimming was good. The whole area where the resort is located is protected by a coral reef which extends at least a mile off the beach. This reduces the waves on the beach and makes the water pretty calm. There is no snorkeling directly off the beach, as the water is too sandy.When you check-in you are given a towel card. Every day you need to give exchange your towel card for a towel at the towel hut on the beach. Do not lose your card or you will be charged. At the end of the day, you drop off your towel and pick up your card again. Only one day did they run out of towels, which was VERY aggravating. It was on the weekend, when a lot of new people had checked into the resort for a long weekend and they couldn鈥檛 keep up with the towels. Other than that, there were plenty of towels.The animation team is out working the crowd in the morning and then late afternoon. They took a break from about 11 am 鈥?3 pm. The music was very loud directly near where they were centered, so if you are looking for a quieter place to sit on the beach, we鈥檇 recommend not sitting near their speaker systems. They were not pushy at all, and there were quite a few people who participated in daily dancing lessons, sports games, etc. There are plenty of quiet spots on the beach to get away from the noise.As you鈥檒l read in other reviews, there is definitely topless sunbathing, mostly by the European crowd. It was subtle and natural.ActivitiesWe took advantage of the free non-motorized water sports at the resort. My husband sails, so we took the hobie cat out almost every day 鈥?it was amazing. You can take the boats out for 30 minutes each day, and you are required to sign up for a slot in advance. The boats literally skim the coral once you are out which is amazing. The water is so clear we actually saw brightly colored fish swimming around the coral.We also took the single kayaks out on the water. Paddling was so easy and relaxing.You can also learn to wind surf, though not many people were having much luck with it.In terms of culture in Punta Cana, this is an area we felt was lacking. When traveling, we like to absorb the culture of our surroundings. We felt there to be little intellectual cultural stimulation; we were very insulated by the resort. There are no towns to explore or no way to absorb yourself in the true life of the DR. Partly, this is to do the poor economy, as the resorts have made themselves their own mini-city separated from the outlying areas. There are some excursions which offer trips to larger cities in the DR, but this requires almost a full day of traveling away from the resort. This truly was a beach resort trip, with little other cultural immersion.BarsThe bars are plentiful on the resort! They were all over the beaches, you never had to walk far to find one. The beer was pretty good, but definitely a light beer 鈥?Miller style. The frozen drinks on the beaches such a pina coladas and margaritas were from a frozen drink machine. Rum was readily available and it was so good!The lobby bar was by far the best bar at the resort. The drinks were mixed freshly, and margaritas were actually shaken and not from a machine. Definitely take advantage of the drink specials which are advertised on display cards on the bar 鈥?they are amazing. Our favorite was the Amore Tropical and we still crave it.Unless you are a super VIP guest, none of the all-inclusive drinks are top shelf; they are moderate at best. You can purchase a top shelf drink for $3 per drink, which was reasonable and we took advantage of it in the evenings. Bring your singles! Change is typically not available at the bars (see 鈥淕eneral Advice鈥?below).Early in the week we got the novelty of 鈥渄rink as much as you want whenever you want鈥?out of our systems early. Just a reminder that a day full of hot sun and a drink in your hand at all hours takes a toll on the body! Pina Coladas were a great start for breakfast just one day, but it鈥檚 a long day! We were quickly reminded how dehydrating the sun can be and learned to pace ourselves.PoolsThe pools were beautiful. There were three altogether we had access to. The main pool has a swim-up bar which is so much fun. It was busy most of the time, but we never waited long for drinks, we were always served quickly. We spent most of our time on the beach so never laid by the pools, but took dips in them occasionally. It was much more humid by the pools and inside the resort because the ocean breeze didn鈥檛 make it in that far, so we stayed mostly on the beach.ExcursionsWe wanted to get some snorkeling in and enjoy the water more, so we took a 陆 day snorkeling excursion which we booked through Apple Vacations (the reps have a hut on the resort and are available every day if you need help or need to book tours). The bus picked us up in front of the resort, and then we went around to about 6 more resorts to pick more people up. This was a little long, as we drove from resort to resort. Once we got to the location, we all got on a big boat. We headed out not too far to a roped-off section of water. We got our snorkeling gear and floating devices, and jumped in the water and for about 陆 hour snorkeled our way over to the roped off area. We saw a lot of really amazing fish along the way in all kinds of colors. The protected area had nurse sharks and sting rays in it. You literally swim right above them. There are also all kinds of fish in there. It was a bit crowded at times with people snorkeling, but it was amazing to see the sharks so close up.Once back on the boat, they sent around fresh coconut and made pina coladas which they sent around in small cups. We took a boat tour of the coast which was beautiful. We saw virgin coastline as well as the fronts of many resorts. At one point the boat stopped in a natural bay area with a sandy bottom and shallow water. We all jumped off the boat and hung out in the incredibly warm and peaceful water. The boat played Bob Marley music and the staff walked around in the water serving cups of beer off a tray. It was a very cool experience. Looking back I would have liked more natural snorkeling, but the trip was nice for what it was, and it got us out on the water like we wanted.FoodMain Buffet: We really liked the main buffet. I am a vegetarian (and I eat fish), and I found plenty to eat throughout our trip. I absolutely loved the bean dishes every day for lunch and dinner, and the fish was plentiful. Even without fish there was plenty to eat. My husband doesn鈥檛 typically eat a lot of meat either, and found plenty of selections, meat and non-meat. He was impressed by the carving station several times throughout the week. The food does get a little repetitive, but there was enough variety that you could always find something. The DR is not known for their food, and we knew that going into it and didn鈥檛 have high expectations. We loved the fresh fruit smoothies every morning; I still crave that banana shake. The fresh fruit was simply amazing. The mango was out of this world, you just can鈥檛 get fruit that tastes like that in the U.S.We never got 鈥渟ick,鈥?but we did find ourselves a bit nauseous at times throughout the week. We were prepared for that in advance, and had plenty of Pepto Bismol and Immodium. We know that was because the food was prepared and cooked in things we aren鈥檛 used to eating, so we tried to eat in moderation to avoid anything severe and it worked out pretty well.Several of the friends we met from England were very sick with stomach problems for several days; it kept them to their rooms. They remarked that the people they met from the U.S. were not getting sick as severely as the people from England. We couldn鈥檛 figure that one out, but that was their observation.A note on wine: if you enjoy good wine, don鈥檛 have high hopes in the DR. The house wine, to us, tasted like water. There literally was no taste to it. In the a la carte restaurants they will offer you a bottle of wine to purchase for $15. Since the house wine was so poor, we didn鈥檛 want to take a chance on spending that much money for a bottle of wine. We decided to stick to the rum and were happy with that decision. Do, however, try the mamajuana if you get a chance. It鈥檚 a local mixture of rum and honey stored in a bottle with roots and sticks to give it an earthy flavor, it was almost like a port. We really liked it. A La Carte Restaurants:Definitely book these as early in the morning as you can, they fill up very quickly. We tried to eat most of our dinners in these restaurants just for variety.Mexican: We never ate here, as it sounded pretty generic.Japanese: Amazing! Very highly recommended. The food was just excellent, and the cooking entertaining. This was our favorite restaurant by far.Spanish: We really enjoyed the Spanish restaurant. It was a relaxing way to spend a dinner, quiet and romantic. We had a wonderful server bring by a cart of after-dinner drinks, and after my selection of sambuca, he proceeded to pour it into two glasses, light the liquid on fire, and then performed a show by pouring the bright blue liquid on fire from glass to glass. It was quite a show! He was wonderful and had a great sense of humor. You will recognize his unique laugh if you run across him, treat him well.Italian: We did not have a good experience at the Italian restaurant. The food was bland, and our main entrees were the same food that was served at the buffet, just larger quantities. We actually left before finishing our meal. All of these restaurants share the kitchen with the buffet kitchen, so the food is very similar in some cases, even though you are ordering off a menu.Brazilian: As I am vegetarian and they basically offer meat selections, we did not eat here.Coffee House: This was a nice place to stop in the morning or the evening for some specialty coffee drinks. My husband had a beautiful frozen mocha drink one day with chocolate drizzled on it and it was quite a treat. They also made fruit smoothies which were very good. A note about coffee: the DR only serves instant decaf everywhere. I don鈥檛 drink caffeine, which was not a problem to deal with for a week, but just something to know in advance.PeopleAs other reviewers have mentioned, the majority of the visitors were European. We found this to be wonderful as we both love Europe, and almost felt like we were on a European holiday. We met many wonderful people from England, especially our new friends John, Julie, Ryan and Shania. It was great fun meeting new people and enjoying the tropical environment.General AdviceTake lots of one dollar bills!!!! We can鈥檛 emphasize this enough. We read this advice from another reviewer before we left, and don鈥檛 know what we would have done without them. You will not be able to get American cash or change at the resort; we ran into others who had a hard time with this. The staff works so hard, so we were sure to leave a dollar to our server at the buffet, to the bartender, the maid, and anyone else we might encounter that helped us. It鈥檚 amazing how much a dollar bill can go in the DR, it really is appreciated and while it wasn鈥檛 much, we felt it was the least we could do. We found it sad outside of the resort areas how devastatingly poor the country is; the resorts are really very insulated. We tried not to forget this as the staff waited on us during the week we were there.Overall, we loved our trip to Punta Cana, and really enjoyed the Ocean Bavaro. It was extremely clean and friendly, and had everything we were looking for. It was a perfect honeymoon for us. Beautiful weather and a beautiful location, it was a very special trip and we still think of it and smile and long for that ocean breeze.We like to travel a lot and see different places, and if we go back to the Caribbean some day we will try a different location and resort. There are too many things to see in the world to stay at the same place twice for us.

<Content>Family of 6 had a great time We just returned from a relaxing week long vacation for a party of' '6' - 2 adults, 3 teenagers, 1 tween.November 3-10Our arrival to the resort was before the 3:00 check in. As we had read many of the reviews, we were prepared for the wait. Upon arrival, they gave us our 'bracelets' and we met with our Apple representative. Our representative was great. We had lunch and then some of us 'hit the beach' while others 'roamed around grounds while waiting for our rooms.We were in Block 5. 5317 - awesome beach/ocean view; and 5301- also a nice view of the beach/ocean. 5301 did have trouble with the airconditioning, but it was taken care of within a reasonable amount of time. The maid service was wonderful. We also leave a small tip each day even though it is 'All Inclusive'.All 6 of us are 'beach bums'. The beach was beautiful and neatly kept. We did have a few days of rougher than normal water, but that certainly did not keep us out. Compared with some of the other resorts (we walked up and down the beach), we had very little sea weed. The chairs were plentiful - with the exception of the Holiday weekend. We spent very little time at the pool- other than for a late afternoon snack. The pool activity we saw seemed to surround the swim up bar. - not really our thing, but certainly enjoyable for others. I can say that the pool bar did have the best mixed drinks. The buffet was good. I have to give credit to those preparing the menu trying to please so many different appetites. Even within our family- we have fish lovers, meat and potatoes kids, and pasta/pizza munchers. No one went hungry! Desserts were also very good. As mentioned in other reviews- there are 5 different restaurants. We tried the Mexican, Italian, and the Brazilian restaurants. The surprising favorite was the Brazilian.... and to think the kids all rolled their eyes when I told them where we were eating that night. The service at all 3 was fabulous.Our only complaint with the resort stems from 2 incidents occurring over the 'Dominican Holiday Weekend'. The resort was packed/overfilled/overbooked- you get the idea- over the weekend. I don't mind waiting for a table, for service at the beach grill, or for a drink at the bar. I do mind being next in line and having the employee look right at you, and then find a fellow Dominican further down the line, wait on them first, and then continue until all the fellow Dominicans are taken care of. There were at least 4 of us 'overlooked' at the beach grill at lunch and another bunch of us at the lobby bar. It certainly didn't ruin the vacation or the day, but it is something to keep in mind when traveling again..... watch for local holidays.... unless you speak fluent Spanish.'Spa' Services- massage on the beach- 1 hour- $30- awesome.Braids for the tween- $20- half of her head.We did one side trip- the Marinarium- very good!!This was our 4th ftip to DR. 2nd in Punta Cana.

<Content>What is the problem? I thought the resort was excellent. I was concerned about staying a full week but when it came time to leave, I was sad.  I had read the reviews before I left. When I arrived I promptly asked for block 5. Apparently, this is a very popular block as is was filled and remained filled the whole week. No problem (as all of the Domincan people would say) the room we had was spacious, had good water pressure and great air conditioning. By the way I was in block 10. It was further away from the beach but the room was nicer than the other rooms that were closer. The food in the buffet areas were okay. They are catered towards the Europeans. As Americans we did not find the food very flavorful. I made reservations for the restaurants every night. Each restaurant was excellent in its own way. It was my sister's birthday and we celebrated twice, once at the Italian and once at the Japanese restaurant. Le Cafe' (the coffee shop) and the Sports bar were excellent. When I became a little homesick I visted there. It is very americanized.The staff is great. Very eager to communicate. I learned quite a bit about spanish and the Dominican culture. The entertainment was very good. I CAN NOT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW EXCELLENT THE SAX PLAYER IS! Every night I sat at the coffee shop, got my cup of tea and listened to the sax player and the pianist. It was Kenny G quality. Make sure you catch it at least one night you are there.I am really outgoing and I enjoyed the archery and tennis. I like to work out and the Spa is awesome! The sauna after a workout was a bonus. The view and breeze from the top open floor of the spa was to die for. Make sure you visit the spa!Of course I got a beach massage. For thirty dollars I received an hour massage. (cheapy, cheapy!)Overall it was a great vacation and I am very pleased with the resort. I really don't have a bad thing to say about it. The Apple rep's (Apple Vacation is who I booked thru) are helpful and knowledgable. Especially Rafael. He booked an excursion for us and he was well versed in five languages! As was much of the staff.Some tips I have are bring a raft, the ocean has alot of seaweed and its a little cumbersome to swim in. The big mugs worked out well, I used my mostly for water but there were occasions when I filled it up with beer! A great drink I discovered while I was there is the dominican champagne it is 7-up with dominican rum, yummy! It gave me a good buzz without a hangover. Also, if you are looking for things to bring, I was told that the local school children needed shoes, school supplies, hair ties etc. Consumable goods are very expensive here. A baseball or toy car will go alot further than a buck for a tip.No matter what happens, remember you are on vacation! If you are having a hard time with something try one of the american places or the spa I mentioned. It will help put things back into perspective.

<Content>The Good The Bad And The Ugly The Good The Bad and The UglyThis report is on the Ocean Bavaro Spa  Beach Resort in the DR (Dominican Republic)Back Ground of travelers: Male and Female, married 42 years in our early 60鈥檚. We have traveled to the DR twice in the past 20 years and have traveled extensively through out the Caribbean, always to all-inclusive resorts. Our tour operator was: Sun Wing Tours.This hotel does live up to its four star rating in a few areas and falls short in others. Let us begin with the arrival. (THE GOOD) Our reception at the front desk was courteous and warm and they understood and spoke English well enough. (THE BAD) Our arrival was at noon and we where the first new group arrivals of the day. We requested our room and they informed us that it was quite impossible to give us a room until after 3pm, as this was the normal check in time. This was a bit of an inconvenience but we understood the rule. We asked it they could supply us with an area to take our bags and change into swimwear. They directed us to the public washrooms we did not like the idea and they could not understand. (THE GOOD) We perspired for three hours before getting our room. Our request for a room near the pool and the ocean was complied with.(THE UGLY) We arrived in our room and the floor was still very wet from being cleaned. Only two towels paint pealing from most of the wood trim in the room, shower head falling off wall, mirror doors on closet fell off hinges on to foot and over on my wife鈥?never did get fixed for the week (THE GOOD) Our building was number five and we recommend it, as it was locate steps from the ocean, the pool and the bar (THE GOOD) Off to lunch in the main dinning room, food was plentiful and tasty(THE UGLY) The main pool was under construction (THE UGLY) The other pool with swim up bar had one to many drunks. (THE GOOD) We spent 99% of our time down at the beach where there was lots of space and lots of loungers.(THE GOOD) The beach was very long and the sand was awesome (THE UGLY) They only had one fresh water shower that stopped working half way through the week for 200 ++ people (THE UGLY) The pool they where working on was near the beach and the noise of the work going on in the pool area with trucks coming and going and workers tearing up cement with chisels and hammers was most annoying. (THE GOOD) No peddlers on the beach as the beach and hotel is very well secured(THE UGLY) We do no advice anyone to go off the Resort unless you are in a group. We did and we witnessed a landing of illegal Haitians with armed smugglers and all.(THE BAD) Check out the theme restaurants on the first night you arrive. You can go into these restaurants without a booking after 9 pm. Just drop in and see the food they have to over and you can be the judge. Mary and I liked the Japanese only out of the group. (THE GOOD) The lobster night which is an extra charge is well worth the price if you are a shell fish lover as we are. They serve on the beach under the stars and the service is fabulous. (THE UGLY) We where not informed until on return that the Punta Cana area is on the World Health alert for Malaria, Hype a and b. GET YOUR SHOTS BEFORE YOU GO.

<Content>Don't go here We stayed here Oct.8 to Oct.15. 2006.We booked with 18 people.They came with me to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary and watch us renew our vows. I called the resort and emailed before we got there.Ocean Bavaro never emailed me back.I went to guess services upon arrival and they printed me out a package written in spanish that I could not read but for the $900.00 U.S.I told them again that I did not need a package deal just 10 min. of thier time on Oct.10 on the beach at sunset.They told me for 3 days to keep coming back and every time I went back they told me to come back again.A friend of mine ended up saying our vows to us because the hotel didn't want to be bothered with me.I was willing to pay them 150.00. The resort was nice but the beach was littered with plates,cups,straws,and cigarett butts.My bathroom ceilng leaked when it rained it rained 3 times when we were there.At least my room didn't flood like others.We were bugged all the time by time share people who could not take no for an answer. The food was bad for the most part.By wed. all 18 of us had the diarrhea and not from drinking the water.The servers would take your plates and drinks away before we were done with them.You could not go back up for seconds at the restaurants they would tell you no more.Depending on the girl taking your request whether she understood any language that day is whether you got in the restaurants or not.I got the feeling the did not like americans just our money.I understand that ocean bavaro is a 4 apple and how I don't understand. I've stayed at other 4 apples and was treated far better .Ocean Bavaro should be a 1 or 2 apple based on service alone. SAVE YOUR MONEY GO SOME PLACE ELSE!

<Content>Friends renewing their vows at the beach We went to this resort with some friends of ours. Our friends were renewing their vows on the beach for their 10th wedding anniversary. From the moment of check-in we had nothing but problems. The only good thing I can say about this resort is the pools are great and the ocean is beautiful. The hotel lacks in customer service and friendliness. For example, the night we arrived my husband was tired, so he fell asleep in the hotel room. I went to get something to eat and when I came back there were two extra beach towels (wet) at the foot of our bed. The two we used were hanging on the balcony. (someone was in the room!) I spoke with the front desk regarding the matter and was told I would have to come back in the morning. It was 8p.m. and the guest services were closed. We came back in the morning and were told to come back at 10:00a.m. We did. Then, we were told to come back at 2p.m. Again, we did. The final time we were told was 3p.m. We were given a different room but it was a downgrade from what we had the first time. This was just one of the many problems we encountered at this resort. We all booked through the same travel agent and were put in all different areas of the resort. Some people had basic rooms, some with spa rooms. This is the fault of the management. Apple Vacations is a major contributor to their facility. You would think that the hotel management would have a better system then what they do. The food selection is something to be desired. The service is unfriendly. Out of the restaurants that require reservations, the japanese is the best. There is a huge language barrier, even if you know basic spanish. The staff who make the reservations for the restaurants speak no english. The front desk staff speaks some english, but they forget their enlglish when you have a problem. Yes, this is their country and it is their language, but they are a facility who get guests from all around the world. English is a dominant language. You would think that they would make the effort at the resorts to teach their staff basic english. The same effort that travelers make to learn basic spanish. We have visited other resorts in Punta Cana. We never have been treated with such rudeness and there was never a language barrier. We will never go to this resort again. If you don't care about food, service, quality of hotel rooms, friendliness and you intend on spending all your time at the beach... This would be your resort.

<Content>Don't waste your money ! My wife and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro resort with several friends in Punta Cana, D.R. from 08 OCT 2006 to 15 OCT 2006 as booked through Apple Vacations.Although the resort grounds themselves were quite nicely cared for, the service offered there didn't measure up nearly as well. There were several problems that truly effected the quality of our experience:1. Several members of our group experienced the loss of their luggage AFTER it had been delivered to the curbside of the main lobby of the resort. It ended up in Santo Domingo and was not returned until the following day. Fortunately, there was no loss of property but, needless to say, the members of our group were NOT impressed by the inconvenience this caused them and the discomfort resulting from the inablilty to obtain their medications as needed.2. Upon our arrival at 11:00 a.m., we were advised that our rooms would not be available to us until after 3:00 p.m. and that we would have to wait in the lobby until such time that they were ready. At the end of our 4+ hour wait (during which the luggage came up missing as described above) we were told that there was going to be another 'slight delay' as our rooms were still not ready. When after 30 minutes had passed, we were finally shown to our rooms, we experienced several problems that caused more delays and cost us more of our time. These delays were: sending one of our group to a room already ocuppied by other guests, several members of our group found their room air conditioning units to either completely non-functional or malfunctioning severely and dumping large quatities of water upon the floor as a result, and one of the rooms had suffered such extreme water damage to the ceiling that several cracks in the ceiling could be seen emanating in many directions and seemed to be ready to fail structurally.3. Several of the staff demonstrated a less than helpful attitude in that; when addressed in English claimed not to know English and when addressed in Spanish by one of our group in that language would then pretend not to comprehend that language either until a stern tone and aggressive posture was taken with them. When this occurred, they then seemed to recall their comprehension of either language (Spanish or English) that suited them and things proceeded along until the next contact with staff that again mandated a reassertion of the above method with the offending staff. This became quite annoying (and tiring) after it persisted for the first three days and became a sore point for all of us in that we spent so much time dealing with such a resistive staff.4. Additionally, we were all subjected to a never-ending, high pressure sales pitch from Amstar staff on-site to go view a time-share facility nearby. The Amstar staff present on the resort would constantly approach us with an aggressive demand that we go on a bus ride to the time-share facility in exchange for some free merchandise of low value and after being told no several times, eventually in an angry tone as a result of all the badgering, would then re-approach us again if we returned to the lobby area even as little as ten minutes later. We would then be subjected again to the same strenuous, badgering that we had just endured as if it had never happened minutes prior to this. This remained a problem throughout the duration of our 7 day stay at the resort and generated animosity in many of our group or the uncomfortable situation that it had become. I approached the resort staff on more than one occasion about this issue and was dismissed without resolution of the problem. This issue alone was enough to ensure that I will never, ever return to this resort as I feel that there are better things to do with my vacation time than fend off overly aggressive salesmen with, Don't take 'no' for an answer sales tactics. That they would proceed to follow us about the resort attempting to argue that we should just go for a 'leetle' bus ride after ebing told 'no' repeatedly and often angrily due to our frustration at these repeated assaults, approached the obscenely ludicrous.5. Finally, the aggressive sales pitch tactics were also used by several of the resort staff during our meals in that we were often pressured to buy bottles of wine and other items while dining and being served wine with our meal and such were offered at ridiculously high prices, an obvious attempted to fleece us for a few more dollars. The food quality was unpalatable at best and inedible at the worst and the buffet area was frequented by various types of birds that tended to roost in the rafters above the food with unsanitary, albeit predictable results.6. Guest behavior at this resort also proved to be an issue as on several occasions when my wife and I would decide to get into the pool or the ocean for a brief time we would return to our chairs to find our articles that we had placed on our chairs in our absence, cast upon the ground and kicked out of the way. In one particular instance we returned to find our chairs taken over in such a manner by a hispanic female in her 30's and her children who was in the process of using my chair as a changing table for her infant who had soiled his diaper in a rather 'large' way and was not being very careful with where the fecal matter ended up. She acted as if she didn't realize that she had done wrong but there was no way that she could not have known that someone was using the chairs because she had to have moved quite a bit of our personal belongings in order to use the chairs.Despite this egregious behavior by the staff, we found that they always had a hand out for a tip, despite that we were told that this was an all-inclusive resort and soliciting tips was not permitted.Be warned !!! Stay away from Ocean Bavaro resort via Apple Vacations in Punta Cana, D.R. Apple rated it 'four apples' and they are all rotten !!! I just wish that I could get my time back so that I could go somewhere else and actualy enjoy my vacation.

<Content>Great Holiday Just returned from 2 weeks at the Ocean Bavaro Resort Hotel with a party of 6 adults and had a fantastic time. Booked holiday through First Choice on the internet and flew from East Midlands Airport.(not Gatwick thank heavens).O.K not every inch of wall was painted perfectly or every bathroom tile was spot on square but the hotel was very cleen, the food was good and the entertainment was o.k. This is a 3/4 star hotel (if you want The Ritz then then you should book the Ritz). We paid 拢700 each All Inclusive which i thought was good value.The staff are friendly and helpfull and always cleaning and checking that things are o.k in the hotel and also around the Swimming pools and gardens.Tried all the restaurants and liked the Mexican the best.The shop on site is a bit limited in its stock but you can grab a bargain if you haggle a bit.Went on Jungle Safari it was fantastic and the guide really knew his stuff (Alex) and also this helps the local school children.Caribbean Festival trip was good swimming with sharks and sting rays was great but the crew tried to make it a bit like a party.Overall i would say this is a good hotel for the price.

<Content>Great place for the price All of the people writing the bad reviews must be extremely picky and not able to make fun out of their vacation. The only thing that I will agree with was the food. Do not go to this resort if you want fancy cuisine. I would not eat at the buffet because it was outdoor and there are birds but I went in a group of 11 people and they liked it for breakfast. The cafe serves really good coffee and pastries which is where I got my breakfast. The brazilian restaurant puts out a yummy lunch buffet everyday that is near the pools and we made sure we made reservations for the restaurants each night. We ate at every single one and I really liked the food at all of them. I was with a group of people who spoke spanish and it did help us out alot. Even if you know a little spanish and use it to flirt with the people to work there you will get served over the other snobby people who just stand there. The rooms are standard-nothing speical but they were clean and we always had hot water. We were in Block 10 but it was really far so I tipped the front desk guy $20 and he moved us to Block 5 in a day. The people that work there respond to tips so if you are polite and willing to give a couple bucks they will remember you and serve you faster. The people that work there are so hardworking. They are doing the activities in the morning and the shows at night-way over 12 hour shifts and they do not get paid alot. The nightlife is not really much to speak of but if you know how to make your own fun the bars in the resort and the disco can be fun. The sports bar is nice, the lobby bar and the pool bar were also fun spots to hang out in. We also went out of the resort to a club called Mangu and I TOTALLY reccomended it. It was our best night in Punta Cana and it was nothing like I expected. The beach was beautiful and the pool with the swimup bar was really nice. We also went on one of the excursions snorkeling and swimming with nurse sharks and stnig rays. It was a little pricey but so worth the money. We stopped in a shallow part of the ocean and had a floating bar. It was really fun. Basically if you go to this resort with fun people and you know how to make your own fun it is a great place to go for the cheap price. We went for 5 days and 6 days for $869 with air and everything included with apple vacations. They treat the guests from apple vacations a lot better than others so if you can go through them I would reccomend it. Hope this review was useful and don't let the other reviews scare you off. I loved it and I have gone to Greece, England, Vegas, Arizona, Mexico and stayed at beautiful places before.

<Content>Ok, worth what I paid. We just returned from a week long stay at this resort on 9/24/06. I have traveled a lot and and here is what I think. This is not a 4 star resort, more like an American 3 star resort. Here is the following:The rooms: we were in block 6 - which is the spa elite club portion of the hotel, if you can upgrade to this part of the resort, it is a good idea. The rooms and bathrooms are better than the standard rooms. It is also located on a quiter part of the resort. The Food: terrible. Good if you want to loose weight while you are on vacation. As a matter of fact, everyone we spoke to felt the same way, so I know it was not just us being picky. The beach: one of the nicest I have seen. If you want to get a hut (which is a good idea as the sun is strong), you need to put your towels on the chairs under the hut very early, do it by 6AM - and be sure to put your towel on all of the chais under the hut, even if you are not using all 4 chairs, or you will be sharing your hut and be unable to move your chair according to the sun. The pools: pretty lame, but really doesn't matter as the beach is so nice, who wants to be at the pool? Entertainment - very lame. don't count on anything great. The person impersonanting Michael Jackson will likely be serving your coffee in the morning for breakfast. Most of the employees do service and enteraintment - need I say more?The people - the Domicians were very nice. We speak fluent in spanish, so I think this helps. I did notice some other reviews before we went about not helping people who only speak english and I do have to say, I did notice this with people who only speak englisth. I don't advise going here unless you can get around with a little spanish. In general: less than 5% were Americans, mostly Spaniards and Itailians. They can be quite rude in my experience, so you just have to ignore it. Topless sun bathing is about 70% on the beach, so if you don't want to see it, don't go here. Also, bring cash. While they say they accept credit cards, they don't everywhere on the resort. None of the stores accepts credit cards and if you want to do any water sports, it cost! Anything over about $75 will only accept cash. Bring your cash as the ATM's only give Peso's. Again, I'm telling you, bring your cash, or you will be dissappointed. If you have a problem - complain to the manager, but don't expect him to keep his appointment. We did complain, and finally he kept his 3rd appointment as the food was so bad. Let him know, he needs to hear it. As we said, the place is really nice, but boy the food stinks. The place would be really good if it had better food. Only he can change it, so either complain about what you are not happy about and let them know what you are happy about or they will never know.Would I go back here? No. But only because there are so many places to see. I got a really good deal on the vacation, if I had paid more, I probably would have been a bit upset with the experience. But for what I paid ($930 for 6 days, all inclusive, including air and everything else), it was worth it (just to give you a gage on price and what it is worth). it was nice, I wish the food was better, I wish they treated the Americans better and took credit cards - if they did, I would say this would be the perfect place!. Buyt hey, no place is perfect. It is an experience to be enjoyed. Last bit of advise - if you go and have the same problems, just drink a lot - it's all included and will make you feel better.

<Content>Beautiful waters and Island, boring resort. I am a teenager and i stayed here for about a week. even though i am a teenager i know a good hotel. There wasnt much to do at night especially becuase we werent in peak season. my parents complained that the casino was closed i dont know what the was about.. the food was okay nothing special i ate at the japanese, brazilian and bucenero. All decent nothing great. although my parents complained about the food it didnt seem that bad to me and my friend. (we are 15)... We were in the elite club it was nice spacious rooms with beautiful ocean views..the ocean is beautiful and i would suggest going to the sport hut and renting a boat and going scuba diving it was so much fun. (when you are on the boats ask the guys to take you to the nicest beach around) we did and it was gorgeous!There isnt much to do at night. At all especially for us teens we were usually asleep by 11 to save ourselves from bordeum.the beach was nice it could get seaweedy but it didnt matter to me that much. and a guy comes around with diffrent animals once in awhile and takes picture. i got to hold a monkey! there was also a snake and iguana ... probley more.as for the islanders... they were VERY friendly.. a little too friendly sometimes, to the point where it got creepy but if you just ignore it and tell them to go away and dont give off the wrong signals it would be ok.i was american and there were not many americans there. mostly italian and spaniards... i found some of the itlians to be very rude but i rubbed it off.overall it was a good vacation. i woudlnt stay here again but it wasnt anything horrible.i loved this island it was amazing.

<Content>dirty and boring when we got to check in we were left to find our room which are in loads of blocks with no help from anyone. when we got to our room it was dirty very basic and not a 4 star which was advertised in the brochure ( when we got back home the brochure had changed to a 3 star property) we tried to use our phone card but all reception staff cannot speak a word of english so we couldnt get any help. the beachw as beautiful and the only good thing about the island. we couldnt go out anywhere without booking excursions which were expensive. the entertainment was rubbish and lasted half an hour. food was ok but my boyfriend ended up with an upset stomach leaving him in bed for 2 days solid. tv kept cutting out and we just didnt have anything to do. it was so boring and there is only so much time you can go for a walk on the beach. hopefully this place has changed for the better since we were here but my advice is go elsewhere - the barcelo bavaro hotel looked very nice.

<Content>Any Where but here The service was less than adaquate. The hotel check in was suppose to be a 3:00p.m, we didn't get a room till after 7:00p.m. we were suppose to be in bloque 6 but they tried to put us in a room with only one small bed and it was filthy dirty with a scratched number on the door that you couldn't hardly see. This was bloque 7 on the first first floor. We ended up on the 2nd floor which was just OK. They need to upgrade the rooms. Our room didn't even have a chair or a luggage stand. Our safe was broken and it took them a few days to fix it. there was a blanket covering the window. We had very little hot water for showers. The houskeepers were wonderful, they tried to give you what you needed, The restaurant help was good also. It is just the rooms and the guest services, the reception desk that didn't know what they were doing. Once they had your money , you were done for. I would not recommend staying here. This is our 5th time in Punta Cana and we never had any problems with anywhere else we stayed at. We will be going back again next year but it won't be at this resort,.Deb Belancikdebra.belancik@pw.utc.com

<Content>Better than expected! We visited this resort the week of Aug. 11th through Aug. 18th using Apple Vacations through our travel agent. We have always been very pleased with any trips we have booked through Apple  this one was no exception.  After reading numerous 'bad' reviews about this resort my wife  I didn't know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised at how unfair, we think, these reviews were! We do not stay at the top of the line resorts. We look for the good deals  this one was one of them. Sure it wasn't as nice as some other places but when you pay 1/2 to 2/3 less than the other places it was just fine with us. This resort was very nice. The grounds were very well kept. Our room was close to the beach which is what we wanted. We stayed in Bloque 5. The air conditioning worked very well, the shower had plenty of hot water  worked better than most of the hotels we've stayed at in the states. We also used the in-room safe which cost an extra $20 for the week. There was also a $20 deposit. We never had any problems with it. Our rooms mini refrigerator (included) was always stocked with bottled water  pop daily. We rarely spent any time in our room other than to sleep, shower,  change our clothes. We did watch some news on the TV which also worked fine. The beach was quite large with plenty of chairs. You do have to get up early  put your towels on the chairs if you want to be under a beach hut. We usually did this before we went to breakfast at 7 am. Beach towel cards are included and in order to get fresh ones you must turn in your towels before 6 pm in order to get new ones at 8 am the next morning. Yes, there is some 'seaweed' at the beach. It is more like pieces of sea grass that wash up. We didn't have a problem with this. Each morning workers would be out raking it up  hauling it away. The beach is near a lot of motorized water sports  sometimes the fumes can get strong but there was always a breeze  they quickly dissipated. This resort had numerous restaurants but we only used a couple of the buffet restaurants. The food was very good and the selections varied daily for dinner. We always had a good meal. We also used the snack bar restaurant near the pool each day for lunch. Again, no problem here.  We went on two extra excursions that we booked from our resort using our Apple Representatives, who were always there when they said they would be. The first was to Santo Domingo, an all day trip, the capitol of DR. It was an interesting trip which would have been better if time wasn't such a constraint. It was a long bus ride though. Almost 4 hours each way. Our second (another all day) trip was to Saona Island. This was a rather short (1/1/2 hour each way) bus ride to where you catch the boat to the island. We had a great time. This is one excursion that you really want the weather to cooperate with.  Overall our whole experience to the Dominican Republic was an enjoyable one. The weather was great, the food  drink fine,  our accommodations more than satisfactory. Sure the people don't speak much English but we managed  yes everything is 'open air' including the restaurants. It's kind of hard keeping birds  flies away from everything but we didn't have a problem with this. Kind of like a big picnic. We only wish we could have everything open air like this back here in Pa. year round! This resort did seem to have a lot of Europeans staying at it  yes some can be rude. We have come to the conclusion that people everywhere are rude, not just Europeans. Get over it! You're on vacation! Enjoy yourself! Learn to experience new  different things! If you expect everything to be as it is back home, wherever that may be, then don't go on vacation. We have been to over a dozen destinations in the Caribbean  we've always had a great time wherever we've stayed. For the price we paid we think we got a great deal. Would we go back? Absolutely!

<Content>Ok Experience The hotel itself was nice. The rooms were fairly clean. We had a view of the ocean from our Block 5. The mini fridge was always stocked with water/soda. There was no iron in the room. The food was good with a large variety. The Japanese restaurant was the best. The beaches were cleaned every morning. The staff was very friendly. The entertainment was aweful. We had gone to Allegro Resort in March, and the entertainment differed extremely. The Happy Club in this resort wasn't all that happy, more like annoying. The resort had a MC for the shows, and then there was an assistant MC during the days at the beach. If he talked and made noises like a baby one more time I didn't know what I was going to do. The night shows were very dry and lame, I enjoyed only one show the entire week. The loudness of the speakers in the theater was too high. You would come out deaf. If you want excellent entertainment I would recommend the Allegro Resort, not Ocean Bavaro. We had book our trip through applevacations and it all went well until the last day of our trip. To our suprise just before departure from Punta Cana we had found out we were first traveling to San Juan, then a stop in Miami and then finally to Boston. We had no knowledge of this 2 stop flight until the morning we left. Out iteniary from Apple did not mention this at all. Before leaving for our trip I noticed that it was taking longer to get home then to travel there so I called apple and asked why the difference, The rep told me that they take a different route, and sometimes it with the wind and against the wind, so I believed him, I had no reason not to. Come to find out we booked our flight with 2 stops from the beginning and apple never made us aware of this ever. Of course the direct flight from san juan to boston was overbooked so we were unable to get on. So it took us 18 hours of travel to finally make it home, when it should of taken about 5 1/2, thanks to apple.

<Content>If you have expensive tastes, it is not the place for you. We went for 6 nights and we had a fantastic time. The beach was beautiful, our room was clean and the staff was nice. But we have a few complaints to share:1. The foodWe were very disappointed in the food. The five included restaurants (Mexican, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian, Japanese) provided a good variety but the food was less than mediocre (if not worse). And, though I read some decent reviews of the buffet, we both found it inedible. Flies (and I mean LOTS of flies) were on everything and birds fly through the buffet constantly. Our second day there we watched in horror as a bird crapped -- while it was perched on a banana holder which hung directly over the food. To say the least, we lost our appetites. And since the buffet is the only place to eat breakfast and lunch, from that point on we went to the coffee shop for breakfast and ate Lay's Potato Crisps (from the gift shop) for lunch.2. Stink AlleyThere were areas that literally smelled of (as my boyfriend described it) a combination of farts, rotting garbage and death. These areas just happened to be near the restaurants. Again, not such an appetizing experience.3. The other guestsI have heard that Americans are considered rude. But, it was our experience that the Europeans were very inconsiderate. We were consistently pushed off of paths so that a group of 8 could take the whole thing; attempts to walk single file weren't even good enough. We were bumped into and pushed while in line without so much as a feigned sorry.Conclusion:It was a learning experience. We made the best of it and had a great time but we wont go back. Admittedly, we didn't go there for the food. But when you go away for 7 days and there is nothing edible at your resort nor a grocery store food becomes an issue. Beautiful beach, mixed drinks and potato chips satisfy, but only for so long.

<Content>Beautiful Resort Stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Aug 11th -18thThe resort is very beautiful-Loved the very large pool-swim up bar- walk right into pool. One of the nicest pools I have seen so far in my travelsThe food is ok - for the money we paid -can't complainThe beach-some seaweed - beautiful emerald green waterIf you don't mind loud music on the beach-dancing-can be noisy some parts of the day.Wished they had a help yourself coffee bar located close to the beach. Liked this service at the AlegroSurprise that the coffee shop located close to the lobby doesn't open earlier than 10:00am kinda dissapointed in that. -great deserts in the coffee shop.The entertainment was great- wish it started earlier than 10pm-was too tired all.My opinion all and all the money we paid was well worth every penny. If you do not mind being only about 10% english speaking-mostly a european resort -then this is a place for you.If I were to go again- I would definetly go with a group of friends.

<Content>Can't wait to go back!!! I only have the best to say, the resort is beautiful the staff was pleasant at all time they always had a smile, Rosio specially was very proffesional at all times. I was there with my husband our 19yr old son and another family. Our room was ready on time block 6 Elite suite the ac worked great.. We did get our wake up calls when requested. The beach was beautiful the workers and animators were very respectful. I have always stayed in five star hotels, and honestly the service on this one was better than in any other that we have travel to. We have travel to the Caribbean before, never to Punta Cana. We are sooooooooo happy my family and the other family that was there with us that we cannot wait for next July to stay there again, I dont want to try any other one because I'm afraid it will not be the same. The best vacation of my life....

<Content>Vacation in paradise We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from July 15 - 29, 2006 and it was our second stay at this resort after our first visit in January 2006. The hotel is located at the wonderful long beach of Bavaro and we can only recommend this place.Hotel rooms: We had booked a superior SPA suite and the room was spacious and located next to the beach. We never experienced any problems in our room. Food: The buffet in the main restaurant offered a variety of international and local dishes and to our mind had something for everyone. Bars: The hotel has several bars (lobby bar, pool bar, sportsbar, etc.) and the barkeepers there are great - especially Santiago, Bernando and Edison. They will remember your drink after the first day and will mix your drink immediately when you sit down at the bar. All of them speak English, some also German and also Italian. Nevertheless you should remember that the Dom. Republic is a Spanish speaking country and if you try to speak at least some Spanish words, people there will appreciate it.Overall: after our visit in January we decided that we definitely have to go back to this beautiful place, because it means vacation in paradise. If you are looking for luxury and want to spend your time with only English or German speaking people it is better to stay at home - but if you want to feel the flavour of the Caribbean and enjoy the extraordinary way of life of a beautiful Caribbean island, the Dominican republic is the right place to go.

<Content>Stop Complaining My boyfriend and I just returned from a weekend at the Ocean Bavaro. We travel 2-3 times a year to Caribbean destinations and have visited many different resorts. When we travel, we travel to relax, not to fret over everything that can and WILL go wrong. Was check in smooth? Absolutely not. However, as we always do, we carried our bathing suits in a separate bag, after we got our bracelets, we found the nearest place to change and then headed for the pool. We came back at 4pm and our room wasn't ready. We waited another couple of minutes while Roberto took care of the people who were complaining and we were then given an oceanview room in Bloque 5 after he thanked us for being patient. The room was clean and comfortable. The a/c is COLD!!! but that only made my boyfriend smile with glee. I got the blanket from the closet. And yes, its true, the toilet paper doesn't always go down on the first flush... oh heavens!! The food while certainly not gourmet, was plentiful and tasty enough. (There were these deep fried ham and cheesy things that were quite special. :-) No, they don't speak a lot of English, but this IS a Spanish speaking country. However, a couple of phrases of Spanish goes a long way. Just knowing a few words of Spanish will help and when all else fails, point. They don't speak French or German, either and it seemed to me that the French were definitely in the majority at this resort. The French woman behind me at the Omelette station pointed to the eggs, put up two fingers and then pointed up. She got two eggs sunny side up. Its obvious by the Starbucks-esque coffee shop and the sports bar that this resort is really trying to make Americans happy. All in all, we had a great weekend, but then again we always do because this is OUR vacation and we make the best of it by not accenuating the negatives. Its vacation folks, relax!

<Content>Relax and enjoy the positives Charlottesville Virginia USAA friend and I spent 7 nights at Ocean Bavaro Resort and Spa. I had stayed there in 2004 and have some observations, not necessarily good or bad, just comments. There was some confusion as the resort has just been sold or ownership transferred or something. There is another resort Ocean Cana that shares the same facilities but I think it is a lesser rated place and probably cheaper. The employees overall were not as friendly as in 2004. (Maybe this has something to do with ownership change?) During my last stay, they would say hola in greeting. And our maid was surly even though I left tips. We got clean towels about every other day on average but no clean washcloths, even after leaving a note in Spanish kindly requesting them. The maid left our sliding door to the patio unlocked after cleaning and always turned our AC off so the room was warm when we re-entered.It was impossible to get a grass hut on the beach. I guess people were getting up earlier than 8AM because that is when I went out looking and there were already towels out. There are plenty of chairs on the beach.There were many Dominicans staying at the resort.The spa prices were significantly higher than they were on the last trip - slightly higher than for the same services here in VA. The whirlpool smelled like a sewer but the sauna was wonderful.The desserts in the main restaurant were delicious - much variety. The Mexican restaurant had cold, unappealing food but we left and went to the main buffet. We could always find something to eat there. The breakfasts were the best with the omelets made to order. We didn't get sick. The new internet set up is nice and convenient right out by the pool.Our room cards stopped working 5 times during a 7 night stay which was frustrating. One night I went to the front desk when I couldn't get in the room and the employee insisted on walking me back to my room which was 1 minute away and kept telling me how beautiful I was and asking personal questions. Short line checking in but it took 2 hours to get our room even though we arrived well after check-in time. Others were frustrated also. But they did hand out cool towels and cold drinks. When I asked for a remote control for the TV they asked what brand of TV. So I had to go to the room, look at the brand and tell them. I also had to go back and look to see what kind of safe I had before they could give me a key to it. Couldn't they write this stuff down? Then they didn't have a key available and I had to wait until the next day. So that meant standing in line while the front desk staff talked amongst themselves and answered the phone. This got old. When I took the remote to the room, I discovered it had not been programmed. The desk staff did not know how to do it, so they would send someone right away - we all know what that means in the D.R. Luckily we only wanted to watch some news and it wasn't that important. Don't plan on restaurants or bars or the internet place opening at the appointed time. I went to the lobby bar to get a cup of ice and it was 10:05 AM - sign said they opened at 10AM. Man said they were not open. I waited at a table right in front of the bar until 10:15 when it finally opened. All he had to do was reach in front of him and give me a scoop of ice.The pool aerobics were great. The instructor was very energetic and fun.Lots of repairs going on. No problem there except the workers would leave their hammers, chisels, paint cans on the paths until the next day. It was dangerous at night. It took us 3 days to catch up with our rep, CoCo Tours. He was supposed to be accessible our first day there, but he didn't show up. Our room was nice - block 6. Our AC worked great. The refrigerator was not cold, but kept our drinks cool. There was a dripping leak in the bathroom but it was no big deal to mop up. Expect a strong musty smell. I took air freshener. I don't think it can be helped because of the humidity. Take your own alarm clock. The wake up calls will not be done.The beach and the weather were great. That's really what matters, right? The airport set up is better organized. It took just minutes to get through customs and be on our way to the resort. The new coffee shop is awesome and open until late!We tried not to sweat the small stuff but it WAS our vacation and we wanted to relax without worrying about being locked out of the room because the card wouldn't work, missing our flight because we couldn't find the CoCo rep to verify it for us, having to carry our valuables on us until they could find a key for the safe. The resort is beautiful and with some management attention to customer service issues they would really have a great place. I would go back to this resort. For the price it was a great deal. From what I've heard, this concept of customer service is prevalent in the DR. So its best to just kick back and relax. But I am submitting these comments so others know what to expect. Don't go there expecting first world service in a third world country.

<Content>not a four star hotel We went to Ocean Bavaro from July 27 to Aug.3, 2006 and we had a nice time except that we didn't like the service. It's a nice decent hotel except small minor things. There wasn't hot water between 5 pm till around 7pm but we used to take a shower before that time. Room keys weren't working for almost every other day, so we had to go back to the reception to give us a new one. Beach wasn't really as I expected , we've been to Iberostar before and Breezes in Punta cana but their beaches were a lot better than this one. If you want to walk on the beach go on the left side it's more nicer and cleaner beach. Beach is a little deep and has a lot of seaweed especially after 2 rainy days. Pools were nice and very warm. [--------------------] we didn't like their comments that they gave us every time we walked by. My daughter who is 16 tried to exchange her towel with a new one and the guy who work there grabbed her and kissed her on the cheek....what kind of behavior is this????? Rooms were clean and comfortable except the aircondition had a loud noise that we couldn't sleep at night. Food was average we ate mostly in the buffet and we went to the Italian restaurant which was nice and also Brazilian was good. There wasn't too many Americans or Europeans there, mostly Dominican and few Italians. Any way I love the Dominican Republic but we wouldn't go back to this hotel we would try a different one.

<Content>just avoid the hamburgers says Chrissy from Newmarket ON We went for a wedding 7/22-29 2006. I agree that the check in was problematic, we waited about an hour and a half for our room but they give you a bracelet so you can go to the bar so its not too bad. We were in block 4 which is just your basic room but it was ok, the only comment I would have is that because the maids blast the a/c 24 hours a day, it is freezing in the rooms (we turned it off a few times) and there is so much condensation in the room, you can see it on the windows and feel it on the bed. i had no hot water in the shower but it didn;t bother me as much as i thought it would. The pools were awesome and the swim up bar was nice. The food was pretty good, the main buffett is much better than the one next to the 24 hour pizza place and bar though. I did eat a hamburger from the pizza place and I got pretty sick and couldn't eat much for 2 days so I would not recommend eating them. The beach was actually kind of dirty, because of all the people i'm sure. We went hoseback riding which was awesome and ATV's which I hated but they took us to a much nicer beach during that excursion and it was really fun. It was kind of offside though driving to the excursions through the towns, it made you remember you are in a 3rd world country for sure. i didn't enjoy the shows at night but others i went with did. all in all the wedding was beautiful on the beach, people needto remember the place is in a 3rd world country and their 4 star rating might not match your idea of a 4 star rating.

<Content>Not what i expected... We just returned from Punta Cana Ocean Bavaro resort. we stayed from 7/28 to 8/4. the resort grounds are well kept, service is very poor. tipping will help but not so much. check-in was the worst. we got to the hotel @12 and finally got a room @4:30. they will give you a bracelet so that you can go and use the buffet. you may want to pack a bathing suit in a carry on bag so that you can at least get in the pool while the room is ready. we traveled with apple vacations and got a ocean view room in block 5. the view was incredible but had to change room the next day since the shower was not working. we were moved to block 6 room 6114. this was a larger room with a jacuzzi, the view was not as good as the one in block 5 but definitly a much nicer and newer room. the room was clean. Also, it is very humid in the room i recomend packing extra clothes since it takes a while for the clothes to dry. the beach was great but the water was not as clean since there were lots of sea weeds especially after a windy/rainy day. there are plenty of chairs on the beach and by the pool however, if you want to be close to the beach and have an umbrella plan to get up early to claim the chairs. i got up at 7 to put towel on the chairs and never had any problems. the food is Ok, we tried all of the 5 restaurants on the resort. we found the japanese the mexican and the brazilian to be the best. you will need to make reservations for the restaurants. they take reservations by the main buffet area as early as 7 am. i got there each morning around 7:15 and always got what i wanted. the all you can eat buffet is also great, they have plenty to eat there. there is also a nice coffee shop by the lobby area. try the cappuccino and the cold frappuccino, they are great!! i recomend going to see the shows each night at the resort theater they are very good. plan to get there between 9:15- 9:30 to get good seats. Overall we had a good week at Ocean bavaro; however since both my wife and I got sick the last 2 days, I wold probably try another destination for our next trip...

<Author>anaxor
<Content>In love with this place. I have been at Ocean Bavaro, with my friend, and we have spend a week, between July 24 and July 31, 2006.I must say that I have visited many places around the world and still this experience was one of the best. I am not a very pretentious person, and I always like to experience the places I visit, the way they are....with the bad and the good.....if I want pampering and be served hand and foot, then I would not go anywhere. I read a lot of reviews from many sites, before going to Punta Cana.....and since I know from previous experiences that a lot of people complain about all sorts of things, I pay attention only to certain facts, with the idea in mind that people have different tastes and personal opinions, so I go by my own obviously.Comparing to other Caribbean places, I loved Punta Cana for the beach and especially for the vegetation that is so abundant everywhere. I always liked a beach with palm trees on it, not only next to it....and that was what made me want to go there.The hotel, bloque 5, was wonderful, and had a beach diagonal view, that was wonderful.... room was very clean, air conditioning worked all this time , I had hot water and cold water without any problems--I said that because there were many many complaints on reviews websites that water was a problem. The refrigerator was always full thanks to out maid.The food at the buffet, was wonderful and plenty and it was something for every taste. Every morning on the way to breakfast I made reservation for that night as well as for the next one. After visiting all the restaurants, I realized that people's opinions come many times from the particular dishes they ordered. I personally loved the Mexican and Spanish......because I love certain dishes from that cuisine.....Japanese( funny, most of the people loved it) I was not wild about it....too salty and dry compare to other Japanese restaurants I have visited in my life. Italian had good dishes and not so good dishes...it all depends on people's taste. In other words,...the food was great, and the fact that for a week I did not have to worry about cooking and groceries .or going out....and I had such a variety.......was fantastic for me.The beach had seaweed......but the picky plants workers were trying to keep it clean..after all it is natural and is coming from the ocean....not a bother for me.The resort grounds were magnificent....clean.....beautiful....I loved the vegetation that was hiding the buildings.....loved the ducks, the flamingos, the flowers....beautiful!!The entrainment was FANTASTIC!-- from the daily beach activities...the music , the dance..were my favorites! And the entertainment team worked so hard at it. Richard and his team were amassing.--in the morning on the beach..appearances at different spots in the resort in the afternoon and every evening at the shows....7 days a week. At night at 10 there were shows at Gaviota Theatre..and before 10 was music and dance at the outside teathre..I did not miss a show. The dancers were amassing.....Sammy ( Samuel) was one of my favorites beside Richard.....all of them did such a great job.And what I loved the most were the people....I connected with a lot of locals from the hotel workers to outside resort regular citizens. Very nice, hospitable, even when I ventured on streets I meet some interesting people and had very good discussions...I speak ok Spanish some French.....English of course and other languages as well( one of my hobbies). Every time we gave compliments to any of them they were so happy.......and it worked as good as tips.....many of the workers there said that there are so many tourists complain but almost none giving praise to their hard, long hours work.There were many day trips available, and we booked only one --not enough time for everything--I wish we could stay 2 weeks! We took the Santo Domingo tour--when I visit a country I like to see more about the culture and history .The only thing I did not like about it was the fact that we had to go pick up tourists from other hotels and that made the trip very long ..about 4 hours....not to mention that a lot of visitors were late or just wanted breaks to go to the bathrooms or buy food. and made everybody late. Other than that the trip was great.....we got to see lots of views. Driving through Huguey, La Romana, crossed the Chavon river( where Jurassic park and Rambo was partly filmed), Boca Chica ....many villages and very interesting views....nature is beautiful...beautiful well build homes next to piles of garbage......there is poverty......but nothing that I have not seen in other countries......maybe for an American that comes here for the first time it is amassing to see poverty and garbage......I have seen so much through other countries of the world , that this does not impress me much....it is the way they live and that is all about it!In Santo Domingo we visited the Alcazar de Colon--the palace where Christopher Columbus's family lived...beautiful. and our guide was very good at explaining all kind of facts about it. I forgot to mention that the guide we had in the bus was very very good ... while we were looking left and right at the views and places, he had a story and facts for everything,,,,,It felt like I was in a geography/history /sociology class about Dominican Republic. Then we went through the colonial part of the city...stopped at the mausoleum, went to the first Cathedral of the new world, Santa Maria la Menor were initially Christopher Columbus ashes were before moved to the CC lighthouse--that we passed by on the way back. At the Cathedral, we did some shopping---assaulted by vendors and children willing to shine our.......sandals.......On the way back we passed by the DR president 's palace...I forgot to mention, we had lunch --very good--at some hotel in downtown.Overall it was an interesting wonderful experience......where I learned a lot about the Dominican country and people.Came home with great memories, great coffee, rum.....some jewelry and local art......and I would like to go back next time and visit some of the northern mountain part of DR......It is a beautiful interesting place full of history, music and dance that I would recommend for those that like different cultures and do not get offended by other customs and way of life.

<Content>The Week Of Discuss and Disappointment Afriend and I stayed from 7/28-8/4/06,it was a low class 3 star dump when you are used to other. Pools were dirty, the guests at the swim up I assume thought they were to just drink and urinate in the pool all day as they did not get out to use the restroom so we did not get back in after the first episode. The beach was dirty, the beach shop people attack you trying to get you to buy their JUNK, the people at the resort want to take you to another of their five star Ocean Barvaro Motels...Much better then this to see...what? well, you get nagged to go with Felix, and the other is nicer.Pick and chose your food,all pretty much the same 3rd rate taste. A quant coffee house IF you have never been in a nice one in the states or other countries such as Italy or Spain. Our A/C had to be maintenanced 2-3 times daily, I called the manager on the 4th day, after showing the man what needed to be done, it was then fixed. Not much english, only spanish. English is only understood when it is to their advantage we quickly learned.No water pressure in the shower, may have to flush toilet twice due to low water level with urination to have paper go down. People were waiting 4-6 hours upon our arrival for check-in, we waited 2, I called our agent, within 5 minutes we had our room, I had made the desk clerks aware I was placing the call from my cell. PLEASE do so or you will wait as most did on a daily basis as we seen them come in right to our last day of departure. If you are a 5 star person and want quality and peace without chaos,go elsewhere, other class of folks may enjoy the chaos and the lack of wonderful nighly entertainment. For those of us who enjoy finer please reconsider this, and I came home with 32 mosquito bites due to green moldy water in the ponds.

<Content>Brilliant Honeymoon 2nd August 2006A trip advisor member from essex, England.we honeymooned at the Ocean bavaro between 24th july and 31st july 2006. I will try to cover as much as i can without going on to much as i found reading reviews very helpful.The arrival at Punta Cana airport was a nightmare we waited nearly an hour to obtain visa and get through passport control. There was a lot of pushing and shoving and locals seemed to be given priority and ushered straight to the front. It didnt take long to get from airport to hotel though but when we arrived none of the reception staff knew who we were (there were ourselves and 3 other couples) and said we had no booking there. our rep had already disapeared (airtours) so after a lot of hand waving and showing the original booking confimation(take this with you) they managed to locate our booking.We had upgraded to a tropical Junior Suite and this gave us VIP satus so we recieved a private check in, also as a VIP we recieved several extras ( spa treatments, i hour day motorised watersports, double jaquzzi in room, bathrobes, free saftey deposit box and 24 hour room service).Our room was in block 91 and we had a wonderfull view of the flamingo pond. The room was huge with a huge corner jaquzzi in corner also we had a bath and shower. The room was clean and the fridge was full with water, 7-up, pepsi and beer. also 2 bottles of wine and a bottle of rum were left(but no corkscrew and we didnt manage to obtain one the whole stay) THE BEACHBeautifull white sand and clear water, ther was a little seaweed but they tried to clear as much as they could 1st thing in the morning it was worse on windy days when the sea was a bit rougher, plenty of sunbeds but you do need to get there before nine if you want the ones with shade. Nice bar where they also done hair braiding(the lady was very good) i had my full head done for $40.THE POOLSThe pools were clean and never hadd a problem with getting a bed and as they provide towels you didnt have to worry about drying them. the swim up bar was great and never had to wait to long to get a drink.FOODWe thought the main buffet was great, loads of choice and nice food, we had the mexican and we loved this also we had the spanish it was awfull, our food was still frozen in the middle and talking to other guests we wernt the only ones to experience this. do not eat there.ENTERTAINMENTwe didnt go to any of the shows we just enjoyed relaxing in the lobby bar but i heard the shows were good fun.EXCURSIONSWe went on 2. we swam with the sharks and stingrays fab day out and went to saona island(paradise on earth) I would recommend both.Overall we thought this was a beautiful resort with well kept grounds, a lot of the staff dont speak good english so it pays to learn a few simple words of spanish. Tipping goes a long way(just a $ here and there) we tipped the bartender and he always served us quickly and always remembered our drinks. we had a great honeymoon and would return here if we went back to the Dominican Republic.Any questions please email medalecharmed@aol.com

<Content>Not what I expected It was a group of 5 and ever since we got to the hotel our experience was not the greates. From the welcoming to the food, room staff etc. I'm Dominican and Ocean Bavaro gives my country a bad rep. Every year I travel to Puerto Plata but this year I decided to go some place different, NEVER AGAIN! will I stay in this resort. We visited Ocean Blue (beautiful)!!!! Now I know better to read other people's review before I travel.

<Content>Cheapy Cheapy Winey Winey...but lots of fun! First of all we booked through Sunwing and cannot say one bad thing about it. Transfers were great to and from the airport and flight was good...pack lightly or you will get charged. Rooms:Upon arriving we were told to wait until 3 to check in which we had seen in other reviews. We went back at 2:30 and slipped the gentleman at the guest services outside the door $50 to find us an ocean view room. He did give us an Oceanview villa however not facing the ocean. It was not a bad room at all but we wanted ocean view and waited two days to recieve this in Block 6 for no additional charge. Once we moved we found our room fantastic...view was great, if you are not in block 6 bring your own iron!Service:Friendly and on the ball, language barrier...brush up on your spanish, just the basicsFood:Breakfast at main buffet good, same selection each day, not really a variety but still good. Lunch was similar...there was pizza so people that said there was not they lied! Big thing: reservations are required so you need to get at the booth in the main buffet before 8:00 to guantantee you a good reservation time, otherwise you can always eat at 9:30 at any of the restaurants, but we found that the service was better at around 8:00! Mexican, fair, good soup, Italian very good, Bahia...fair at best, Japanese Great fun and food, and we did not attend the Spanish out of fear of the menu! Cafe was great, they make a really good frozen drink!Drinks:Okay Wine was awful...undrinkable...we bought a bottle of wine every night. You just have to request a wine list from any of the restaurants and you can charge it to your room! Beach and Pool:Beach was okay, obviously beautiful, but there was some seaweed and a very calm surf~ The pools were good, put your stuff down before breakfast to guarantee a good spot...pool by the Bahia restaurant has a great breeze off the ocean!Party Pointers:Beach party is alot of fun...make sure you go! Lobby bartenders at night are a blast as well as the pool bar at night!Overall a good time, you get what you paid for...do not expect something like sandals!

<Content>Worth the money Overall it was a positive experience. The people were friendly. The food was plentiful. The weather was perfect.  We received an upgrade to bloque 6 (spa rooms). The room wasn't clean yet so we put our bags in the room, changed to swim suits and went to the beach.  There was some seaweed (not bad). The water was warm and cloudy (from sand being washed out). The sand was the whitest powder I have ever seen.  Tipping the maid was worthless. Tipping room service was worth it. Francisco made sure we always had diet pepsi in the fridge.  We experienced the Marinarium (awesome, snorkeled with sharks and stingrays). The 2 person speed boats (wouldn't do again, boat broke down, wheel wouldn't turn, snorkeling was great). Animal Adventure Park (excellent, paid for sea lion adventure, swam with sea lions in the pool, watched a sea lion and bird show, got to pet a bengal tiger). Take money in case you want to buy pictures on your excursions (about $7-$8 a piece)  We ate at Pepitos, Wasabi and Mezzaluna (Mezzaluna was by far the best for food and service)  It cost $60 for a one hour massage for both my wife and me (ask for Maria, strong hands).  The gift shop had decent prices on things (prices are in Euro, add half again for dollars $1 euro = $1.50 american) Offer less, they say no, start to walk out, they will probably stop you. If not go back another day.  The staff at Pelicano Watersports were great. We went to the pool for discover scuba. After a lap around the pool we signed up for the PADI open water diver certification. (IT WAS AWESOME) We received excellent instruction, pool training and 4 open water ocean dives. If you talk to Paco, Robert, Ingrid, Sandra or Natasha tell them Drew  Kendra from USA said Hi.  Take pepto bismol tablets and dramamine (little things like that are much less expensive in the states). Learn some basic spanish.

<Content>We had a good time We were there July 11-15. The weather was great, hot but you are on the beach so who cares. The hotel was really nice and the a/c worked wonderfully. We were promised block 5 or 6 through Apple Vacations but were placed in block 100. The only problem with our room was that the safe wouldn't lock and I didnt feel comfortable leaving the room without it locking so we had to wait 15 Dominican minutes which translates to 2 hours. That is how it seemed to be there pretty much all the time. Once I got used to that I was fine. Block 100 was okay, but we had 2 double beds and ants. We were moved to block 6 the next day and it was amazing. We never had any problems. The maids were wonderful always working. The food was horrible. I lived on rice, toast and fruit pretty much the whole time. Our 2nd or 3rd day into it we found a gift shop with Lays potato chips and that helped a lot. I highly recommend that you bring your own food. We liked to starve to death. We brought the Bebba Kegs and they had never seen them, but they filled'em up!!! The beer was really good. I think it was pretty strong. Anyway the frozen drinks were really good coco loco was yummy but too sweet so I pretty much just had the beer. Ask for Santiago at the pool bar he is wonderful. The entertainment staff has to be the hardest working group of people I have ever seen. They work from 9am-2am or so. They are on the beach, practicing for their show that night, dancing in the front of the resort, and after their show they are at the disco dancing some more. They always have you dancing. My favorite person was Richard, he has so much personality. The beach party was fun too. We went on the sting ray/shark excursion and I do not know how to swim, but I did it and it was amazing. I highly recommend it. After the snorkeling they take you to a private beach where they serve you more drinks and just have a good time. Keep an open mind and you will be fine just bring your own food. We went with another couple and had a fabulous time. It is going to be what you make of it. We would go back!!!

<Content>some good - some bad! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from 13/7/06 鈥?21/7/06. I booked the holiday in a rush and then only after read the reviews on here trying to find out more info on the hotel!!Overall we had a good holiday, just there were a few problems, many of which we found as a result of our travel agency, Thomson. I first found there to be a problem when I received my holiday documents through the post, we had to pre-book our seats at an extra cost (having already paid a supplement to sit together and a further supplement for food). I phoned Thomson to be told all 1st class sits had gone and that I would be sitting in the front of the plane as I had ordered a meal. However, once at Gatwick I realised there was a major problem. The queue for all Thomson flights was in the region of 800-1000 people long, that is no exaggeration. There were no separate desks for flights, it was just 5 flights queuing for check-in. We arrived at 7am, and finally got through passport control at 9.15 for a 10am flight. We rushed to our gate and boarded the plane. The legroom is awful, I have been on dozens of trans-Atlantic flights and these were easily the worst. I had never been on a package holiday before and presumed Thomson chartered other aircraft 鈥?they don鈥檛 鈥?they have their own fleet. We arrive at Punta Cana and queue for an hour to pay entry tax ($10) and finally board our coach. Our rep gives us a talk on the way to the hotel (about 25 mins) all seems well with him 鈥?how wrong we could be! On arrival at the hotel, the 4 couples on our bus all find our rooms not to be ready, we had to wait another 45 mins for these, even though it was now 5pm, and check in was supposed to be 3pm. The next morning our rep gives us a welcome talk, again seems good, saying we can contact him anytime on his room number, as he lives in this hotel and shows us all the excursions, which seemed pricey, but looked good. We didn鈥檛 see him again for nearly 4 days. All the groups tried to find him and call him for various reasons but no-one was successful. We needed to find him because I had been ill since day 2 with food poisoning, and had had the doctor out who wanted my girlfriend (who had also now come down with food poisoning) and I to go with him to the local hospital! He arranged for us to have 鈥渨ell fare鈥?seats on the plane back in order for us to be more comfortable and be near a toilet etc, however, on arrival at the airport this had not been done and we were once again at the back of the plane in normal seats. Other couples had similar problems with Thomson 鈥?excursions where the reps were hung-over and didn鈥檛 give any talks etc 鈥?2 hour coach rides to the excursion site that our Rep 鈥渇orgot鈥?to tell us about. So, the hotel,First impressions were good, nice open plane reception and lobby. Nice gardens etc, cannot fault this, just the check in delay was annoying when we all wanted to shower etc. Rooms, we have a double. I had tried to upgrade us the week before via email, they told me to just ask at the desk on arrival but the desk knew nothing about this so I gave up. Room was big and spacious, 2 double beds, satellite TV, free mini bar. Only issue was the air con, which was excellent but steamed the bathroom mirror up and made the floor tiles in the room damp etc, but apparently this was the same in all the rooms. We were in block 5, room 5303. We had a side on view or the sea and looked out over the smaller pool. The issues we had with our room were that at night from about 9-11.30 there is a show the other side of the pool, in Spanish. The music is ridiculously loud, especially the base, which made the windows shake etc, but I guess there was nothing we could do. Ill say now, if you want a quiet relaxing holiday this is probably not the place. The food overall was OK. My girlfriend and I had bad stomachs the whole week. The food was plentiful but standards were low. Meat is especially bad, and the deserts were not great and became repetitive. We ate in the main buffet 2 nights, the Italian (very good), Mexican (nothing special) and Japanese (nice evening but only 3 dishes?). 1 night we did not eat through illness and one night we went down the beach to the world famous Captain Cook鈥檚 fish restaurant. My girlfriend had a huge lobster and I had pasta due to illness, we had drinks and starters and deserts and meal was about 拢40 鈥?well worth it 鈥?sit out on the beach etc. Breakfast in the main restaurant was probably the best meal. Again the meat was not good, but omelettes were good and fresh doughnuts and fruit etc. Lunch, we tended to use the 24 hour snack bar by the pool for a burger etc, which was ok. Only issue I had with the main restaurant was the birds coming in a landing in the bread and salads and the staff seeing this and not taking the food away!!! No wonder I was ill鈥?br/>The beach was amazing. I have been lucky and as a youth was extremely well travelled, but I must say this beach was as good as any I have been too. Only issue was the event staff who again played their music at their beach hut full blast all afternoon. They organised games like beach football, volleyball etc.We didn鈥檛 really sit by the pools much but they looked ok, nothing amazing.The bars were well stocked on spirits and soft drinks, but only 1 local beer, which none of us liked. Cocktails were good. They have a sports bar, and lobby bar in the evenings, plus a starbucks coffee style place. Again that was good, but no cookies, like I had read in other reviews??The weather was amazing, rained our second day for about 30 mins and that was it.We had a massage by the beach in a little hut for 1hour for $30 each 鈥?well worth it. Evening disco 鈥?was comedy. Full of staff and Spanish girls, pitch black with strobe lighting and Spanish hip hop songs. We were all 18-22 and we all left after 5 minutes鈥?br/>The gym was ok but small and the spa looked lovely but expensive. My girlfriend is a beauty therapist and tells me for the products it used it was over-priced 鈥?but what do you expect in a resort?The phones in the rooms are a nightmare - none of us could get a line to the UK and had to use our mobiles!Overall I felt the hotel was ok. I was unimpressed with the standard of food but from the sounds of it, it was the same everywhere in all hotels. There are millions of staff everywhere who all seemed quite friendly. The weather and beach were good, and for the price we paid, around 拢1100 for 8 days, I didn鈥檛 feel it was too bad value. The only issue we all found was that the Spanish and South Amercians all got treated first and much better than us. Also, there is no prices in any shops and as soon as ther realise you are English or American they jack up the price. The little men who harras you on the beach to go into their huts (see pics) are the same. As I say, the main issues we had were with our agency. Overall the hotel was standard, but we all felt it had that kind of tacky Spanish Butlin鈥檚 holiday camp theme going on. I got a great Tan though! Would we go back? To the Caribbean 鈥?yes 鈥?to the Dom Rep 鈥?possibly 鈥?to Ocean Bavaro 鈥?unlikely, would we use Thomson ever again 鈥?no way!Anyone need any help give me a shoutHolland_luke15@hotmail.com

<Content>We had a blast Friendly people and great times We just got back last night we stayed from 7/5/06 thru 7/12/06.Our kids had a wonderful time they did not want to leave. The only problem I had was there really was not much for my younger son to do. But he had a great time in the pool and playing pool. We stayed in block 5 room 5205. Our Favorite people there were Reynaldo in the buffett area and Bernando in the pool bar they were great and very helpful..

<Content>A good tropical value My husband and I took a belated honeymoon to Ocean Bavaro from June 19-26th. We purchased the trip through Apple Vacations.We were greeted at the airport after we went through customs (you will need to purchase a 10.00 tourist card at the airport) by Apple representatives and told which bus to board for our trip to the resort. The ride to the resort was probably about 45 minutes and we were the first stop.Because we arrived at the resort around noon, our room was not ready. If you go through Apple Vacations, you check in at Guest Services, not the regular front desk. They gave us a bracelet immediately so we could utilize the resort until the room was ready. We purposely packed a small bag with our suits so that we could swim before we had our room. We ate lunch and enjoyed the beach a bit. We were told to check back around 2-2:30 because the room might be available a little earlier. It wasn't. At 3:00 which is check in time, our room was STILL not available. I was getting a little upset, but they told us if we waited 20 more minutes, we'd get a free room upgrade. We went from a standard room to a suite with a jacuzzi and were located in Block 6 which is steps from the beach. I was happy that they did this for us. The room was nice, but we had one minor problem. The vent above the toilet would drip water. I would usually have to drape a towel around myself when I went to the bathroom because it would drip on me. The water was from condensation from the above pipes or something, but there wasn't anything they could do. And really, this was the room upgrade! Keep in mind that the floors in the hotel are tile so you may want to bring socks or slippers to wear in the room. The cleaning staff did mop the floors every day so if you track sand into the room, they clean it up really well. The room was always kept very clean each day. I left a few dollars on most days with a note for the maid that said agua, por favor. Mucho gracias! and they kept us very very well stocked in our fridge. Normally there would be a few bottles of 7 Up, Pepsi and water, but we wanted water for the most part. The only downside is that when they clean the rooms, they keep the door to your room propped open to the outside and we had mosquitoes in our room every day. My poor husband is a magnet for mosquitos and was bit every day in our room. I was bit as well, but not as much. We definitely regretted not bringing any bug spray. The beach was absolutely fantastic! They keep the beach very clean and rake the seaweed every morning, lugging what seemed to be a hundred black garbage bags up from the beach full of seaweed. They also go around cleaning up cigarettes and garbage from the beach throughout the day. The water was gorgeous. It was warm enough to be able to go in right away but not too warm that it wasn't refreshing. We had a few days where the water was clearer than others, but it was so wonderful. There is a reef where you can snorkel which is right before the buoy lines. For this reason, we didn't go on the snorkeling excursion which was 69.00 per person. Rather we snorkeled everyday at our own beach. There are many thatched roof huts on the beach and we usually went to claim ours before we went to breakfast. We always did this by 7 or 8 am because otherwise, you won't get a great spot. You will be given a towel card for every guest in your partywhen you check in. They want you to get your towels in the morning and then return them by 6 pm. There is a towel hut on the beach. The pools: the pools on the ground were very clean and well kept. They were gorgeous. Only a few times did we utilize the pools though. We preferred the beach, but on days when I needed shade but still wanted to be in the water, there are a few areas in the pool that are shaded from the palm trees. The bars: My husband is allergic to alcohol and I was pregnant so we didn't utilize the bars for alcoholic beverages. There were plenty of frozen drinks and other beverages that you can have before they add the alcohol if you don't drink or are bringing kids. They also had a polar water cooler next the bar at the beach. The swim up bar was really nice in the pool!The food: Pizzeria-We ate here at lot for snacks in the late afternoon. They cook small pizzas and cut them up for a self serve bar. We saw pizzas of the following variety: plain cheese, cheese and canned corn, cheese and tuna, cheese with cubed ham, cheese with strips of bacon, cheese with mushrooms. So not come thinking you are going to get your regular American pepperoni pizza. Sometimes people would be rude and when fresh ones came out would basically pile a pizza or more on their plates, but for the most part, they were making them constantly. Other things you could get were hamburgers and hot dogs at this snack bar. Bahia (next to the pizzeria and close to the beach)-they were open for lunch so we ate there a lot for lunch. They had different stuff everyday. Usually had the grill going for burgers or fish. Usually had a type of rice, meat, salad, french fries, lots of fresh fruits and desserts and ice cream. This is all self serve here. Main buffet-this is the only place open for breakfast. We usually got there around 7:30 and it was not crowded, but one day we went later and there was a long line. I loved all the fresh fruit and constantly had fresh pineapple, guava, passion fruit, bananas and mangoes. They also made smoothies, but they were far too sweet for me. They had a cereal bar and also a buffet that changed a bit each day. Some things were scrambled eggs, plantains, sausage, bacon, fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, cold cuts and cheeses. There will be things on the buffet for breakfast that Americans are not used to (hot chicken wings), but it's cool to branch out. They had multiple types of breads (but no bagels or english muffins), banana or corn muffins, fresh croissants, oatmeal, rolls, pastries, freshly made donuts,etc. There is plenty to eat. We ate only once at the buffet for lunch and it was fine and a few times for dinner. Each night the selections will be a little different, but one night they had a huge thing of paella. People went nuts over all the seafood. Keep in mind that this buffet is all open. There is a roof, but it is not air conditioned and you will see birds fly in and snatch bread and things on occasion. Same goes for flies, since it is open on the sides, they can get in. There is also a smoking section here. Restaurants: You can make reservations when you go to breakfast, but do so kind of early. WE always did by 8 am and didn't have a problem. You can also make reservations for 1 day in advance. Each restaurant is closed one day per week. The restaurants are fully enclosed and air conditioned. Reservations are for 6:30 or 9 pm.El Mason (Spanish)-enjoyed our appetizers and dessert but didn't enjoy our main meals. The translations were pretty bad on the menu (this is not a buffet, you order off of the menu). My husband ordered a pork dish and it seriously came out with the skin and hair of the pig still on it! I couldn't stand that restaurant at all.Pepitos (Mexican)-we loved this one. the appetizer is a buffet line with tortillas, both flour and corn, and then a variety of meat fillings to make tacos or burritos. There was another buffet with toppings like lettuce, guacamole, etc. We were stuffed by the time we were done with this part. We didn't think the entrees were all that special. Each table had corn chips and queso, but it was clearly just a jarred cheese product, nothing authentic.Wasabi (Japanese)-this is hibachi style and was a lot of fun. You have assigned seating as each table seats 8. You will be brought a cup of miso soup (their version was more like chicken or beef broth with chicken, onion and tofu), a platter of sushi and tempura. I found most of the cooked sushi items very dry, but my husband said the raw tuna and salmon was very good. While you are eating this, your table's chef starts making fried rice and a mix of grilled veggies, then cooks up chicken, beef and shrimp. I thought this place had the best food. We went here twice. I think I was also kind of comforted by watching them prepare the meat. When it's on a buffet and sitting out for a while, you just never know. You are also given dessert here, but none of the two desserts we had were usual for a Japanese restaurant. Mezzaluna (Italian)-they have an antipasto buffet for the appetizer which had olives, crackers and an enormous wheel of parmesan, cold cuts that were always at the regular buffet, canned artichokes, marinated mushrooms, etc. We weren't that wowed by it. I ordered spinach cheese canneloni and there was barely and spinach and it hardly seemed like there were any noodles. It was very, very, very heavy with ricotta and mozzarella cheese. The tomato sauce wasn't that great, but it was fine. I would say that it wasn't even as good as Olive Garden (American chain). I was expecting better. My husband had the lasagne and said it was ok. Dessert wasn't anything special...I found the desserts at the buffets incredible. We didn't eat at Bahia (Brazilian) for dinner or the seafood place which is not included.Le Cafe (coffee shop)-what a little gem! The coffee items were so good (some Starbucks-like drinks. You could get pretty much anything and they had a display case with desserts you could ask for and then they had self serve cookies too. I thought it was only open in the evening, but we found it open in the afternoons too. Not sure when it opened. They even accomodated my need for decaf options. You can get things like Italian sodas here too.Non-motorized equipment: my husband used a kayak to play around with from the resort. We brought our own snorkel gear though. My husband also took part and won a tennis tournament at the resort while we were there. We didn't do any excursions, but we heard GREAT reviews by other guests of the Marinarium. There is also a safari, a party boat, shopping tour, tour of cigar factory (you can bring back up to 100 cigars, but they have to be Dominican NOT Cuban and really, we were told, that if it is labeled Cuban, it's probably not anyway). I would encourage you to book excursions through Apple Vacations if you go through them. They can ensure your safety. They will have a little orientation for you the first day at the resort if you book through them. It was nice because they spell out what's safe (restaurant water and ice) and what's not (the water in your hotel room, a few casino games will take you for broke, etc).We went to one show at night (they start at 10 pm each evening) which was fun. It was one where they did a lot of show dancing and that's when the award ceremony for my husband's tennis tournament was so we went! Most nights we were tired from the entire day. We also did not go to any of the Discos at night. The people that work there work very hard. The same guys and girls in the morning on the beach trying to get you to do stretching and aerobics are usually the same people dancing in the shows at 10 pm. It's incredible how much they work. Keep in mind if you are American, you will be in the minority of tourists here. We loved the international flavor of the place, but if you expect everyone know English, they will not. We got by just fine with a little Spanish, but i wish we knew more. Guests at the resort were very nice and were from France, Germany, etc. Also, if you are American, be warned that most women will go topless at both the pools and on the beach. Again, I liked the more free environment, but i know some Americans are very uptight about this kind of thing. We had a great time. We were there for 7 days. One day there was a thunderstorm and it rained all day long and the resort lost power. it did not dampen any spirits though, people were still out in the pool, we still ate at Bahia for lunch and they made it fun. We had a few overcast days and then few fully sunny goreous days as well. This resort is a great value. Many other guests echoed this as well. We did not encounter some of the things on other reviews. I always had a hot shower at 4 pm when we were getting ready for dinner and did not encounter them shutting the water off (except during the storm). I can't think of anything else.

<Content>Waste Of American Money I was in Punta Cana from June 22, thru June 28.It was my 40th birthday celebration, let me start by saying that the rooms are horrible we arrived at 3:00 pm but did not settle until 10:00 pm that night so we lost out on a day.We had to change rooms 4 times. The first room they gave us was all the way in the back where it was far from all attracions when we booked this vacation our travel agent said our room was facing the ocean not construction. So we immediately called the front desk and said we did not want that room, so they gave us another room only to see the bathroom filthy, the bed on a crate and no air conditioning. So we called the front desk again and complain, so they changed us to another room that was worst from the other two they had given to us by this time now we're hungry my 7 year old daughter is restless and cranky my husband and I went to get something to eat and to get familar with the surroundings of the resort. Now we decide to go back to the room it was hot humid the air condition was not working and when my daughter when to lay down in bed it was a pool of water the ceiling had a leak over her bed now we're fuming my husband now went personally to speak to the manager and demand our money back. It took my husband almost two hours to get us a room that we we're going to be comfortable in. If you're reading this please consider what I'm saying especially if you are traveling with a child. I too read travel review I should of listen to them and go with my instints. You work hard the whole year so that you can spoil yourself to a good vacation. Other then that be prepare if you are going outside the resort you are going to have a lot of hustlers which personally made me uncomfortable I like to go shopping and not be watched or obligated to buy anything. The food at the resort was okay nothing to brag about it got boring after awhile especially the buffet. If you like coffee their coffee is really good they have a cafe spot, something like Starbucks it was really nice. Activities for kids are really good the director that handles this she was really nice and cater to the kids. The landscape, gym, spas are wonderful and beautiful. well I hope I'm able to help at least one person that reads my review this really works I should of listen to the ones I read.Good Luck!

<Content>Our Dream Honeymoon Came True My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon (June 13th - June 20th) at Ocean Bavaro in Punta Cana, D.R. Words can never describe how amazing our visit was. This hotel lived up to every expectation we had and made our honeymoon a memory that we will forever cherish.We used Apple Vacations to schedule our all-inclusive 7 nights trip for $2,000.00 including flight. Or non-stop flight on USA3000 left in the morning from Cincinnati airport and arrived in D.R. 3 1/2 hours later. We watched a movie and Everybody Loves Raymond on the way down. As we watched, we were served a meal and drinks. We had a choice of chicken or pasta and both were ok. Nothing gourmet but edible. Upon arrival at the airport, we were transferred to our hotel on a very nice air-conditioned bus which took about 20 minutes. During the ride, an apple representative gave our some important information such as games not to play at casinos, do not drink the water, how to convert currency, and more. He also gave us a quick Spanish lesson considering it is the language of the country. Check in at the hotel was a breeze. We walked up to a table, gave our information and received a room key and two towel cards (for the beach). A beautiful woman brought us over cold fruity drinks. A bell boy loaded our luggage on a golf cart and drove us to our room. We entered the average room with two double beds. I kind of curled my nose as my husband cheered and started putting on his bathing suit. I called the front desk and explained it was our honeymoon and asked the price to upgrade to a honeymoon suite. He said $280 which was cheaper than getting it from apple. Always upgrade at the hotel. He offered to send the bell boy to pick me up but I decided to walk to the front desk and enjoy the grounds. I waited about 20 minutes and was taken by the bell boy to the suite. It was beautiful, clean, big, with a jacuzzi in the corner surrounded by marble tile, but it wasn't a honeymoon suite. The bell boy called the front desk and the clerk said that they would give us the room for free because there wasn't a honeymoon suite open. It was room# 6605 Deluxe Junior Suite. I was ecstatic. He took me to first room to pickup my husband and luggage. THE ROOMAlways cool, fresh, dry, a bit dim (better electricity in the U.S.), and roomy. The water in our room was low pressure but we had hot water. Strange because the people to us didn't have hot water but the next day the apple rep. had their room changed. The toilets flushed just fine and the TV was full of English speaking channels with familiar movies and shows. We had our power go out twice. Once for two minutes the second day and once when we were leaving on the last day. We didn't mind because we aren't snotty enough to care. =)THE PEOPLEEvery one that works at Ocean Bavaro is wonderful. They are friendly, extremely hard working, and will do everything they can to please you even if it isn't the right thing. They try and as guests in a different culture, learn to keep your cool and accept it. They really do appreciate tips ($1 min. and $3 max a day) because the average weekly income is between $200 and $300. We brought gifts for the maid from the dollar store like nail polish, lip stick, bath soaps, and more. We would leave her a note every morning saying thank you and present in Spanish with a dollar or two and a gift. We would write any other request such as towels, water, Pepsi, even fresh flowers etc. and it would be there when we returned. If you don't tip the maid expect a crappy room cleaning. We didn't care either way because we made the mess. As a perk, we found the maids unlocked supply closet with the water and pop. You've got to learn and speak some Spanish if you want good service. A lot of them understand and speak English but it really shows respect when you care to take the time to learn their language. As for the tips, remember the drivers, bell boys, maids and bar tenders even if it鈥檚 only once for a small $1 bill. THE FOODSo many choices and so little room in our stomachs. Some things you will dislike but most of the time you will find something you love. We loved everything we ate. At the buffets you will see small signs above each dish with about 6 different languages translating what it is. Look for the British flag and you will see the English translation. If you can't find it, just ask someone. Restaurants that needed reservations were easy to get into. We ate at the Japanese twice and it was by far the best. Drinks were great too. Someone said they were watered down which I never found to be true. You can even request more alcohol in any drink. Some were too sweet but all I did was added water. The only drink I thought was terrible was the wine (very dry). I didn't complain, I just didn't drink it. When it was offered, I would say No gracias which is simply No thank you. Over all, we felt like we at like queens and kings. A bit of advice, we never got sick and our secret was to take a sip of pepto either before or after each meal. We went through two bottles and felt great the entire time. Also, take bathroom spray with you. =)THE EXTRA COSTSWe took two excursions. Both we highly advise you take. For two of us, both cost approximately $300. First was the Marinarium which is snorkeling and swimming with the sharks. The sharks don't even bother you and they have no teeth. Do not touch the fence because you will get stung by jelly fish. After that you party on the boat with unlimited drinks. The other was the Outback Safari tour. You ride in a jeep deep into the country and experience the culture and food. It was beautiful and the tour guide was hilarious. We also went parasailing for $65 together by having two vendors compete between one another. Super fun too.THE HOTEL OVERALLThe grounds were lush with green tropical plants and towering palm trees. The staff worked constantly to scrub and rinse the sidewalks, landscape, and keep the place looking in top condition. The pool was refreshing and a bit cloudy but there were so many people and a swim up bar. What do you expect? Don't worry, they clean the pool twice a day morning and night. If you don't like it, go over to the smaller Brazilian pool that is a clear and cooler. We would rather drink. The beach was beautiful with its white sands and blue water. There were always open chairs on the beach and by the pool. The fun team was always playing music and doing fun activates. Try one at least once. The night shows were amazing with the talented staff. It was very professional. Warning!!! This is not a quite resort so find another place if that is what you seek. We were ok because by the time we were ready for bed we would pass out from being too tired or drunk. APPLE VACATIONSWe will use them again and again and again. They will bend over backwards to take of you. They give you the best at an affordable price. They are the best!!!OVER ALL TRIPWe said it over and over again while we were there and we won't stop saying it. Ocean Bavaro is the best! We will suggest it to anyone and we will always go back. This was our first time and not our last. Punta Cana is a breath taking place and the culture is outstanding. If you can't go with an open mind than stay home or travel in America. This is their culture so I suggest that you respect it, work with it, and be patient. You will eventually get what you need and everyone will be happy. When we got home we really noticed a difference in how rude we are in America compared to the peace in Punta Cana. As a major perk to our trip, we met and hung out with three couples. Two ended up being from Ohio too and the other is from Austria. We are continuing to keep in touch. Our seven nights was the perfect amount of time. Not too long and not too short. As we left, one couple stayed because they had another week left. You could tell they were going to be bored without us all. We will never forget our honeymoon. PRICELESS!!!Good luck with your trip planning and happy travels to you.

<Content>Would go back, but NOT to this resort!!! My best friend and I went to Punta Cana June 16-20. We work together so we were so excited to get away. We picked this resort based on the number of resturants and it looked like a nice place from the pictures. The food was pretty good. The japanese resturant was awesome! We ate at the buffets for lunch only to find a worm in our food! Needless to say thank god we brought food from home to snack on! We arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon, check-in wasn't until 3. We went back at 3 only for them to tell us come back in 10 minutes, this whole procedure continued for the next 3 hours. When we finally got our room, it had NO AIR CONDITIONING! They moved us to another room with only 1 bed. We didn't bother complaining because no one understands what your saying anyways!. The workers are somewhat friendly. One of the couples we met said they went to get a drink at the bar and the bartender wouldn't serve them because they didn't speak spanish! I don't speak any spanish what so ever and that was kind of a problem. Our maid only gave us 1 towel so we called to get more and an hour and half later the maid brought us more, she barged into our room yelling at us in spanish pointing at the bathroom we had no clue what she was talking about so we just stood there! The only good thing about this resort was the beach, it was very pretty and there was always a nice breeze. There was A LOT of seaweed in the water, if you don't mind that than that's good. The pools were nice too... All in all Punta Cana was very pretty, I would probably go back but WOULD NOT stay at this resort!!! Please take it from us, we're 22  23 and were looking to have a relaxing vacation and we're easy to please. This was not the place to go!!!

<Content>A good relaxing hotel This is a hotel my 50,s twin brother and I have stayed in for the last 3 years.We have been fortunate,in that we found a good one first time! Being honest,though,there are members of staff who appear aloof/ignorant.I firmly believe that you can find this anywhere on occasion.The main lanquage problems are probably a root cause.English is accepted,but at times not understood.Basic spanish ( picked up from listening to others,will help slightly )We have found that if you treat people with respect and dignity,they will try their best to respond.In general,we always have a good and relaxing holiday.We have come to know the locals and have friends there now.This is why,when planning our next,we have to toss the coin between GOA,which we also love and the Dominican Republic.For the last few years,this paradise ( for this hotel is this ) has won.Please believe us when we say that you will have a great time here. The rooms are great, some in need of touching up,but you may just get one which has not been used for a while and damp.We normally go in December,humidity reasonable.Last time we went in July and humidity kept our clothing damp,even when taking out of cases in UK.Food has to be evaluated on the diverse cultures that the hotel caters for.It can be repetitive/boring,but you will not starve! I hope that I have given an honest review and it will help anyone thinking of going to this hotel.

<Content>Waste of time I just came back from staying 2 days in the Ocean Bavaro:Bathrooms are falling down, need replacement urgently.Food is mediocre, no quality. Mexican Restaurant and Rodizzio [----].Pool was always dirty.And to top it all, cleaning service stole RD$3,000 from wallet.There are much better options nearby, like the princess resorts, Fiesta, Melia, Barcelo.Would never come back, they can pay me to go back but i wouldn't.

<Content>Good with some Bad Myself and four friends stayed at the resort from June 3-10. It was our first time traveling in the Caribbean and we are all young (early 20s) I felt that there was not alot of young people there. Our room was alright, nothing spectacular. We got upgraded for free to Block 5 with a nice view. We leftthe maid a $3 tip each day and she put flowers on our bed and gave us lots of bottles of water and cookies. The food was nothing to rave about. At the buffet I mostly ate pasta for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was usually the best meal. You can have an omelete made and there's doughnuts, croissants, yogurt fresh fruit and smoothies. The staff at the buffet were very nice and quick with clearing away the dirty plates and refilling your empty glasses. The restaurants weren't too spectacular. The food in the Italian was okay, I got tortolenni and that was tasty. The second night we went to the Italian we had to wait for about 20 mins before we just got the menus ourselves. In the Mexican restaurant people who has entered the restaurant the same time as us had already eaten dinner and desert before we were served our food. The restaurants require a dress code of long pants for men, but they didnt enforce it. Dont go to the restaurants for good food... go to eat in comfortable air conditioning. The staff at the resort were very nice for the most part. We tried our best to use our high school spanish and they effort seemed to be appreciated. However, Some of the male staff members made inappropriate comments to my female friend and myself. The one employee at the front desk asked if he could come to our room, another told me that he had loved to look at me. Nothing too serious, however, it was very inappropriate for an emplyee of the hotel. Theres not much to do at night. if youre into the club scene youll enjoy thr disco, howvere if youre not, dont even bother going. The sports bar was a nice play to hang out. It had AC and pool tables with tvs. One bartender there was named Jose. He was a very fun and friendly man. The lobby and the sprts bar were the best places to get drinks b/c at the other bars they had no idea what you asked for. They didnt know what a strawberry daquari was. The beaches were very nice and well-kept compared to the nieghboring resorts. However if youre looking to relax on the beach in silence, do not go here!!! They play loud club music on the beach all day and play games/give exercise lessons which are very loud. If youre relaxing on the beach and sleeping the staff will wake you up and harass you to play one of their crazy games and it really got on my nerves. Also its hard to walk on the beach in peace b/c all of the vendors harass you to come into their store and are very very pushy. All of the store have basically the same small touristy products. Your best bet is to get them from the hotel gift shop. As for clothing.. women bring shorts, casual skirts and light sudresses.. men bring shorts, tee shirts and polos. Its way too hot to wear anythingelse. Bring ear plugs b/c it was very noisy, also a travel clock b/c there was none in the room. Do not drink the watwer at all.... i just brushed my teeth with it and got sick. Americans are in the minoirty, and there were many women who tannned topless. Definitely rent the snorkeling gear and see the fish at th reef in front of the hotel beach.. its worth it. My overall experience was good... my friends and I had fun. I prob would try a different reosrt for variety, but I would reccomend that your try the Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>If you're going for fun and relaxing in the sun, this one's for you... I'm going to keep this short, many of the positive reviews have already mirrored what we found in Ocean Bavaro. We were there from May 26th thru June 2nd. Try to learn enough Spanish to communicate w the staff, it'll go a long way in creating friends and enthusiastiic help. The staff in the resort were superb, very friendly and helpful. We went thru Apple and were put in Bloque 10, as some have stated, not the best of places - we asked Guest Services immediately for a better room, also well stated in other reviews, and we were put in a Bloque 6 Suite! on the beach with an in-room jacuzzi! - no additional charge. The food was great. We liked the Mexican Rest the best but only got to eat at 3 of the 5 different rest.; the Japanese was suppose to be the best, but we didn't get up at 6:30a to make the necessary reservations. The beach was great, there is some floating seaweed or tree twigs, but didn't spoil our snorkeling off the beach or rafting together in the sun. Plenty of pools are there also that were well kept and big. The entertainment was super; my wife and I were in the Su night skit for an hour! The MC and stage staff treated us both w respect and we had a very good, rememberable experience. They seem to involve the kids also in certain skits they do. The children we saw w their parents were extremely well-behaved and seemed to have a great time also. Moreover, there are pool tables, table tennis tables, and areas for the kids to play. I don't mind answering any questions anyone may have if you're thinking of going there. My email, if not already posted, is dedna@comcast.net.Finally, I think if you're going to just relax in the sun, without the everyday excursions, then this is for you - for Couples expecially. It is an up-and-coming place, it seems also that they're growing to meet the demand many vacationers have.

<Content>Ocena Bavaro My girlfriend  I stayed at this resort form June 1st to June 4th. Here is an honest review from someone who has traveled extensively. We were upgraded to bloque 5 (Ocean view) with no additional fees. We arrived at 11:00 a.m. but could not check in until 3 p.m., no problem, we went to lunch. The food quality and service at the buffet was horrible. The food was edible, but very different. Pureed pumpkin for breakfast????? The mimosa and bloody mary station was nice, and the coffee was great. We felt like 2nd class citizens when we tried to get a cup of coffee or an ashtray. We tipped like crazy, and spoke spanish, but no matter what we did, we were ignored. The beach bartender was great, however. Maria at the gift shop (cigar lady) was very friendly and a great help. The Brazilian resturant was a joke. Please don't waste a reservation to eat there, the service was just as bad as the food. The Italian was good, but service was lacking as well. The room quality was fine, but there is no alarm clock, so use your phone or bring one. The beach is beautiful, very deep with nice white sand. The grounds are beautiful but it does take a while to walk around, and I prefer a much smaller resort. Cigarettes are $2.00 a pack as my friend was pleasantly surprised. We met some really nice people, and the beach staff does work hard to keep things going. It was a good time, but not a place I would recommend. I have heard all of the Dominican resorts lack in food quality, which was fine so I didn't gain any weight! For the money, we had a good time, but I stand firm that this resort prefers Europeans to Americans, which is a shame. Try it once if you get a good deal. You may feel differently.

<Content>don't eat the food!!! Just came back from Oceans. First the bad. The food was horrible. I have traveled many, many times in Mexico and Jamacia and the food was either very good or fair. I am not picky!!! The only good food I ate was the omelet and even then I would not eat ham in it because so many flies were on it. I heard the Japanese resturant was good but we could not get in.... seems you have to get up at 6:30 or tip the hostess at least $15. Almost everyone I talked to got sick at least one night. I got sick the last night I was there ( I have NEVER gotten sick at any other resort) . I got up at about 3 in the morning to run to the bathroom and when I went to flush I found out the water had been turned off. When it came on at around 6 we had very little pressure and not any hot water.  The main pool was dirty and food floating in it, as was the spa pool. There are not ANY trash cans around main pool so people just leave their left over drinks and food anywhere. We did not have cable for 2 days because for some reason the cable kept going out. The lights were so dim in the rooms I could not read at night.The good things were that it was a beautiful resort and the staff was friendly. My bed was fine and I gave the maid a little tip and had plenty of towels and water. If you tell the bartender to make your drinks strong they will but they only use local brand alcohol. The show was corny but my 4 year old son loved it. The dancers were pretty good though. The coffee house was not open until 10 am but was excellent. The beach was very nice with plenty of chairs.  Was it a total waste of money... no, I had a good time just relaxing. Would I go back to this resort...no.

<Content>Fantastic Deal-Fantastic Resort This is the thing. If you're looking for a great deal and a wonderful hotel, this is it. I was quite wary after reading some of the reviews before we left but my husband and I are somewhat daring and our travel agent eased our minds a little when she said Ocean was a nice hotel and she thought we'd like it.  The flight was nice and we arrived @ 1:30 p.m. and check-in is at 3:00 we were given our bracelets and told to have lunch and come back at 3. I wished we'd packed our swimwear in a carry-on because we would have changed and lounged by the pool with no worries but alas, my husband went back to the desk at 2:30 and they said our room was ready. I read on this site that the room blocks with the best view were 6 and 7. So when he told us that we were in 9220 we must have looked crestfallen because he assured us that we would like it and he whispered It's an upgrade but if we didn't like it he would change it. When we walked in and saw the jacuzzi we thought we'd stay:).  The Staff: We found everyone to be extremely friendly. Our maid hugged me on introduction Everyone always said Hola and the servers in the buffet were very attentive.The Grounds - Gorgeous, enough said.The Beach - Gorgeous, soft white sand, clear, warm turquoise water.Entertainment - Very good. The Fun Club worked very hard and kept the fun going from morning until early evening and then they go to sing and dance and work the crowd at the show every night.Food - The food was good, not great and we never got sick at all. All the water is bottled and everything is very clean. I, like another poster said, did not go on vacation to eat gourmet foods. I live in Chicago, I could stay home and spend the money on fancy restaurants.Overall - Most people who go on these trips are not wealthy, like us, most people work hard for their money and want to get the most they can for the money they spend. The rating system may tend to confuse the issue. The stars are relative to what you're accustomed to or your experiences. For the money you spend at the Ocean Bavaro Resort you can be very pleased with what you get. We can't wait to go back.

<Content>Never again Spent 5 days and 4 nights from may 15th to 20th. Boyfriend and I went with two other couples. We were all in bloque 6. Two of the rooms were fine but one couple had no hot water the first two days. Couldn't get moved until the 3rd day we were there. Beginning day two we all took turns getting sick (diarhia). None of us drank the water but we did have steak and hamburgers. (tasted terrible). Talked to a lot of different people in the pool and everyone mentioned someone (wife, husband, friend) that also had diarhia. Some of the staff were friendly, some were not. We tipped well. All three couples had problems with their safes in the rooms. We waited 2 hours one day for someone to come with a master key to unlock ours. We ate at the steak and italian restaurants. I'm sorry but I don't understand how anyone can say the food is good. Nothing tasted good to me. When we got home my boyfriend and I still had stomach problems. Went and saw my doctor, he said we had e-coli and that you shouldn't even brush your teeth with the water there. Also, I ate salads 3 out of the 4 days. Doc seems to think because they wash the veggies first that's probably what made us sick. Prescribed ciphro- finally feeling better. Nobody mentioned eating red meat to us before we left but we were told not to eat the chicken! I really hate to beat the place up, it's beautiful, but when you only get 2 vacation weeks a year and spend one of them with diarhia, somethings wrong!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Staff, and Amazing Beach! This was my first all-inclusive resort that I have ever done and was a little weary of what to expect, having read the previous reviews of Ocean Bavaro Resort; However, with that being said, after spending a week at this resort, I must say I enjoyed every minute of my time at this resort. The staff first and foremost were absolutely amazing. For those who like to complain about the staff, just remember that you aren't in your rich-taken-for-granted lifestyle anymore and the people who are working to serve you work longer hours than you could probably ever imagine, for less pay than you can probably imagine. One review mentioned how the staff ignored them. I have to say that is farthest from the truth! Everytime we would walk by a staff member not ONCE did we not have someone say hello (ola). This being my first all-inclusive, it was a little akward tipping and knowing when to tip, you'll get used to it and when you see how hard everybody works, you will gladly feel like tipping. As for the resort, we stayed in Block 8 and didn't have a single major problem with our room. There was fresh water daily in the fridge to take to the beach with you, the rooms were spatious and very clean. Occasionally the water would be a little difficult temperature-wise at times, if you are really concerned about taking a warm shower, don't shower around 5pm during the dinner rush. Either shower before or after.The resort was beautiful. While there was the occasionaly poop-patch smell at some locations on the resort, the grounds were absolutely wonderful. The flamingos were a nice touch too! The pools were nice, and there were lots of bars located around the entire resort. Amazingly enough, the Dominican beer - Presidente was really good! Try it! The classic Margaritas, those were really good too. The evening entertainment was really good too. I was amazed at how much effort each dancer and performer put into every show night after night in order to entertain the clients. My cheeks would hurt on most nights from laughing or just having such a good time watching the show. One aspect of the resort that I did not expect was the amount of European tourists that stay at the resort as well. I found this aspect of the trip nice. It made the resort feel more international with more people to talk to. This is esspecially true if you don't like being on vacation with lots of Americans, but don't worry, they are easy to spot on the beach. The food was good. My favorite was the Japanese restaurant, but that wasn't because the food was the best, it was the best overall experience during dinner. (You'll see what I'm talking about when you eat there). The buffet food was good enough. I didn't go on vacation to eat the best meals I've ever eaten before, so that wasn't a major issue. The amount to choose from though was nice, and the cooks did their best job switching the meals up at night as well.Overall, I would highly recommend this resort for anyone looking into an all-inclusive. One of my funnest days during my trip was the Contiki Party Boat, so if you are looking for a fun time, I recommend that one too! Try a massage too, it was heavenly! If you are looking to take souveniers home as well, the coffee is suprisingly amazing! I wish I would have bought more to bring home as a matter of fact. I was pleasantly suprised by the overall experience of the resort and would seriously reconsider returning to this resort again in the near future.

<Content>dont believe the negative... this was a trip through apple vacations, out of stl louis mo. for my mother, my sister, sister-in-law, and myself. we had a great time. we arrived at the hotel approx. 1130am, check in is at 3pm. we checked in with the front desk. they went ahead and gave us our wrist bands, towel cards, a cold drink in the lobby while in lilne, and a cold, wet towel that they were calling dominican snow :). our room wasnt reaady yet. so we went checked out the grounds, and then went to the beach till about 230. room was then ready. we were in block 100. rooms are not extravagent, but they are not unacceptable either. no complaints about our room. no complaints about the service. grounds and beach were beautiful!! night life is spectacular. SANTIAGO at the pool bar, is wonderful, haliuruis, and lots of fun. what a coot. we just loved him! if you are looking for true american food, you wont like it. but the food they had was not bad.we got enough to eat. tip on using the phone in lobby (with a calling card) you must first give the recep. desk 1 dollar for every call you make. if you make a call from your room, make sure it is with a mexican calling card, purchased in the mini market. otherwise, there will be a 7.00 per minute charge to your room. ! not once did we experience any problems with the water, or getting a shower. we got towels when we asked for towels. no one got sick. there are flamingos walking around by one of the ponds. there is also a mother peacock with her baby always at her side that was cute. got any questions, send me an e-mail. i'll try to help you out.

<Content>Absolutely brilliant - what a holiday!! I have been home a (whole) week now and all I can say is I'm defintely going back again next year, same time and same hotel. Absolutely brilliant holiday.I was a bit worried about the hotel after reading all the negative reviews - I can honestly say that I never encountered any of the problems people have brought up and am sure they must have stayed at another hotel because I couldn't fault it at all.Check in was no problem - didn't have to queue for hours and there was no problem with our room which was in Block 5, was spotless and which had an ocean view. Rooms were cleaned every day and stocked up with plenty of drinks. Our shower was working perfectly and there was certainly no musty smell in the room or bugs.Staff were all friendly - no language barrier at all (and we didn't speak a word of Spanish before we went). Picked up a few Spanish words like gracias and pour favor (that's please and thank you for those rude people out there who expect to go to a Spanish-speaking country and be spoken to in English). A little bit of common courtesy isn't much to ask at all.Anyway, the pools were fantastic as was the beach and the weather. We stayed at the hotel from the 1st - 15th May 2006. The weather was absolutely scorching the first week but as we got into the middle of the second week we did see a thunderstorm and a few showers of rain but it really didn't affect our holiday because it didn't last very long and we were actually quite glad of the rain coz it cooled us down a bit. I expected to see more rain actually because it's the start of the rainy season there now. So I was pleasantly pleased!!Food in the buffet was excellent at times. It does get a little repetitive though especially if you eat there all the time so we tried all of the a la carte restaurants (some of them even twice) but liked the Japanese and Brazilian the best.Trips out were fantastic. We did the Speed Venture on our first day - we drove our own speedboat along the coast and out to a coral reef where we jumped off a bigger boat and snorkelled in the sea. Our guide gave us bread and the fishes came and ate it out of our hands. We then got to drive the speedboat back again - loved every minute of it.The next trip we did was Rancho Jonathan - horseriding in the mountains. I'd never ridden before and loved every minute of it (bit sore the day after though!!) - We even got to eat mangoes from the trees!!We also went to Dolphin Island and were able to swim with the dolphins and have a couple of pics taken. Short but sweet trip.Some friends we met at the hotel went to Manati Park and swam with dolphins there - you got more for your money @ Manati Park but it all depends on whether you want to swim with dolphins in an enclosure in a park or out at sea (which is where Dolphin Island is).The best trip ever was the Marinarium - it's a biological research facility but it's not as boring as it sounds honest!! It's basically a glass bottom boat which takes you out to a place in the sea where there are nurse sharks and stingrays. You get to jump off the boat and swim with them and take pics of your own. After you've done that the boat turns into a fun boat where they gave you something to eat and then make you these lethal cocktails - I couldn't drink them though coz I was too sick from the night before!!. They take you to a different part of the island where there's a natural pool and the water's crystal clear and waist high. Everyone gets off the boat and has a play around in the water and they bring drinks from the boat with them on a rubber ring!! Fantastic day out - highly recommended.All in all my holiday was one of the best I've ever had. I wouldn't worry about all these negative reviews because they are far outweighed by the positive reviews.

<Content>Better than expected! Would definately return! I booked this trip as a last minute deal and what a DEAL it was. I have traveled extensively in the Caribbean and have many resorts to compare this to. I have never traveled to the Dominican Republic before, however. Here is my assessment of the resort.Food Variety- Excellent, there were 5 specialty restrauants (Spanish, Brazilian, Mexican Japanese, and Italian) plus a buffet restruant and pool side restruant that served Pizza and Burgers. If you couldn't find something there to eat, there is something wrong with you. The Italian and Japanese restrauants were excellent, the Spanish was OK and didn't experience the Brazilian or Mexican. Food Quality- Resort food is never as good as Cruise food, but compared to other resorts that I have been to, I would say the food here was average to above average in taste and qualityRooms- We had a standard ocean view room and I would say that it was average in comparing it to other rooms I have had in the Caribbean. The water pressure was not the best, but the rooms were clean and had balconies. Resort Complex- The complex was absolutely gorgeous, very beautifully landscaped and was just the perfect size. I love that they had the specialty restruants in different areas of the resort and in their own buildings. It was almost a like you were in a little town. There was also a disco, sports bar, and a coffee house in addition to the specialty restruants. The restruants were very qaint and all had their own theme decorations.Shopping- If you walked up the beach, there was a large selection of market style shoppingBeach- One of the most beautiful, clean beaches I have ever been to. You could walk for miles on the white soft sand. The water was clear and had gentle waves. Good for swimming. Not a lot to see close by for snorkelingExcersions- The only excursion we went on was the Marinarium (stingray and shark snorkeling tour). While it was a little pricey, it was an excellent tour. The snorkeling was above average. Service- The bar tenders/staff were not as friendly as I have had at other destinations. Drinks- This was my only disappointment. They did not use fresh fruit for the drinks. Only mixes. It was hard to get served and I spent a lot of time waiting for drinks at the swim up bar. Pools- The main pool was very nice and had a swim up bar. There were other pools as well, but I never got to thoseActivities- The activity crew was excellent. There was always something going on by the beach or pool and the activity crew were good at getting people involved. There was always nighttime entertainment. The shows were your typical resort shows with dancing and music, but they did have a nighttime beach party and I heard the disco was fun, although I never personally made it. Dominican Republic- This was mainly a resort area and not really a place to get a feel for the people or culture of the Dominican Republic. Away from the resort there were a few small towns around. As with most third world country, there was a lot of trash and poverty outside of the resort areas. I think this was a great resort, especially for the price I paid. It would be a great place for families or couples. I would definately return, especially if I got the same bargain.

<Content>OMG!!! Best Place I Have Ever Gone!!!! This resort was the best place i have EVER gone too, in my whole life. we bought this trip 6 weeks in advance and we spent the 6 weeks dreaming about the vacation and reading all the reviews. My dad actually freaked out because of some of the bad reviews they had gotten but they couldn't have been true. we had a blast!!! the only complant we would have is that one man told us that we couldn't use one of the canoes because they were itailian only. other then that it was great, the people were so nice, i stayed there for two weeks and never wanted to leave.... i actualy cried when we left the airport because i loved it so much. we went to some of the other resturants besides the buffe and they were the exact same as it, except they had less food. but if you want to go to them then you have to get up really early and go down to the head desk infront of the buffe to get them because they are always full. also for lunch if you don't want to come in for lunch the barzillian resturant with the spa above it and the pool with the volleyball court you can go in right off the beach. we didn't learn that untill like the 10th day. we went on the bannana boat and it was fun i think it was 8 us dollars per person and we also did the parrasailing it was $45 i think but i don't remember. i would only go on the parrasiling if you want to see the island and how pretty it was for 15 minutes then go.. it was cool.... you get fliped on the bannana boat, so when he flippes you let go, so you don't get dragged.  I miss there limonadas and there pinocoladas and there bahama mamas...... and there delicious shakes in the morning. they served mashed potatoes for breakfast it was so cool! i miss them too, i actually miss it all... next time we go we are going to stay for a mounth instead of 2 weeks, I WOULD NOT STAY LESS THE 2WEEKS, right at 2weeks is were you start to get use to everything and your stomach settles...... so do not go for 5days it's just way to hecktect. There airtport has a grass roof and no walls it is bueatiful, the weather was great even when it rained it was great. i'm looking out my window to a rainy cold coast and am missing the clear bueatiful waters of the carribean sea. oh, and go to there shows at first we thought that there shows were only them picking people at of the aduince and dancing with them but that 's just for the dancers to get ready there shows start at 9 wait maybe it was ten but any way they are really loud. they must think the louder the better. i miss there intro songs Hola Senor and uno, dos , tres i'm am actually listening to them right now because i miss there little dances......... man i need to go back I want to go back and defiantly will go back to Punta Cana. i went there in march and it is now may and there is not been one day that i have not talk or thought about our trip to Ocean Bavaro Spa Beach and Resort!we stayed in block 93 room 9323- the rooms arn't the best but we wern't there for the rooms we went for the beach--- veiw from this room was GREAT over pondBring lot of money for tips.... tips go ALONG way.... the bartender would bring us refiels from the pool bar before we were even done with them because of the TIPS!!!!

<Content>Wonderful place, wonderful staff, overall-- fantastic!!! My sister and I (in our thirties) took our parents (in their 70s) on a family vacation for seven days in April 2006. This was the first vacation our family took as a group in 35 years. My sister and I have traveled extensively; however, this was my parents' first time traveling to the Caribbean, and their first time to a resort. My sister and I have stayed at resorts in Italy (Isola de Elba), but this was the first time we had traveled to D.R. I want to say that I had booked the vacation at Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort, and then saw some mixed reviews on this site. I was worried about the negative reviews, particularly because we were taking my parents on their first vacation. However, I have to say that I experienced NONE of the negatives that people have described!!!Check in was easy, and while we waited in a short line, they even had cold compresses for the entire line. Our rooms were very nice, clean, and safe. We stayed in bloque 8. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning worked; no complaints about the room at all. No water problems at all. My dad ended up making general conversation with the housecleaning staff, and found out that the water in the showers are supposedly shut off from 2 a.m.-5 a.m., but none of the four of us ever had a problem with taking hot showers during our entire stay.As for the staff, they were wonderful!!! One suggestion: get to know people who work there, make conversation, ask about their lives. If you make an effort to get to know the people who work there it really makes a difference-- and you can learn about their culture, their lives, and life in D.R. The staff were so friendly to us and often chatted with my parents, and even took pictures with all of us before we left. Tip well, and tip often-- these people work hard and deserve it. And more importantly, be respectful-- I saw some guests treating the employees so terribly and it seemed that they had a I paid for this and you are here to serve me attitude. This was hard for my parents and my sister and I to witness, and made us very uncomfortable to see guests treating the staff with such utter disrespect. The animation team is staffed by an amazing, friendly bunch of individuals. Pinky, Johnathan, and the rest of the team were fantastic. They go and go, and I just do not know how they do it! They really work hard and again, they were wonderful to my parents and to my sister and I. At the end of the week, we gave them a small tip of 10 dollars as a small token of appreciation-- in talking to the staff, we found out that they work super long hours and that the pay is minimal. There are enough activities if you want to keep busy, and if you don't want to participate and just lay around on the beach, you can do so. My mom did aqua aerobics, dance lessons, spanish lessons, and played some beach games. My father did some dance lessons, beach games, and spanish lessons. I say this because I think that the activities are for all ages. We went to the shows at night, to the beach party, and to the disco (one night). We had a good time at all. As vegetarians, we ate enough and got our fill. No problems in terms of eating! The buffets have plenty of fruit, vegetables, and other options. We went to the mexican and italian restaurants while we were there. Again, the staff were wonderful and so good to us. Language was never a problem. My parents do not speak Spanish but attempted some phrases, and it was very much appreciated. My sister and I can converse in basic Spanish, so we were able to talk with staff. However, many people spoke English. I should say that trying to speak Spanish is appreciated, and shows respect for the country (and people) you are visiting. If you are expecting people to speak English-- I hate to say it this way-- why go to a Spanish speaking country? Relax, try to speak Spanish, and enjoy the language and cultural differences. That's the joy of visiting another country besides the USA!Overall, my parents, my sister, and I had a wonderful time. The resort was relaxed, we felt pampered, but it did not have a richy rich feeling that would have made us rather uncomfortable. It was a good balance. My parents really enjoyed their time there and really enjoyed learning about the people who work there. My parents enjoyed it so much they would like to return next year! A great idea for a family vacation-- enough things for people to do of all ages and of all activity levels. My advice is go with an open mind, don't be uptight about how things should be, and tip, tip, tip the staff. And for those who did not have such a good stay, did you stay at the same resort as we did? No complaints here, that is for sure.

<Content>what can i say??!! Experience?? When we arrived in dominican the welcome was friendly at the airport but the holiday rep was not because we where late arriveing cause of delays the rep did not come to the hotel to sort all the guest out, she left a note to the driver explaining to meet her in the morning which was not helpful to us because when we arrived at this hotel we were given room keys and a map outlining where the rooms were on the complex as it was massive. That was not a problem, but, when we arrived in our room the beds had no sheets on and the mirrors where cracked. Also as we were two single travelling females and the terrace door did not lock we were still waiting for our luggage and were quite concerned about the door, so we returned to reception to find other guests with the same problems and some even worse then ours. People were moved because of the safety for their children, but we felt as if we were not worth it being two young holiday makers, so maintenance men came to our room to fix our problems.You can imagine it was late and we were tired from the delays.In the morning we deciced not to let this ruin our holiday so we met our rep to tell her these problems but she did not do much.The complex is nice and i recommend doing the boat trips the shark tour is really good and the staff are really frendly.In the evenings the entertainment was not very good at all and the animation staff did not talk to us we were treated like lower class. Be warned something which is not stated on the holiday brochures are that half of the complex is for italians only we went into their buffet area one night just cause it was quieter as the main buffet area is jam- packed and we were thrown out.There were hardly any people in there with loads of really well prepared food we didnt realise this we told the rep and she explained it was only for them i was fuming as i was never told this they had there own spaace on the beach so be warned if you wonder why you are being froned upon!!Also we where told there was a disco area but when we got there it was being revamped they put on beach partys but i did feel for those based in the rooms near the beach but again these where mainly for staff entertainment. I may seem to be moaning alot about this hotel but i believe you should be aware of these problems as i put too much trust with the travel agents, as you do. This complex is more for children and not singles or couples. We did enjoy some of our stay here but would not return. Many thanks for taking the time to read this :)

<Content>Resort has problems We stayed for 8 days in block 6. It claims to be the Elite Club. The room was nice, with a whirpool tub. They turned the water off completely at night. We needed to save bath water in the tub and use the trash can to flush toilet and wash our hands. The water pressure for most of the day was poor. This was the major problem. I would not recommend this resort because of this problem. We also woke up to a large (almost dead)cockroach on the floor. The food was average. We enjoyed the Japanese Restraunt, otherwise the buffet was our choice.The beach was beautiful, some seaweed, but you could walk for miles.The pool was dirty and the skimming function was not working.Entertainment was ok, the Michael Jackson review was good.The drinks were ok, ask for them strong if you want.The staff was for the most part unfriendly, they pretty much tried to ignore us as we passed by.We have been to Punta Cana several times and would not go back, nor would recommend this resort.

<Content>Great Weather, Great time. I just returned last night from a four day trip to the Ocean Bavaro. If I had to rate it. . .I would give it an 8 out of 10. Good Things: We checked in at 2:00 in Guest Services. Check in with them. They speak English and gave us a room before the 3:00 check in. The workers at the front desk would not allow us to check in until 3. We stayed in Block 5. Our room was literally ocean front with a jacuzzi overlooking the ocean. It was clean and beautiful. We did not have a problem with water pressure or hot water. We tipped the maid $3 and always had towels and water in the fridge. The beach was beautiful. (although there is a lot of sea weed) The only annoying thing about the beach was the happy club. I went to lay and read. The happy club was there to entertain people on the beach. I found it a little annoying. Also, a word of advice. Bring insulated mugs from home to use on the beach. The cups they use at the bar are really small. Food: The only thing that was kinda bad was the food. But not entirely. We really enjoyed the reservation only restaurants. We ate at the Italian, Japanese and Mexican. The Japanese was great and the Italian was a close second. The rest of the time we ate at the main buffet for breakfast and lunch. The food was a little different but that is expected being in Dominican Republic. The only thing that kinda grossed me out was that everything was outside. So flies and birds were around the food. For the most part is was protected. The cafe had great desserts and coffee. We went there for dessert almost everynight even though the restaurants give you some sort of dessert. There is a snack bar that is open almost all the time. They had pizza (some weird toppings but some regular ones too) and hot dogs, etc. It was nice sometimes to have American like food. We never got sick the entire trip but we avoided drinking the water and did not eat much red meat (which I was warned about). We did have some red meat but made sure it was really cooked.I think we enjoyed our trip so much because of the room upgrade and great weather. After we checked out we asked for a courtesy room to shower and change before our flight. We were given a key to a standard room and it was not that nice. Not terrible but not as nice as our room. I would suggest trying to get a suite in block 5 or 6. If you take Apple vacations, I heard that you get a room in one of these areas anyway.

<Content>Some good, some bad I just returned from a trip to Punta Cana and the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Resort. First, I鈥檇 like to address some points from other reviews: Washcloths: we had them. Toilet paper: had two rolls of it. Spa: ok but not great; treatments were good enough for inclusive and the prices were cheap for those treatments not included. Hot water: hit or miss but they are supposedly working on it. Drinks: so watered down and too sweet鈥?most of them tasted like Kool-aid. Food: food at the main buffet was plentiful but mediocre but the dinners at the specialty restaurants we went to were great. We enjoyed the Japanese restaurant (Wasabi) and the Italian restaurant (Mezza Luna). And we loved the Coffee shop鈥ood coffee and yummy pastries (try the macaroons!) Overall, it was a nice enough trip but there were two downsides that would make me less likely to return. First, it was noisy at night, and I don鈥檛 just mean noisy before midnight but all night. We were on the first floor so it might be quieter on an upper floor where people aren鈥檛 walking through at different hours. (I guess some people have no clue that they are loud!) Housekeeping starts at 7am as well, so if you like to sleep in on your vacation, too bad! The other issue is watersports (I think someone mentioned this in an earlier review); they seem to have no interest in doing anything other than talking with each other and selling excursions. The 鈥渋ncluded鈥?watersports, well, just try and do one of them. These were the only times at the resort I was told 鈥渘o鈥? I also saw other people told 鈥渘o鈥?when they tried to do things鈥atamaran, banana boat, etc., unless it was a paid activity (and the ocean was very mild each day I was there so weather wasn鈥檛 a factor). These were probably the least friendly employees on the property (especially the tall, thin girl who never smiled). However, everyone else on the property was VERY friendly, especially the staff in Meza Luna and the employees in Guest Services. Overall, I鈥檇 say the trip was good value for as inexpensive as it is and I鈥檇 definitely recommend it as long as you don鈥檛 like to relax in peace and quiet and sleep late when on vacation. Oh and one last tip: bring cash because much of the island doesn鈥檛 take credit cards and you can鈥檛 charge to your room at the spa or gift shop! There is an ATM at the entrance to the resort but it will only give you pesos, not U.S. dollars. If you purchase something in pesos, find out the exchange rate from the hotel first鈥everal people tried to shortchange us on the exchange.

<Content>Beautiful grounds but not much else We began our trip with an open mind after reading many not so good reviews. Thought we had everything covered on what rooms to request, being patient with staff and tipping. We had a big group- 20 people (10 adults and 10 kids ages 12-17)After our stay we will never go back to the Dominican Republic! Airport- $10 fee is a joke, upon entering they barely look at your passport when they stamp it but be prepared on the way out of the country. Every piece of luggage we brought was searched. There were dogs sniffing everything and our passport was checked at least 4 times before we got on the plane.When we arrived the mass of men who want to take your bags from you is awful! We kept saying no Thank You because we already had arrangements to get to our hotel. They grabbed a suitcase away from my 13 year old son and I had to fight to get it back. Became worried on our drive to the hotel because everything is so trashy.Hotel - Check-in was relatively smooth. We were all put in Block 8(6 rooms). Once we got to our rooms we found that 2 rooms assigned to us were already occuppied. So that family had to go back to the front desk to be reassigned. Some of our rooms were okay but our particular room was horrible. Hindsight I should have requested a enew room. There was a gap in the bathroom ceiling and the AC leaked when it ran alot. The beds were horrble. A couple of nights we had no water. We were right by a pool and bar and a short walk to the beach which the kids loved. We did tip the maid everyday and she filled our refrigerator with water and soda, that was the only good thing. Food - Awful food. This is the only vacation I have been on were I lost weight. I got very sick 3 days into our trip. We had a hard time finding food we could stand to eat. We had brought som snacks from home and that was a lifesaver. My kids lived on doughnuts in the morning and pizza during the day. We had many in our group get sick. My husband had to go the emergency room when we got home and is still on antibiotics as were a couple other people in our group. Beach, Pools,and other Amenities- Beach was nice. Usually went out early every morning to save chairs. Be prepared for the topless ladies. Our kids were all warned about this and everybody was immune to it by the end of the week. Kids played volleyball and water polo alot. The kids loved the pool tables. We didn't do much of the beach or pool activities. We did do the dune buggy excursion which although we had some mishaps turned out to be very fun. We arranged with the photographer to get a group picture taken. Taking the picture was great. They took some in the pool and on the beach. They did the whole group and individual families. The nightmare began when we went to select and buy our pictures. It took us forever and the girls working in the photo hut really were not interested in helping us. All total we bought 17 pictures and it took over an hour to do this.Overall we had fun not because of the resort but because of the group of people we were with. If only my family had been there we probably would have come home early. Friends can help you cope and get through anything. In all honesty I can say I will never go back to the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Won't go back!!!! We have been to Punta Cana many times and this is by far the worst resort we have experienced. The only thing we can give a positive review on was the food. The people at the front desk were rude and we had to ask for the manager on three different occasions. We asked many times for a key to the safe in our room and when we finally got one, on the third day, it only worked for two days and we were never able to get another that worked. They shut the water off during the day so when we went to take an early shower, around 4pm, we only got a trickle of cold water. The water was also shut off during the night. The pool was filty and during the 9 days we were there, only saw an attempt to clean it once and that was at the opposite end. We sat by the pool during the day and saw many people fall because of the slippery conditions which was never addressed. I don't feel it deserves the rating it has been given.

<Content>As Honest As I Can Be My friends and I spent four days at the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort. Let me first start by saying the beach and the resort grounds are beautiful. That is the only reason I rated it okay. That's all I can say. If you don't speak French, Italian or Spanish don't go. The language barrier is substantial. At first this was amusing and fun but soon got very frustrating. Towels are like gold. Getting more is almost impossible. The food is weak. The drinks are worse. Our rooms were in building six and if you must go, try to get this building. It is very close to the beach. The rooms smelled musty. There are no ice buckets, no extra toliet paper, no pens or paper. We actually, by accident, left the front desk with a pen and the employee came after us to get it back. Believe me it was a comedy of errors. Take a shower around 5:00 and you should have hot water. I can't make any promises after that. When you ask for something and the employee says one minute that really means don't expect to see me ever again. I think this place was attractive to Euorpeans. Which is fine, maybe their standards are not as high. Again, this would not have been so bad if we could communicate. I felt for the money we spend we did not get what we paid for. We met some other travelers from New Jersey and Canada and believe me there were not many and they agreed that we could have been at a much better place for the money.

<Content>Great holiday! We've been back just over a week (9-24th March), and wish we were back.We were very worried about what to expect from reading the previous reviews, but we needn't have been.Travelled with First Choice, good flight and loved the early booking-in, the night before the flight.Flight was okay, there are several films on the outgoing flight, but beware you have the same films on the way back!On the return trip there was no ice on the plane, and there was no choice with the main meal.Flight and transfer okay, but had to wait for nearly an hour to book in, with no Rep. This was due to a previous coach load of Italians, but managed to make ourselves known and then no problem.The whole complex was, in my view, one of the cleanest we have been in. The grounds are very pretty and are laid out very well, all kept in good condition.We were in Block 100, the furthest from the beach, but nearest the restaurants and reception.Room was basic, but very clean, the maid was in every day and changed sheets and towels reguarly.Water, Pepsi and Sprite, 3 of each in our fridge every day.Safety box was $20 a week with a deposit, returnable, of $20.No problems with hot water or the shower, a few drips from the air conditioning, but could put up with that.Had a problem with a/c one morning and a light wasn't working, but after reporting to the reception, by the time we went back to our room in the afternoon, both were working.Tried all the restaurants, except the Japanese, but we much preferred the buffet. At all the restaurants the food was the same as the buffet, with a few variations, and at every serving we were rushed, no time between courses.If you were dis-satisfied with the buffet, I can only say you must be a very fussy eater. There was always fresh steak, chops and fish, one night we even had fresh lobster. For the less adventious, the usual pasta, pizzas and salads. The same at the beach grill, but not as much to choose from.There is a great Coffee shop which you must try at least once (you're be back I'm sure). They serve several variations on coffees and teas with biscuits and cakes. Try the caramel iced cofee and the almond biscuits.It is only open from 4.00 until late, but worth a visit, but be prepared to queue.You are never far away from a bar, wherever you are on the complex. There was never any waiting, and lots of cocktails to choose from.The beach was good, but I preferred Cuba, (my personnal view). There was seaweed washed up, but this was cleared away every morning. One thing that I was not happy about was the litter in the sea. Most mornings there were empty bottles, carrier bags, paper and my husband even found a length of hose floating in the sea. One man found a broken bottle just a few yards inshore. This seems to be an overall problem with Dominican, we have come across this previously, but no reflection on the hotel.My husband wanted to take one of the catamarans out and was told that unless he had a certificate to state that he could sail, he would have to have a lesson which cost $20 - so not all the watersports are free.We went on 2 trips, the Outback Safari, which we enjoyed and the Carribean Adventure. This was good as far as snorkling with sharks and stingrays, but not very good value for money. It is only a half day excursion, and it maybe cheaper booking direct, as it is only a few yards up the beach from the hotel.We have had two holidays in the North of Dominican, several years ago, and thought we would try the south. We noticed a difference, but to go anywhere and join in diving etc. we found to be much more expensive now than then.We paid to use the VIP lounge on the return, which we found okay, but not worth the money. There are free drinks and food, but the area did not have enough seating and no AIR CONDITIONING, which you could do with. Overall we had a very good holiday, and you cannot beat the Dominican if you want to experience the Carribean for next to nothing.My advice is to read the reviews, take them with a pinch of salt and then make your own mind up.

<Content>Very Relaxing Vacation Stayed at Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Mar 17-26. It was my wife and I and our friends. It was very relaxing. We stayed in La Romana last year. More people at Ocean Bavaro. A good mix of Italian, French, Canadian and Americans. Like our trip last year, the Dominican seems to be a good place to go and relax. Not many tourist type things to do outside of the resort. We did go to the shoping plaza. If you have seen one shop, you have seen them all. Same stuff was in the shops on the beach. The gift shop in the hotel actually had the same prices (coffee was actually cheaper). We bought rum and coffee at a convienence store that had the prices listed. So back to relaxing and having a good time...Beach - it was great. We generally saved chairs every morning around 8:30-9:00. The area by the water sport building (place to get towels) had some very good shade. We would sit under some of the pine trees. Water was warm. Small amounts of sea weed from the coral would wash up, no big deal. Not too hot, always a breeze.Grounds- gorgeous, that's all.Food- normal dominican food. Not bad, some of the meat was a bit dry in the Brazilian restaurant. Main buffet had a good selection. Great fruit and veggies. We enjoyed the Spanish, and Italian. The best was the Japanese Steakhouse. I never read a review that talked about this restaurant (we found it half way through when we went to the mexican restaurant). Wasabi was the best restaurant. Good entertainment. It is located by the disco and mexican place outside of the lobby at the front entrance. Also, very good coffee, lattes, etc. at Le Cafe.Entertainment-Most was good. They did a History of Michael Jackson. The impersonator was incredible. He danced for 1 hour+. We also went to the Veraclub side and checked out an Italian show. It was very funny. They were improving remakes of popular music videos.Excursions-We booked our first through the hotel with fast eddie. We took a snorkeling tour. We got it for $70 pp. We went snorkeling for about 40 mins, then went to an area that they have caged sharks and stingrays. They let you in the cage. We dove and touched the sharks as they swam by. Sharks are fed so they aren't hungry when you get there. The rest of the trip was a booze cruise with entertainment. We found a local guy down the beach that would take us on basically the same trip. We went for $15 pp. Just snorkeling, and you could not get in the cage with the sharks. Glad to swim with the sharks, but this guy let you snorkel longer and brought you to more unique areas. Also, you only had 6-8 people snorkeling at a time vs. 75-100. Massages- awesome, but again we went down the beach. Go to the first beach shop area that has a sign that reads massage center. The lady is named Dominica. She was great. Around $35 for an hour ($45 for deep tissue). She has had training (it is obvious when she is giving you the massage). It was very relaxing. The is very good and respects your privacy. We had people approach her during our massage to ask questions. She would either wisper a short answer or ignore them. She made sure it was relaxing. She had a professional table right in front of the shop. Not sure how the massages were on the resort, but they were always located next to busy areas and did not seem like they could be very relaxing or private.Customer Service- to the Dominican Style - it was laid back at times and prompt sometimes. But we were on vacation, so who cares, we did not have anywhere to go. Don't be demanding, or expecting quick service all the time, you are in the caribbean...relax. Restaurants were good at timely service usually.$$$aving tips- go down the beach to find excursions. Don't try to go down too much on prices because they are very good. Check the tours offered by the resort, you can find most down the beach. Our snorkeling equipment on our $15 excursion was much better than the $70. Deep sea fishing was $75 pp for 4 hours. We did not go, but the boats and equipment were very nice.It seems that they have vendors come in each friday (all the same company). You can really bring them down on prices. If you are a cigar lover, be very aware of the cubans. Actually, lack of. I went hoping to buy a box or even a few to smoke while I was there. I could not find one real cuban. I brought my real cuban bands with me. Even in town at a bigger, nice cigar shop, they had very poor counterfeits. We thought we had a real box, until they opened it. It was the best counterfeit job I have seen, close but not the real thing. Make sure you have them open the box before you buy.Overall, we had a good time. We made the vacation what we wanted. Gave some $$ to the front desk and were put in bloque 5 with a great view. Hot water always came on (sometimes had to let it run for a few minutes). Room was clean. I felt we got a good deal. I was not there for the room. I was there to relax and get away. Don't expect a 5 star, just go and unwind. Make it what you want and you will have a good time! I would be happy to answer any questions.

<Content>We had an AMAZING time!! My boyfriend and I spent the week of Mar 18-25 at Ocean Bavaro. We had an amazing time!! The grounds are unbelievable, the beach was gorgeous and the food was great. The animation team did an amazing job with all there activities and getting everyone involved, there was always something going on! The shows at night were also really good. We stayed in Block 95, it was really nice and didn't smell like mildew at all (some people have complained of this in other reviews). As well, we didn't have any problem with the water presssure. We had an amazing time and I would definitely go back again!!

<Content>Great value for the money All you have to remember when going to the Ocean Bavaro is what you paid for. The beach, pool and grounds were all beautiful. We emailed the hotel prior to going (a few days before) and asked to be placed in block 6, whcih worked and was well worth it. I did not see any other rooms, but ours was large, clean, not musty, AC worked great and we were the closest building to the beach. The food was fine...again, you get what you pay for. Same with the drinks. My only complaint in comparing this hotel to other all-inclusive in the same price range was the staff. When making simple requests, it seemed as if you were disturbing them. They seemed to be put out when asking for anything out of the normal (i.e egg whites at breakfast or to have someone come to your room when your safe breaks) There was one particular staff member who seemed to have the job of drumming up business for the restuarant that you pay extra for. He would walk around the resort ALL DAY, with an ear burning whistle. This whistle could be heard all the way from the lobby if he were on the beach. If there was any intention of relaxing, it is hard with that type of annoyance. Overall, like i said, you get what you pay for. It was perfect for our group that was looking for a nice beach to lay out, have some drinks and relax. If the Dominicans could learn some hospitality tips from the Mexicans, I would be back in a heart beat!

<Content>Just had a great trip ! Just got back from Ocean Bavaro from March 12-19 and we had a great time. I was a bit concerned with some recent negative reviews, maybe we just got lucky, maybe we just have a better attitude. We arrived around 2:30pm and they welcomed us, told us check-in was at three. The reception area is gorgeous, open, and airy. The checking-in was a little bit confusing because they took our paperwork, gave us our wrist bands, didn't say anything and went into a back room. So we just kind of stood there hoping something would happen and it did. A few minutes later, we got our room keys and towel cards, I also requested a safe for $20 for the week + a refundable deposit of $20 for the key! We were assigned a room in block 100, which I was disapointed at it was the furthest to the beach and was very noisy at night with all the drunk kids coming back from a late night. I also found people not respectful of others trying to catch some sleep (walking with high heel shoes on ceramic floors late at night). We had NO problems with hot water or water pressure. Nothing went missing and the staff was very entertaining and tri-lingual. The food was as good as you can expect for any all-you-can-eat buffet and there was enough variety that you should be able to find something to eat, even for a 4 year old. We managed to book three a la carte restaurant: #1 on our list was Wasabi (Japanese), next was Mezaluna (Italian) and last was the mexican. I had to be at the buffet area around 6:30am to be able to book one of these restaurants as they are on a first come first serve basis.The beach and pool area were gorgeous. You just had to get to the pool early to reserve your spot. The weather fantastic. Warm, sunny, and breezy everyday. Just wear lots of sunblock, we wore SPF8 all the time, and still got burned, so be careful.My wife had a wonderful massage right by the pool for $55US and I choose a deep sea fishing excursion which was also great ... just wish we would have caught something.All in all, a great vacation. First time we were taking our son on a sunny vacation.One last note, I got really sick from food poisining the first night I was back home. Not sure what to blame it on, either a bad breakfast, bad airline food or something I ate at home.

<Content>Awesome time! My daughter and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from March 12th to the 19th, along with many spring breakers from Canada and the USA. The resort was great and we both had a lot of fun. Our room was in block 100. Because it was a fair hike to the beach and pool (which we didn't mind at all because we still walked in the sun and could take in the beautiful grounds while doing so), we didn't have the same problems with water pressure at all. We had hot water when we wanted it, and only had pressure problems one day during the entire week. Our A/C worked well and we had a ceiling fan as well. It was clean, roomy, and more than adequate for the amount of time we spent in it.The food was good too. We especially enjoyed breakfasts and the new Cafe that compared to any Starbucks or Tim Hortons. We went to the Italian, Brasilian, and Mexican restaurants. My favourite was the Italian. My teenage daughter liked the Brasilian. Unfortunately we weren't able to get reservations for the Japanese restaurant while we were there. The tropical drinks were all consistently good and we loved the pina coladas and strawberry daquiris in particular!The resort was a really fun place to be--there was always something to do and the animation team worked very hard to make everyone feel included.I think the people who have written all the negative reviews either had really bad luck, or are too picky for a 4-star resort. If you are stuffy and expect instant service, then perhaps you really should pay more and go for the ultra-luxury places. However, if you want a reasonably priced, beautiful, and fun place to go, don't hesitate to book this one. My daughter has already convinced all of her friends to go back for their spring break next year!

<Content>Mixed Review - HOT Water problem My wife and I stayed 7 nights in a Spa room, March 8-15, 2006. We have been to Puerto Vallarta, Cancun (x3), Punta Cana (x2), so this was not our first vacation.Check in was fast as was check out. No problems.The Spa room is beautiful. Large bathroom, bathtub w/shower. There is a separate jacuzzi tub in the room. However, there was not any HOT water in our room, 6304, Block 6! We called every day to fix or move, without any success. Other people in other blocks did not have that problem.FOOD - Is very good, above average. Main buffet supplies a wide variety of well cooked food. We also ate at the Brazil, Italian, Spanish and Mexican restaurants, very good. You have to book 24 hours in advance. There is a Cafe (coffee) shop on site as part of the all inclusive. Great place.BARS - Lobby, sports, pool and beach bars are great.POOLS - are spacious and warm.Italian quarter - there is a part that caters to Italians, Ocean Cana, it is not a problem, they have there own buffet (same food). Staff are great, friendly and do try. They are limited in special services, plumbing, eletrical, etc. Before you book here, have your agnet confirm the HOT water issue. It is a drag sitting on the ebach and worrying if you can shower or not! Never mind using the jacuzzi you paid for.MarkMark_Ref@yahoo.com

<Content>go vip We stayed 3/9 to 3/14 and were concerned with all the negative comments. Our check in took five minutes and the staff was excellent we were taken by golf cart to our room in block six. No smells and very clean with jacuzzi and shower ocean view and fifty feet to the beach, no problem getting shade spot every day. We had reservations handed to use at check in and we got beer soda and water every day in our room and fresh fruit baskets every day. If you work hard for your money maybe you should think about spending a little extra and go for the vip treatment. Best restraurant by far was the Washabi, Mezzaluna next then the buffet, we were disappointed with the Bahia(Brazilian) meat was over cooked. Spa was also included as was a couple massage and treatment very good and soothing. The only things they missed were face cloths and bottle openers.

<Content>Great Deal! I spent a week at The Ocean Bavaro from 2/28/06 to 03/06/06. I left the states very concerned due to some of the reviews I had read prior to my travel date. I went there expecting nothing and couldn't have had a better time. I am not sure what some of these people were expecting but reception was fine, the wait staff were very assertive, and the food was great. Santiago at the pool bar in the evenings is a great guy and consumate bartender. The beach is unbelievable, around 80+ but always a a nice breeze to keep it comfortable. I am not really into musical plays or dance but the entertainment (animation) was pretty good, I actually sat through two or three of the shows. The culture mix was interesting. I did tip pretty well. I brought about $150.00 in ones and fives. These people do not have much money. We are very fortunate to afford such luxuries so TIP WELL!!!! AND HAVE A GREAT TRIP!!

<Content>Ten Man rates this a 10! Spent two weeks (Feb 19 - Mar 5) at the Ocean Bavaro in Punta Cana. I had read many reviews that were mostly good before deciding to go. I was concerned only because the previous year the weather in Puerta Plata was terrible. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. From the landscaping, the pools, the beach and the rooms. We had a Junior Suite in building 9. The room had a king size bed with a very nice two-person jacuzzi. The main restaurant always had a huge buffet with lots of food to choose from. Also there were a Japanese, Italian, Spanish and Brazilian restaurant for booked meals. The Brazilian also was open in the afternoon for quick meals like burgers, fries and pizza. There also were plenty of watering holes to grab a drink. I earned the nickname Ten Man apparently because I was at the beach bar every morning at 10 o'clock for a beer! Geez , I really miss that pick me up. I've found that most places I've visited had rather poor entertainment but the quality during my two weeks was very good. The musical impersonations was great!We visited Saona Island by catamaran and came back by speed boat. It was a very beautiful beach and a fun day excursion. The dune buggy trip was a blast. From ripping down dirt roads to speeding thru town it was an experience to remember!Best of all, my girlfriend and I met some great people from Ottawa, Mike  Jan, Edmonton, Brent  Bernie(Boomer), and Americans Alan, Emily  Colleen.I mentioned the weather from the previous year, well we got 14 days of 90plus and it rained for two hours on the last day so we couldn't get better than that!I wouldn't hesitate to book another vacation to Punta Cana and the Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>loved this resort!! my boyfriend and i stayed at the ocean bavarro from 3/1-3/7....i must say that i was extremely nervous about this resort after i read these reviews but we decided to hope for the best....upon arrival we were able to check in within 5 minutes....a bellboy helped us to our room..we stayed in a standard room....the room was perfectly clean, the ac worked great the bathroom was clean, the shower worked great...the resort itself is gorgeous, flamingos and palm trees, its just breathtaking....the beach is great and the pools are absolutely beautiful....i'm a very very picky eater so i was really worried about the food....but it was great....we were able to get dinner reservations for every night we were there....the staff was extremely friendly....we never had to wait longer than two minutes for a drink....we had an amazing time and would recommend anyone to go to this resort...i dont understand some of these negative reviews, our stay there was great...the only complaint (and really its not a big deal) is the water pressure is very low from 5-6 probably bc everyone is showering to go to dinner....but the people, the food, the hotel room, the drinks, and the resort itself was outstanding!!

<Content>Not so good for Americans When we arrived we were put in block 11 and the room smelled horrible, I asked to be moved right away because the mold immediately flared up my allergies. We were moved to the block 7, which was fine nothing special but didn鈥檛 have a smell and was clean. We proceed to the beach after check in and I was very impressed with the beach and the pools and the grounds. When we headed to our room to get showered  dressed for dinner, we had no water at all. I called the front desk and was told it should be back on in 25 minutes, but it never came back until the next morning. We finally went down to the buffet, cleaning up as best as possible with no water, food was not too good, we left and got 陆 way back to our room and realized we left our digital camera on the table, we went right back and no one had seen the camera and most had no clue what we were asking, we went to guest services and no one was there, we tried everyday we were there and camera was never found. 4 out of the 6 days we had no water, and my fianc茅 got extremely sick, try vomiting 7-8 times and not able to flush your toilet because there is no water, sure makes it unpleasant if the other person had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I really felt out of place because 90% of the people were European and spoke no English, and neither did most of the workers. All of the instructions for the activities were given in Spanish and French, which made it difficult if you wanted to join in. The bartenders with the exception of Santiago would ignore you unless you tried to order your drink in Spanish. We ran out of money and wanted to do some shopping and needed $20 each to leave the country, so we asked for a ATM machine and were told it was right outside the gates, it did not work the entire time we were there, we were told to go to the small village about a 10 minute walk, (this seems to be where they dump their garbage between the hotels) we got there and this ATM was also broken. We had to go to the bank and wait in line for 40 minutes and show passports, sign many papers to get money from our account and they charge you to do this.I don鈥檛 want to sound totally negative, the weather was perfect the entire 6 days, beach pools and grounds were beautiful and we did get wonderful massages by the pool in the huts. I would not return to this resort, maybe Punta Cana again at a different resort, but only for maybe a 3 night get a way to soak up some sun and to get away from the snow and ice for a couple of days

<Content>Beautriful But Beware Stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from 03/01/06-03/07/06. Just let me say that the resort itself is beautiful. The grounds are very tropical and well kept. The beach of course as you've probably already heard is breathtaking. We've been to Mexico Mayan Riveriera and Jamaica before and the beach at the Ocean Bavaro is somewhat comparable. (Snorkeling not as good though.)Now, on to the bad part. If you plan on taking multiple showers forget about. Little and sometimes no water pressure at this resort. On our last day we had to use cups in the bathtub to take a shower. Complained to staff on several occassions, but was told they were running out of water and to wait until later to shower. Too bad dinner times at reservation restaruants are only for 6:30 and 9:00 so this was not an option. Watch out for the salad and ice cubes. I'm very particular about watching what I drink in areas of the world that advise against drinking the water. I've never been sick at a resort before, but somehow despite being extremely careful I ended up sick for 3 days on my vacation.Lots of Europeans. This resort is more catered towards the older European travelers who look to play botchi ball all day and go to bed at 9:00.Still had a wonderful time though, but would strongly recommend staying at a resort with its own water purification system where water pressure is not a problem and illness seem to occur less. We usually stay at 4 of 5 star resorts, we can definately tell the difference in a 3 star resort such as Ocean Bavaro.Would definately recomend looking into staying at the Occidental or Barcelo resorts if planning on staying in this area of the D.R.

<Content>right on for the price Overall, I thought the resort was exactly what we paid for. We saved about $300 each this year by booking the Ocean Bavaro and the savings was noticed. I do travel quite frequently and found overall this hotel was average. I wouldn't recommed this hotel for families only because the electricity when out. I'll point out the good, not so good, and a few helpful hints. The beach is absolutely gorgeous. The seaweed people talk about is not bad at all. The water is turquoise, warm and nice to swim in!! The weather was great for us, sunny and in the 80's. The grounds are fantastic as well, so don't forget your camera. The rooms are as people mentioned, a little musty smelling and very average. Our toilet did run and was difficult to flush at times. The water pressure in the shower was almost non-existant some days and other days fair. The electricity did go out on us the 1st night, and we simply used our cells phone to continue getting ready which was a little annoying. It was out for about 45 minutes, but never went out again after that night. From my traveling I found the customer-service lacking. I felt very few staff members went out of their way to be helpful and curteous. No major problems just a lot of emotionless service. The food was okay. Everyone can find something to eat since there's a pretty good variety at the buffet. The food is not top notch, but again I think you're getting what you pay for. I actually liked the Bahia restaurant the best. Helpful hints. Yes you have to get up early to get shad on the beach from a palapa. If you get down there after 8-8:30 the odds are you wont get one. Also, to the left of the lobby is the main buffet. Directly before you walk into the buffet is where you make your dinner reservations. Again, people start making reservations for dinner at 7am, so if you get down there after 8:30 you most likely wont get the restaurant you want. Bring with you a print out of the hotel features, because we were not provided with any information in the room and forget what type of restaurants there were, etc and no way to get any specfics. The towels for the pool/beach are located by the beach. If you walk directly up to the beach, look to the left and there's a hunt labeled towels. It's pretty far off to the left and a little hard to see. If your room smells bad right away, don't fret. Ours had just been cleaned when we entered and I wanted to change rooms right away, but I gave it time. They use a horrible cleaining spray which makes your room smell, but it does go away and then just the normal musty smell returns, which you can definitely live with. I just wouldn't go changing rooms right away if you don't need to. It's very hard to get an iron, so if you like to iron your clothes I'd bring one! If anyone has questions, feel free to email me. I just returned on Monday, March 6th.

<Content>Looks can be deceiving!! My husband and I stayed at Ocean Bavaro from March 1-7. I read all the reviews prior to going and they were about 50/50 so we decided to go and hope for the best. AIRPORTUpon arriving, we were pleased to see how quick and easy it was to get through the airport. The whole process only took 15-20 minutes. You stop and buy a Tourist Visa for $10 each and then proceed to Immigration. Then you collect your baggage and go through customs where all they asked us what which hotel we were staying at. However, immediately after customs, there were about 2 dozen men with luggage carts trying to grab our bags from us. We kept saying, No Gracias, but they are pretty ruthless. They basically block your path so you have to push through them to get out. This was the only negative thing about the airport. We quickly found our van and driver and they loaded our luggage and within about 15 minutes we were on our way.CHECK-INIt took about 45 minutes to reach the resort as we stopped at about 3 other hotels on the way. Upon arriving, the hotel looked beautiful. The lobby was huge and airy with a bar off to the side. We approached the desk to check in and we were given our bracelets after about 10 minutes and then told to have a seat and come back in 15 minutes. We did so and then returned to the desk. We got a room in block 5 on the 2nd floor. (I had sent an e-mail requesting a room in block 5 or 6 based on previous reviews). We were given 1 room key and 2 towel cards. When I requested a key for the safe the guy told me they weren't available and to come back tomorrow. He also told me to come back tomorrow when I requested a 2nd room key. No big deal.ROOMSThe bell boy helped us take our luggage to our room. (We tipped him $3) Our room was great upon first glance. Perfect location right by the beach and pools. Nice view. It did have a musty smell to it, but nothing we couldn't live with. The fridge had 2 Pepsi's, 2 7-Ups, and 2 bottles of water. Everything appeared to be in working order. We were pleasantly surprised. There are NO face clothes though so if you want them, bring your own. We knew this and we came prepared. Also, no kleenex or facial tissue so we brought this too. Our room was great until later that day when the A/C stopped working. We noticed there was water leaking from our bathroom ceiling too. The A/C was located over the bathroom. We reported it and someone came out and supposedly fixed it. However, over the next 3 days, it stopped working 3 more times! Altogether we had someone fix it 4 times before it finally worked right. If they would have just fixed it right the first time, it would be no issue at all. However, when it's 80 degrees and humid outside, it's hard to sleep comfortably with no A/C. We did tip our maid $2-3 a day and she stocked the fridge with extra bottled water and we always had plenty of towels.BEACHThe beach is absolutely wonderful. White sand and turquoise water. The water is a good temp. Plenty of lounge chairs but yes, it's hard to find one in the shade if you wait until 10 or 11:00 to hit the beach. No problem, as I wanted the sunshine! We had no problem getting towels except for one time when we tried to exchange our dirty ones for clean ones and they told us to come back tomorrow. We just kept the ones we had. There are Hobie Cats (small sail boats) and kayaks included. We sailed on the Hobie Cats 4 days and used the kayaks once. All of the other water sports cost extra I think. They have para-sailing, banana boat rides, tubing, and little jet boats. No jet skiis though - too many accidents so we were told. We tried to go on the banana boat twice but we were told we couldn't go with only 2 people but we couldn't find anyone else to go! They did not try to assist us to coordinate with others so we could have gone. It was $8 per person for the banana. POOLSThe pools are awesome. The main pool with the swim-up bar is the biggest pool I have ever seen! There are shallow areas for the kids as well as a volleyball net set up at one end for games. The pools were a little bit dirty, but as someone else mentioned, it's pretty hard to keep sand out of the pools when the beach is right nearby. There were also plenty of chairs around the pools.FOODThis is where the problems happened! In my opinion (and my husbands) the food at this resort was awful. It was weird and some of it unrecognizable. I got sick with diarreah and stomach cramps the first night we were there. I stayed in the room from 7:30pm until the next morning. My husband went to the pool bar and drank rum  Cokes until 2am. He has a high tolerance and gets drunk but never gets sick. However, he got extremely sick that night. He was throwing up for 2 hours. We don't know if it had something to do with the food he ate or the different rum that we're not accustomed to. Then on our 3rd night, I got really, really sick. Diarreah and vomiting, chills and hot flashes, all the symptoms of food poisoning. I had not drank any alcohol since our first day there so it had to be from the food. I was sick all night and then weak and achey the next day. After that I was scared to eat anything. I stuck to bread and pasta and only drank bottled water and Pepsi. A lot of other people we talked to were also getting sick from the food. It was not good. I know there are a lot of people from Europe at this resort and they're catering to everyones tastes, but some of the selections were just really strange and unedible. And yes, as mentioned in previous reviews, they do put corn and tuna fish on the pizza as toppings!!! Yuck! If it wasn't for the nasty food, I would have rated this resort 4 stars. PEOPLEYes, all the staff speak primarily Spanish, but hey, you're in their country! For the most part, many of them understood the basics in Spanish, English,  French. A lot of the guests staying there were French - either from France or Canada. Also had people who were Italian, German, Spanish, etc. This did make it somewhat hard to communicate or carry on a conversation. The last few days, the resort seemed to fill up with young kids on Spring Break who were quite loud and obnoxious at times. Like someone else said, don't go here for peace and quiet!ENTERTAINMENTThe entertainment staff was excellant and hardworking. We went to the evening shows every night except for the 2 I was sick. The MC speaks 5 different languages! It got a little annoying when he had to keep repeating everything 5 times though! No big deal. The show on Thursday was my favorite - lots of dancing. These guys (and girls) dance like professionals. It was better than watching Dancing with the Stars! They also entertained during the day at the beach with music and games. They had aerobics on the beach in the morning, etc. They work very hard all day and night.BARSThere were plenty of bars throughout the resort. 2 on the beach, one at the main pool, one in the lobby, one in the sports bar. Santiago is the best bar-tender! He works evenings at the main pool bar. We tipped him well while we were there. He would have your drink for you before you hardly sat down.MISC.There are 2 pool tables near the main pool and one in the sports bar. We used these alot. We also got massages twice at the little huts set up around the pools. It cost $20 for 1/2 hour. Very relaxing. We only went to the Disco once - it was not really our kind of music. There's another bar in the Disco. The staff takes pictures of you through-out your stay and then posts them in their photo shop. You can buy the smallest one for $9. We bought one that turned out really nice. As for bugs, I got a few mosquito bites. We saw about 8 mosquitos in our room while there. The shopping was nothing spectacular. The same thing in every store - t-shirts, cigars, jewelry, keychains, paintings, etc. They do hound you to come in their store and buy things - you just have to say no thanks and keep walking.DEPARTUREOur check-out was quick and simple. We could not find our CheapCaribbean rep the day before so we weren't exactly sure what time our bus was leaving for the airport. We just allowed ourselves plenty of time. It seems that the norm is for the bus to leave 3 hours before the time of your flight. We had one little mishap on the way to the airport. Our driver pulled over and opened the engine compartment - our bus was overheating and smoking!! We stood on the side of the road for about 10 minutes and then luckily another bus came by and we squished into it. We did not have to pay the $20 Departure tax at the airport - it must have been included in our package.OVERALLAll in all, we had a good time. The weather was sunny except for one day where it rained half the day. It also rained at night a few times. Our room was good except for the A/C problems. The worst part of our trip was the awful food and getting sick from it. This alone will prevent me from ever going to this resort again. Even before I got sick, none of the food really tasted good and it was same old thing every day at the buffets. I lost 5 lbs. on our trip! You're not supposed to LOSE weight at an All-Inclusive resort! Good luck to those of you going and please be careful of the food.

<Content>Buyer Beware My wife and I stayed at ocean bavaro Feb. 20-27. the price was good and the hotel was rated 4 stars. We arranged airport transfers through turitor (local tour company). They were not prepared for us at the airport (we had to wait at least 30 minutes for them to get their act together.). Their representative at ocean bavaro (fast Eddie) was incompetent. We informed him the first night of our departure plans (through Santo Domingo), reminded him on thru. and sat. He still had to do all the arrangements on the moon. morning of our departure. Very stressful!The resort was beautiful. Grounds were kept immaculate, beach was raked each morning (lots of sea grass!) and you couldn鈥檛 put an empty plate down without the staff immediately picking it up. The food was mediocre at best. The warmer trays in the buffet did not work (cold food that should have been hot!). Meats were tough to cut much less eat. (Best entr茅es were chicken!) Seafood was tasteless even with the cold sauce to put on it. Table wines were worse than grape juice. Beer (el presidente) was good and cold! mixed drinks were certainly not premium. No trouble with any of the foods as far as stomach trouble was concerned. Ate all salads and no one had any trouble!!Ate at the Brazilian restaurant one night; basically another buffet. The waiters came around with different meats but again they were terrible. (Except the chicken!) the other 鈥渟pecialty鈥?restaurants were unobtainable (they start taking reservations 2 days in advance at 7am. by 8am when I came , they did not have any spots left except for the 6:30 seating at the Brazilian.)Restaurant managers were always unavailable and invisible. Most of the restaurant staff did not speak English but they knew the basics (beer, tea, coffee water, etc.) top management was even more invisible (what are they afraid of?)We were originally assigned a room in block 95 back off the beach (after requesting an ocean view.). The room was immaculate, modern and quite large but we wanted something closer to the beach. We made arrangements with a desk supervisor to see an upgraded room later that night. We took a room in block 6 (Caribbean spa room) for an extra $240 cash). It was well worth it! The room鈥檚 balcony overlooked the beach and we just had to walk out the block entrance to be on the beach. The room had a Jacuzzi and was extra large. All plumbing worked and the bed was comfortable (after the staff repaired the broken slats). The room was well worth (to us) the extra money.The weather was perfect, the beach clean and the water warm. don鈥檛 take the snorking trip (not many colorful fish and dead coral!). Pelican (on site water sports) sent us out with a non-English speaking captain and a boat without easy access back to the boat. (My wife almost broke a rib as they pulled her back into the boat!) Most of us could have done without the loud music coming from the beach staff (and constant whistles) as they created activities for about 15 people while the other 200 on the beach tried to relax! An unnecessary intrusion on those of us that wanted peace and quiet!All in all, we had a good time. But if you are spoiled like us (we go to Aruba every summer), you will find a lot of negatives. The beach isn鈥檛 as good, the food not up to expectations and the staff under trained. I would rate it 2 陆 stars!Jim Doig

<Content>Loved this resort! We just got back from the resort and I must say we were impressed. First, we had read a few negative reviews on this resort so we did not know what to really expect. Well for us, this trip was just great. When our travel agent made the reservation, we had requested a room on top floor of block 5 after reading lots of review on trip adviser. When we got to the hotel for check in (it took about 25 minutes which is not bad in the Carrebian..) we were delighted to find out we got what we asked for. So block 5 is the closest to the beach and we were on the top floor with a great view of the beach and the pool. Room was very clean, we had plenty of towels and they were changed every day. The mini bar was stocked with lots of water and pop. As far as the food, the buffet had always something to please us and the taste of everything was pretty good, lot better than in Cuba.We were able to go to the Mexican and Italian restaurant quite easily. Again the food was very good. The wine had not a great taste but hey...the price is not bad! We had bought 3 bottles at the duty free so we took them to the buffet. The people working at the resort are very nice and helpful. So I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good quality resort for a reasonable price. And yes we would go back again!

<Content>Loved it, would def go back, but not for everyone Just got back from Ocean Bavaro from Feb 22-28, and we had a fantastic time. From reading the other reviews, maybe we just got lucky, maybe we just have a better attitude. We arrived around 2:30pm and they welcomed us, told us check-in was at three, and sent us off to the buffet for lunch. The reception area is gorgeous, open, and airy. The food was as good as you can expect for any all-you-can-eat buffet, and there was enough variety that you should be able to find something to eat. LOTS of fresh fruit which I ate every day. Smoothies at breakfast as well as make-your-own bloodies and mimosas. I never got sick from the food there (the alcohol is another story ;) ). And I would say the free wine was undrinkable. So I had beer and cocktails instead, and paid $20-30 USD for good bottles of South American wine at the reservation-only restaurants. I'm not complaining, the same wine here would have been more. So, the room and checking in... A little bit confusing because they took my paperwork, didn't say anything, and went into a back room. So we just kind of stood there hoping something would happen and it did. In a few minutes, we got our room keys, went to the room, and were very pleasantly surprised to find a jacuzzi in our room! Yes, the lights were dim, and yes, the pillows were lumpy, but we were on vacation and there to have a good time, not to find things to complain about. Once you laid down and night, you didn't feel the lumps. And for light, just open the windows! We had NO problems with hot water or water pressure. Nothing went missing and we left ipods, cameras out on the counters. The staff was very entertaining and tri-lingual. Any attempts at us speaking Spanish were very well appreciated, as it is the least we could do being visitors to their country. The BEACH was gorgeous. The weather fantastic. Warm, sunny, and breezy everyday. Just wear lots of sunblock. I'm olive skinned, wore SPF30 all the time, and still got burned, so be careful. Fun activities like Bingo, and entertaining shows at night (a la Univision variety shows). We also went to the Spa-- WOW. Do this. My boyfriend and I went together and they accommodated us by allowing the two of us to use the men's changing room and sauna (privately of course). Then he went off for a facial and massage while I got exfoliated, wrapped in mud, and massaged. He got a pedicure as well. And the packages were $125US each. A steal! The spa was actually very luxurious and serene. A must do.Basically, it's a good solid resort, clean with what you need; it's not luxurious per se, but we only paid $700 per person for flight and 6 nights so what can you expect?

<Author>WinnipegCouple
<Content>A Comprehensive Review from an Experienced Traveller Background of the reviewer:I'm 28, my wife is 25. She has traveled extensively with her family, together we have been to Cancun, Acapulco, Tahiti, New Zealand and Portugal...so we're fairly experienced, knowledgeable travelers.Check In:We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro for one week, Feb 22nd to Mar 1st. After a 30-40 minute air conditioned bus ride, we arrived at the resort. Check in was delayed approx 1 hour while rooms were cleaned from the previous vacationers leaving. When we checked in, keys for the safe were not available...we checked back the next day at approx 1:20pm  received a safe key. Cost for the key is $20US for the week, plus $20 deposit. A little disturbing, but you really should be locking your suitcases anyway. While waiting for our rooms, we were free to visit the bar  get our vacation underway.Rooms:We stay in room 1409 (Block 1, Rm 409). The room wasn't spectacular but wasn't terrible either. The fridge was stocked with 7up, Pepsi  bottled water. A single $3 tip on the second day got us 6 bottles of water daily in the fridge vs the original 4 for the rest of our stay. Our AC worked just fine  the room itself was clean, though the sheets were not changed during our stay. My only real complaint about the resort relates to the room...there was little to no water pressure at varying times during the day, so showering proved to be a bit of a challenge at times. It was either a scalding hot or freezing cold trickle or a just generally low pressure. The toilet also ran  just flushed poorly in general, but a quick bend of the float arm fixed it up nicely. The TV had at least 4 english channels (TBS, USA, WGN  NBC), more than enough for the time we spent there, keep in my though, we don鈥檛 travel to stay in the room.Restaurants:The resort had one large buffet restaurant and five a la cartes. The main buffet served food of average quality and there was always something for just about any taste, again, not spectacular, but really not that bad, put it this way, I went for seconds at every meal. Breakfasts in the main buffet were again average. All the a la cartes were very good, with the exception of the Brazilian, which wasn't terrible, but the meat was overcooked, I would rate it average. The Spanish, Italian, Mexican  Japanese were all really good, far above what I expected having read reviews on here. The Brazlian served really good lunches from 12-3, primarily consisting of seafoods, pork, chicken and the usual French fries  some pastas. One tip is to get down  make your reservation for the next night by 8:30am, otherwise, don鈥檛 count on being able to get a spot.Entertainment:The resort has a 6-10 member entertainment team on duty from about 10am to 11pm everyday. I honestly don't think these guys sleep. From beach games to aerobics to evening shows, this group tries really hard, and I believe, succeeds at making the days fun. During our stay, between the two of us, we played Volleyball, Soccer, Baseball, Football, Water Polo  other crazy games, I was even up on stage playing some other game. I really can鈥檛 say enough positive things about this group. They went above and beyond to make it really fun to be on the beach.Beach:The beach itself is cleaned every morning by the staff. You will find some vegetation there, though it鈥檚 not the slimy seaweed kind, more short twigs that really isn鈥檛 bothersome. The water is relatively calm and clean. One tip for those of you who鈥檝e never been to a resort like this, wake up early (the towel hut opened at 8, but we鈥檇 keep our towels for 2-3 days), get down to the beach  put your towels on your beach chairs, then go back to have breakfast, continue napping, book your a la carte, etc. If you don鈥檛, you won鈥檛 be on the beach or you鈥檒l be stuck in the burning sun, the palapas fill up quick. You can walk north or south on the beach for miles. There are plenty of shops and some great people watching. When shopping for souvenirs, the Dominicans are much less aggressive than Mexicans, but will really try to quote you high the first time you ask for a price. The Signature Rep suggested trying to get it for 1/3 what you鈥檙e quoted, I would suggest going much lower though. If they don鈥檛 like what you quote them, walk away  they鈥檒l start coming down in price.Resort in general:This is a large resort, with several pools, a decent gym and plenty of things to do.Other guests:Most of this resorts clientele while we were there were either from France or Quebec, as such, expect that you will be hearing a lot of French from the staff  guests. This was not a problem at all for us as we鈥檙e both quite fluent. I found most of the other guests to be polite  always having a smile on their faces. Some on the other hand were just downright rude or ignorant, ignore them  have fun.Check Out:While we did have to burn an hour waiting for transfer, the hotel staff does not remove your bracelet, so you鈥檙e free to eat  drink to your hearts content. Another bus ride to the airport  we were on our way. A note about the airport, if you don鈥檛 want to tip someone, drag your own luggage. There will be men there waiting to take your luggage  will even try to take it from your hands. This is common in Mexico/the Caribbean, just be polite  drag your own stuff.Who I would recommend this resort to:Couples  Families of all ages. This is a large resort, there was probably 5-700 people there when we were there. If you enjoy fun, sun, music  games this is a good destination.Who I would not recommend this resort to:One group that comes to mind is honeymooners. This is NOT a quiet, romantic resort. There are lots of people, lots of kids, loud music  fun (unless of course that鈥檚 what you鈥檙e looking for). If you want a quiet resort, look elsewhere. It鈥檚 not obnoxious in your face loud, but it is busy.Travel Tips Review:Airport 鈥?Don鈥檛 let them take your luggage if you don鈥檛 want to tip.A la Carte Restaurants 鈥?Book EARLY  for the next day if you want a spot.Beach 鈥?Get down  get your palapa (umbrella) early, before 8:30am if you want a prime spot. Leave your towels on them (they鈥檒l be fine, there鈥檚 security on the beach), then you can go back when you want to.Attitude 鈥?Be polite  courteous, more importantly, RELAX! It鈥檚 your vacation! Don鈥檛 sweat the details  just be happy that you鈥檙e fortunate enough in life to be able to travel, many people aren鈥檛! One complaint I heard was someone complaining that they didn鈥檛 get what they paid for, get over yourself, if you want what you pay for go to WalMart.Haggling for souvenirs 鈥?They will quote you a ridiculously high price, counter it with a ridiculously low one  meet somewhere in the 20-30% of what you were quoted range. Don鈥檛 be afraid to walk away and don鈥檛 feel pressured to buy something you don鈥檛 really want.Final thoughts:Overall, I have to say that this place exceeded my expectations. I was quite happy with the service of all the staff, the food and the resort in general鈥f course, it has it鈥檚 quirks, but this is a third world country after all. If you鈥檙e that picky about every little detail, go to a five star, or better yet, stay at home, because I don鈥檛 want whiners  complainers ruining my vacation. The nicer  more polite you are with the staff, the better service you鈥檒l receive  the more fun you鈥檒l have. You鈥檇 be surprised how a smile  a few Spanish words can make a world of difference. We had a terrific time here  I wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Can't complain We went to Ocean Bavaro Spa  beach resort from Feb.8 to Feb.22. There were 25 people in our group, half stayed for one week and the other half stayed for two. My husband and I were married on the beach on Feb.13 and I couldn't have asked for a better wedding. Our co-ordinator Sandra was amazing. The flowers were perfect the orginazation was impeccable. My husband and I were lucky enough to be upgraded to Block 6 in the honeymoon suite with an ocean front view. It was the most beautiful room I have ever stayed in. The rest of our group was in block 96, which wasn't too bad. A few people requested to move to block 100 which was extremely nice for a standard room. Food - The buffet wasn't bad, but got sickening after two weeks. My cure to the buffet is to make yourself a sandwich using the bread, veggies and cheese. It made my second week a breeze. We went to the Spanish, Italian, Mexican and Japanese restaurants. They were all good. Most of our group went to the Japanese at least 3 or 4 times...it was a definate crowd pleaser.Pool - Good old Santiago!!! The service at the swim up bar was great. I agree that the pool could have been kept a bit cleaner, but what do you expect when you have hundreds of people jumping into the pool after walking from the sandy beach. I think they did their best to keep it as clean as possible. Beach - The most beautiful beach I have ever seen. This resort has the best beach/lounging area in the vacinity of resorts. Shopping - Not the place to go if you want to shop. I personally found the market a bit expensive...compared to Mexico anyway. I wasn't really going there to shop, so it didn't really affect me. The shop owners are VERY AGGRESSIVE, to the point that I only went to the Market twice because I didn't want to deal with them. We did get some beautiful paintings and wooden masks for a decent price.People - Overall most people (guests and staff) were friendly and helpful. We met a lot of great people from Ontario and Wisconsin. I do wish that SOME of the French people stayed home though....I have never met more ignorant and rude people in my life!!Sickness - Out of 25 of us, about 8 people got sick...no idea what from, but each was only sick for about 24-36 hours and then they were fine. I think our North American bodies are just not used to the change in food and climate.Make sure to bring: facecloths, munchies, tips or gifts for your maids and of course a good attitude as it is a different country and you have to expect that it is not going to be just like home.Overall, I was pleased with our stay. I would go back to this resort.

<Content>Worst resort ever We stayed at this resort January 19 to February 2, 2006. It was the worst resort we ever stayed inThe bathroom ceiling leaked the first nite there. In the morning we went to reception and told them, they said they would fix it. Two days later the ceiling was saggy and shifting it was so full of water. Went to phone and our phone did not work. The lights in the room were horrible, could not read, thats how dull they were. We had freezing cold water for five days. We had a nice big room, but there was no table or chairs so one could play cards or whatever. We had to constantly ask for towels and bathmats. The dishes in the buffet restaurants were disgusting, you had to go through dozens of glasses and plates to find a clean one. When they moved us to our knew room, the safety deposit box did not work. We went V.I.P. to say the least, the service was disgusting. It was something every day, this resort is not even a 3 star rating as far as I am concern. We have travelled for years and have always had a great time, this year was a night mare.

<Content>Great Time... Fantastic Resort!!! We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro for one week (Feb. 18-25). We absolutely loved this resort and would not hesitate to return or to recommend it to others. As this was our 4th trip to Punta Cana, we knew what to expect from the airport, transfer, check-in etc. Upon arrival at 1pm, we were stunned by the beautiful lobby. The staff were quick and helpful about getting us our room as soon as possible. We booked a stadard room but before we left on vacation I emailed the resort and requested for our room to be in Block 4 which I had heard from other reviews was a good building. I was delighted to know that my email was recieved and we were given a great room in Block 4 on the top floor. The room was great for a standard room. Two double beds, satelite TV, restocked minifridge everyday, lots of towels in the very large bathroom... and best of all, it was in the most central location of the resort...close to everything!! Our room did not smell as other people have written in their reviews. The room was the cleanest we have every had for a standard room. The only problem we had was around 5 or 6 o'clock everyday there was very low water pressure in the bathroom from everyone trying to take a shower at the same time.Beach: fantastic!! Clear blue water which was very very warm. Resort is close to el Cortecito so its great for shopping. We did have a hard time getting an umbrella on the beach, but thats the same at any resort if you dont get up early to reserve one.There are lots of water sports near this resort, so there are lots of boats going by... it was never a problem though and was actually amusing to watch.Pools looked nice. There were three... one with a swim up bar. We didnt go in the pools.. but not for any specific reason other than that we are die hard beach people.Food: The food was by far the best we have ever had at an all-inclusive resort. The buffet had plenty of selection and we never went hungry. I think I gained 5 pounds while I was there!! hahaWe tried the Mexican and Italian a la cartes. Both were FANTASTIC!! Very delicious! It was so EASY to make reservations. There is a little desk directly in front of the main buffet where you simply line up in the morning (starting at 7am) and tell the lady where you'd like to go that night or the following night and she books you in. Couldn't have been any easier.Service: AMAZING!! We found that everyone went out of thier way to please us. We never had an empty glass of water or wine. Never had an empty drink at the bar. It was fantastic. The staff here work really hard and deserve every tip they get. Language barrier was never a problem as it has been at some other resorts we have been to.We were given access to all the facilities on the resort complex including restaurants, pools, activities...etc.We viewed the Carribean Spa suites and the Honeymoon suites... very nice. We also watched a wedding ceremony on the beach which was very nice and saw that alot of preparation was put into it by the staff.The spa was huge and offered many great services.This is just a note to some of the other reviews posted on here... specifically the negative ones. While I realize that everyone is entitled to thier own opinion, some people are comming off sounding really horrible in thier reviews. For god sake, your in a third world country at a beach resort. Of course there are always going to be a few problmes. Of course there might be something you are not completely happy with. But suck it up.You paid a reasonable price for a 4 star resort. If you wanted luxury and pampering and to avoid any potential problmes , you should have paid the extra money for a 5 star luxury resort! Dont go to a 4 star and then complain about everything. Of course there are going to be a few minor hassles. But your on vacation. Bottom line, this is a great resort and is offered at a great price. There are tons of facilities and we were given access to them all. If your looking for a relaxing vacation in the hot weather with great service and scenery.. this is the spot for you. Complaining about every little thing really sucks the fun out of any vacation, so of course you'll have a lousy time. Take it with a grain of salt and enjoy your vacation.

<Content>I should have listened. I owed this review to the people that like me check tripadvisor for help on were to go. Please do not go to Ocean Bavaro. I read dozens of reviews before I decided to book. It was 50-50, so I took my chances, I regreted now. They have plenty of problems, but the most serious is false advertisement, they say they have this big complex of hotels (3)were you could go and use the facilities of all of them.We were turned down on this one buffet and were told they only served Italians, that that section of the complex was reserved only for their italians customers. Cannot begin to tell you how that felt, we had to get up and leave, no one could go there, they had security guards around that area.., but the do advertise as if you could use ALL the facilities. The are completely disorganized, no one can help you, you dontknow when or where the activities are taking place. How to make dinner reservations(no one told us we need them)We had to pay for bottle water and bottle beer(we thought it was an ALL INCLUSIVE)The people were not as friendly, we have been to DR before, and this was a first, I guess the athmosphere is contagious in that place. The hotel grounds are beatiful, but we had problems with the rooms, all 4 of them. They actually gave my friend a room that was already occupied(no one realized this) and to make it worse the bell boy left her luggage in there with someone else's stuff(was he drunk not to realize the room was not empty) when she tried to get in the room the key did not work, it took her 5 hrs to get everything straight as she waited in the lobby with her 3 kids.My mom got her key but no luggage until 11pm( we got there @ 12 pm) O, but the next day they both got a tray of rotten fruit and 2 cookies. This people have no respect for their customers or their own bussiness. we work hard for our money, mine was a waste, I hope you spend yours wisely, dont stay in the ocean bavaro. I recommend Barcelo Bavaro and MeliaBavaro, you pay more but is soooo worth it. Happy travels.

<Content>Loved the Ocean Bavaro It was great! Where to begin? Flight down was great! Very small airport with a thatched roof and no gates 鈥?all outdoors! Make sure you have your $10 per person to get into the country handy and much faster with passports! We got a taxi right away for $25.00 to Ocean Baa-vaa-row (that is how they pronounce it) 20 minute scary drive as there appear to be no road rules! Very nice resort 鈥?we got a nice room after about a twenty minute wait, nothing spectacular but two full size beds with very good mattresses and clean nice shower. Pillows were VERY lumpy but we took our own. No musty smell at all. We were in block 5 and it was a little noisy sometimes at night but not bad - we just ran our AC then. We also did not always have hot water immediately but we ran it for a little while and soon there was. A few people were not happy and complained 鈥?some got a free upgrade, some had to pay for the upgrade. We had bottled water, 7up and Pepsi in our fridge 鈥?left a note and tipped and we got 6 bottles a day instead of two. Tip the maids, they did a great job of keeping out room clean.  Weather was absolutely beautiful every day 鈥?96 to 98 degrees. Very light breeze all the time and it feels good. It rained (sprinkled) for less than 10 minutes a day, 2 days and rained for about an hour one time in the night. Everything is lush and green and well kept up. Best beach I have ever been on 鈥?sand is white and almost like powdered sugar soft! No shells on the beach at all which was different. They rake the seaweed in the morning and it gets a little sea-weedy on the shore by mid day but no big deal! Beach in front of the resort is the game area along with games at the pools, (noisy) we went just past the boat equipment area everyday and it was quiet and nice. There is a tiki bar down there right before the shops. You can walk for miles on the beach 鈥?breathtaking with the turquoise water. Ocean was warm and not too wavy for most water sports.  Food on the buffet was average at best, only real complaint anout this resort because it was phenomenal in Peurta Plata but the beach was not as nice there but we always found something that we liked but were somewhat choosy based on different cuisine. It was not necessarily a bad thing to drop a few lbs on vacation for once!! We stuck to the rule that we did not eat anything that was not cooked and we did not drink their water (although they said you could) and we never got sick, even though we had a LOT of ice in our drinks and slushies! Reservations for restaurants have to be made at 7:00 a.m. line right next to the buffet area and you can reserve for that night and the next night. Spanish restaurant was good if you like seafood, also sirloin was OK. Italian was not good. We were not able to get into the Brazilian or the Japanese as we always slept a little too long. We did not eat lunch but there is another buffet that is down by the beach. They also do hamburgers and tortilla pizza鈥檚 (we called it Piza Hut)until late (midnight?) which are OK. Toppings for pizza included corn and hotdogs 鈥?yuck!Drinks were great!! Santiago at the pool bar is the best 鈥?tipped him well and he always knew exactly what we wanted and kept us stocked. We checked out Ocean Blue also. Brand new and very nice but really spread out and a little too big for us. We only saw the suites which all had Jacuzzi鈥檚 and were immaculate. No one could believe the deal that we got through cheapcarribean and even tho we listened to the time share to get a free spa massage, they could not meet or match our price we paid. Most people we talked to there paid double for the same thing. You can also go to Ocean Cana 鈥?walk there and with your bracelet, all is included. Or you can shuttle to the casino at Ocean Princess.We did not do any tours 鈥?we were just lazy old slugs, slept and walked the beach a lot. Again, I think it depends on what you are looking for, we wanted relax and got it. There are vendors that come in on Friday night and you can haggle. There is also a big bonfire beach party on Friday night that was fun. Oh yeah, the new coffee shop was new but doesn鈥檛 open until like 4 p.m. 鈥?Great flavored coffees, frappacinos, etc. and cakes, cookies etc. Also new sports bar with a pool table. We listened to the Piano man a few times but never even made it to a show. They do not specifically cater to American鈥檚 鈥?more to French and Europeans and there were very few English speaking guests so when we heard it, we were quick to chat. Canadians were nice 鈥?French were very rude鈥?Dominicans were very friendly and happy and really communication was not an issue.Overall tho it was wonderful!! I would go again in a heartbeat! To get back to the airport, 鈥淔ast Eddie: the cheap carribean rep鈥?got us a transport for $15.00 instead of the $25.00 taxi. We did not have to pay the $20 to leave the country that we had heard about - not sure why?? Enuf info???? Whew! Only other recommendation I would have is to take face washcloths if you are used to using them 鈥?they do not have any. Definitely take insulated mugs for on the beach 鈥?they gladly fill them and if you don鈥檛, you get plastic small cups that tip easy, warm fast and get sand blown in them on the beach. Oh yeah 鈥?we purchased an international phone card that did not work. Also, very costly to call collect or credit card. BUT there is an internet center that is open from 9:00 til 1:00 and 2:00 til 10:00 pm which worked out great for communicating. $3.00 for 15 minutes or $9.00 for an hour. Again, as I have read on this site before, your trip is what you make it. For another country, we were impressed with the resort, service, people!

<Content>A great vacation...nothing bad to say We stayed for 1 week at the Ocean Blue hotel from Jan 1st to jan 8th 2006, and it was the best vacation ever!! Since we were travelling with 3 children (2, 7 and 9 years), we needed an hotel that could accomodate 5 per room. Ocean Blue Jr suite was choisen with this in mind. My hunband supprised me when he said that he booked the V.I.P. accomodations, 3 脿 la carte diners included, water sports for 1 hour per day, catamaran trip each day, one horse-backriding trip per week, one massage per adult per week, and probably other advantages that I can't remember right now. After a bumpy bus ride to the hotel (to say the least), we were greeted like kings and queens, in a really beautiful lobby. When the buss-boy realized that we had the VIP voutcher, he took our bags to a different check-in desk, where we got a Ocean-blue drink,  the kids got a frozen juice. Nice...being so tired and hot. The lady at the front desk now explained to us in details all the advantages that our blue VIP bracelet will give us...we can call her from 7 am till 11 pm, anytime to reserve a restaurant, an activity outside the hotel, whatever we wanted...wow....what a service!! We even have a private concierge at the bottom of our room complex, if we need anything for the room. The bossboy took all of our luggages and we were taken to our room in a golf cart. Didnt need to wait a few hours, luggage-less like the other guess. Very nice.Now lets talk about our room....we got room 1617, on the upper level, the second room from the corner, with the most incredible view on the beach, the pool. SO BEAUTIFUL...and the room itself smelled so good...the housekeeper probably sprayed some perfume...it smelled so fresh...only one problem, we are 5, and one king size canopy bed, plus a small sofa, not even a sofa bed...so 1st call to the concierge: she offered us a room with 2 double beds, but on the first floor, with a view on the fence and the back side of the hotel next door...we finaly deceided to be tough and kept our beautiful but smaller room...small price to pay...(the next day I saw a baby bed in an alley, and the maids took it to our room.)We saw that the mini-fridge wasnt working properly, so 5 minutes later, someone came to change it. And someone else came to fill it with soft drinks, wine, water bottles. We had to ask the concierge for beer and diet coke (witch never came...I dont think that they have that in Dom Rep) but it didnt really matther..They also bring us some orange juice (more Tang than real juice, but I'm being difficult) and milk for the baby.The only negative thing that I can say about this hotel is the reservation for the a la carte restaurants.. The reservations had to be done before 3 pm for the same night, and lots of time, there was no place at the seating that you wanted. One night our room number wasn't on the reservation list, at the grill restaurant...the restaurant was almost haft-full, and they didnt want to accomodate us. Being a bit mad, I left for my room, to go and call the reception and make a complaint, but my husband caught me, saying that the hostess from the restaurant finaly found us a table!!! I have nothing negative to say about the food at this hotel, is was quite good, ok not a 5 stars restaurant...but everybody got to eat 3 meals a day, without getting sick, and enjoying it.The kids dint want to leave the pool, they loved it so much, the baby was pointing at the in pool bar for some juice all the time...too funny...the waiter would make her laugh...and dancing with her...We just loved the beach, so clean, beautiful white sand.Like everone there we had to putsome towels and a book to reserve nice chairs by the pool or beach, but that was ok. The temperature was fine, only one night it rained, very windy the last few days, so that would explain why there was more seaweed in the water. But that's nature, thats not the hotel's fault.Oh yes, one big thing that worried me before going to Punta Cana was the bugs...they make us take anti-malaria pills, I donno really why, cause I couldnt see a moskito anywhere, just once in a while a little fly, even less bugs that here in Montreal during the summer months!! So we loved it so much we wanna go again next winter....but for 2 weeks now....

<Content>Very disappointing I didn't read the comments on this site before our trip and now I wish I had!!! It was one fiasco after another with this resort. I want to start with something positive so with the exception of the front desk staff, everyone working at this hotel were so friendly and accommodating. There. Thats done. We arrived late afternoon and went to our room. It was a first floor room and the room smelled of mold. The tiles in the bathroom were black with mildew, the tub was cracked and the shower faced backwards toward the wall and when you tried to spin it, it dropped. We changed rooms the following afternoon after we were told to come back later in the morning. Our second room was fine but a far cry from the 4 star resort we had anticipated. They brag of the 5 a la carte restaurants but you can't book them more than a day in advance and if you sleep past 8am you can forget booking a restaurant for the next day. The buffet was okay for the first day but it got old fast to the point of dreading going to eat and the snack bar was always out of food and very limited to really bad hamburgers, hotdogs and pizza (that had corn on it). Each day was a fight to get a beach towel. If you didn't pick one up by 10am you didn't get one until the afternoon. Come back later was a phrase I got very tired of hearing at this resort. It was to the point that we kept our beach towels for the week and just dried them in our rooms overnight. The entertainment was dreadful. It was the same sleazy lounge singer each night singing the same songs in the same order. If I heard Jesterday one more time I would scream!! He didn't even sing the right words!!! The resort is very isolated that a quick trip into town for shopping is out of the question. You are stuck on this resort. There is one store on the resort for all your basic needs including Viagra and Amoxicillin (by the pill - seriously). The souvenirs in this store were garbage. The time share sales people were such a pain. We were at the point of being rude to them by the end of our week. The resort itself was nice but there were lots of cigarette butts and plastic cups at the pool and it seemed nobody picked up during the day. The beach was dirty with sea weed, plastic cups and just debris. If you walked further down past the resort on the beach, there were piles and piles of garbage bags on the beach. I tried to take a picture when one of the locals asked me not take pictures of them and the garbage. My advice to you is RUN! Don't book this hotel. I wouldn't go back to the Dominican based on my experience this past week.I do agree with a previous review though. Santiago is AWESOME!!!!

<Content>Ocean Bavaro true to trip advisor feedback We stayed at Ocean Bavaro from Feb. 10 to Feb. 17, 2006 and found many Trip Advisor comments to be true. I have never encountered such an inept front desk staff anywhere. One person was working (slowly) and other staff wandered in and out but mostly made no attempt to help despite guests pleas for help. Additionally, there was a long line of guests wanting to change rooms. Many angry. Not a good sign, but I was forwarned and ready. Interesting experience when it was finally my turn to check in. The one working staff member began processing us, then began helping someone else and left us and another couple standing for over 15 minutes. Finally we got a wandering staff member's attention and she grudgingly looked into the status of our check-in. Told us rooms were not ready, feel free to start using the hotel amenities, put on our bracelets. We moved to the bar area and waited...for an hour. Finally I went to check and one room was ready. Now close to 1.5 hours after arrival, we were brought to a moldy, musty, dark room on the ground level. My allergies kicked in immediately and we went back to the front desk asking for a different room where we could at least open a window. Told to come back tomorrow. I said no, I cannot sleep in this room even one night. Come back in 1.5 hours and we'll see. Finally about 4 hours after arrival we had a room in block 5 that was much better.It's too bad the front desk is so inefficient and starts guests off with a bad first impression because otherwise this is a nice resort. Grounds are beautiful, beach and pool were well-kept, restaurants except for Mexican were good. Housekeeping and service was great (we tipped, which always helps). We would go back despite the poor reception. Also learned, allow plenty of time for check out, as the process is the same!We speak English, not Spanish, which caused some language barriers, but I consider that our own shortcoming--we were in their country. There was usually a staff person somewhere around that could help with communication. No real problems. My only complaint was the time-share lechers that were everywhere and were persistent all week long. Finally one day, we went to the 1 hr. presentation at Ocean Blue (not impressed). We were able to end the presentation at 1 hr., but it took another 1/2+ hr. to get the promised incentives. Salesmen claimed to have no idea what promoters were offering and didn't have a bottle of rum as promised. Instead we got a bottle of wood chips called mamajuana (which by the way will not make it through customs). The certificate for (2) 1/2 hour massages were not as claimed either. We were told the certificate could be used at any Ocean or Princess property. Went to use it at Ocean Bavaro and after 45 mins of phone calls and confusion, couldn't use it there. Told to go to Princess. Went there. Another 1/2 hour of confusion, couldn't use it there. Certificate was filled out in a way that made no sense to spa receptionists. Went back to Ocean Blue and finally could use it there (luckily--they grudgingly fit the appointment in) but only for 1 person and a 25 minute massage. It took from 10 am to 4:30 pm for all this. I needed a massage after all the stress. Definitely not worth it! Do what I didn't do--use common sense and don't go! The whole ordeal left me feeling that these people were only schemers and opportunists. The very people who coerced us into it, claimed ignorance when we enlisted their help. We found many that suddenly didn't understand English.We didn't do any other tours. Enjoyed the property and lots of nice people. Evening music in the courtyard was nice. Shows were mediocre, but ok. When we were there, I'd estimate 90% European and 10% US and Canadian. Be ready for lots of topless bathers, language barriers, but nice people. I'm rating the resort average, but the property would be higher without the front desk ineptness. Go, but have patience.

<Content>good with the bad My husband and I arrived home Sunday evening.The weather was beautiful, beach and food excellent.Outside staff enjoyable. Now, let me tell you thebad side. Check-in time was 45 minutes to 1 hour. Drinks at the bar. First room smell musty and toilet was leaking water around the floor. Second room better with balcony.Stole my mastercard, $20.00, Nike jacket and my uggboots ( $160.00) from my room. I would not trust the cleaning staff at all... Do not take anything of value. I highly recommend to use the safe in the room. Probably will not be reinbursed for any of my merchandise, but I am certainly going to express disappointment in their staff. I feel this resort should know what type of people they employ. This is unexceptable in a All-Inculsive resort.I hope this is helpful in making your vacation schedule.Sincerely, Nanci S.

<Content>Our trip to Ocean Bavaro Beach and Spa Resort My husband and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort from Jan 30 to Feb 6, 2006. Upon arriving around 10:30 pm our immediate reaction was What a beautiful hotel - lobby was very impressive with a band playing in the background and lots of excitement and being greeted with a mixed drink when we were checking in. We were escorted to our room in block 2 on a golf cart. All employees very friendly. Did not like the room at all. Do not take any rooms in this block. The smell was atrocious - if you have any allergies at all you will be bothered with breathing problems. I slept on the balcony for 2 nites - when we complained there was only one room available in Block 99 which was worst than this room and further away from everything and very noisy. We had no choice to stay where we were and we just tried to avoid being in our room. My husband slept in the room and he was okay.....Room also had no water at some points but found out later that other people experienced the same problems in different blocks....I am sure they controlled the water usage. The furniture in the room was very old and also smelled. Front door didn't close properly and entrance to room overlooked a garbage/construction pit. Fridge was covered in rust on the outside - inside okay. Certainly didn't resemble the photos in the Vacation magazines. Brian at the front desk showed us a room in Block 6 and he told us we could have one like that the next day - to come in the afternoon. We were also lucky that we ran into his Manager and he discussed with him our predictament and he agreed to let us upgrade for 1/2 their price. So we settled for room #1 for another night. It seemed once we spoke upgrades and that we were willing to pay more - we had no problems. I knew from the reviews that I read before we left home that Block 5 and 6 were better and I had requested that. Next day went to front desk and they told us we were being moved to block 5 not 6 and it would cost us 15.00 each a nite instead of 30.00 each and we were upgraded to one of the honeymoon suites on the second floor right by the Ocean. Now this was more like it.....the view was spectacular. Room had no smell but air conditioning running a little warm instead of cool but we managed. The room was beautiful - canopy kingsize bed with jacuzzi tub overlooking ocean. Room wasn't as big as the one in Block 6 but had a nicer view.The ocean was a beautiful turquoise colour but a lot of seaweed floating and on the sand. Walking along the beach was great to see the vendors - once you get down far enough they come and ask you to come and see their merchandise. Get use to them saying cheapey, cheapey.....if that bothers you, you won't like it. The tour guide tells you to bargain with them, never giving them the amount they are asking - go 2/3 less. Jewelry is amber or laramar stones some are nicer than others. The resort also had vendors come twice when we were there. They had tables outside the buffet area and found the quality a little better.Food not as good as in Mexico. Variety but if you are a beef eater like my husband you will be limited. Beef was not that great. Chicken and fish okay. Lunch at the beach restaurant - okay and if you like thin crust pizzas with tuna or hot dogs as your toppings okay. We only tried the Italian restaurant omitting the Mexican and Spanish but heard depending when you went that they were okay. Also had a bar-be-que outside the beach restaurant one day.Pools - swim up bar great. Bartenders very good. Will really mix those drinks very strong....some went down easier than others and watch Santiago he likes to throw a bucket of ice on you when you are not looking. Pool can be a little cleaner for my liking.A lot of debris at bottom and bugs and sand from beach.The grounds were impeccable, very well manicured. Very beautiful!Met a lot of people - mostly from Southwestern Ontario. Had good times with them.Did not encounter any mosquitoes even while sleeping on the balcony all nite. I did take my malaria pills since you have to take them one week before you leave then for 5 weeks after but only once a week. Brought deet with me but didn't use it.All in all I would say the resort was rated okay with the exception of the room situation. If we were given the upgraded room first and not seen the other room, there would be hardly any complaints. But remember there were other complaints from others. I would go back to Punta Cana but would definitely try another resort.

<Content>Worth your time for the money I Just got back from the Ocean Bavaro Feb 12/2006...I must say the first room I stayed in was not to my standards, we had to pay $20 US/person to upgrade into a better room closer and on the beach STAY AWAY FROM BLOCK#2. Anyway from that point the staff were very kind and helpful. You will very much enjoy the grounds b/c they are kept very clean...If you are considering a trip outside of the resort, visit Catalina Island for the BEST snorkling. If you never snorkeld before you must practise within your resort the day before...I recommend NOT to book any activites with the company on the beach...deal with the hotels/representatives only we almost got ripped off. The food is average, but very enjoyable if you take advantage of the resturants (which you must book in advanced there)..other then that you'll meet happy staff, a lot of Europeons, and very clean rooms.

<Content>Lots of problems . . . There are better places to stay Stayed here for two nights in February. The problems began from the moment we arrived. Check-in took 45 minutes. Once we got to the room, the chain lock was broken, the sliding patio door wouldn't shut, the TV remote was broken, and there were many other minor things.The water was off several times during our two day stay, at all times of the day and night.The service in the restaurants was terrible. At some meals we weren't even offered water.The food was average and the beach was average.The positives: the pools were nice and they had plenty of lounge chairs to go around. The landscaping was nice and well-maintained.In summary, I have stayed elsewhere in Punta Cana. The Ocean Bavaro was definitely sub-par. Take your money elsewhere.

<Content>Great time at Ocean Bavaro I just returned from Punta Cana yesterday and can't say enough about the Ocean Bavaro resort. For the price we paid, it exceeded our expectations. The rooms were of standard quality (much like you'd get at a Holiday Inn in the States), but we didn't go to beach for the rooms. The best parts of the vacation for me were the beach (absolutely gorgeous, crystal-clear blue water) and the Dominicans who worked at the hotel. I've never had better service in my life. They were full of laughter and made the trip a wonderful experience.

<Content>Fantastic Time at the Ocean Bavaro We just got back from an absolutey fantastic 6 nights at Ocean Bavaro. I do not understand the negative reviews that had us very worried. If you need an American 5-star hotel, then stay home or pay three times as much. We loved the mix of languages and cultures. It was like a beach vacation and a trip to Europe combined. There were very few Americans, but a significant number of Canadians so there was English spoken in addition to Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Dutch. We got lucky and got a good room first time around in Building 96. The room was freshly painted and similar in quality to an older Holiday Inn. Building 96 is as far from the beach as you can get, but this was not a problem. It is a short 5 minute walk through the beautiful grounds to the pool or beach. We enjoyed finding our way through the maze of trails with new picture opportunities at every turn. I kept taking pictures of the beautiful flamingos and cranes in the lake. The grounds are immaculate. Every morning, every stray leaf and twig is swept up. We also did not get a single mosquito bite and saw only a few flies. Beach: The beach is awesome. The powdery white sand makes the water a ittle too milky for snorkeling, but it could not be better for everything else. Pools: We loved the main pool with its palm shaded nooks and islands. We made good use of the swim-up bar. All the bars were well staffed with no more than a 0 to 5 minute wait. The pool was comfortably warm because it is sheltered from the wind. In some other hotels cold water is a problem. Food: The food in the buffet was quite acceptable. It ranged from average to excellent. There was much variety, so you could only eat the things you liked. The beach grill was a favorite for lunch. On different days, they had grilled lamb, pork, beef, or fish, as well as the usual buffet. We went to all of the ala carte restaurants, but found them generally no better than the buffet. We ate everything including the salads and the fish, and the goat, and did not get sick or hear of anyone else getting sick. We also liked the almost 24-hour pizzzeria. Staff: We found the staff to be friendly and helpful in every way. They sometimes know little English, but, hey, I don't know any Spanish. I did, however, learn enough to order my pina coladas and Bahama mamas con mucho ron. Summary: We loved it and would absolutely go back.

<Content>Only Stayed 3 hours We booked our trip through Travelocity and rented a car, so we didn't have the magic voucher that allows the gatekeeper to let you through - so we encountered a few problems at the front gate to the property.....then same problem at check in. We should have figured something was up when two guests in line ahead of us seemed very unhappy and were waiting for different rooms....anyway we finally checked in and were taken to our room - THAT HAD NO DOOR KNOB! The bellman was great and went back to get us another room while we stood around looking at the paint spilled all over the plants from when they painted the building last. The bellman returned and let us into our new room - again he was very nice and seemed almost ashamed at the ineptitude of the front desk....so our room....it took us about 5 minutes to realize something was wrong - there was only one lamp with a flickering bulb. (And the bathroom door did not close and the bathroom mirror was cracked - but not nearly as important)One lamp to light the whole room doesn't seem like biggest deal in the world except that it was raining and we had no where to go. Anyway - to the good part - I called the front desk to ask for another room - they transferred me to the manager - who said they would call me back in 5 minutes - three hours later no call. (I tried calling back but no one answered the phone.)So I called Travelocity and they got us a new hotel.Maybe it's a great hotel in disguise - but we certainly will never know.

<Content>Fun Time @ Ocean Bavaro Spa  My husband  I went down with another couple  had a great time. We are from Pittsburgh  wanted to get away from all the cold! The entertainment group kept things going all week long. We had a very nice room in block 6 room # 6109 - ocean view  w/a jacuzzi tub. There was a fruit tray the 1st night of arrival  then every night afterwards they brought in a cookie tray to our rooms. Our room was clean. The food was good - not the best but good. Did the tour - snokeling with the sharks - the sharks all just stayed at the bottom of the ocean, they did not move very much - but the tour guides made it a lot of fun. Overall, I would go back to this resort - Have a great trip - Go Steelers!!

<Content>fabulous vacation I went to the Ocean Bavaro from January 8 to the 15-06. We were two girls, we had a great time. The animation was fantastic there was always something to do. The food was great and I am a very picky. The a la carte restaurants were very good my favorite ones were the Spanish and Brezilien. The staff were very kind always with a smile on there face and always willing to help. The only complaint about this resort was the rooms. I was in block 95 and our room smelled like humidity the room was like a motel room. Just horrible but everything else was great. If I had to chose to go back to that hotel I would but stay in a different block I heard 7 was clean. Enjoy and remember this hotel is NOT a 5 star don't expect to much. By the way the BEACH is BEAUTIFUL. If you have to take an excursion go to SAONA island you will be amazed.

<Content>Lovely memorable holiday but with some minor problems ...... Had a wonderful time but with some minor problems.Grounds: Beautiful garden, well maintained, nice poolRoom: Do avoid Block 93. We had a room on the first night which smelt of stale cigarettes,damp and the ceiling was covered with white mould. Apparently this is quite common complaint and it does happen in other resorts too. But problem was solved the next day. Although reception is abit surly but if you smile and ask nicely, problem solved. Asked to see other rooms and moved to block 4, room was much better with a good view. Food: Fresh and good food. Good variety,main buffet restaurant and several restaurants which you must booked early as they are v.popular. Do try their freshly made banana shakes for breakfast, best in the world !! Lunch at the beach restaurant - good grill fish and meat and delicous buffet. Pool Bar: Santiago, cheerful entertaining bar tender served good v.strong caiprhinia, coco loco and sex in the beach etc. Beach: Breath taking beautiful with lovely white sand.Service: A bit chaotic in the morning for breakfast - have to ask several times for hot water for tea but otherwise friendly and efficient. Do tip cleaning lady, a tip goes a long way. Reception hit or miss, can be a bit moody sometimes considering the amount of demanding guests they get. So I don't blame them even though thats their job. Entertainment: Apart from the nightly shows that start from 10-11pm, there isn't much to do. But have discovered the HURACAN cafe plays good chill out music.(Turn right, 5 mins walk) and the MANGU disco ($8 cab ride) was lively and go upstairs where they play music like back home if you've had enough of local music.Complaint: Lumpy pillows, bring your own. Word of caution: Avoid the gift shop. I paid nearly 拢5 for a pack of 8 tampons. Bring your own crips,nuts to munch on with your beer in the evenings. Suncream, immodium (just in case), insect reppelent prices are outrages. Not only outrages, deliberately do not put price tag on some of the items. Trip to the doctor is also jaw dropping expensive. Do get travel insurance. Make sure you bring US Dollars in small denomination and not travellers cheques. They make it difficult to change money to small notes.If you're travelling from London Gatwick, make sure the flight does not stop at Manchester.Make sure you ask for Punta Cana Airport 15 mins to resort. We landed in La Romana airport which was 2 hours drive, a pain, we could've spent our last day on the beach for 2 hours. In Paradise every minute counts !!!We've been to Thailand, Bali, Salvador-Brazil and overall this is one of the best vacation we've had, considering the price, all inclusive package, lovely beach and good food. Give it 9/10. If this is your first trip to Dominican Rep, we would higly recommend Ocean Bavaro. However we will be trying other resorts as there are so many other beautiful ones. Aaaah so many beautiful places, so little time. You'll be spoilt and other places in the Caribbean would not be the same.

<Content>Very enjoyable 2-weeks Just return from two wonderful weeks at Ocean Bavaro Resort  Spa 鈥?Dec 24 till Jan 7. My husband, myself and our two boys ages 25  27. We had a great experience that I would like to share with you the reader. Once you have finished reading this review if you have any questions fell free to email me at mjdrury@vianet.caArrivalWe arrived at the Punta Cana Airport at approximately 9:30 pm their time and did have quite a wait to get through customs as they only had two people working but we chalked that experience up to it being Christmas Eve and like everyone else they wanted to be home with their families too. There was some confusion about the tourist card, the one most people had was the old tourist card, they now have one with a bar code on it. So when you arrived you had to fill out another tourist card info sheet and then exchange both (your old and the new one you just filled out) for the one with the bar code on it. There was no extra cost for this. Some people did have the new cards from their tour companies. Remember to retain the other half for departure along with your US $20.Reception  RoomsAfter a short 25-minute air-conditioned bus ride, we were at the resort. Check in went smooth and we were happy to see that we were in the same building on the same floor, which was block 5, right at the beach. We did ask to exchange our son鈥檚 room after we had been in it 鈥?nothing wrong with the room but it was a key lock and not a card lock and they only had one key, which unfortunately created some confusion the very first evening 鈥?one kid trying to find the other to get into the room. As other reviews have stated they asked us to come back the next day after 3 pm and they would see what they could do. The next morning I asked the maid who on our floor had departed that day or was there an empty room and she showed us the room directly beside us, then she proceeded to call the front desk for us and have the rooms switched. I do not speak Spanish and she did not speak English but we both got through it with patience and several thank you's. Both rooms were clean  in fine working order, nothing to complain about, air conditioner worked great (a little to cold in the kids room 鈥?thermostat was off). Fridge filled with pop  water when needed. Clean towels everyday and we actually got a washcloth daily, bed linen changed every second day. We rented the safely deposit box for $20 US per week along with a @$20 deposit, remember to keep your safety deposit box receipt to get your $20 back because if you don鈥檛 have it you will not get it back.Pools, grounds  beach We found the all very acceptable; everything was cleaned daily 鈥?each morning. The seaweed that I read about so much in other reviews was really nothing at all to complain about as it is more like sea grass and there was always some floating in the water.We kept our beach towel for at least two days but when we did exchange them we turned them in by 6 pm (as they had asked) and went the next morning around 9 am and got new ones. It was only later in the day that no clean ones could be found.BarsSeveral to be found 鈥?beach, lobby, pools  swim up. Never had to wait more then 4/5 minutes but most of the time just 2 or 3. All drinks were good and they will make you whatever combination you want.RestaurantsMain buffet (Palmasol)鈥?good selections for all mealsThis was the only place to have breakfast but they also served lunch and dinner. No dress code but you must have on shoes and a top of some sortPizzeria 鈥?by small pool near beachServed pizza, burgers  hotdogsSays it is open 24 hours but actually closes after the disco crowd is finished Mexican (Pepito鈥檚) in front of lobby to the leftWent once and enjoyed our meal very muchGood appetizer鈥檚, drinks  dessertsGood food selection that you choose from a menuBrazilian (Bahia) 鈥?by small pool near beachWe did not enjoy this restaurant as much as any of the others. Both times we went they seemed in a hurry to feed you and get you out. Several times during our meal they actually forgot to bring us some food.This is the restaurant that you go up and get the appetizers and they bring around skewers of meat to your table. You each get one small piece of each kind of meat and they never came and asked if we wanted more.Dessert selection very limited hereItalian (Mezzaluna)Very much enjoy went 3 times in the two weeksGreat appetizer table, drinks  dessertsChoose your meal from the menuEl Meson (Spanish)We did enjoy our meal but can鈥檛 really say that we found it very Mexican in food or d茅corSeafood (Bucanero Grill)This was the only restaurant that you had to pay if you wanted to go. We are not seafood eaters so we never went.All the specialty restaurants require that men wear closed toes shoes, long pants and collared shirts. However, we did see many, many people going in with shorts, t-shirts and sandals.Excursions 鈥?all in US $$* Outback Safari $80 鈥?best tour we were on, well worth the $$. A full day in the back of a jeep with several very interesting stops. Drinks (all day) and lunch provided. Our tour guide was very professional, knowledgeable  helpful (as was the driver). We found their jeeps in excellent repair and they even had seat belts.*Saona Island $85 鈥?not one of the most interesting tours we did, no snorkeling on this tour, just a speed boat ride to the Island with a short stop to look at the star fish, lunch on the island then a catamaran back to the bus, which is two hour ride away from the hotel. We did get to see some dolphins that started swimming around the boats and showing off for us, it was the best part of the tour for us but as our guide said this rarely happens.*Santo Domingo $58 鈥?only our son went and while he did enjoy himself he found they never stayed long enough in one place to actually see the whole thing or the time to take it all in. He was disappointed they never went to the big market (as the tour stated) but to a store instead for shopping. Lunch was provided, but drinks and snacks you had to purchase on your own.*Caribbean Festival $72 鈥?enjoyed a big boat ride out to snorkel, fresh fruit and pop served along the way. After snorkeling, they took us out to the pens to swim with the sharks and stingrays, which I can鈥檛 believe I did. They then served more food and rum based drinks. Was an enjoyable 4 hours and we were very entertained by all staff on board.*Helicopter Tour 鈥?the 4 of us went for a 30-minute ride through the countryside, along the shoreline, then in front of the resorts. This was the very cool ride. Cost was around $130 per person but you can go for a shorter ride for less money*Horse back riding 鈥?2 hours for $55. While the tour itself was OK, we actually did not see or go anywhere that was spectacular. We rode along the road and had to contend with minor traffic and people walking, then to a small beach, then back to the ranch via the road. Word of caution when they stop at a small roadside open bar they ask who wants a beer or water, they hand it out then after you have drank some of it they charge you.*Coco Aventura $15 -this activity is right between the Ocean Bavaro and Carabela Hotels. Ropes brides, pulls, tight ropes that sort of thing. Was well worth the $$ and fun as well as a challenge to do.*Parasailing $49 single $45 double 鈥?booked at Ocean Bavaro Aquatic centre. Enjoyable and seemed very safe. You are actually only up in the air for 10 minutes but what a view.*Snorkeling $20 - booked at Ocean Bavaro Aquatic centre. Saw lots and lots of different fish. Take some bread with you and a couple of bananas and the fish will all come around youSpaI did go once to the spa for a massage and enjoyed it for $60. Then I found this message place in the huts right beside the resort and got several more messages for only $30 and I actually liked them better.Never used 鈥?fitness centre, kids club, baby sitters, tennis courts, laundry services or money exchangeAnimation Team 鈥?Evening EntertainmentAs with everyone else at the resort theses folks work hard and have long days. We did participate in some of the games (beach and pool) and enjoyed it all. As for the evening entertainment, I say it was 50/50, not the best I鈥檝e seen, nor it is the worst. Some night it was good enough to stay the whole hour and some night you left after 15 minutes.Tips鈥ou do not always get the wake up call you asked for so take a clock with you.鈥e purchased a phone card and made 6 calls and were only charged $3 US when it should have been at least $12鈥ever had to save a beach chair early in the morning there were always some available鈥heck out went smooth but since we had a late evening flight, we asked for a courtesy room to shower in at 5:30 pm we were given a room key and guess what it was someone鈥檚 actual room. So word of caution never leave anything out you don鈥檛 want someone else to see.I am hoping this review helps you as much as reading the other reviews helped me.

<Content>Better than expected We are just back from a two week break in the Ocean Bavaro. We stayed at the five star Ocean Blue in April and were encouraged to return to Punta Cana for Christmas and New Year.Overall we had a great time and the weather was terrific. We had a Deluxe Suite which was great but the downside was it was beside the Theatre so no chance of sleeping before 11:30pm.They put on very good nights on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.We found most of the staff to be very helpful and nearly all had great English. Even though the hotel was full, there was plenty of room and an abundance of sunbeds by the pools or sea.You do end up overdosing on the buffet after a while and we found the Italian and Spanish a la carte restaurants very good. As a wine buff, there is a good choice of reasonably priced wines in addition to the free house wines in these restaurants. The only irritants we found was that there were never enough pool towels at the hut and we had to reuse ours for days. I recommend bringing your own along also. The noise from the night time entertainments does permeate through the complex so be warned.The animation crew are very good and there is a huge team that got many people involved.We did notice several differences between this four star and the five star Ocean Blue but felt that we got very good value for money given it was expensive to get to from Ireland. We were advised by a few reps that this is one of the better four star hotels in the resort.Go an enjoy - I wish I was back there now !All in all a great holiday in Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>be aware Spent a week over New Year at this hotel. Group of 25 people (11 rooms). Bedrooms: We were first sent to block 99 - absolutely terrible. Rooms were large, but some stank of damp, others had water permanently on the floors, the bathrooms were antiquated and dirty (for the Brits amongst you all, think Butlins 1970). The next day we managed to get changed to block 7. Better, in that the bathrooms are cleaner and the bedrooms, although smaller, have had a recent coat of paint. Take a torch with you though, as there is only one very low wattage bedside light, no ceiling or wall lights at all. Very basic in all aspects - 2 small towels per room, shampoo and soap bottles were filled up by the maids from a large bottle on their trolley, not replenished daily! The marble slab fell from the sink in one of the bathrooms, narrowly missing someone's feet, and crashed into bits on the floor! Conclusion, rooms are bad. Blocks 98 and 99 are in the Veraclub area - some sort of Italian area - they have their own restaurant, theatre, shows etc.Food: We only ate at the buffet restaurant, which we all thought more than average - breakfast was the best - although rather repetitive after 7 days.Staff: On the whole, very friendly although the reception staff need to do a bit better. You feel that you should be giving them tips all the time - we didn't until the last day - but, on the whole, nice people (although completely inefficient!). The animation staff were very good indeed and the younger members of our party had wonderful times with them.The Resort: Public areas are lovely, beach is very nice, although you have to pick up your beach towel by 8 am, otherwise they run out (take care of them; a USD 15 charge is made if you lose your towel, and so they tend to disappear from the beach at times).Conclusion: We all had a wonderful time, due mainly to the fact that we were a large group and would have enjoyed ourselves anyway. The first 2 days were stressful having to hang around the reception, pack, unpack, pack, unpack etc. which is totally ridiculous. It seems from all the reviews I've read that this is happening to 90% of all guests - why?Will return to Punta Cana, but not this hotel - it really is too basic.

<Content>Loved the resort I was at the Ocean Blue golf and beach resort with my sister-in-law in Sept. We loved it...I think most Americans make to big a deal with the language..The staff was very cordial and if they didn't understand you they would find someone who did. We had no problems. The food and drinks were great. Vacations are what you make them, and if you had a problem with this resort....it was your own fault and you must be to hard to please. Stay in the states.

<Content>Good Time; With Some Problems Stayed two weeks. Check in very efficient. Arrived at 10:00 pm and we were in our room within 5 minutes and luggage arrived 5 minutes later. However our room developed a leak from the bathroom ceiling overnight. We were moved to a new room within a couple hours of advising the front desk. Room was clean, with a bar fridge stocked with Pepsi, 7 Up and water (no beer), air conditioner worked great.We stayed in the Ocean Cana side of the resort (Ocean Bavaro and Ocean Cana share all facilities). We were in Block 99, which is next to the outdoor Veraclub stage. The Veraclub is for Italian guests and they put on a very loud show each night from 10:00 to approx. 11:15. If you plan to be in your room prior to 11:15 all rooms in Block 99, 98 and 7 are very noisy during show times. Also, our room only had hot/warm water 3 of the 14 days of our stay. Seemed to be a very common problem throughout the resort during our stay. The trick we learned from other guests was to leave the hot water run at least 15 minutes and then you may get some hot water.Despite the above problems still enjoyed our stay. Resort grounds are nicely landscaped and kept spotless. Maid service was excellent, restuarant and bar staff service was good. Food, for an AI, was average to good (compared to the 5 other AI resorts we have stayed at). Plenty of loungers at the pools and beach with choice of sun or shade (never had to play the towel game). Great massages in the huts near the beach ($30.00 US for one hour). No beach vendors unless you go off the resort. Were a few time share salesmen, but did not bother us.Overall, an average 3.5/4 star resort. As long as you do not expect 5 star excellence/perfection you will enjoy a holiday at this resort.

<Content>Good first trip out of the country the ocean bavaro was i would say a 3 star resort. staff is friendly but hard to understand if you don't speak Spanish. Don't expect to be waited on promptly though and sometimes you have to ask more than twice for stuff but be patient. The food was good but I thought the breakfast buffet was below average. They had the same thing everyday. One day my omelet wasn't cooked very well. I went to a breakfast buffet in Hilton Head, SC that was well above average.The buffet should not be open due to flies always in your food and cold items were always warm. and guys be sure to take kakis or you will eating at the buffet all week long for dinner. Ladies too be sure to take a sundress or nice pants. make sure to get the gin fizz at the lobby bar it is very good. and the banana mamas are also very good. The brazilian was our favorite if you are on the adkins diet you will be in heaven. and the appetizers at the Italian restaurant were very good. We had great weather all week only rained 10 minutes one day. Checkin was hell we got there early and had to wait in the 100 degrees lobby for 3 hours in that time we could have got to go to the beach but we couldnt leave our luggage and go. Make sure to take bug repelent spray and don't use perfume, cologne, or scented lotions you will be bit from head to toe. Europeans need to be taught manners they cut in front of you everywhere don't know how to say excuse me. Entertainment was very good I don't know how they dance in that heat and humidity every night. we met 4 couples down there that spoke English and still keep in touch that was nice not to be alone all week long. the disco tech was fun too. We were picked to be in a dance contest. Santiago made our long islands really good and strong at the pool bar! If you are shy and timid Do not go to any shows because they will pull you up on stage or dance with you. Our room was nice very well air conditioned towels were always an issue though only 1 wash cloth for 2 people. towels and chairs on the beach were plentiful. The pools were nice but not cold enough to get relief from the heat. The ocean is breathtaking and be sure to ride the crazy banana boat ride. I wimped out though couldn't take the taste of saltwater anymore hold on tight! because you'll get wiped out I did't enjoy bartering on the beach I like to go to a shop and just buy instead of dealing. The lunch buffet beside the small pool is very good they had good pasta dishes and good salad and ladies the male staff treat and look at you like you are a princess had a great time but I would never return to this country there's just too much else out there to go. It is definitely nice for a first time trip out of the country though. Punta cana is very well worth your money though it only cost us $1600 for both of us including flight. The flight to and from was great the staff are friendly but the food stinks it you like frozen dinners though you shouldn't have a problem. Make sure to take lots of sunscreen. If you are fair skinned I would suggest a chair in the shade. we came home with beautiful native tans that everyone was jealous of. One other note of advice, if you see a photographer with exotic animals do not take pictures with your own camera we got the dirtiest look when we did that. overall though this trip was a great first tropical getaway. Take lots of pictures!

<Content>can't understand the bad reviews There are good and bad reviews on tripadvisor about this hotel, but the bad ones are not the hotel we enjoyed last week (Nov 11 -18, 2005).Unless they have done a lot of renovating recently this is not the hotel depicted in the bad reviews. It was clean, the service was excellent and there was plenty of variety of food in all the restaurants. Our room was clean,and comfortable with fresh flowers on our bed every day, cold pop and bottled water in our fridge every day no bugs. The evening shows are mediocre but it gave us a nice evening out. I would highly recommend this location, we stayed in block 5. Beautiful surroudings with an ocean view and pool view. Lots of games on the beach all day and plenty of beautiful beach for long walks. Yes there was seaweed in the water but it was not bad and it was the floating kind, not underwater so you don't have to walk in it.There was plenty of lounge chairs poolside and on the beach. Always people walking around cleaning and working. Every day they came around with trays of the drink of the day and in the afternoon served trays of fresh fruit to your lounge chair.We have travelled many times and we rate this place as one of the nicest. No problem with language that couldn't be overcome and lots of little extras that were a pleasant surprise, eg self serve, soft, ice cream machine at the beach bar and many other little touches that made this a great holiday.

<Content>Nice resort, Nice people, good holiday resort We went to the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach resort 7 -14 November 2005. We found the accomodation to be satisfactory and pleasant enough but the normal rooms were let down by the lack of tea/coffee making facilities. Upgrade at the resort if you can - we were advised its a lot cheaper to do that when you are there. The buffet restaurants are good with a large variety of food and the breads and rolls are great. The staff there are all very helpful and friendly. The Italian restaurant and the Brazilian are very good. But watch out if you are going soon - there is major refurbishment/ construction underway in the Ocean Bavaro Check in and this means that there is banging, sawing and general construction noise whilst at the Palmasol buffet. Ferro's Disco,and the Amigo Lobby Bar are closed as they are in the same area. The Mexican restaurant has been relocated near the Punta Cana Pool. We found the Punta Cana pool to be the best and quietest in the resort, there was always a parasol and lots of loungers and the bar and snack bar by the side of the pool was excellent. We cannot fault the staff or the food or the resort - really it was very nice but we are annoyed with the travel agency for not letting us know about the extensive remodelling being done on site - especially as we had visisted this site and seen notices about the main reception being refurblshed- we queried this but we were told by our travel agency that this was grade 3 ie minor work and were not told about the other bits closed. Also watch out if you are travelling from Gatwick as some flights go via Manchester and this adds at least another 2 hours on to an already long flight and transfer to the resort. Would we go back there - Yes once everything is reopened and without the flight via Manchester. Go and enjoy it but check that the building work is finished before you go to really appreciate how good the resort can be. ps the gardens and lakes were beautiful and the beach is lovely. Tip the maids and have a lovely time. Big Warning finally - you will be approached by a load of guys with Royal Hotels on their t-shirts. They are selling timeshares for the Royal resorts and once you get to the Ocean Blue resort which is a new hotel in the chain in Bavaro you will get very hard sell to buy one of these timeshares. Yes the Ocean Blue is a fantastic hotel but if you don't want to spend over 2 hours saying no then don't go. They will hang round the buffet anc try to entice you with offers of gifts, t-shirts and breakfast or lunch. Avoid them.

<Content>nice resort We have just returned from the Ocean Bavaro and we had a wonderful trip. There are always small problems at any resort however we found the staff wonderful at solving them. They could not do enough to help you out. Our first room was in need of renovations and after talking to the front desk we were quickly moved to a more suitable room. The resort is being renovated but we did not find this a problem -when they are done it will be beautiful.The buffet staff worked long hard hours to make your stay pleasant. If you were polite and friendly towards them -they worked harder.People that forgot their manners deserved to be ignored.The resort is clean and well maintained. The beach is clean(except for seaweed which is an ocean issue not a resort problem) The animation team provided many hours of entertainment -something for everyone.The al a carte restaurants were nothing special but the food was good (as it was in all the restaurants)and the atmosphere different - we had no problem booking them.This is smaller resort than many on the Bavaro beach but it has heart and it makes for a wonderful vacation.If you have expectations of a Canadian hotel you will be disappointed but if you realize you are in a different culture and enjoy as you go you will have an exceptational holiday.

<Content>nice resort but wouldn't recommend I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro last July and I had an okay time. I went with my best friend who is also female. The airport in Punta Cana is samll but is so beautiful. When we went out to the transportation to the hotels there was some confusion as to which one went to the Ocean Bavaro. When we finally got to the hotel check in was very easy. We were taken to our room which was nice. In every review I had read most of the people recieved an upgrade to their room. I don't know if they just thought that because we were American they could just let it pass. When we got to our room it was nice. There was a plate of fruit and cookies on the desk {which would of been great because we were starving} but it was covered in bugs. We had to put it in the hallway. As were all the flowers that were put on your bed every night. Flowers are nice but not when they are in your bed crawling with bugs. We had gotten there pretty late but were still hoping to get something to eat. Forget it. If you are still hungry after 10pm. you are out of luck. If you are allergic to nuts DO NOT go to this resort. I am and let me tell you the use almonds in everything. We went to the Italian restaurant one night and we asked for just pasta with butter and they even put almonds on that. Neddless to say I lost alot of weight on my vacation. Thank God for the Pringles in the gift shop. The Staff at the hotel are very nice.At least the guys were. If you are a young girl the guys will love you. The women working at the hotel are not nice to you at all especially if you are a girl. The drinks are watered down but potent enough to get you drunk at 3 in the afternoon. Which I don't suggest. This resort is European and they do not really like Americans there. If you don't speak Spanish good luck. They out on shows every night but the only bad part about them is that they are mainly in Spanish or French. Even though you can't undestand what they are saying it is still funny. The spa is wonderful. We each got a massage. It was the best part of the vacation. The beach is gorgous and the water is a beautiful blue, but a little seaweedy. Overall this resort was nice but I would not stay there again. Mostly because of the nut allergy thing.

<Content>The Service was good the first day We arrived at the hotel, and per the reviews we upgraded to the Junior suite, they first quoted us 55$ per person per night, I told the guy a friend of mine upgraded and told me it was 20$, so the guy automattically agreed and we got the upgrade to a junior suite in block 6. The room was great big, the next day they wanted to move us to a nicer suite over looking the beach, we moved, there was a queen size bed, but the door would not lock and there was werid dump smell comming from the bed, i dont think they change the top bed cover. So we decided to stay in the previous suite which was on the ground floor and didnt face the beach.Warning take moskito repelents, i took 1 fogo thingy for the plug but it didt do much, i bought some there but they were crap, i had about 4 different moskito replers, all the doors closed and the air/con on all the time, and still we got bite's !!!! the last day they had guys fumigating all the hotel. The spa looks good, there are also other massage places but i reccomend the Spa one, its 100 times more relaxing, that the thing beside the pool. Also ask if the visa machine works before you get anything done, as it was broken all the time, i think its because they want payments in cash, prob they keep some, as they ALWAYS trick you with the rate.the bar was ok, not much queues, but the coctails were never properly done, they were served wattery and everyone was leaving them or binning them.Matanai Park is a bit crap, if you do there i reccomend you swim with the dolphins as that the only good thing it has, the dolphin and seal lion show.I will never go again, oh the staff pester you a lot trying to convinse you to buy tours and spa deals etc... good luck

<Content>Each Experience is Unique - United States We just returned last night from Punta Cana. I had a wonderful time and enjoyed the Ocean Bavaro Resort. I had read several reviews prior to our departure and wasn't sure what to expect. We stayed in a Caribbean Spa Suite in Block 6. It was nice. There were some issues with water pressure and at times we didn't have hot water. I was able to laugh it off, but my husband was upset. That would be the only complaint about the room.The food at the resort is ok. I am vegetarian, but was always able to find something to eat. We mostly ate at the buffet, but did eat at the Spanish restaurant our last night at the resort. The Spanish restaurant was very good.Do not take traveler's checks to Ocean Bavaro. They aren't able to cash them out. We had to walk about 10-15 minutes down the beach to cash them. They charged a $5 service charge per $50.We went on two excursions. We went on the Outback Safari and the Marinarium. I did enjoy the Outback Safari, but was quite upset in seeing the conditions for all of the animals. The dogs and cats aren't cared for too well. I know it is a third world country, but it was difficult for me to see. The Outback Safari was a surreal experience into a life most of us Americans do not experience. The Marinarium was very fun. The snorkeling was great and it was a very fun atmoshpere. Now that all of the negative comments are out of the way, I will focus on the good things at the Ocean Bavaro. My husband and I met some great people there. There really aren't many Americans, but when you find them you become fast friends. Our group eventually expanded to include friends from Canada, France, England, Germany, and the United States. We all partied together every night and intend on keeping in touch.The only negativism we received being Americans was from SOME of the British. These individuals were quite hostile about the Iraq war and weren't friendly to us. Visit Rafael at the pool bar. He is a lot of fun!Also, trying to speak Spanish will get you a lot farther in this country. There is a significant language barrier. I have studied Spanish for four years, but I am by no means fluent. It definitely helped in our service and in relating to the staff.Please remember this is a poor country and they are trying. If you want Cancun, then go there. This island is by no means Americanized. It is truly a great experience getting to know different cultures and meeting people from around the world.Have fun!

<Content>Best Vacation I have ever had! Anthony's Da Man I just returned from the Ocean Bavaro today after spending four of the most relaxing days EVER!! I have been to several AI's and I think by far this one is the best. The whole staff, was more than willing to help. The bartenders (Manuel,Santigo, Rapheal) are very entertaining and EVERYONE loves to dance!! The entertainment (the popcorn man, Erick, Carlos, Michele) staff was the best but I will say that Anthony at the front desk can get anything taken care of that you need. He works very hard so if you're gonna be there make sure you take care of him!! Good times - cant wait to go back!!

<Content>Managed to have fun but would not go back This is an honest review of the Ocean Bavaro/Ocean Cana Resort. Taking everything into account, we managed to have a good time because it was all about our daughter. She managed to meet some friends and we managed to meet some friends. But I would not recommend this resort to others. You definitely definitely definitely do NOT get what you pay for.The Good:Great kids club - they went above and beyond. My daughter met new friends from England and Brazil and they even had a birthday cake with a cake fight for her birthday. The woman at the kids club Meyra was so kind and my daughter loved her.Resort - Beautiful grounds and pools and the beach was beautiful too.The Bad:Food - I've been away many times before and I know that the food will be different. But the food at this resort truly was horrible. Our stomachs were upset the whole time we were there. They tell you that the ice in your drinks is purified but this is not true. We also brushed our teeth with bottled water every day which should have been fine but we still got sick.Preference for Europeans - I would really suggest that if you are not European that you stay away from this resort. Dollars are quoted in Euro's and it's not a very friendly place for non-European folk. The first restaurant we saw was apparently the Italian Restaurant right beside the Ocean Cana check in. When we walked into the restaurant an Italian woman began yelling at me Italiano ONLY, Italiano ONLY. I spoke to a woman who worked there at the front of the restaurant who told me we have access to use the restaurant but it was mostly used by Italians. A lot of the people in there were staring at us and pointing (and I'm not exaggerating). We ate our meal quickly (the food was not good at all) and exited the restaurant to walk around. ***2 days later*** Let me say that the same Italian woman proceeded to bud in front of me at the reception desk when I wanted to talk to them about making an outside call (I couldn't get through). When I informed her that my daughter and I were in line there before her she proceeded to stick her finger in her chest and tell me I in line, I here. This woman was a thorn in my side.Checking in and getting our room - At 3pm we were to reception and were immediately upgraded to an Ocean Spa Suite (we paid for a Standard Room). I had previously emailed the resort to request an Ocean View room since we were going down there for my daughter's 8th birthday and this was her first time to the islands. We were excited to receive a room in the famed Block 6 but when we got there we faced a noisy construction site, there was no bedding for the day bed for my daughter, and worst of all there was no running water, the toilet didn't flush and there was no drawers or shelves to put our clothes on. I left my husband and daughter in the room and went to reception to request another room. The girl at the front desk could not speak English very well and kept going into the famous back room before returning to me 20 minutes later. She did this 3 times - each time coming back with the same room number. Finally, she came back to me with another room (2 doors down from the original). I asked for a safety deposit box and she tried to charge me $40 PLUS a $20 deposit. I quickly informed her that I was aware it was only $20 for one week and she said oh, okay. When I went to our original room to tell my husband and daughter we were moving my husband told me that staff had already brought another couple through our room to view it (and they turned it down). I was still at reception and they hadn't even sent someone in to fix the water and they were already showing others our room! When we went to our new room as soon as we opened the door there was an extremely foul musty odour and mildew all around the bathtub. The safety deposit box didn't work and there was a large leak right in front of the door. I was so upset, it was now close to 5pm and we had been there for over 4 hours and my daughter just wanted to put her swim suit on. I told my husband to take her to the pool and proceeded back to the reception area where I spent over an hour once again trying to tell the girl at the front that we needed a suitable room. They kept denying me and I finally broke down and raised my voice asking for the manager. The girl at the front went into the back room then came out and asked me to come to the back room with her. When I went in the back room there was 5 people sitting around a small desk and the manager was in front of the computer. He told me he brought me back there because he didn't want the other travellers to hear me complaining. I thought that was funny since there was a large line up of people at reception complaining themselves! He spoke to me in a condescending manner and told me they did me a favour by upgrading my room. I told him thanks but no thanks - if doing me a favour was placing me in front of a construction site with no running water, mildew, leaks and no bedding for my child than I didn't want it. He told me that I should know that a standard room didn't come with an ocean view. I then proceeded to produce an email from the resort (I emailed them 3 times before I left) which said that they would give me an oceanview room. He told me they were just trying to make me happy and I told him that lying to me didn't make me happy. I finally told him enough was enough and that I did not want to talk anymore and that I wished to have a satisfactory room immediately because this was ridiculous. He sent a rep with me to a new room. Can I tell you that this room was AMAZING to see. It was the Tropical Deluxe Suite with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a double person jacuzzi. It was more than what I paid and they obviously realized the mess up. I went and got my husband and a rep met us to pick up our bags from the old room to take us to the new room. Well, it was a beautiful room but when I went into the washroom and moved a towel 100's (again, NO exaggeration), 100's of small bugs went scurrying everywhere. I got a wet tissue and wiped them all up and put them in the toilet. These bugs continued to pop up throughout our whole trip. Again, I know I'm in a foreign country and this will happen but the room was infested. We have bites on our body EVERYWHERE. That evening, when the disco started, we realized we were placed right by the theatre where the internet centre is. The music went on til 3 in the morning. This continued for our whole trip.Vendors - They allowed people onto the resort property the WHOLE time we were there. We were constantly harrassed every time we went to eat. I know this is how they make their money but this should be kept off of the resort or restricted to one day only. H10 also has people placed in front of the buffet to ask you to go and check out their other resorts. The same man stopped us 3 times a day EVERY DAY to ask us to go see the Ocean Blue. This was very frustrating.I will be contacting my travel agent as well as Nolitours (World of Vacation) to advise them of everything that happened. I know this is just my opinion, but it's an accurate account of our experience at this resort.

<Content>the best holiday yet re the report don't go! 10 of us were at this resort at the same time as the people from Birmingham. Well I assume they were at the same place although they didn't have the same holiday as us. We too had 4 children all under 5 years old.The Staff were wonderful from reception to the maids from the waiters to the gardeners the entertainment staff for both juniors and seniors were faultless. We all commented on how friendly and polite they were to us all.Yes it rained and the roof of the main buffet leeked but the staff moved the tables so no one got wet. I do think that the hotel should arrange for it to only rain at night when we are in bed.The reception closed for refurbishment we went with first choice who notified us of every thing that was happening. It is now the low season and when you are open allyear round then these things have to be done sometime. The other people should have come to see me because I am not confessing to having a drink problem but even when the reception closed I still managed to find 4 bars.We are hoping to return next year but not in a group of 10 but in a group of 16. If you go on holiday with the intensions of enjoying your holiday then you will love the place as we all did

<Content>dont go number 2 we are brits, seasoned third world travellers. fifth time here. do not go to this place. YOU WILL BE ILL. all of our party were very ill got back yesterday 18/10./05 2 of our party still very ill with enteritis. this place is geared to spanish nationals. you will get totally ignored even if you are first to the bar (they even waited when my partner was the only person at the beach bar) and then served 6 spanish first. the restuarant was flooded every single day with people falling on the wet floor. they are all rip off merchants. the cigars are the dearest in the world if you pay their prices. in the restuarant we always had a saucer never a cup, then when we got a cup for tea we got hot water and had to wait for ever for the milk to arrive. never any spoons so resorted to using a fork handle. the staff in general were more interested in chatting up the female population than doing their job. if you want to go to the D/R go to BOCA CHICA. the people are friendly. the sea is better and you can mix with the locals. which i think that is what holidays are all about. another thing the volume coming from the evening shows was horrendous going on until 1 am every night (and me an ex roadie)it shook the patio windows. i do not see the reason for the volume still it was all run by kids so i suppose they think the louder it is the better it is. oh yeah and if you do book make sure your agent doesnt use EXCEL airlines. you have been warned.

<Content>Dont go Let me start by saying i have never listened to anyones reviews before. my mistake , this place was awfull . we had arrived with our 4 children at 8 on the evening we was told by the travel agents we would have ajouning rooms when we went to reception this was not to be . but still we managed to be in the same block , they could not understand me and therefore couldnt do nothing about it.it rained on the second day and this caused a flood through the roof of the apartment in my room right through where the electrics was. i rang reception and told them that my room was leaking water through the vents and they replied . its raining yes.the evening entertainment was a different show every night wich was good. although we are one jacket and a pair of trainers missing. this happened because when the show finishes instead of telling evryone they are closing they just turn the lights of. no warning no nothing ,so when we tried to find my daughters trainers and jacket in the pitch black it was inpossible. i went to look for them early the next morning but they was gone. so i went to reception and asked if they had been handed in . i was told they hadnt yet but they would be. we never got them back. when i went back to asked they just shrugged it of like it was my fault.the rooms was basic but tidy. we had the rooms made up everyday wich was good.after 2 days of being there they closed the main reception wich in turn closed the lobby bar and the disco so we was left 2 bars short of what we had originally wich was 5.when you went down to breakfast it was like a biulding site you could hear them hitting the walls with sledge hammers and other tools. anyway thats not all the beautiful gardens they say are there was not to be they drained the ponds in the gardens and left the fish to die on the bottom. after 3 days in the sun you can only imagine the smell and this is within 10 ft of the buffet. the flys that then decended on the buffet made it almost inpossibe to eat.i complained to reception with a lot of other people already there doing the same. i told them about the rotting fish so the next day the cleaned it up.none of us should have needed to tell them this it should have been done anyway. we was told that because of the main reception and bar being closed and the disco we could use the sister hotels facilitys, we walked into the oceans sister hotel and was told we could not eat or drink in there because we was not italian and this hotel was just for italians and employees. we went to see the rep about all of this in wich she said she would sort out my flooding . this never happened. she did however go to the manager in the sister hotel and after 6 days we was allowed to eat and drink in there. even this was afetr some negotiating with the buffet staff who had to check with reception if it was okay.the swiming pool had lights fitted round the edge under the water . 3 of these lights had come loose and was just hanging there in the water i know they would have been water proof but it just looked so bad as the pool was a good size and well kept.they only had one bar staff on most of the bars so it was hard to get served especially the beach bar who had one barman on who diidnt open up till 10.30 or though it was supposed to be 10.00 . even then he would just carry on talking to the security staff. this wasnt just to me this was universal , he did it to everyone wether you was english , spanish german or french.the food was bland with no taste and what did look okay tasted horrible. i tied to ring england but was told i needed to purchase a phone card from the mini market. i purchased the card for 8 dollars and went to reception. i was then told i would have to wait as there was only one phone for customers. the then asked me for a dollar they said this was a conection fee that everyone has got to pay , so i paid it. the dialed the number for me but my mother back home in england wasnt there so i rang my sisters house in england for this they asked me for another dollar. they said if the phone rings on the other side you pay regardless of if you talk to anyone or not.the second week the weather was bad due to bad weather in the gulf. no ones fault at all .but it didnt help that when you was eating your meal you was being rained on . the roof kleaked that bad you had to paddle through the water.this was the same in the theatre when you watched the shows. one poor french lady slipped on the wet floor and fell on her face . when we seen her the next morning she had been to the doctores she had a black eye and a cut face. not very good at all.this was the same in the blocks . they wwas clean and tidy but when it rained they became like an ice rink. my daughters all fell at different times and so did one of the maids or worked there.we have been to the dominican before with airtours and had a great time . in fact i wished we had gone back to the bahi principe. this hotel was 2 star not 4 star like they say. the only good point is the beach is perfect, paradise even.the complex was nice to look at . and the entertainers was out of this world.all of them made the evenings something to look forward to. they had so much energy and time for everyone. its a shame the rception staff didnt take a leaf out of there book.i would like to say for those of you that are thinking god what a moaner. i have been going abroad now since 1996 every year sometimes twice a year and never complained once about anywhere we have ever been .

<Content>excellent vacation!!! My family and I just returned after spending 6 days at this wonderful resort. We have 2 small children aged 3 and 4.The resort was spectacular just a perfect size not too big not too small.RoomsWe recieved a free upgrade upon arrival and stayed in block 6 in a caribbean spa suite. It was very nice a little musty smelling but all in all it was very nice. It has a marble bathroom with jacuzzi which was a surprise.FoodWe only ever ate at the buffets which had plenty of selection and of everything i tried it was pretty good (i have had better at other resorts But it was not bad food). I managed to gain 8lbs so it was good!!!!!BeachAbsolutely gorgeous. I do however have 2 complaints about the beach, the 1st being that there are no shells for collecting!!!!2nd being the dirty guest who leave cigarette butts all over the beach. I am a smoker but would never dream of doing this. I had to clean up before i let my kids dig in the sand.StaffUnbelievable!!! They make this resort! There is always something going on somewhere and the staff are so attentive. I heard complaints of language barriers but this was not an issue. I do not speak spanish except hola gracias etc.. but this was never a problem. The staff are GREAT!Weatherpretty bad!!!OverallA vacation is what you make it. We had a fantastic time!!! If you are looking for a 5 star experience do not go here there are things to complain about. Since i do not have 5 star expectations there was no point mentioning any negatives because they did not impact the quality of my wonderful wonderful vacation!!!!!

<Author>Worldtraveler777
<Content>A True 'Moderate' Resort I am a travel agent who recently stayed at the Ocean Bavaro for inspection/familiarization purposes. I have stayed in Caribbean properties ranging from budget to luxury, both before and during my time as a travel agent. I am bi-lingual in both Spanish and English. However, I planned to speak only English during my stay at this property to gauge the competence and effort of the staff to communicate with English speaking guests. I had read that some guests had problems communicating with the staff. Please understand that this property probably has only a 15-20% average occupancy by English speaking guests.My wife and I arrived late for check-in around 9:00pm because of the demise of Transmeridian Airlines(the original charter airline). Fortunately, Pace Airlines stepped in and got us down to Punta Cana, albeit 6 hours late. The check-in process was handled very smoothly. We were given a room in the fabled block 6(room 6217). We left our luggage in the lobby to be delivered to our room and headed to the main buffet. We were quite hungry since there was no food served on the flight from Orlando. Our waiter(Jose) quickly greeted us with a hearty 鈥榟ola鈥?and a short greeting in Spanish and I responded, 鈥榟ello鈥? He quickly changed to English and was easily able to communicate with us in English. I was impressed by his effort to communicate and he seemed to understand most of the things I said in English. We headed to the buffet. The layout of the buffet was average compared to other moderate all-inclusives I have been to. We were pretty hungry and they had a decent selection to choose from. The bread selection was above average and quite good in my opinion. The food itself I would rate as average. Nothing spectacular, but seemed to offer enough variety to keep most people happy. The quality of the food itself was ok (the pork chops were very under cooked, however). Also, Jose was quick to return and offer refills on our drinks and did not seem disinterested at all. Watch out for flies landing on the bread and some areas of the buffet that are not hot or cold. The buffet is open-air, so you do get a mix of insects and occasionally birds flying through the seating and food area. There are fans above the eating area, however they are so high up on the raised ceiling that they have little effect on the flies. Dinner rating: average.We headed to our room and when we arrived, our luggage was not there. I picked up the phone to call the front desk and the phone did not work. I tried the phone in the bathroom and it did not work either. I decided to check out the room before going back down to the front desk. The room was all tile(typical Caribbean/Mexico). There was a king bed with a smaller day bed/seat near the balcony. The view was nothing spectacular in this particular room. It had a view of a watersports business next door to the resort. If you craned your neck far enough to the left, you could see the beach. BTW, this room would be rated as 鈥榦ceanview鈥? even though you could barely see the ocean. The room itself was clean and the bathroom was nice with a Jacuzzi included. The bathroom only had 2 towels and 1 foot towel. The mini fridge contained 2 bottled waters and 4 soft drinks. No unusual smells in the room. The in room safe partially worked(only 6 of the 9 numbers functioned).We went back down to the front desk to report the phone problem and were told that there was nothing that they could do about it until the phone company came out to repair the phone. I stated that I need to use a phone to communicate with the relatives watching our children. He said that the best they could do would be to change us to a different room the next day, which I agreed to do. No one from the bell staff was available, so we ended up carting our luggage back to our room. We were very tired by this point. There was a beach party occurring our 1st night and we could hear the extremely loud music until 1:30am or so. Block 6 is located next to the beach, so we got the full barrage of music. Fortunately, they only do the beach party once a week. We finally got to sleep around 2am. The next morning we woke up and headed straight to the lobby to meet with the local representative/liaison who was overseeing my stay at the resort. I explained the telephone situation to him and he immediately talked to the staff. They once again said that they would change us to a new room, but did not give us a time. We then headed for the breakfast buffet. I was more impressed with the breakfast selection than the previous night鈥檚 dinner selection. The selection was good and they had a made to order omelet station. They also had several different types of freshly made fruit smoothies which were very good. Overall, I was impressed with the breakfast offerings. Jose was once again there to greet us and was extremely cordial. We went to the front desk after breakfast to inquire about our room change and were told that it would be 2:30pm before we could make the change. We headed back to our room, changed and headed for the beach. Block 6 is conveniently located next to the beach which was very nice. There were plenty of chairs and shaded umbrellas available since we were staying during the low season (late Sept.-early Oct.). It was extremely hot. The beach is a nice, typical Punta Cana beach. Lot鈥檚 of coconut trees and a lot of sand. There are a lot of topless sunbathers since this is more of a European resort. There is a roped off swimming area. The water is quite murky, mainly because of the wave action created by speeding boats just outside of the swimming zone. Don鈥檛 expect wonderful snorkeling in the waters in front of the resort. Also, DO NOT venture outside the swim zone or you will be in danger of getting hit by a boat. There is quite a bit of seaweed from nearby reefs floating in the water which ends up on the beach. Overall, I was impressed with the beach itself. It is swept clean at night and is kept free of most garbage. There is a beach bar and a beach grill which had a small selection of food including hamburgers and pizza. There are also a lot of activities offered by the staff ranging including aerobics, dancing and volleyball. If you want to stay busy here, you certainly can. Also, the beach area is well patrolled by security guards keeping those without wristbands off the property. At 2:30 we headed back to the desk to see if our room was ready. When we got to the main lobby, we found out that it had been closed for refurbishment and would not open for another month or 2. The new check-in area was now at the adjacent Ocean Cana. We walked over to the Cana鈥檚 lobby area and it was quite a change from Bavaro鈥檚 lobby. The Cana鈥檚 lobby is extremely small. This leads to extreme overcrowding, especially when a busload of tourists check in. When we walked up to the front desk, the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. There were several people in line when we arrived. When we finally were able to ask once again about our room change, the front desk person seemed disinterested. He seemed to be handling several other tasks plus ours. After about a 15 minute wait, we finally got a new room key. The new room (6210) was a short walk down the hallway from the original room. Even though it was a bit closer to the beach, the view was pretty much the same as before, overlooking the watersports business. The room definitely smelled musty/smoky. The bathroom was not nearly as clean as the previous room. There were cigarette stains on the Jacuzzi. Also, mold surrounded the Jacuzzi, especially between the shower and the edge of the Jacuzzi. It was pretty nasty and it kept me out of the Jacuzzi. I wish I had had some bleach to pour around the edges of the Jacuzzi. I assumed that the mold was the result of condensation caused by heating and cooling changes. Note: the rooms are kept extremely cold. If you turn up the thermostat or turn it off, you will cause an extremely bad condensation problem to occur. We witnessed this happening to a guest who arrived, found the room to be too cold, and opened up the sliding glass balcony door to bring some warmth in the room. They left their room for about 1 hour. When they returned, the entire room鈥檚 tile floor was saturated in condensation. We had turned our thermostat up a bit and I got up during the night and nearly fell as I slid on a small area of condensation formed because of the temperature change. Everything did work in this room, except that the king bed had one very small pillow and one very large pillow. We asked for more pillows, but they were not delivered until the next day. We decided to tough it out in this room even with the smell and bathroom mold since we would only be at the resort another day and a half. I also did not want to have to waste time standing in line in the small Cana lobby. The pools at the Ocean Bavaro are nice and kept clean. The grounds are very well kept and there is a very diverse amount of plant life. There are also swans and flamingos on the property. I did not use the Spa, however I noticed several guests getting massages at shaded tables located near the beach and near block 6. We did not eat in any of the specialty restaurants so I cannot comment personally about them, however one of the English speaking guests we spoke to enjoyed the Italian restaurant.When I had opportunities to ask the staff questions in English, most of the time they made the effort to communicate and in a couple of instances, if they did not understand, got someone who did. I did not sense any animosity or irritation when I spoke English. It certainly helps to know some Spanish if you come here, but it is not entirely necessary. As mentioned before, don鈥檛 expect to hear many other English speaking guests. While we were there, we may have encountered 4 or 5 other guests speaking English.The staff seems to work hard. Those involved with the entertainment aspect definitely did their job. We caught 3 shows. 2 were children鈥檚 shows and 1 was an adult show. We enjoyed 1 of the children鈥檚 shows and did no care for the other. The 1st show was fine and involved audience participation by the children. Those children who wanted could get up onstage with the cast and sing and dance to current children鈥檚 songs by the Wiggles and others. The second children鈥檚 show involved young actors lip-synching sensuous songs. One involved a young boy who was probably 8 or 9 singing to sensual song to a girl that was probably 10 or 11. She was making sexually suggestive moves which were unacceptable for that age. We did not enjoy it and left the show before it ended. The adult show involved pulling males from the audience and turning them into 鈥楳r. Ocean鈥? Didn鈥檛 particularly like this show either. Since I was not there for an entire week I cannot give a complete opinion about the shows other than the fact that we did not like seeing the young performers performing in such a sensual way. As mentioned before, I felt the entertainment and activities staff worked hard and did a decent job. There seems to be a problem at this property regarding use of international phone cards. We were unable to use our MCI Worldtraveler card here. We tried several different ways to make calls with our card, but were always blocked. We came to find out that the provider at the resort is Verizon. Apparently only certain cards can get out and MCI wasn鈥檛 one of them. I鈥檓 assuming Verizon was blocking the calls. In fact, they sell Verizon phone cards in the gift shop and I eventually bought one for $8 US in order to make an outside call. Be warned about the change in the reception area to the Ocean Cana. As mentioned, it is extremely small compared to the Ocean Bavaro鈥檚 lobby. On our departure, the lobby became unbearably overcrowded as guests were arriving and departing and others waited there to meet tour buses. Luggage piled up as there were probably 100 guests crammed into the small area. I guessed the occupancy rate at about 40% for the 3 days I was there. I would hate to see this lobby at 戮 to full resort occupancy. It would be a disaster. The chartered airport buses were piled up behind each other to the point where several had to go backwards to exit the resort. Overall, I would rate this as a true 鈥榤oderate鈥?property. The rooms in block 6 we stayed in definitely had issues. The 2nd room was almost a health hazard with the amount of mold in the bathroom. Being a moderate property, I certainly don鈥檛 expect it to be as good as a 鈥榙eluxe鈥?or 鈥榣uxury鈥?property. However, the room at the Holiday Inn Select we stayed in prior to our departure was better than room 6210 in the block 6 section. There was a large disparity in the cleanliness and smell of the 2 rooms we stayed in. I did look at 2 other rooms in block 6 and did notice a musty smell in one of them also. I know that several guests did the 鈥榤usical room鈥?thing of changing rooms. My suggestion is to press for another room if you encounter dirty or smelly conditions. Would I return here? Probably not. There are other properties rated as moderate that are better for the money. However, if you like lots of activities a decent beach, average food and nice pools for a reasonable price, then this place will fit your bill.

<Content>Great resort....tip for party animals within.... I went back in Nov 2004. I keep reading all these reviews from people nit picking about the smallest things!!! The food was very good, the service was accceptable. The beach was very nice, and the grounds were immaculate.Here's the tip to all you party animals.....The booze stops flowing at 1 or 2 am if I remember, BUT if you make your way to the Brazilian resto say around 2 or 3, there's an after hour party. I was pouring my own drinks behind the bar till 5am everynight. Good times!

<Content>SOOOO Relaxing!! I went to Punta Cana Sept 17-Sept 24 with two other friends. Everything was amazing with some exceptions!We arrived at the Punta Cana airport where we were greeted with music and people dressed up in costumes to take pictures with you. The weather was slightly overcast and very humid! We boarded our bus and first stop was our resort! We arrived at the resort at 1:30pm and check in was not until 3:00pm so our rooms were not ready. We got our bracelets and went to the buffet and let me tell you the food was actually GOOD! With all the other reviews I have read and knowing not to expect too much, but I was pleasantly surprised. We finally got our rooms at around 3:30pm and we stayed at block 3 room 3407.. I tried to ask for block 5 or 6 but you had to pay extra for block 6 and block 5 was booked up.. and since we are only in our rooms to sleep anyways, we didn't think spending extra was gonna be worth it.. The room was clean with two double beds. It overlooked the convenience store and it was located by the main buffet and a short walking distance to the pool and beach. POOL: The pool was amazing, always clean, the pool bar always packed! Santiago is soo funny! We met alot of nice Germans and French people.. BONJOUR FRANCE! HELLO GERMANY! ENTERTAINMENT: There was always activites going on. During the day you can do water arobics (which was alot of fun) or you can do aerobics on the beach, they had bingo, the staff was always running around doing something.. they would walk around throughout the day carrying trays of fruit to pass out or they would have freezies or popcorn! The shows at night honestly weren't that great..The one show they did have that was amazing was the Fire Show.. the dancers would dance with lit torches, a man would blow flames from his mouth! I found night entertainment was a little disappointing. The clubs don't open until midnight but the club everyone should go to is MANGU (located at the Occidental Grand Flamenco) its a $8 cab ride, $6 admission plus you need to pay for drinks but it was lots of fun. They had two floors, top floor was a House/Trance room where there were actually DJ's spinning, the main floor which is always packed was playing HIP HOP  RB and Salsa. The club at our resort called Ferro's was pretty bad. They used CD's and was really small.. But you make the best out of it. On Friday night they had a Beach Bonfire Party which was pretty good however the bonfire lasted like a half hour. RESTAURANT: The main buffet is always good, the buffet by the grill wasn't that great.. we went to two a la cartes the italian which was pretty good and the mexican which wasn't good at all. I thought the Breakfast buffet was always the beast, they have your standard omellettes and eggs cooked however you want but they also make fresh donuts and fresh baked breads plus crepes and waffles daily! soooo YUMMY! The wait staff was always cleaning up and bringing drinks.. Hello to VICTOR, he's the best server! always smiling and has these beautiful eyes!ROOMS: well as i mentioned before we stayed in block 3, close to the main buffet and close to the convenience store.. we stayed in a standard room with two double beds, the only english channels they had was TBS, CNN and MTV but whose there to watch tv anyways? Besides, there is no remote for it.. We tipped the maid daily (just for added security) but it seemed that all she did was make our beds! we had to go down to the front desk daily to get more towels, toilet paper and our safe BROKE! We paid $20 USD for our safe plus $20 USD for a security deposit but its worth it! We didn't let something small like that ruin our trip.BEACH: The beach wasn't that great.. there was a lot of seaweed which I thought they could clean at least, but then again its a public beach so I can understand why.. the water was very calm and nice. We did banana boating which is $6USD per person and I tell ya the guy loves to throw you off the banana boat! There were excursion which ranged from $60USD and up but we didn't go on any of them as nothing looked very interesting.. well that concludes my review of the resort! Overall we had a great time and very relaxing!.. Banana Mama anyone?

<Content>Nowhere near as bad as its been described.......!!!! We stayed at the Ocean Bararo in Aug/Sept 05. Tried to go out with an open mind having read some good and some bad reviews on this site. First thing to hit you when you step off the plane is the humidity, but the welcome at the airport is nice.No problems checking in, the staff behind the desk worked as quickly as they could and we were given a very nice cocktail whilst we were waiting.Luggage delivered to our room, the room was in block 7 which in all honesty is ready for refurbishment e.g. the furniture etc was a bit shabby, however it was clean and cool. Later that night experienced a little problem with the plumbing so we requested to be moved to another room. Guy behind the front desk told us 'tonight I don't care, tomorrow we will sort it' - not a problem because we just wanted to sleep anyway by this point.Next morning same guy showed us two lovely rooms as we requested to upgrade, we settled for a Caribbean Spa Suite in block 6, fantastic beach view and jacuzzi bath. Cost us $20 per adult per night but it was worth the money. Unfortunately we didn't realise there were lots of extras we should have got that we weren't told about until we got home and read it in the travel brochure.The grounds and the beach can't be faulted, extremely clean and well kept, our son loved the flamingos and the pea hen that made its home in the dining room.Our housekeeper looked after us very well, keeping us topped up with towels and drinks - they were very grateful for a few dollars and small gifts.The service in the buffet dining room was far better in our second week than the first week, there were noticably less guests in the hotel during the second week. My advice is to try and sit in the same area each day and give a couple of dollars tip then the staff get to know you. We are english, speak very limited spanish but the staff appreciated it when you try.Unfortunately both adults in the party experienced severe upset stomachs which lasted for 8-9 days of our holiday, however we are not sure if it was the food or the rum!Went on 3 trips out, the jungle safari was great - try to get on Elvis's bus, he really made it a great day and try rum and coke Dominican style if you dare. Saona Island was beautiful but the 7am start and 2 hour bus ride there and back let it down a bit.The gift shop is a complete rip off, everything is priced in euros and then converted to dollars.The beach is beautiful but what is annoying is that many guests just don't bother to clear their own rubbish away and this place will get spoilt if it continues.We didn't get to see much of the entertainment as our son had a very limited attention span, however what also put us off was that there was only ever one bar man on duty and queues 3-deep to get served, so all inclusive may be good but it isn't if you can't get served. Our answer was to buy a bottle of brown rum $5.00 a bottle and sit on our balcony.

<Content>100% Honest Okay, so after reading all of the reviews, I was very afraid of spending my honeymoon here but I've been a lot of places in my life and this one ranked very high up there. **I forgot to mention that I am American**Punta Cana is a very authentic place. From their outdoor airport to their driving in the center of the road to their uncommon use of any language besides Spanish. I first would like to start by saying we met another American couple there as soon as we were on the bus to the hotel. We were greeted with drinks and handed a check in packet with keycards and rooms within 5 minutes. The people we encountered spoke english with a very thick accent but because I understand them both, it was easier for me to comprehend. We went to our room and were given an upgrade to a beautiful villa (block 65) with a jacuzzi right in our room. The room was very clean and a nice size with an excellent view from our balcony. Each day we planned tours or excursions so we spent half the day being gone and half the day there. They have more activities than you can handle so you won't be bored if you spend the entire time there. From morning til night, there is something going on. Okay so the average American might be really upset to know that everywhere you go people don't adjust or resort to learning English because of Americans. I heard that over 10 times from American guests who assumed I was Dominican because of my color. They spoke in English and didn't know that half the staff too spoke it however were uncomfortable speaking it so spoke their native language. They knew I could speak both and after they saw me making a positive effort to say at least some words in spanish, they met me half way. The hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful. I am a very picky eater and ate chicken and drank bottled water everyday I was there because I read all of the reviews. I didn't get an upset stomach at all however my fiance ate everything on the menu and was a fluent restroom visitor each night. He said his stomach didn't hurt he just went every night he was there. One suggestion would be to bring small face towels because they gave us 4 towels in our rooms and none were small enough to use as face towels. Everything from the flamingos to the beaches (white sand and warm turquoise water) were immaculate. We did the four wheel tour, Saona Island and swam with the Sharks. We had the time of our lives but notice others who weren't so friendly who would just sit down or out of all of the festivities. This is a place you go to let your hair down, jump in and out of the water, understand that you're going to get a tan, drink lots of rum and dance to their latin music. After the tours each night we went to the buffet for dinner and attended the brasilian restaurant one night and the mexican restaurant another night. We loved them both however understood that people who were there for only 3-4 days had a hard time getting reservations. My suggestion would be to make reservations for them all at the same time. After dinner we always went to the theatre where they had a different performance for each night. (English/Spanish/French/German) These performers were out of sight. After each performance, they announced that different them parties were held at the disco. One night they brought the disco to the beach. That was a real blast with a Bon fire, Music, Snacks and of course plenty of liquor. All inclusive means just that there. We spent money only on excursions and tipping staff who were very thankful to recieve a dollar or two. This place was a wonderful treat and while there is always room to complaint over anything if you look for things, If you go with the intention of having a wonderful time and enjoying another culture, this is the place for you. If you want America or your native country then stay right at home. I personally Loved It!

<Content>absolute heaven hi ,a girlfriend and I went for nine day's to the ocean bavaro spa  beach resort last august, it was absolutely amazing.the people were very friendly, the resort was spaceous and modernly designed,and the designer also thougt of tipical dominican details.The food was very good, and at the discotheque we stayed till the lights went on....every night a midnightswim, and every night we were being asked to leave by the securityguard, it became a ritual, a lot of fun. I believe we were the two tallest girls in the resort, sometimes we felt like giraffes, everybody was so tiny...In former country's it was also good, but here was something extra. I 'll never forget the place, I already felt homesick(to the hotel) when I entered the plane back to amsterdam....If I ever choose to go back to a hotel were I already stayed, it would be this place, In one word fantastic!!We met a lot of nice people, americans, spanish people, a lot of nice looking guys....We had a splendid time, I'll never forget it!!!!

<Content>Ocean Bavaro leaves much to be desired (to put it mildly) I will give the positive first: the grounds, our upgraded spa hotel room, and the pool were beautiful. Everything else left much to be desired. First-off, the service was awful. Drinks at the bar usually take about 15 min. to get--10 of which you're standing around until someone decides to come over and take your order. Food was terrible. And not to mention, the 24 hour pizza snack bar never had any pizza ready. You had to stand around with your plate in your hand until they were ready, and then had to fight off other guests who were pushing and shoving just to eat. Trying to make dinner reservations at one of the a la carte restaurants...good luck! They are always full. We had to slip the guy some money just to get us in. And the $40 beach restaurant, lobster dinner--i wouldn't feed it to my dog! Ferro's disco--unless you want to sweat from just standing or sitting, do not even enter. There is no air ventilation.Getting towels from the beach--good luck. They are never stocked up. You have to go back at a later point in order to get them. The staff was rude, not the friendliest people. I don't speak spanish but my bf does, fluently--and it made no difference. Also, pray you don't need to see the dr. because it's $60 just for the consultation. The safe in our room was broken, and after complaining about it at least 5 times and getting no results- we gave up. Aside from all these complaints, my boyfriend and i managed to still have a wonderful time amongst ourselves. Until our very last day when my digital camera (with all our 80 pictures) was stolen right from my bag. I had it zipped up in my bag and left it unattended for 10 minutes. The resort was not apologetic in the slightest.I would never return to ocean bavaro nor would i recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Stayed at a nice hotel with Great Friends Stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from 8/13/05 through 8/20/05. There were five people in our party (ages 27 to 35). In general, we made the best of our vacation and had a good time. However, we didn't expect a lot when we booked the trip. We planned the trip 3 weeks prior to leaving and got a pretty good deal ($735 pp inc. Air from Philly). We booked through apple vacations (listed as 4 apple resort - should be more like a 2.5 or 3 apple). The weather was beautiful, a little hot and humid at times, but to be expected for the summer months. In this review, I will try to be nice and pick out the positive things about the resort, but it wouldn't be an accurate review if I didn't mentions the negatives as well. Please keep that in mind as your read on:Check in:We decided to beat the crowds at check in, so we took a taxi from the airport to the resort ($22 US) and the trip is about 25 minutes. When we arrived at the resort the porter saw our Apple Vacation tags and took us to the Apple Rep. It took about 10 minutes for us to get our wrist bands, room keys, hotel map, and welcome info. Summary: Check in was very quick and smooth.Room:We were upgraded to a Spa room 6311 (Block 6). The rooms were very spacious, had a TV (mix of channels), Good air conditioning, patio with view of ocean, king bed, and the bathroom had 2 sinks, a shower, and Jacuzzi tub. The refrigerator had a couple water bottles, Pepsi, and 7-up. Had 2 Presidente beers the first day, but was never restocked. Maid service was very good, kept the room clean, and had towels by the time we were taking showers (4:00 PM at the latest). Summary: Room was very nice, and the building location was good as well.Food:We ate at 3 of the 5 ala cart restaurants. The Mexican was the best or the 3. The fajitas were good and the self-made tacos were good too. The Italian was okay (to be nice). The servers were nice, and helped us with some Spanish (ollo, tuelca, etc). The Brazilian was okay too. Served, beef, turkey, chicken, pork, and sausage from skewers. I understand I am in a 3rd world country and the food is different from the US, but overall the food was bad!! I was to Punta Cana last year (at the Allergo Punta Cana) and the food was tolerable. The only thing that this resort had that was good (other then the mentioned above) was the breads and the pizza. We basically lived off that for a week. Like I said earlier, we didn't expect much when we planned our trip, but the food at the resort was the real deal breaker for our vacation. During our vacation, everyone in our party felt sick or got sick at one point or another. Lucky, we were able to fight it off before our trip home (with a little help from Cipro). Summary: Food was not good.Beach:The beach was very nice!! White sand and bluish-green warm water. Always a nice breeze from off the water. There were a lot of topless women at this resort (this didn't offend anyone in our party). The only negatives were the seaweed in the water, the beach bar isn't actually right on the beach, and the playmakers are terrible DJs. They could not operate the music equipment if their life depended on it. It was blasting loud, then quiet, then loud and so on. It would have been nice if they popped in some Dominican music and played it at a low level all day, but it was only on when they were doing activities (I.e., stretching, games, etc.) We brought our own games to play on the beach while we consumed our Presidente and mixed drinks. We made our own game using Washers (ollos) and plastic cups, but played by Pennsylvania rules. Summary: Beach was beautiful, relaxing, and fun with the exception of the music. Other:The hotel grounds were well kept, spread out, and nice. The Pool near the Brazilian restaurant was much cooler then the main pool. It was very refreshing after sitting on the beach in the very hot, humid sunny environment. The swim up bar is shaded, so you can get a tan while drinking there. And Santiago is by far the best bartender at the resort. He took very good care of us all week getting our drinks (even when the bar was very crowded he got us our drinks), so we reciprocated by leaving him a very good tip at the end. It helps to know a little Spanish, even if it's the basics, they will appreciate you making the attempt. I wish people visiting the USA would show that same courtesy.Overall:This is our third time to the Dominican Republic (2 times in Punta Cana at all-inclusives, 1 time in La Romana on a cruise stop), and I don't think we will ever go back. We had a great time spending time with our friends, and made some new ones along the way. We made our decision to visit this resort because of the price, and the Apple rating of 4, but my overall opinion of this resort is 2 stars (On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best). This resort would have gotten a higher rating from me if the food was better, but I was hoping to go on vacation and get fat, not to lose 5 lbs while I was visiting, and that was disappointing. For our next trip I think we will spend the extra cash and go to an all-inclusive resort that has good food, drinks, beach and entertainment. This is the 4th all-inclusive vacation we have been on, and I would put it on my list as my least favorite, so far.

<Content>Wonderful stay at Ocean Bavaro  We spent our honeymoon at Ocean Bavaro from Aug8th-15 traveling fromAtlanta Ga, and had a wonderful time from the 1st day. It was hurricane season but we could not have asked for better weather postcard perfection. We did not like our 1st room assignment and it was upgraded to a jacuzzi Tropical suite, good view close to everything Thanks again Felix no hassle. @@The food was very good, and of course with all the nationalities present here, there was a large variety of foods, including the islands cultural specialties. The food was better to us at the main dining areabecause there was more variety, so after our second restaurant reservation, we were quite satisfied with main dining room. @@ The beach was very beautiful and relaxing, go early to get a spot under a umbrella, the sun can be very intense and a sun block of 30-45 will help save your skin from burning. We kayaked, and used the catamaran sail boat daily- free, went to the gym although it was not airconditionded - but WoW what a view of the ocean to sweat an extra pound off from that delicious rum raisin ice cream everyday on the dessert buffet. @@Went one night to the show that starts at 10pm. A remake of Michael Jackson performances the dancers were fantastic, actually better from where we were sitting, very entertaining. The entertainment staffworks really hard from the early morning aroebics class in the ocean to the late afternoon salsa lessons on the beach@@Overall this place sets the pace for a very relaxing stay. massage stations around the beach, NIGHT lighting, to the piped in music coming from rocks. @@We took long walks down the beach and saw other all-inclusives property beaches, one outstanding thing we notice is that there were many more vacationers at Oean Bavaro - Why - the friendly staff, great food, its authentic, great service, clean comfortable rooms. Ocean Bavaro pulls it off sucessfully and get a A+ by us. Complainers-LEARN TO RELAX AND LET GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Honeymoon not what we expected!! We booked the Dominican thinking it would make our honeymoon very special - how wrong could we be.The Ocean Bavaro hotel in itself was very nice and the rooms where good and the cleaning ladies wonderful but that's where it ends.The rest of the hotel staff, from management to bar staff couldn't care less about you unless you spoke fluent spanish!The food was not that good and so even though we went all inclusive we ended up spending more money on food in the attached resturants as that was the only place you could get a decent evening meal.All in all the honeymoon for us was only made special by the english people we met who where great.I do not recommend Bavaro Ocean resort.

<Content>traveling alone let me start my saying I read alot of reviews before going. I was going alone and my first thought was safety. this seemed a safe place for a female of my age. everyone talks about the food, rooms and beach. but that is not what we go there for. first off all the above was great. however nobody explains the best part of the beach, there is always a gentle breeze that keeps your body regulated maybe its cause i'm from the south but I never broke a sweat on the beach. I didnt swim in the pool because I have one at home. I was there for the relaxation and meeting new people I wasnt looking to be treated like I was in the US. thats why we go to different countrys. The vacation is what you make it, not to depend on them to treat you like your at home. I took 2 tours that I highly recomend. first was Jurasic safari. this is an all day tour of the real DR if you can get on Rigo and Miguels bus. He is the owner of the tour and he will make it as fun as you want it to be. dont be afraid to ask him to stop if want to see something. our group had a blast!! very insightful and well worth the $65.00 it included many stops and sights, drinks and food. only tip is to take candy for the kids they dont get that often and you will see very BIG smiles. The next was the seaquarium diving you walk on the bottom of the ocean and go snorkling...3 hrs. but a great thing to try if you want to see what diving is like. They have lots to offer make sure you check the board by the lobby to see the day or weeks entertainment. I met lots of great people my service was fantastic. also a quick thanks to Vacation express I did not book with a travel agency but Felix helped me book my trips and even gave me a free ride back to the airportsaved me $30 so my friends if you go with an open mind to their country you will be treated well...if you want to be treated like your in the states vacation there. I will go back every chance I get. Good luck and God bless....

<Content>Dreadful choice Unfortutely we really screwed up this year with outr holiday choice. The Bavaro was a truly awfull holiday experince.Stong impression we left with was of a staff group who ould not care less about their guests, especially if they do not speak Spanish. They really made no effort at all.We were very worried when, on three successive evenings i the main restauarant we saw people being sick - we were right to be worried because day 4 was me then day six my son.The grounds and beach are beautiful - careful though; finding towels is a challenge in itself and the staff just love to tell you to come back in an hour when of course there will STILL be no towelds so there is promise but a change of manahgement and some staff training a must....rooms were also nice and the cleaning ladies very, very good.One good part is seeing Punta Cana - on the way out especially- it is a truly charmng and picturesque building.

<Content>Just Returned and Here is Some Useful Info..... We just returned from a week at the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort.There was 4 of us; my husband, myself and our children (15 year old boy and a 14 year old girl). Here is some useful info that might help you to enjoy your vacation.Upon arriving at the hotel at about 3:30pm along with about 16 other people we proceeded to check in. For some reason, the rooms are not set aside for the incoming guests and a person has to take all your paperwork to a back room to figure out where you will be staying. The key here is that it took us more than 2 hours to finally get to our room. We were not being singled out, it took everyone that long. I would advise bringing a bathing suit and a towel in a carry on and once your name is given at the front desk and they are working on your reservation go to the pool or the buffet and relax. It was very hot in the lobby and people were getting aggravated but that didn't help expedite anything. Our first room was in Block 3. It was very musty and I actually saw a salamander run across the floor. We went back and requested another room and were put in Block 7 which was very nice. Same room set up as Block 3 but we were just steps from the ocean, pool, and entertainment..very happy with that block.Once in our room, we checked out our mini fridge to find only a few waters, couple of pepsis and a few sprites. We found a maid and tipped her and asked for more water and she immediately brought more. Of course they rotated the maid staff pretty much everyday so we had to stay on top of the water situation always. Water is prime......you will use it for everything including brushing your teeth and it goes fast. I actually brought masking tape and taped the faucet handle down both in our room and our kids room because you will instinctively go to turn that water on especially while brushing your teeth. I would highly recommend taping the faucet, you do not want to drink that water. We came supplied with immodium, pepto, gasx and cortisone spray. None of us got sick but we did run into a few people who did so be prepared. Our first day, we immediately went to get beach towels at 8am. They do run out quickly. We had no problem getting them at that time but we did hold on to them the entire week as did many others. We then proceeded to go have breakfast and make dinner reservations. Reservations can be made from 7am-12pm and 3pm-11pm There are 2 seatings at each restaurant, 6:30pm and 9:00 pm. We tried for the 9pm seating and got it all but one night. There are 4 restaurants; Mexican, Spanish, Italian and Brazilian. I would suggest making reservations early in the morning and you can make 2 at a time. I would say the the most popular restaurant is either the Italian or the Mexican. Try for those reservations first. Then the Spanish then the Brazilian. All restaurants were good, not great but good. The reason for us choosing the 9pm seating was mainly because of nighttime downtime. For some reason?? the pool closes everynight at 7pm. So if you have 6:30 reservations that means you pretty much have to get out of the pool at 5:30, shower, eat, finish eating at 8:00 and then the show doesn't start until 10pm. That gives you 2 hours of downtime. It was fine for my husband and myself we went and had cocktails but our kids had nothing to do so they went back to the room and watched tv. If you eat at 9pm, you can swim til 7 then go back to shower and relax then have dinner at 9 then see the show at 10. There are also activities and sports going on throughout the day. We (esp. our kids) had a hard time with participating because of the language barrier. I did not feel we got treated any differently, the people were very nice but it was hard to feel like part of the group seeing our family speaks no french, spanish, italian or german. I would say 10% of the guests there spoke or understood english.The beach was nice and we didn't have trouble finding shade or an umbrella to sit under. The same was for the pool but I would put some towels on a few chairs by 9am if you want some shade. There were always enough chairs and it was never the typical run for the best spot situation. We also felt comfortable leaving things on our chairs when we went for lunch or to walk around although my husbands shoes disappeared one day as did someone elses that I spoke to. I heard the excursions were ok though very expensive. My husband and son went fishing- didn't catch anything but it cost them $200. People who did venture off the hotel grounds found many things expensive and people wanted to haggle constantly. The gift shop was expensive for some things but my daughter wanted to bring some things back for her friends and she found some cute clay figurines for about $3 each...not bad.Our son used the fitness center a couple times each day and said it was good with all the necessities. Our whole family also got massages. Right by the pool there is a cabana for massages. It was $25 for an hour which is unheard of at home. The massage was ok more like a rub down but we all enjoyed it and it was well worth the $.It was very hot the whole time we were there and you will sweat constantly even whole you are eating since air conditioning is rare except in your room and some of the reservation restaurants.Checking out of the hotel was a breeze as was customs and our whole trip home was smooth. P.S. the downstairs level of the Punta Cana airport is air conditioned.Overall, it was a good vacation. Bring lots of $1 and $5 as housekeeping, bartenders and the waitresses truly appreciate the tips and truly will remember who tipped and who didn't.

<Content>excellent resort, and a peice of home I stayed at the ocean bavaro resort with my sister and my best friends for 10 days and i wish i could have stayed longer. we arrived on a sunday afternoon and we didnt have to wait long for a taxi at the airport. The apple representative at the airport offered both english and spanish when he introduced himself. Hey! they must have been welcomeing of americans if they offered to speak our language. we arrived at our resort in 20 minutes. we knew well ahead of time that check in wasnt until 3:00 so we were prepared to be waiting for a while. when we arrived at reception we were immediately given our wrist bands so that we could got to the buffet area and get something to eat. (after a long trip wouldnt you rather have a seat, relax and have food?) I dont think people realize that when they give you your wrist bands this gives you the opportunity to go anywhere in the resort, no questions asked! If you think you might want to go to the beach wear your bathing suit under your clothes. After eating and relaxing for a while ..... it was our choice to stay at the buffet until the lines cleared....i mean why rush we were going to be there for 10 days and we didnt want to start off our vacation with a bad attitude. We were immediately upgraded to a carribean spa sweet. we were on the ground floor. although out room had a leak we didnt really mind because we were warned ahead of time, and we were upgraded for free!! within 2 hours there was a repair man in the room fixing the leak and we didnt have a problem for the rest of our vacation.There are so many activities to do both in and outside the resort we were glad we had 10 days so that we could do something different everyday and still have time to go to the beach.Everynight had a different theme both at the buffet and at the show at 10:00. Every friday Vendors come in so that you can shop in the resort if you sone feel comfortable leaving. Very accomodating if you ask me. if you want to shop you have to bargain, and these vendors look forward to it! if you are a cheap and spoiled american like so many of us are .... prove to them that just because we are american doesnt mean we are stupid and rich!! if you see something you like think about how much it would probably cost here. then ask how much it is. if you dont like the price then think about how much you would like to pay for it without being completely selfish because this is how they make a living. they will eventually give in. they also have a beach party with a huge bonfire and drinks on fridays. also on wednesdays they have a disco tour. provided that you are at least 18 years of age you can pay 10 dollars to go on a bus to a local club for about 4 hours my friends and i enjoyed it very much. also, the 10 dollars covers for one drink at the bar in the club. Calling cards are expensive!! they are 10 dollars for about 25 minutes. if you really have to make a phone call....i dont know why you would have to because you are on vacation....but you should probably stack up here before you go over there. If you chose not to use a calling card its 2 dollars a minute.If you are adventurous and you dont mind hanging out with locals like me and my friends you can take the public bus and a taxi. All you have to do is ask and you will get the answer. the bus is 2 dollars if you go to the next city over called higuey and about a dollar if you go to plaza bavaro which is like a huge mall with alot if the same stores and a few places to eat there is also a bank and a waetern union. if you need money out of you ATM just make you you conver it over to pesos ahead of time because the ATM will only give you pesos....if you need american money you can walk over to the bank and they will give it to you free of charge. there is another place to shop its call el cortecito its a mini villlage with restaurants, shops, and supermarkets. the supermarkets have set prices. I bought dove shampoo for 3.00, pretty much the same that you would pay here. if you want to take a taxi to the plaza or el cortecito its about 6.00. not bad considering you could stay for as long as you want. Now, we also asked how much it would be to take a taxi to higuey its 50 dollars round trip and they wait 2 hours for you. so if theres two of you, you could pay 25 each and think of it as a mini excursion, or like i said you could pay 4.00 round trip and stay for as long as you want. my friend and i did this. we stopped at la basilica which is a cathedral in the beginning of town...of course we were immediately spotted and had people comeing up to us asking us for money ...in the local town dont be afraid to have your defenses up you are out of the hotels protection. anyway a young guy can up to us and he was very polite he claimed that he was a local student studying tourism and he offered to show us aroung for a little bit of money. he said i wont give you a price....you give me whatever you want. he gave my friend and i a chance to discuss this and we agreed. i told him that if he was going to be with us that he had to try and keep others way that would try to hassle and persue us. he agreed when he took us to la basilica he wandered to the side gave us a chance to take pictures an be tourists in peace. he took us to another church that was about 200 years old..so he said and he took us to the roof...the church has stairs specifically for this purpose... so that tourist could take pictures of the city from the roof. he then showed us the fire dept. police dept. he took us to gift shops and offered to take us to the fruit market. we were with him about an hour and then he walked us to the bus station. i gave him about 15 dollars for the hour....a mini excursion. we found out that you culd pretty much go anywhere on the island from the bus station. so if you are a brave tourist and you find a nice dominican like we did tour the island your self if you are willing to travel with out a tour group.we did go on excursions provided by the hotel. We took th altos de chavon tour worth 65 dollars plus tax. it was amasing we went to a cigar factory, we went to a plaza to shop we took a boat ride on the chavon river with lunch on the boat. then we drove up to altos de chavon which means chavon hights..up in the mountains there was a town made completly of stone....and the church where micheal jackson married lisa marie. we also went to a cave.....when you think of a cave....you never imagine what you are actually going to see it was beathtaking....and there was also Taino art an awsome experience for those who are intrested in indians. my sister and best friend went snorkling with stingrays and sharks they enjoyed that. you can also fet on the banana boat its 6.00 for 15 min but we bargained for a half hour.i have been to a much more luxurious resort in punta cana and theres no way i enjoyed myself nearly as much as i did at ocean bavaro. vacation is what you make of it. If you are the type of american that is not open to the spanish culture then go to cancun mexico where all the americans go. or stay home and go to florida. Vacation is about not haveng to do or worry about anything stressful the way we would normally do here. we got up late everyday had breakfast at 10, lunch at 3, and dinner at 9 sometimes we went to bed at 10 sometimes at 3 and if you are hungry at 2 theres a 24 hr pizza bar ..... the burgers are the highlight.im hoping to go back next year for 2 full weeks instead of 10 days.

<Content>One to watch My wife and two teenage sons have just returned from having a two week vacation in this resort. We were really looking forward to this trip having spent three lovely weeks in the Riu Meringue in Puerta Plata last year and having had a wonderful vacation there. Our thoughts on the Bavaro are below but this choice was not even a quarter as good as the Meringue.ArrivalCheck-in very much as we saw in previous reviews. After a long flight from Europe we just wanted checked in. The wrist bands were quickly issued but thereafter they seemed to forget we were there for an hour so so............Not a good start.Accommodation.We were allocated two rooms in block 100. Absolutely no complaints at all. The rooms were excellent and maid service thoughout was first class with linen and towels changed daily. Contrary to the rest of the staff the maids were first class.Dining.We used the main restaurant each day basically due to the hassle in trying to get one of the other restaurants booked. Food was, to be charitable, indifferent and quite bland. However two of us had bad food poisoning attacks which really took three days out of the vacation; not good and when my son was sick in the restaurant staff cleared the table but never thought to enquire how he was feeling. This incident, for us, summed up the general staff attitude. They just did not seem to care at all about their guests. If you have a weight problem this resort is perfect for you; you are guaranteed to lose a few kilos.........we also noticed a few other guests being sick in the restaurant so this is a little worrisome.Pools are excellent except for the guests who frequent the pool bar and leave rubbish everywhere.BeachThe beach, as many others have mentioned is wonderful. Beautifully kept and marvellously clean. The water was so warm and I have to say one of the finest beaches I've ever seen. Fantastic.We left the Bavaro on 5 August and this was one of the holiday highlights which is a great shame since with better management and a little more customer care this resort could really be first class. The facilities are there with good accommodation, superbly appointed grounds and that truly wonderful beach. We will not return to see if this improves over time since we see vacation time as too important to be wasted or risked.

<Content>What an awesome place...... 4 of us (age range from 14 to 50) went to this hotel with much concern after reading all the reviews. i spent about a month researching this area  hotel, and considered changing the trip after reading all the negative comments. i am a pretty seasoned traveler and realized that i was going to a 3rd world, very poor country, and took that all into consideration. we americans need to realize that not everyone lives the luxury lives that we have here in the USA. (as is also the case in many other countries). i think our children also need to realize how other parts of the world live and appreciate all the things they take for granted, as well as learn of other cultures. all this aside, i want to say that i cannot believe all the negative i have read on this hotel in particular. when we arrived, we were met by our travel agency guide (noel from turinter company)... he spent well over an hour telling us of things to do, got us a welcome drink, spoke to and arranged our check-in with the front desk personnel--he was beyond wonderful to us and made us feel so welcome . he also even placed calls to the USA for my daughter, as we speak no spanish. we were then taken to our rooms, and when my daughter  friend went to their room, they walked in on a couple already assigned to that room. fortunately, they were getting ready to go to dinner, so no harm done ! we went to the desk and they immediately assigned them to another room down the hall.... OK, it was an inconvenience, but the people were super about it  even talked to us every day after that, and the desk profusely apologized. mistakes happen, and yes, we could have let it ruin our trip, but we chose to overlook it, go on and enjoy our trip. from that point on, i could only walk around in total amazement at the well kept grounds, the warmth we felt from all the staff, the food and food displays, the ammenities, the beach  pool areas, etc. i am a very picky eater, and can honestly say that we always found more than enough that was satisfactory to us. granted, there were things on the buffet that were not our choice, but we were not the only people there ! we did not drink the tap water, and had no problem with getting sick. we tried several times to make reservations to go to the specialty restaurants, but it never happened, so no big deal, we will do that another time !! i am not sure where these people writing bad reviews stayed, but i cannot believe that it is the same place we were at. we have a place in cancun that we love  usually vacation at, but opted not to this year. we thought we would never find a place that we would love more, but i think we have found that place in DR. please consider that everyone's expectations are different, and if you expecte a 5*, americanized hotel,  all american food, do yourself  the DR a favor  stay home ! our maids were super... we left gifts and tips for them every day, and always had a clean room, towels, extra water, and they were so appreciative of what we left them (nail polish, bracelets, cosmetics, a couple dollars, a small purse, perfume  chocolate candy.) i left a couple things each day. .... (we took school supplies for the schools, but school was out, so we passed the stuff on to the staff that had children, as well as some of the people at the market next to the resort). the last morning we were there, our maid came to our door with 2 coconuts drilled at the top with a straw, so you could drink the coconut milk and flowers coming out of the top, with a note written on the side thanking us for everything... it was very sweet !! i hope you think about what you expect, then go and enjoy yourself. we could not have asked for a better trip and experience, and will definitely go back .  the only thing i personally think this hotel could do better with is their choice of drinks....... i do not drink beer, and after the first day, the pina coladas and banana mamas got to be too much sweet for me. i would have been in heaven if i could have had a kaluha and cream, but Oh well, i didn't, so no big deal. it would also be nice if there was bottled water available in other places besides just your room, but again, you can't have every thing, and i would still go back in a heart beat !!

<Content>Don't know what you all are complaining about! I have no idea what everyone's problems are with this resort! We found it fantastic! As for being sick, you will get the runs because all their food is cooked in cocanut oil, which is a known laxitive! We were told ahead of time when we first arrived that this was the case and to be careful. Also, you are in a different country with different customs and traditions! Of course they aren't going to speak your language! If Dominicans were to come here, do you think that they should know english or french? My god people! Half the part of going to a different place is the differences! We had a trying time with the english too, but it in no way ruined our trip! It was gorgeous and all the people were extremely nice! We would love to return and if we do it will be to this resort! Seriously, do not pay any attention to the people with bad reviews. You get what you give out of this resort! If you are pleasant and nice to people they are the same to you. Tipping works wonders!

<Content>I'd rename it the 'Do it yourself' resort! We just returned yesterday from the Ocean Bavaro and although we had a good time, none of it had to do with the hotel or the accomadations provided to us.Americans Welcome? I dont think so. Nobody understood english very well. There were barely even any english speaking guests to converse with. Here is a breakdown of our week.1st - we arrived at noon and we were told we could not check in until 3. We were not offerred a drink - a cold towel or any of the usual welcoming things that a resort offers. We were pointed to the restaurant and they said we could get something to eat. When we asked for a room to change into a bathing suit they pointed us to the public bathroom. We had to dig through our luggage on the side of the driveway and drag our stuff to the bathroom to change. In the meantime, we watched other spanish speaking people walk in, given drinks and cold towels and rooms to change. We were finally escorted to our room - which was filthy. I wouldnt bath my dog in the tub. when you sat on the toilet you could see under the sink which was plywood written on by prior guests. We went back to the front desk (15 minute walk) and were given a better room. In the 100 block - which was nicer but very far away from everything and with a 3 year old, that makes life very tough. I wouldnt advise that anyone excepts the first room given to them. It seems they try to give you a bad one to see if they can get away with it first. Every time you have a problem or need assistance you are told to walk to the front desk (this is a 10-15 minute walk from our rooms). And then when you get there they dont understand what you are saying and you are left standing there for 15-20 minutes. Our room key kept losing its activation and we would be locked out of our room. We would have to run back to the front desk every time. It was frustrating.Then, nmy husband was calling me nightly at 10:00 from the US to check in with us. He could not get through. He would ask for my room, he was transferred 3 or 4 times then disconnected several times, every night. I had to call the front desk and their answer to me was, come here and talk to us. After what seemed like hours! I finally was able to find someone to understand me and recognize that I was going to get a phone call every night and when I do, they should transfer the call. He still was hung up on every night and finally just stopped calling. I couldnt even get a phone call in!The beach was dirty. Plastic bags in the ocean wrapped around your legs. Seaweed everywhere. My 3 year old would not even go on the beach. Said it was yucky. I somewhat agreed. We found ourselves cleaning up the beaches.The pools were dirty too. First, they opened at 9 and closed at 7. To me this is bizarre. I have stayed in many resorts all over the place and not one had a time limit on when you can swim in the pool. The workers came out and cleaned the pools at 8 am. My daughter was up at 7 and wanted in the pool by 7:30 and we couldnt go in. The pools were not cleaned very well at all. The same garbage you saw the day before still floated even after the men attempted to clean. Filthy. We found ourselves cleaning up the areas we were in.The food. I am still sick at the thought. My daughter had a fever and was going to the bathroom non stop the 2nd day. By the 3rd day my mother was doing the same and I still am today. The thought of having to eat the food they served one more day is enough to make me want to vomit. I cant even think about it without feeling ill. I lived on bread and spaghetti with a prego like tomato suace. And snacks I brought from home.The service was do it yourself. get your own drinks - get your own food - get your own everything. They dont tell you the amenities at the resort, you have to figure it our yourself. They dont tell you whats going on or the activities, you have to figure it our yourself. The so called 24 hour nurse or doctor service is not free. When my daughter became feverish I wanted to run her by the staff nurse and I was told at the door $60.00. I went on the internet and got the answers to the questions that I had concerns with.The gift shop is a rip off. WATCH YOUR MONEY. They tried to charge me on a number of occassions $11 (that seemed to be their favorite number) for a bag of doritos, a push pop and a piece of gum. A woman employee once came to my rescue and I thought, finally! an honest person! On the last day of our visit she told us her home was robbed and she needed money, she mentioned having a small child and all of their clothes were stolen, we offerred to give her some clothing of my daughters and she only wanted the money. Although I wanted to help it was hard to believe after all of the dishonesty we experienced and I would find it a terrible shame if this is an ongoing scam that this worker poses on everyone. I am not a wealthy person and I save every penny I had this year to take my daughter on this vacation. They seem to think that you are american you must have money to spend, or money for them to steal. I would recommend being educated on Pesos and Euros before entering that gift shop.AND the worst. THe racism is apparant and insulting. Spanish speaking people were treated better. Given upgrades special treats. More respect. Americans were laughed at. Taken advantage of and simply made fun of.There was a restaurant about 20 feet from our rooms. This food was noticably better. More selection - better selection. In order to get into this restaurant you had to be a vip or come from an italian travel agent. Something bizarre which was never fully explained to us. If a common guest went into this restaurant they were told to leave! Then a family we met said they were told it was ok to eat there (they were of dominican decent) and another family we met, spanish speaking, they were told it was ok to eat there. When we asked the front desk we were told you had to be from a certain travel agent in order to eat there and we were not. and we were pointed back to the common area.Disgusting.Even our trip home was horrible. Our flight was at 1:00 - our airline said to be there 2 hours before. We prepaid with our package for transportation back to the airport. They told us they could only pick us up at 9 am. We had to sit at the airport with a 3 year old for 3 hours. We asked them to come later and they laughed at us. LITERALLY laughed at us. I think the service was Turnitad. HORRIBLE. Would I return to the dominican? certanly. But I would not go to this resort ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good vacation. It was frustrating, insulting and dirty.

<Content>Had an awesome vakay at Ocean Bavaro Just got back last night from Ocean Bavaro after a week of absolute rest and relaxation. Read reviews before going and was a bit nervous but after this week I am glad I stayed there.On arrival we took a taxi from the airport. It was about a 20 minute ride and it was quicker than taking one of those tour buses. Just get use to how they drive over there. It's crazy. Once at the resort check in took about 20 minutes because the rooms weren't ready yet but other than that everything else went smoothly. People at the reception desk were very friendly and courteous. Had no problems with them. We stayed at Block 100. This is furthest away from the pool/beach which was fine with us. It is quiet at this end and about a minute walk to the Main buffet restaraunt. The rooms were well kept and everything worked fine. AC was great. I tipped the maid daily and she kept the fridge stocked with water and soft drinks.The property is beautiful and very well kept. There is always someone keeping up with maintaining it clean. The beach is absolutely beautiful, plenty of lounge chairs but if you want a hut you need to get there really early. Most people get up early and put towels on the chairs under the huts, then leave and come back much later. The water is nice and warm the only thing a bit too much seaweed which they try to clean up early in the morning. The pools were lovely but we spent most of our time at the beach. This hotel is very family oriented. There are alot of activities for kids as well as for adults.The food was great. It seemed they had a different theme for each night. Some of us did get sick. Make sure you bring Pepto or Imodium. The only restaurant we were able to get into was Pepito's. (Mexican) and the food was really good. The entertainment group was AWESOME! HOLA Manuel, Junior, Jimmy, Leonel and Carlos. This group works so hard and they are very talented. I definitely suggest that you join in the beach activities. They have a nightly show they perform and it's amazing the work they put into it and how excellent they perform. There is also a kids show before the Entertainment group performs. The disco was pretty good. Alot of good music, if you're into merengue, salsa, reggaeton, and bachata and some techno too. Mostly a young crowd.Overall we had a fabulous time and would definitely go back. In regards to the negative reviews go with an open mind. Some people are just never satisfied.

We are actually returning again on 19th October - i cant wait.

<Content>Americans not welcomed! This was our 2nd visit to Punta Cana. Last year we stayed at the Punta Cana Princess Resort and it was wonderful! The people were welcoming and we had a great visit. I cannot say this about our recent stay at Ocean Bavaro. From the time we stepped off the bus things were not good. The check-in process took HOURS. We waited in the lobby with our 2 children, it is not easy for adults to wait let alone children. I stayed in line and tried to keep smiling while I watched others (Spanish-speaking guests) walk in front of us and be very rude to the workers. I could write a book but I will try to condense this. Each day I was seated at dirty tables at the breakfast buffet. I could not get my coffee served to me. If my husband, who looks Spanish, would ask for coffee in spanish we would be served. You could not get beach towels. I was told by one employee that the resort did not have enough towels. This was obvious! They would only place 2 towels in your room, even if you had 4 people staying there. Above all of this, the worst thing about our stay was how we were treated. My children even realized that we were not welcomed. I would recommend for others to visit the Dominican, but you should find a resort that wants Americans.

<Content>Relaxing Resort IntroductionWhatever other people have covered in their reviews I don鈥檛 want to say again. I鈥檒l just put down a brief statement of my experience so this review won鈥檛 be as repetitive as others. I hope it helps.BackgroundThere were 4 of us, all from Montreal; guys aged 23-25 years. We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort from June 18th 鈥?25th. We got VIP packages at the same price as standard (which was pretty sweet). We flew Air Transat.RoomsBlock 6 is great. It had a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. Very romantic. Too bad we were 2 guys to a room. BeachBeautiful. White sand and turquoise water. You can鈥檛 go too far out though, there鈥檚 a rope blocking you. Past this is where the motor boats speed by. One of these motor boats speeds you around on an Inner Tube (2 people), which was a lot of fun. You have to hold on for dear life, our arms hurt after it was over from gripping so hard and trying not to die. We had told the boat driver to go hard and fast鈥nd he did. We went back a few days later (when our arms were no longer sore) to do it again. There was a different driver who seemed to take it a lot easier, and so it wasn鈥檛 as much fun. Ask the driver to go hard, it鈥檚 really worth it. FoodThe Buffet was ok; you could usually find something to eat. The other 3 鈥済uys鈥?I went with needed the Imodium and Pepto regularly. I was fine though. The Italian 脿 la carte restaurant was by far our favorite. It had some really good pasta. One of us speaks fluent Spanish, and normally did all the talking, which was a big help. But one night when he got sick, the rest of us had gone to the Spanish 脿 la carte restaurant. Not having our Spanish friend with us caused us some problems. One of us didn鈥檛 get his appetizer. Two of us got the wrong main courses. My friend ordered a gin and gingerale, he got beer mixed with gingerale鈥e said it didn鈥檛 taste that bad though. They saw us looking all confused when we got the wrong things, and they figured it out and came back with what we actually ordered each time. So it鈥檚 good to know some Spanish, it鈥檒l help for sure, but you can usually get by with a few words. DiscoLots of salsa music as expected, which isn鈥檛 really my thing. Also, there鈥檚 lots of jail bait. So be careful. I鈥檓 surprised none of us landed in DR jail. I felt dirty鈥?but in a good way. One night there was a trip to a local disco. We got offered prostitutes 鈥渇or us, good price鈥? After careful consideration, we declined the offer. If my friend Andres hadn鈥檛 been sick, I鈥檓 sure he would have accepted and then I鈥檇 be able to tell you if they were worth it. On another night, I got pretty wrecked; sadly my friends were tired and went to bed, so I ventured to the resort disco alone. After stumbling about in the disco for a bit and bumping into people, I sat down by myself and noticed I had sat down behind a big group of jail bait (an accident I swear). I was pretty messed up, so basically I looked extremely creepy just staring at them all by myself. Again, lots of salsa music, they did also play a few hit rap songs, which I enjoyed much more. The disco seemed to be pretty fun that night, other than the creepy guy all by himself, with a beer, that would just stare (me). There was a beach party also, which would have been fun but it was on our last night there and we had to get up early, so we didn鈥檛 really get to enjoy it. SpaSeeing as how we had a package that included a Spa treatment, we decided to try it out. Beware The Paper Thong. None of us had ever been to a Spa before and didn鈥檛 really know what to expect. For the exfoliation, they handed my friend and I paper thongs. When I tried to put mine on, the front 鈥榁鈥?ripped in half at the seam, leaving my right nut and half my schlong hanging out. It was kind of embarrassing. Needless to say, it wasn鈥檛 comfortable at all (the paper thong). The actual exfoliation and massage however was great. I felt really clean and relaxed after. I just wished they gave me a bigger paper thong, which apparently they do have. SummaryIn all I thought this resort was great. The beach was beautiful and the food was for the most part good. A lot of families seemed to be there. Not a real exciting night life. It鈥檚 a great resort for relaxing. Try not to get hooked in by the jail bait, it鈥檚 very tempting. Or at least try not to get caught. I hope this helped. If you have any other questions, feel free to email me.

<Content>Had a great time, but..... Just arrived back from Ocean Bavaro on Tuesday. Firstly I would like to start by saying that I had a great holiday although there are some negatives about the hotel. Here goes:-Check-In Arrived at the hotel and reception was empty, however it took the man behind reception a while to sort out room keys etc as there were 4 couples checking in at the same time. We got given a nice drink, then the porters took our luggage and we were shown to our room.The RoomThe room we were allocated on arrival was in block 100, while there was nothing really wrong with the room itself it was really far away from the beach/pools so we went to reception and asked to be moved (we had emailed the hotel prior to leaving to request block 5 or 6 but they obviously couldn't accomodate us where we wanted). We were told to come back at 2pm the next day and we did this and were moved to block 2. This was more central and the room was nice but the beds were smaller than the previous room. The room got cleaned every day apart from 2....no idea what happened those days!! The FoodWe ate in the Buffet, Italian, Mexican, Brazilian and the Seafood. The mexican was definitely not our cup of tea, but each to their own. The Brazilian was ok, lots of meat most of which was nice. The Italien was really good, we enjoyed the steak and the lasange. While I was their it was my birthday so we went to the Seafood restaurant that night, it was lovely on the beach! The food was good too it costs extra @ $40 per person but you get 2 huge lobsters, mussels, white fish and prawns as well as starters and wine...definitely worth the money. Buffet was ok, breakfast was the best by far...great omlettes and freshly made doughnuts and waffles!PoolsWe never really spent much time at the pool as the beach is so nice. The pool beside the brazilian used to get cleaned about 10am, however the one day we went to the pool with the swim-up bar it looked really dirty with stuff floating in it, including something that looked like a condom...yuk! Needless to say we never went back.BeachThe beach was absolutely Beautiful, the nicest I have ever been too. White sand, palm trees, hammocks the lot! There is a small coral reef at the bit of beach outside ocean bavaro and you can borrow snorkelling equipment for free and go and see all the tropical fish. We used to take bread rolls down every morning and feed them which was great. My boyfriend saw a coral snake there though so that kind of put us of going back out as I am defo not a snake person! We went parasailing, which was really good...you get taken by speed boat out to the other side of Punta Cana and get to drive past all the other hotels which was nice to see, this cost $80 for two people. EntertainmentThe entertainment wasn't really to our taste...we went to 2 shows and they are probably more focussed on people with children with them. We didn't go to the nightclub/Disco either, but heard from others that it wasn't that great. So generally we just used to have a drink in the lobby bar, which had occasional entertainment such as singersExcursions We did one excursion, which was the Marinarium...it was brilliant. The staff were really good and all spoke about 4 different languages so it is definitely a good one for all nationalities. You swim in the coral with the fish for about 1/2 an hour and then you get taken in to a huge pen in the middle of the sea with nurse sharks and sting rays! I would really recommend this trip, it was $72 per person.Overall we had a really good time, I would say that it helps of you can speak conversational Spanish because although we knew the usual 'Hola, Gracias etc' we did sometime find it hard to communicate and understand the staff as obviously their first language is Spanish. Also, as others have said I would recommend taking immodium or something similar as we did experience upset stomach for the majority of the holiday although we couldn't pin point it to any of the food in particular. The weather was good apart from two days but that was because of the tropical storm so we were actually really lucky not to have been more affected. I liked Bavaro and the Dom Rep and would go back, just maybe to a different hotel.

<Content>almost paradise I've have traveled to quite a few island spots,Cancun,Cozumel, Nassau,Eluthera,Bermuda,and was ready to try a new adventure. We booked this trip last minute for 7 days at $800 per person all-inclusive.Great deal including flght.Airport: Very fast customs, the airport is open-air with a thatched roof, you will pay $10 for a tourist card.Keep the other half in a safe place 'cause you will need this to exit the country or you will pay another $10.Check-in: Went smoothly,After we located my friend's luggage.It seems the tour operators took her luggage off the bus at the wrong hotel.You will make several stops at other hotels. So, watch them unload the luggage at the other hotels,to make sure yours is not taken off by mistake! After a long day traveling,you don't want to be on a bus driving around looking for your stuff. All was resolved though.The Rooms: We were located in bloque 100, which is at the back of the resort. At first this seemed an inconvenience, but it was quiet. No loud music,or kids screaming. It was close to the buffet. The room was nice,clean,all tile,and marble,although it did have a musty smell.Everything in the tropics damp,hence the smell. Air conditioning worked great. A fridge with water and soft drinks is hidden in the dresser, although our maid sometimes would forget to replenish,and yes, I tipped. A safe is in the closet and I would recommend it, $40 w/ $20 returned after check out..... by the way,all your reciepts,room keys,safe key and towel cards are needed at checkout.The Grounds: Beautiful! They really do a good job keeping everything trimmed and looking good. Pink Flamingos,Peacocks, lizards can be seen roaming.The Beach: Just what you'd think a Tropical island should be- Lots of palm trees,nice white sand! Plenty of beach chairs and palapas are available. The Ocean: Clear with more of a green tint, Not the blue you see in Mexico, but still nice and warm. I love to snorkel, they have a small reef on the right side of the beach,you can see a lot of fish there. One complaint is they have a roped in section to swim in, beyond that is the boat highway. Boats of all shapes and sizes cruising by ,and yes ,sometimes the fumes can be too much.There is a huge reef on the other side of this highway, ...Gorgeous Brain coral,amberjack, and the water is clearer and deeper there too. I don't think your supposed to swim there so,you didn't hear that from me! There are kayaks,snorkeling gear, and other activities available for free at the dive shop,this also where you get your beach towels. There are also pay activities as well.The Food: Well I'm pretty open minded and the food was not great and sometimes just awful. There is the Buffet,Italian,Spanish,Mexican, and the Brazillian. The Brazillian was the worst,overcooked meats served in an un-airconditioned room!The Buffet,Italian,Spanish, Mexican all connected to the same Kitchen! No wonder it all tasted the same!!! Just slightly different presentations.I was in Cancun last year and every meal including the buffet was outstanding! I can't say that about this hotel.I never got ill ,but did make more trips than usual to the restroom,and we never drank anything but the filtered water.Make sure you pack Pepto or Immodium with you as a pre-caution. Overall: We had a very relaxing vacation.If your looking for the complete opposite to Cancun's party-'till-you-drop pace, this fits the bill.There are more Europeans and South Americans here ,so if you are an American,Canadian,Or British ,you are the minority! Learn some Spanish(take a phrase book) it kills me when visiting another country that everyone expects the locals to speak their language.This is NOT the States! Most of the staff does speak 4 or 5 languges though! So at least ATTEMPT to try a few words in their's! Hablo Inglese?! Dos Cervesa's Por favor? Gracias! Salud!

<Content>Go with an open-mind and a 12 pack of Charmin... My best friend and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from July 5-12. We read reviews before we left, but we feel it's best to always approach a new experience with an open-mind. Overall, we had a wonderful vacation... Although the airport is unbelievably hot and humid, it was smooth and quick as we went through customs, clamined our luggage, and found our tour bus to take us to our resort. We booked our vacation with Vacation Express. Be sure to sit on the right side of the bus, so you are able to view which luggage they unload at the other hotels...since Ocean Bavaro is last. They unloaded my luggage at one of the other hotels, and I was not aware of this until we reached our hotel. So...after a long day of travel, we had to load the bus again and retrace our route to locate my luggage (we asked them to call the other hotels to see if luggage was left unclaimed - they wanted to drag us around on the bus instead). By the time we finally reached our resort, again, the front desk was empty, and check-in went smooth and quick. Our room was in block 100. This is the farthest building from the beach, but it was quiet. Our room was very clean. The lighting in all of the rooms is extremely dark... ( I didn't want to see myself anyhow because the water was causing my skin to rash and break-out). We had fresh towels supplied about every other day, we had to take water from the maid carts left in the breezeways because our supply would run low. Our sheets were changed once or twice during our stay. The air conditon was fantastic! One day, we did return to the room to find no water. We called the front desk and got no answer, so we had to walk down there. They ignored us at the desk, so we stopped a staff member and asked about the water. He told us it would be back on in 20 min., and it was almost exactly to the minute. Also, each day we returned to our room to nap around 3 or 4...as soon as we started to drift off to sleep...maintenance would start pounding, building, sanding, or repairing something! That was a little annoying, but nothing worth runing our vacation over. You will see that a smile and a tip will help with your maid service too! This resort, as possibly many others do as well, caters to the European guests. Americans and English-speaking guests were few and far between. The more you attempt to speak Spanish, you would think...the better, but it really depends on the person you are speaking to. The hotel staff and the European guests were rude most of the time - I was even laughed at because I was having difficulty understanding the desk girl that you book your restaurant meals with. By the way, you have to book those meals two days in advance, and it's really not worth it. The Brazilian restaurant was horrible...overcooked meat...no air! The Mexican, Spanish, and Italian are all situated around the buffet kitchen, so what they serve at those three can be found on the buffet... We were pleasantly surprised with the Spanish meal. The next night, we had reservations for the Italian resturant...ordered something completely different, but received the exact same meal that I ordered at the Spanish restaurant the night before! Regardless where I ate, I spent much of my vacation in the restroom...I realize that Scott Tissue is economical, but after 8 days of constant use... phew!! So, pack your quilted from home...you'll be glad you did! Bring lots of pepto and mom's. You may never have an upset stomach, but just in case! Besides the food and the lack of conversation with the other guests, the beach was paradise, the drinks were good - if you like rum. I drank a lot of 7up. The beach games are a blast, and I recommend that you join in the fun! It added laughter to our vacation! Our trip was wonderful, but there were a few bumps here and there. We made a few friends with a couple from America (hi Arron and Nick!!)and one from England (hello Jean and Paul)...and we were disappointed that it was difficult to strike up a conversation with people. Punta Cana is a European vacation spot, and I think it will take a few more years for them to become comfortable with Americans. Here are some tips... Drink coffee from the machine, get your beach towels the first day and keep them all week, go with an open-mind, bring a Spanish pocket-dictionary, bring wash cloths from home (they offer none) and hide them from the maid service (she will take up with the towels), tip regularly, don't expect to meet new friends...be pleasantly surprised when you do, bring sunscreen (lots), stay in block 100 if you don't mind being away from the beach, ride the banana, remember that this is not American (we are very spoiled), and relax.

<Content>Would have been OK BUT............ We arrived a few weeks after the hurricane in October 2004. We were given a room in the Carribean Spa on the ground floor. Unfortunately we were unable to leave the balcony door open as we were near the end and the room after 1 week was riddled with damp. We were at reception constantly and eventually offered a room on the first floor but with a double bed (we were friends) so we had to turn it down.After two week all our clothes were constantly damp and it was unbearable. Apart from that the resort is great, the staff are a delight and the entertainment was fantastic. However the food had me constantly in the loo. Loved the Dominicans and would return.

<Content>A beautiful Place to stay My husband and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Spa  Beach Resort from the 20th June - 4th July and we had an absolutely wonderful holiday. We did read lots of reviews before we went and they were very mixed so we were a little anxious but went with an open mind. When we were dropped off at the hotel we couldn't beleive how nice the reception/lobby area was. We were waiting to check in and a lady came over and gave us a pina colada which was very nice as we were gasping for a drink because of the intense heat!! Check-in took about 15-20 minutes as there were some people in front of us. When we got to our 1st room (in block 5 1st floor) we were happy with it but soon found that we were un-able to close the door as it was faulty so we went back to reception and explained the problem and we were moved to a different room in block 100 (this did take a while though as there were loads of people at reception checking in.) When we finally got to our new room we were very happy with it, it was better than the 1st one! It was a large room with a huge bed, lovely bathroom, air con (god send!!) and a t.v which did have english channels (well, American channels.) Before i go any further, I must just say that this complex is absolutely huge and we did actually get lost on the 1st night and couldn't find our way back to our room for ages!!The grounds are absolutely beautiful and immaculate, there was never anything out of place and the gardens, trees, bushes etc were always neatly trimmed. Opposite the buffet restuarant there is a big lake with a lovely bridge over it and the lake has ducks and pink flamingo's in it. We also saw a peacock and a few little lizards.The pools are lovely and very clean, the swim up bar is very handy, although there is a wierd smell of strong beer or something coming from it??The beach, well where do i begin, it is gorgeous, the sand it pure white, the sea is pure aqua green and there are thousands of beautiful palm trees all around (just how you would imagine a perfect carribean beach to look really!!) There was always plenty of sun-beds, but do try to get some in the shade aswell as you will most likely need them. We found that sometimes it got far too hot and we needed to go in the shade for up to an hour before we could go back out in the sun. The weather was brilliant. It was extremely hot, we only had 1 day of rain and a small thunder storm.The restaurants were very nice. The buffet restuarant was always busy but the food was usually good. The only thing we found wrong with this one was that most times when we went to get a drink there were no glasses which got really annoying after a few times, also some of the tables were not set up when you sat down. But the breakfast here was brilliant. So much to choose from and all very nice (can reccommend the freshly made omlettes.) Can't really comment on the seafood restuarant, as we don't like seafood so obviously didn't try it.The entertainment staff on the beach (Los Panas Happy Club) are always trying to get you to join in with their games, I must say, they do a fantastic job and most of the things that they do are worth doing!If you get the chance to go on a boat trip to Saona Island then you must go. It was fantastic. I cannot describe how amazingly beautiful it was. We travelled over on a catamaran boat and travelled back on a speed boat. Whilst on the island they did a barbecue for us, which was very nice and we also got unlimited drinks. On the way back we stopped in the middle of the ocean and got off the boat, the water only came up to our waist! We could see star fish on the bottom and everyone was picking them up.Overall we were very impressed with this hotel and everything else. I would reccommend it to anyone. I know there have been a lot of bad reviews from people but we can honestly say we couldn't fault it at all, maybe we were just lucky, I don't know, but the people we got talking to whilst there were impressed with it too. The next time we visit the Dominican Republic we will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Like a cruise, but on land!!! I stayed at Ocean Bavaro from June 27 - July 1. Our package was through Vacation Express (Transmeridian Airlines) and Coco Tours. When we first arrived to Punta Cana the airport was very small and not air conditioned. The climate there is very hot and humid. They snapped a pic of us at the entrance with the Dominican women and greeted us with a small group of men playing Dominican music. If you are taking a shuttle bus (which is nicely air conditioned) to the hotel, remember that Ocean Bavaro is one of the last resorts from the hotel. The entrance to our hotel was not that mesmerizing compared to some others that we had stopped at to drop off others. I particularily like Barcelo Bavaro. I think it was one of the more upscaled resorts. The front desk did not have a long line, but it took us a long time to finally check in. The man at the front desk gave us each our wrist bands and just left us hanging without our room number or room keys. Finally, our tour representative helped me finally get my room keys. The whole process took over an one hour and there really wasn't a line to begin with. While waiting though, a waitress did greet us with a Bahama Mama drink. The bell boy took our luggage in his cart to our room while we walked to our room. Our room was in block 4 on the first floor. Our room did not smell like mold like others were proclaiming but it was dark and dreary. There were about 15 mosquitoes. I demanded another room insect free and was told at the front desk that there weren't any and to come back tommorrow. After getting more upset and talking to the manager, they gave me a key to another room that was available. I walked over to check it out and found a man inside (thank god he was fully dressed). He told me that this is his room but also wants to change rooms cause the a/c did not work, the tv did not work and the patio door did not close or lock. I couldn't believe they were sending me from one unsatisfied room to another. I decided to keep our original room and they did offer to fumigate the room which they did one day later. Besides the room issues, these are my opinions on the following:Front Desk/Room Service: The front desk is very slow and ignore you until you finally keep talking to them. They would just say one more minute, but there wasn't even anyone else besides me around to help. I was being very nice and did not have any kind of attitude. Our maid was very nice, but never gave us any towels or soaps. I had to always call for them and would have to wait no longer than 30 minutes.Pools/Bars: some what clean, warm. I did like the way the main pool was designed. I loved the swim-up bar. All the bars had quick and good service. Food: I did not go to any of the restaurants, but i heard that the Italian was good and the brazilian was bad. The buffets were average. I did see some flies swarming around some food and a bird pick at the food on the table the first day. The omlettes were tasteless. Honestly, the food does taste different, but what can u expect....it's a different country. I loved the bread assortment. There's so much to choose from. There's ice cream, smoothies, many desserts, many cheeses, salads, etc. There's something for everyone. Each night the dinner seemed to be themed. The service there was wonderful. I did not get sick, although i was real careful what i ate. We were told not to drink the water!!! Beach: Clean, beautiful, fun. The water is calm and warm. There was some seaweed, but who cares. The huts were always taken, but i wasn't there to hide from the sun. I sat next to the Happy Club where all the music and games were at. It wasn't too loud. The only bad thing was that there were barely ever any towels. They would say they'd be ready in an hour and still they wouldn't be ready. So, we were towel free most of our time there. Tip: Definitely wear lots of sunscreen on cloudy days. There was a little skinny dog wandering the beach one day. Make sure your kids do not play with it since it could have some kind of disease.Nightlife/Entertainment: There's Ferro's Nightclub and entertainment each night at the theater near the main pool. It starts at 8pm, but i wouldn't go until 9:30. That is when they pull people from the crowd and make us laugh. From 10 - 11, there's a show. The bar there is open late. I thought the shows were entertaining and funny.Grounds: Very clean and organized. Nothing ever seemed out of place. I did see some small lizards around. The lakes and fountains were beautiful. Near the buffet there's a lake with real flamingos and ducks. Occasionally, i would see a peacock walking around that area. Very cool!Overall, I had a great time at Ocean Bavaro. It really depends on how you make your vacation. Try to be positive and remember it's a vacation away from your daily life. Happy Vacationing!!!

<Content>Excellent!!! Stop complaining!!! I read TONS of reviews before going...so I went into this pretty open-minded on how things would turn out. It was a fabulous vacation!!!We were greeted with a cold drink and a cold towel upon arrival and it only took minutes to get from the cab to our nicely air-conditioned room!!! The room as decent, very clean. Beautiful bathroom. Considering we spent no time in the room, it was perfect.The grounds are gorgeous. The three pools were always clean. It was not that difficult to get under a parasol everyday. I managed to stay for a week and not burn the heck out of my skin. Also, only one mosquito bite the whole week. The entertainment staff worked hard day and night. The night shows are hillarious.The only down side to this resort....English is not wide spoken. Some Spanish helps. Also, there were too many sour-faced people around. You get kind of sick of looking at them. Also, LOTS of families with small children. Be prepared.

<Content>Keep Looking for another hotel Just returned from 15 days at the Ocean Bavaro (7 of it spent feeding the toilet 5 times a day. Should have read the Reviews before booking. The first room I had was a beautiful Spa room but had to move because sliding glass door didn't lock and not enough beds. 2nd Room consistently leaked water all over the floor and the AC didn't cool. 3rd room was nice but sliding glass door didn't lock either. Stayed in the 3rd room for 10 days anyway cause sick of moving. Ordered room service, 1rst time 2 hours late, 2nd time never showed up. Very few people speak english and no one has change for american money. There is one ATM outside the property, gives pesos only. Pools close at 7:00pm so the only night life is a bar, ping pong table and 2 pool tables. Very boring at night. The food was absolutely terrible. I felt bad because they cook alot of food and everything was getting thrown away. It was all Dry and Tasteless. Let's be honest, How can you screw up an omlette? Go to the buffet for dinner so you can find something to get full on. This was a very beautiful resort but the service was terrible (except for Santiago the bartender who never let anyone wait for drinks including the kids). The service here blows. When you are the only one waiting for a drink and the bartenders finish cleaning counters, emptying trash, etc, then 10 minutes later, finally ask you what you need, time to choose another hotel. Don't waste your money here, what food you find edible will be immediately and frequently released in a liquid form, long before digestion occurs. (For a minute there I thought I had struck oil)I actually lost 7 pounds at this all inclusive resort.

<Content>Don't go there! O.K. I WISH I would've read these reviews before I booked this vacation. I just got home last night and am I glad I'm home! On a good note, the hotel is beautifully decorated and clean. On a worse note, it was the worst vacation of my life! I will never return to this hotel or the island for that matter. The staff are not helpful, although you'll find some who are very sweet, but you have to pay them to be that way (isn't it supposed to be inclusive, including tips and gratuity? HA!). My brother had to change rooms 3 times. The second room had an AC that leaked a river of water every day and night and didn't cool the room. The coffee pot was missing, pillows were lumpy, the TV remote was gone, the telephone only works on occasion and when you do get it to work, they hang up on you. I changed extensions 3-4 times to get room service and finally had to call down to guest services and make them place my order. Of course, then it arrived after 1 1/2 hours and was ice cold with a beautifully folded WET napkin. Gross! My mom's been having diarrhea for 3 days with cramping, my two nieces got it, too and now my brother has it. The only reason I didn't get it is because I had bariatric surgery and could only eat 2-3 bites of food per meal (which was TERRIBLE). Although there was one night where the fried vegetables were good and we all ate about 3 pounds of it to get full. If you have any sense at all, do not go to this place. I survived, but I think I just got lucky!More about the hotel: There was an exposed nail coming out of the head of the bed--dangerous?? HELLO! Also, the shower water is only warm when it feels like it (and that's not often). We actually got up every couple hours at night to test the temperature so we could get a shower. The shower smelled like urine, so I'm sure people preferred not to use the toilet, although I'm not sure why? The toilet was the best thing about this place. It flushed and everything! My mother tried to tip the maids into bringing us a couple extra pillows and then ran from her quickly. We thought they were rushing to get them, but then never came back. OK now to the good part! They had an outdoor barbecue while we were there. The rice was good, but we couldn't figure out why they had fried fish heads! Picture it: an entire head hollowed out with teeth and eyes intact, deep fried with the skin on. How the heck do you eat that? And why would you? Go figure!The last entry I will make is this- some of the wait staff at the buffet are really helpful and friendly. My niece, brother and mother all had cramps and diarrhea and she got them a hot tea with herbs to help and it did help, although temporarily. Of course, she also got a $10 tip!Lastly, just don't waste your time!

<Content>IT was AMAZING!!!!! I'm 21 years old and there were 4 of us girls that went!! We arrived on June 5 and had a little trouble getting our rooms together but in the end both were ended up being in block 6 which is the caribbean spa rooms -- very beautiful--. The only thing about this resort is the food... its not bad, but its not the greatest either...it was eatable and i didnt mind. The entertainment was amazing ...the disco... a little small but hopefully they make it bigger... the beach was awesome... the pool was nice, didnt really stay by the pool that much. All in all we met a lot of people from all over... the staff was really nice. As for the people who claimed the staff was trying to sell drugs, thats a load of crap bc we got close with the staff there and they are amazing people, and if they should try and do anything like that, they will be fired, and considering they need money there, i dont think they would try and jeopradize that!!! It was probably the other way around. But anyway. I totally reccommend it. Very fun.

<Content>Had a Great time at the Ocean Bavaro We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from 19 May to 2 June. We really enjoyed ourselves - slightly worried before we went considering the mixed reviews - but we needn't have worried. We have travelled extensively throughout the Caribbean, so this wasn't our one and only experience - but we realise that the Dominican Republic is one of the poorest islands and you have to adjust your expectations accordingly, especially considering the price we paid to go to the DR compared to other islands.We found the staff very friendly and helpful (some more than others but no one was rude and in general they made us extremely welcome). The food was fine - we ate at the a la carte restaurants in the evening - our favourite was the Spanish but they were all good. Breakfast was great - everything you could wish for. Lunch - we mainly ate at the beach restaurant which was grill/buffet - a choice of meat and/or fish and salads etc. We also used the 24 pizza bar - it was fine - not the best pizzas in the world - but perfectly edible and went down well with a cerveza on the beach! The beach - absolutely beautiful! You could walk for miles in either direction - if you can't deal with being mildly hassled by vendors then turn right from the resort down the beach - it is less developed so there are less vendors. The sea was lovely and clear and warm - and I miss it dreadfully! The evening entertainment at the open theatre wasn't to our taste - but then that wasn't important to us - we generally had a late meal, a drink or two in the lobby bar - when there was usually music and a lively atmousphere which we enjoyed. We experienced no problems with beach towels when we were there - always available before about noon. Room towels - one day we only had one left - but when I phoned guest services they sent someone with more within about an hour - and then phoned to make sure I had got them.Our first room was not to my liking (5211) - it was in block 5 with a sea view from the balcony but the room was very dark, the patio door wouldn't lock and it did smell damp (this is mostly from people having the air conditioning set too cold - which causes condensation and seems to be a problem throughout the resort). We asked very nicely for a different room - unfortunately none were available - but they did send someone to repair the patio door that evening (we had arrived around 7pm) so that it locked. The next day we asked again to be moved - and after finding out what was available we asked the cost of upgrading to a better room and were given a honeymoom suite at a cost of US$40 per night. We decided to go for this. The room was absolutely perfect - right on the beach, four poster bed, sunken jacuzzi - heaven! Even better, that evening when I went to thank the man on reception who had organised it for us he told me I was most welcome and that he would not charge us for it. And he didn't. My husband did, of course, tip him. The same man also let us have late check-out for no extra charge. Even if we had had to pay for the room - I would still be writing a good report - the base cost of the holiday was low enough for it not to be a problem.The weather was much better than forecast - it did rain - but only during the first week - and mostly at night rather than daytime. Do not go to the DR though if you cannot handle humidity - it is very humid. We were particularly embarassed at overhearing a family complaining to their rep that they wanted to go home because not enought people speak English, the food was too foreign and the weather was too hot People - do some research - or stay at home if home is what you like best!We loved our holiday - sooo relaxing doing nothing on the beach - but plenty to do if you wanted to. I would definitely go back

<Content>Could have been much much better We have just returned from the Ocean Bavaro in Punta Cana. We went down on the 4th of June via Skyservice. The trip started off a bit rough mainly because the flight time was very early, 6 am, we had an hour stop-over in Puerto Vallarta and therefore the entire trip took approx 7 hrs! When we got to the hotel we had to wait since check-in was at 3 p.m so we left our luggage and went to lunch. The main lunch buffet near reception was good, the food from day to day seemed to be the same and there was very little variety but it was a simple lunch. When travelling to the Caribbean I never expect too much from the food. When got our room in Block 1, even though we requested oceanview. We were told that we could come back the next day to try and arrange that but were given no guarantee. The man working reception offered to upgraded us the spa suites for $20us a person per night. I don't know if that was something everyone was offered or a way for him to make some quick change, it just felt funny. The staff seems to know very little English and I found it hard to communicate. I have visited the Dominican and Cuba many times and this was the first time I have come across this, also I did get the impression that they didnt want to help us at all.The room was nice, nothing special at all. It was really loud, lots of yelling drunk people at night and in the halls and I found the hotel staff not helping keep the noise down for those trying to rest a bit. Overall the entire complex was very loud. Not the place to just sit back and listen to the ocean which was disappointing. We did go on the ATV adventure, paid $110US per couple and it was lots of fun. For something different and fun I do recommend it, the only negative thing is I felt we made a few too many stops to some vendors who were over selling the endless amounts of the something's. The hotel gift shop only sells in Euro currency so I recommend visiting the vendors plaza off the resort grounds by the aquatic center, they are ready to make a deal. I managed to have them drop prices on everything by simply suggesting I would walk away and shop next door. The wanted to sell me a t-shirt for $30 in the end I got it for $10. They will usually drop their original price in half or more. The weather was okay, cloudy but I did walk way with a tan.The biggest set back was us getting sick on the second last day and I suspect that it was from the Italian a la carte restaurant. Don't order the fish!!!! I spent 2 days of my vacation on medication, hiding. Horrible. Speaking to some other visitors, many got sick too. Be very very very careful. I also bit into a hamburger that was completely uncooked. The staff seems more eager to keep the food coming and not paying attention to see if it's ready. The nicest thing about the entire vacation was the beach. Many chairs, white sand, pretty clean waters. Overall a vacation is a chance to get way, it helps when the resort is great, the Ocean Bavaro is a decent complex.

<Content>Best Resort Ever This was my first time going to DR and it was great!! The hotel and the service was great but we did stay in Block 6 which i highly recommend. The food was ok but who cares, once you found something you like stick with it because it will always be threre the next day. The pools we good but the only time i went to the pool is to desalinate myself and to go to the pool bar. The Disco was good but i went to other discos to party as well. If you are a girl planning to get lucky this is the place because there are many hot guys around here. Me and my girlfriends always meet cool guys from all over the world so it was great. We actually became friends with these Italian guys and we are going to stay at their place in the winter time and there coming to Montreal in September so this is a great place to meet people. The Beaches were beautiful and i got a great body tan and when i went topless the people didn't mind and no freaks took pictures either its very relaxed here. I would recommend this resort to any girl from age 18-25 and you're probably see me there next april 2006.Cheers

<Content>Stayed 23rd May - 31st May 2005 Recently stayed at this hotel. Have to say the grounds to this hotel and the beach is absolutely fantastic. Very well kept up to and constantly cleaned. However did find a problem with stomach upsets and mosquito bites, for which they dont seem to accomodate very well for in the local mini market so just as a precaution do take insect repellant and lots of immodium/pepto bismol etc which usually does the trick. They did actually sell this in the shop but was very very expensive. The breakfast buffet is definately the best and we also had very nice meals indead in the Italian and Spanish resturant. We did end up being delayed approx 30 hours in total back to the UK due to a fault of Airtours (mytravel) have to say appauled at this companies lack of communication to their guests. We arrived at the reception all packed to check out to find a note on reception saying wouldnt be picked up that day be picked up the day after!!! no explanation until the rep arrived. Very bad communication. But saying that very nice holiday, very nice location and hotel, we had a carribean spa suite (block 6) so cant comment on the other rooms very nice, lovely white sand, blue sea and very hot weather! be warned the sun is very strong. Hope this helps a little, have a nice holiday.

<Content>Good Points and Bad Points First of all, I would like to very gratefully thank all those who take the time to post reviews as well as Trip Advisor. It really does make a difference to know what you are getting yourself into when you book your trip.With that said, my friend and I stayed at Ocean Bavaro from May 15 - 22, and there are both good and bad things to be said.First the bad: I don't know about all the rooms, but the rooms in block 4 are very very musty - so much so that my friend was throwing up the first day because of it. We stayed in that room for the first 2 nights, but had to move or else we would have rather gone home. In that first room, I killed 2 cockroaches, and the ceiling was leaking in the bathroom constantly. We had to use our towels to mop up the floor. Both of us didn't really like the meat at the resort (yes I know it's a different country, I'm not complaining, just saying we didn't like it). We mostly ate pizza and rice all week. As well, just in case you didn't know, Punta Cana is crazy humid - sticky skin humid. I like the heat, but I have been told that Mexico is not as humid, so guess where my next trip will be. A warning to women, the vendors are very agressive here - my friend and I had a couple of iffy experiences with them. One of them wanted us to go in some dark back room with him, and another wanted to show me how Mamajuana worked (a Dominican aphrodisiac). They just latch on to you and block your way so you can't walk any further. It would have been nice to have our husbands there.Now the good part. We decided to pay extra ($40 U.S. per night) and upgrade to an ocean view room (actually it was the honeymoon suite). It was like heaven. The room was all white with a king size bed (after the first room, we didn't care that we had to sleep in the same bed) and a jacuzzi. There was no smell and more importantly, no cockroaches. The best part of the whole trip though, was the beach. The water is perfect. The sand is perfect. The beach was worth any hardship we had in the first couple of days.Something that I wish someone would have told me: you can get a sunburn even when it is raining. On the first day I went swimming even though it was raining and I got so badly burnt that I couldn't lift my arms the next day and I had to wear a t-shirt for the next few days so I wouldn't get more burnt. I guess the Carribean sun is stronger than I imagined.We also went on a tour called the Marinarium. It was the best day of the trip - we went swimming with sharks in the ocean, then they took us for a ride to an undeveloped beach where we went swimming and they have a small floating bar.So to sum up, it is a small beautiful resort, but with musty rooms. There is a lot of food to choose from, and they have stations of chefs preparing the food in front of you. Breakfast was the best meal of the day. I don't think I would return to Punta Cana because of the humidity, and if I did, I would pay the extra money to get a nice room. Have fun!

<Content>I will return to DR but I won't stay here. My Aunt and I stayed at Ocean Bavaro from May 21-28, and there were problems from the moment that we arrived. After a scary night ride through the country-side of Punta Cana (rules of the road don't seem to be respected there at all) to the resort, we arrived hot and sweaty after a 4 hour plane ride. Immediately, we were ushered into the lobby area and stood in front of the Guest Relations desk awaiting our turn to check-in. A waitress came over with a refreshing fruit drink while we waited (a very nice gesture), and soon there after we were given our room.We made our way to the 92 Villas and opened the door to a Tropical Junior Suite. Now while the room was very nice (despite the smell of mildew) there was a major problem: that room only has one bed! Making our way back to the reception area, we informed the desk clerk that we needed another room with two beds. She didn't seem to understand that two women (and relatives no less) did not want to share the same bed for a 7-day vacation. We waited for a few minutes and then were handed over to one of the bellhops, who loaded our luggage onto a golf cart as well as ourselves, and taken to another room way at the back of the resort. (We carted our bags to the first room ourselves). As soon as we opened the door to this room we were assaulted with the strong smell of mildew and saw the misquitos lining up for attack. The furniture was falling apart and the bedspread on one of the double beds was stained. This was completely unacceptable. We called reception once again and informed them that we couldn't accept this room either. The said that the room next door was available and they would send someone over to open it for us. This room proved not to be any better. So another trip back to wait for another room. No one could appreciate why we could not accept those rooms. Against better judgement, we decided to just take the Tropical Junior Suite room that we initially had and asked for a roll-out bed that never came. My Aunt and I shared a bed for the 7-days that stayed at Ocean Bavaro. Unacceptable.The spa services offered at the resort aren't great and highly overpriced for what you end up getting. The food at the resort is okay. My advice would be to just stick to the buffet but wear a lot of bug repellant as the misquitos and other critters are always on the attack. Avoid the Mexcian restaurant at all costs. I went there one night and ordered what I thought would be a seafood dish but received a tortilla shell with a couple of prawns and cut up hotdogs sitting on a bed of Spanish rice. It was so horrible that we walked out and headed for the buffet. If you arrive at the resort late night, please be advised that none of the restaurants or is the buffet open. You'll have either have to go to bed hungry or go the the little bar that's by one of the pools where they serve either pizza with a corn topping or with a hotdog topping. Completely disgusting.Definitely take some of the tours that are offered through the vacation reps there. They are a little pricey but you'll have a good time. Punta Cana is actually extremely beautiful as are it's people.I just want to close by saying that I read the reviews here before taking this trip, the good and the bad, but I've always said that one must experience things for themselves and judgement should be reserved. The people who have gone to Ocean Bavaro and were unsatisfied were completely justified in the things that they wrote. I am not one to go on vacation and expect the same things that I am accustomed to back at home, especially not in a foreign country, but certain things should be universal, i.e, cleanliness and professionalism, and these are two things lacking at Ocean Bavaro.The one thing that I am most pleased about is that this did not taint my view of the Dominican Republic in any way. The country is beautiful and I will vacation there again someday. Ocean Bavaro just won't be on the receiving end of my business ever again.

<Content>20% OK.....80% Terrible For starters..I wasn't aware of the go and get a crappy room then complain till your head explodes to get a better room plan. This was about my 24th resort to visit in the Caribbean. When we arrived..party of 4...3 rooms. They were all terrible. After they moved us 3 times my girlfriend ended up in a room that was clean..nice king size bed..TV...and that was it...no other furniture. It was better than the room with water pouring thru the ceiling and bowing about to collapse. Then there was the crackhead room but another story...burns everywhere..I mean everywhere. I am not angry..so read on. Both of my other friends had to change rooms twice and only one got one that was actually nice. Seems they keep a few very nice rooms for emergencys or someone screaming. This is a novel thought..how about keeping all the rooms up beyond ghetto status? Even rats for added affect. Enough about the rooms. Shy for 2 of the staff members, whom were wonderfull..a bellcap..one with the safari hat and a front desk guy, the rest would not give you the time of day. Seemed to have been an American thing, so sorry where we came from. The beach and grounds were magnificent. Simply beautiful. My hats off to the groundskeepers. Job well done guys. One of the most beautiful beaches I have seen. Had beach towels more than not..re some other reviews but I am an early riser. Always had chairs..Ok..that was the 20%.Food was mediocre to poor...hey..buy some herbs and spices and try cooking things all the way..hmmm..coincidence...sickness...raw food..maybe. Most food was not cooked nearly all the way...runny eggs...raw meat, and I like my steaks rare.Wrap-up here...I have learned over the years to not let anything ruin my vacation...anything shy of death because it only comes once a year for me so I make the best of it. I am a beach guy so I hang out there and it is very beautiful. But I will never return there. Even if they payed me. Well depending on how much..happy travels.

<Content>Great time again with two exceptions- read for tips We returned for a long weekend stay at the Ocean Bavaro Resort. We stayed there two years ago 9day/8 night and loved it so much that even with a choice of a newer, money comparable resort we decided to come back to the newly named facility(used to be called H10 Bavaro Beach) since we were familiar with the grounds/routines.First of all we have learned from many trips to the Carribean that you must relax and learn to be patient. This is not the US where things are rushed. It is just a different type of lifestyle that you must follow or you will not ever be happy. Relax and take your time because the staff/service will NOT respond if you seem testy or rushed. Know that upfront. It has taken us a few trips there to realize that, but once you do you will suddenly be well-received and get what you ask for.USA 3000 was a very nice airline and our plane seemed brand new. Very professional service and no surprises or problems. Better than other airlines I have flown around the world in.Our room was in Block 5 and had a beautiful ocean view even from the side.They said third floor, but there were only two easy levels of stairs to walk up. We could tell there was an immediate smell of must/mold when we entered the room. It is understandable that in a humid location that a steamy or musty indoor area is possible, but the smell was borderline overwhelming. Because we were aware that there would be trouble with changing rooms at that time of night, and we were excited and wanted to begin our night with fun vs. a complaint, we decided to open the doors, turn down the airconditioning (which would lessen the recycling of moldy smell) and unpack to get ready to party. There was a fruit basket in the room and there are complimentary cokes/dietcokes/sprites/water bottles in the room that we found out were for sure no charge. Refilled daily. There were large blue beach towels already rolled up in our room for us to have right away to bring down to our beach chairs in the morning. (those were in addition to the cards we received upon check in to take to receive two more towels) We arrived at night (about 7:45 pm) so we were ready to check out the poolbar that we loved from our previous trip, and get some pizza at the 24 hr. eatery. When you leave your door open at night, mosquitos will go in and bite you ast night. We had a few on our ankles by the end of the trip but it was no big deal.Tips- WATER- Don't drink any water unless it comes out of the provided bottled water dispensers, and don't eat any foods that appear could have been washed in unfiltered/unpurified water. Even though they tell you that they wash food items in purified water and that the ice is purified- be careful. I would agree that the ice was purified (all the mixed drinks have it, and lots of people drink these all day) I am not totally sure that they rinse fruits etc. in purified water. (Think about it- do you really think that they clean every single thing from fruits to preperation bowls in purified water? I doubt it) Don't rinse your mouth and forget and take a sip of the water out of your room sink when you brush your teeth. Make sure you have a bottled water right at the sink so you can rinse your toothbrush and mouth out easily. (Nice to have it right there for when you are in stumble-home-from-the-bar mode) Taking those precautions and being aware of what is/isn't rinsed in purified water has been smart because we have never been sick to the stomach. Keep hydrated.Tips- STAFF- Relax, you are on Carribean time. There is no difference in the staff treatment here or with any other Carribean resort- it is up to you and how you behave that will tell the kind of service you will get. Fake being nice if you have to, but there is ZERO responsiveness from the staff to hasty or rushed attitudes. We see alot of people get so upset but they just need to relax and they will get taken care of if they are calm. Those who we watched being strong/upset/rushed/demanding DOES NOT work to get what you want- they'll ignore you. Don't waste your time or energy that way b/c you won't win. This isn't home- accept it. Rooms were well cleaned and fresh towels put in each day. They changed bedspreads too and put a fresh hibiscus on our beds each day. Animation team very excited and friendly. Beach music was enjoyable and guests looked like they ahd a blast doing aerobics and dancing.Tips- BEACH- Sun is VERY intense, we wore SPF 15 and 30 the whole time. We tan easy and had a tan when we arrived, but the sun was so strong you could boil out there without high SPF. The majority of the people were burnt and red like lobsters and they looked like they were in pain. You will get tan even thru high SPF so don't ruin your trip w/ Oils or low SPF lotions. We also recommend bringing a small beach towel to prop your head up with for extra comfort. Since we stay on the beach for 9 hours ususally w/ breaks only for lunch, we tend to know what makes the day enjoyable. Also, we wished we brought-or next time we'd buy-a snorkeling mask/snorkel and/or a raft to enjoy looking at the beautiful fish that were plentiful in the water right in front of us. We could see them without masks but it would be way better with. The ocean was very warm and there are virtually NO waves. The water is very salty so you float so easily. Clear to the bottom no matter how far you swim out. BREATHTAKING. We spent a lot of time swimming around out there.Tips- FOOD- It's true that you will need to adjust to the type of food but the people who want to complain or be picky about food types away from their country shouldn't leave home and go to another country. Stay home if you think that you are going to get what you want all the time food-wise. That goes for here or any other location around the world. Make-do with the choices. Out of ALL the variety you will find things that you'll enjoy. Make it work. We have figured out the places/foods that worked for us- Eggwhite omlettes/chicken+veggies/toast for breakfast at main buffet. Burgers/pizza/meats/frenchfries/icecream at beach buffet for lunch, Pizza or whatever for dinner b/c we really never left the upper deck of the poolbar in the evening. There were a few rats spotted around the outside of the Main buffet area late at night by other travelers that we met. We didn't see any. There's an all night 24 hr place that you can order burgers and selection of pizza from. Very good for those who don't make it to actual dinner restaurants on-time. Nobody we talked to was crazy about the restaurant foods that they made reservations for, and we weren't either on our past trip, so we never went. Oh yeah- don't get into the actual swim up part of the poolbar unless you are comfortable with sitting in pee-water b/c noone gets up to use the bathroom. We remembered that from our last trip, and watched that people never leave for hours this time (yikes). Santiago is a great bartender, get him on your goodside and you will never have to ask for a drink again- he'll keep them coming- even if there is a crowd.Tips- GUESTS- be prepared to be stared down intensley by vacationers there. Not sure what country they are from but there is a lot of them. Dead stares, I really mean piercing stares, with no smiles no matter how much you would try to smile at them. Just know that and do not be surprised. Don't be offended, not everyone in the world is openly friendly. Keep smiling or wave at them....thats always fun. Lots of topless women and tiny speedos on all types of body styles, and that again should not be a surprise. It didn't effect us at all.....realize that it is normal in many, many parts of the world and was not a shocker. Of all the women guests they were probably 35% topless. Tips- COMPLIMENTARY ROOM- Careful when you get a complimentary room if you have a late flight out of the D.R., they may give you a really bad room (no towels, never been cleaned, open ceilings) to take a shower and/or change in so be prepared that you may need to take multiple trips back to the front desk, but remain calm or you'll never get a room.Will return to Bavaro Beach but next time we will check out a newer resort b/c the moldy smell in the room at night was hard to breath through. I think that it has to do with the resort rooms being in older structurally even if topically the place was modernized and well-taken casre of. Mold in the walls vents would take a drastic reconstruction. We had a short stay so we dealt with the moldy air smell, but if it was an 8 day trip we wouldn't have survived that room. Other than that the place is AMAZING. So my advice is- if you enter the room the first time and sense a more than just humidity smell, or later on that day when you return from the beach and you seem to smell mold, try to change the room. I do not have allergies and I was so very sensitive to the mold, which means it must have been pretty intense. I could actually distinguish two types of mold smell coming out of the vents. I could feel it in my eyes. I wrapped a t-shirt around my pillow incase that was another source where it was coming from. Everything else was beautiful. Again, you get what you pay for.

<Content>never again This past April was my third trip to the Dominican--it was also my worst due mostly to the staff of this resort. I feel that I am a pretty easy person to please. I worked in the service industry for 10 years as a waitress and own a hotel, 2 restaurants, a bar and a B  B. I realize that dealing with people can be very demanding but for the entire week we stayed at this resort, I can probably count on one hand the number of employees that even gave us a smile.Upon checkin, we were directed to the wrong room. My card worked to a room that was occupied and a very embarassing situation ensued. My room was actually next door but my key was able to open both doors.My friends and I were unable to get beach towels the entire week. Every morning we would trek to the hut on the beach, present our cards only to be told that the towels were all gone--come back later; by the third day it started to become a little comical.I was attending a wedding and so was there with a group of sixty two. I must say that the two people in charge of wedding arrangements for the resort were very nice and accommodating.Everyone except for six of us spent at least two days in their hotel room sick and two of our group spent two days in hospital. The food seemed to make everyone ill--it really wasn't good. I ate rice, beans, french fries and pineapple for the entire week and managed to escape sickness. The Mexican Restaurant was the best food the resort had to offer. Make sure you bring your own Imodium--it can't be purchased on the resort in pill form--they'll offer a shot at the cost of $110.00 U.S.One of our group brought school supplies, candy and other gift items for the housekeeping staff--as she was leaving her room to check out, she brought her bag of goodies over to the ladies--they pushed the bag back towards her, shaking their heads and rubbing their thumbs and fingers together signaling that they wanted money instead. I thought that was the most insulting things I had ever heard.I enjoyed the beach . . . the pools were clean . . . the rooms were musty smelling and the food awful--only surpassed by the rudeness of the staff.Never again . . .

<Content>Trip of a Lifetime!!!! We are 2 girls from Halifax, Nova Scotia, both of us are 25 years old. I just have to say that this was the most amazing trip of a lifetime. We had the most perfect weather - not even a drop of rain fell on us! Your trip is what you make it, so if you go there with a positive attitude that you're going to have fun, then you will!Checkin: We arrived around 12:30pm to checkin and were told that our rooms wouldn't be ready until 3pm. We were okay with that and had to leave our luggage in the lobby with someone watching it. No problem, we took our valuables with us (cd player, camera, jewellery, money etc) and left our clothes behind. Nothing was touched while we were gone. So we took our things, changed into bathing suits and hit the beach. Went swimming, but didn't have towels. No problem as it's extremely hot and you dry off in minutes. You can't get a towel until you get a towel card, but can't get a towel card until you check in. We spent the next few hours on the resort - got a snack at the buffet and went back to the lobby to checkin. Our rooms weren't ready at 3, but after we waited about 15 minutes, they came along with our room keys and towel cards. We got to our room (block 100) and walked in - one single bed in a tiny room. We decided to ask for a different room as we were paying enough money we didn't think we should have to share a double bed for a week. No problem...went back to the lobby a few hours later (long line when we left) and had no problem being upgraded to a better room. We moved to a room in the 7000 building. It was twice the size, twice as nice and had 2 double beds. If you're not happy with your first room, just ask for a switch!! Towels: After checkin - we tried to get some towels, but they told us they were all out. I recommend you bring your own towel from home and some face cloths. They were both hard to come by. No face cloths all week (only hand towels and regular bath towels). I had packed 2 face cloths before I left, so were set. We couldn't get our towels until lunch time the next day b/c they were all out again in the morning. After that, we were fine and had a towel all week. Safe: The safe key is at the reception desk - they charge you $40US for the week, but when you return your key/lock and paper (DONT FORGET THIS AND DONT THROW IT OUT - YOU NEED IT) you get $20US back. So it only costs you $20 for the week. We kept all our jewellery and cameras/money in the safe. No problems there. Balcony: Our room was directly behind the theatre, on the first floor. There are huge hedges all along the ground level (probably to keep people from climbing up on the balcony's. We left our white beach pants on the balcony ALL week, and on the second last night someone stole 2 pairs of white pants off our balcony. We were not impressed, but figured it was some drunken fool. This happened sometime during the night. Only things on one side of our balcony got stolen. We had them hanging out to unwrinkle for the entire week. Unlucky that the second last night they were stolen. There was a bit of a space in the hedge where someone could steal them. That was our bummer, but probably our own fault! :(Buffet: The buffet had a great selection of food, but we found it didn't have a lot of flavour. I've been to Dominican 4 times (3 in Punta Cana) and the food was better at other resorts, but this food was okay. Not as much a selection as other resorts. Pools: The pools were a lot of fun. The swim up bar was always a good laugh and for the most part wasn't too busy. I found it got busy around mid afternoon. Great drinks! Lots of liquor with your drink! The pools were cleaned each night. Beach: Always lots going on!! There are busy spots and quiet spots depending on where you get your hut. By the beach club/animation team booth the chairs were usually taken, but farther down the beach in each direction would be much quieter. We enjoyed the music and events so we always hung out by the beach club. Whistle Man: There was a guy dressed up everyday in a different costume promoting the spa and other things on the resort. He can whistle with his tongue/teeth quite loudly that you can hear him around the resort. Most of the time it's not that noticeable, but sometimes it was quite piercing. I found you could hear it more when you were on the beach near the Bahia restaurant. Animation team: They are awesome! They always have stuff going on. Beach Olympics were a hoot, water aerobics were awesome, crazy games were fun, mini putt, dance lessons, frisbee - everything was fun if you want to keep busy. They were very friendly and always tried to get people to come and participate. You don't have to if you don't want to. They are also the guys in the nightly shows, and they attend the disco every night. We were talking to a few of them and they work 9:30am to 12:30am (yes 15 hours) and only get 3 days off every two weeks. Much different from most of us in Canada who usually work our 40 hour work weeks. They are always smiling though! Bars: There were many bars on the resort - one was the beach bar which was really fun, although we didn't go there a whole lot. The lobby bar was always open for drinks with friendly bartenders. Our favourite was the other side of the swim up bar. The bartender that worked every night we were there was awesome! He was always smiling and singing and made us great drinks. Our favourite was sex on the beach but if we ordered it he would correct us and say Noooo! It's sex on the bar!!. The drink was sweet, but delicious! This bar was also always packed with people. There are tables beside it to chill at while having some drinks. Nightly Shows: These shows are great! The theatre was packed every single night. They have a kids show around 8:30pm each night. After the kids show, the animation team usually puts on spanish music at the theatre and they dance with people from the audience. Not to worry - they lead you along (even if you're a rookie). The nightly shows were different every night, sometimes a comedy/variety show, sometimes audience participation and sometimes they would bring in professional dancers from Santo Domingo. Regardless, they're worth seeing. Keep in mind that most of the time it's the animation team in the shows so they're not real actors. You'll still get a good laugh out of it! The bar is close by to keep you going! Get up after the show and learn the club dance on stage...they do it nightly. Lobby Entertainment: The lobby seemed to be a good place to hang out and listen to spanish music. Always crowded at night. Bar is open pretty late to keep your drinks full!Disco: The disco was never crowded...this resort isnt' a huge party resort, but we managed to party for 7 nights straight, so your trip is definitley what you make it!! They play all kinds of different music so you're bound to hear songs that you know and like. There were a lot of workers that went to the disco, so at 12:30 when they're off, the disco seemed to clear out. It was still an awesome time, the bar is well stocked and drinks are included. Discotheque Tour: They announced a few nights at the evening shows that on Wednesdays they do a disco tour. We were very skeptical about this, but ended up going after we had asked around about it. The animation team organizes this tour and walks around the resort on Wednesday to get people to sign up. The disco on the resort is closed (or so we were told) so they get busses and bus everyone to another resort to a better disco. The tour costs $10US. The bus leaves right after the nightly show at 11 and returns at the end of the night (around 2). It was really fun, definitely safe, and the new disco we went to was defintiely better. It was really big, and packed. Drinks do cost at this disco, so make sure you drink lots before you leave the resort! The drive is only about 10 minutes. Beach Party: WOW! What an amazing night!! They set up wooden boards on the beach by the beach club, props etc and hold the nightly show on the beach. Get there early as there are very few seats. They also set up a bar on the beach with all the regular drinks. Flashy lights and great music. The show is great - when we were there the theme was Christopher Columbus and the discovery of America. They use the ocean and boats to bring him in. Costumes are great. After the show they turn it into the disco and light a huge bonfire. Unfortunatley the night we were there, it was incredibly windy, so the bonfire cleared out the dance floor for about 15 minutes. No problem - time to refill the drinks! The beach party was a lot of fun - but did clear out by 1am. Overall - this resort was a blast, but your trip is what you make it. We didn't have any problems other than our small room at checkin and the towel incident on the first day. It's really hot so wear lots of sunscreen and drink tons of water. Have a great time. I recommend this resort!!! Can't let little things ruin a vacation (like towels). Who needs a towel when the weather is HOT and SUNNY??? How can you have a rotten time in the DR?? It's what you make it! Enjoy!!

<Content>Ola Signor! This year it was our 5th trip to the Dominican Republic, you can say we are fans! However, first time at Punta Cana, beaches and ocean are much better than in Puerto Plata. The hotel and gardens were beautifull and well kept! Food was great and plenty to choose from, those who complain; I wonder what they eat at home?Atmosphere was great and relaxed. Lots of different nationalities; Canadian, American, Italien, French, Belges and some Dutch (like us), but why do the Americans always have to be so loud...?Families, old and young, couples and singles, they're all there.Anyway, we had a wonderfull time and met some nice people. We are definitely coming back to this hotel next year!Hasta la vista!Marlene  Manon

Sorry for my english but i麓ll try to explain the better i can: we were on Ocean B谩varo in our honeymoon and we just loved it.We bought one standard room in our travel agency but when we arrive we said that we have just married and they gave us one honeymoon suite. It was big, had a jacuzi in the bed and our view from the window was absolutely wonderfull... the room was cleaned every day, we had new toals in the bathroom and a lot of water in the freeze.Concerning food: the buffet is really good: it have all types of food and every day new things are doing in front of us, the fruits are always fresh and the deserts are very good.We just went to the brasilian restaurant but we think that we eat better in buffet because we dont like those kind of meat they serve there.. The breakfast were espectacular, we miss it a lot...The mades are always dancing and singing in rooms, restaurants, in the gardens of the resort...they are very friendly...We don麓t saw any kind of flys or other animals in the hotel (only ducks and flamingos in the lake), My skin is very white and here in Portugal when i go to the country the moskitos always come near me and almost eat me alive but i don麓t have any problem there.The beach was clean every day in the morning.We just loved it.

<Content>Ocean Bavaro Well it's been 3 weeks since we got back from the Ocean Bavaro and I am finally coming out of my post-vacation depression. I must admit, I was starting to get a bit afraid when I read some of the reviews but we have no regrets choosing the Ocean Bavaro. We stayed there April 9 - 16.We had a fabulous time, if I don't cover your question, just ask.Checking in: huge line up, but we managed to get a couple of drinks to keep us going. Staff was very rushed, but friendly considering the mob at the reception desk Rooms: We were in Block 100 which wasn't ideal, since you really cannot get any farther away from the beach. Our room was on the third floor, we had a view of the gardens to the right. It was very clean, and we were left 2 bottles of rum when we arrived which was a nice start to the night. Bath towels seemed to be scarce but once we called down to reception they were brought right up.The Grounds: in a word, beautiful. The staff were continuously walking around keeping the areas clean, the flowers were gorgeous, the flamingo area very pretty.The Weather: HOT! but I'm not complaining. We had rain one afternoon for about 1/2 an hour. A bit of clouds each day but nothing worth complaining about.The Beach: once again, beautiful. a little busy near the beach bar but a little further down you can find privacy. The water was warm and clear.The Pool: A little hard to get a spot in the shade towards the afternoon. I found that a lot of people were putting their towels down in the morning and taking off for the day. My solution was to move their towels into the sun and take a seat. No confrontations and we got a break from the sun.The Restaurants: The buffet was ok, your typical all inclusive buffet. A variety of choice for even the pickiest of eaters. We ate at 2 a la cartes, the Mexican which was great, and the Italian. Both had a great atmosphere.Night Life: Not the greatest. The lobby has entertainment which was pretty good, but if you dont' get in there early you have to stand. We tried the disco twice, and both times were dead, unless the action started after we left (midnight). The pool bar is the place to be at night, it was pretty busy.On the Friday night there was supposed to be a Dominican Beach Party, but as we all headed down to the beach a fuse was blown and the party was over. We just headed back to the pool bar - no biggy.Shopping: Once a week they allow vendors to come onto the resort where you can do some bargaining. This was the only shopping we did, they had cool necklaces, and art. and of course Rum!Helpful tips: bring a thermal mug - we had been told to bring one and didn't, we were kicking ourselves! next time for sure. Also, washcloths, apparently they are hard to come by. Pool Towels - if you trade in for a new one, get there early or you will be out of luck. Or bring your own towels. $1 bills, easy tipping.We would definitely go back to this resort. Hope this helps!

<Content>Fantastic time had by both of us! Just come back from this resort only a couple of days ago. What can I say, I did have concerns after reading some reviews prior to leaving. I honestly can say I cannot complain about a thing.Our room was fantastic, we had one of the Carribean Spa Rooms and it was spotless, jacuzzi bath, his and hers sinks, 6ft bed and stairs leading down to a seating area with fridge and television etc.We saw the maid on our first day, and we actually tipped her at the start of our holiday and to be honest with you we wanted for nothing during our stay. I know we would have had it cleaned daily anyway without any problem but I am sure the tip helped!!The staff were wonderful, very very friendly, nothing too much trouble. There is not a lot to do on an evening, but to be honest with you being a couple who went to the Dominican for a very peaceful and relaxing time, it did not bother us at all.The weather was fantastic, so do not be too bothered about reading any internet weather projections. Our projection was for rain, rain and more rain but we could not stay on the beach after 2 p.m. it was so hot!!!!Give this resort a try. You won't be sorry. The food was very good, we mainly ate at the buffet restaurant and they did really try to please everybody. I am more adventurous foodwise than my husband but you could always find something suitable.10/10 for the beach buffet at lunchtime. You did not even have to leave the beach and go inside. Plenty of picnic tables directly on the beach and a wonderful selection.Here's hoping you book it and have a wonderful time.

<Content>Stressful vacation We stay at Ocean Bavaro 4/11-4/25 2005. This is the first resort in last ten years of all-inclusive that we didn't like. When we arrived, we were given free upgrade to bldg#6. I was ecstatic. The first thing I saw was very little bugs crawling from under the sink and we were attacked by mosquitoes right away, then the horrible sewer smell coming from the drain opening in the floor. I sprayed some colon and I had to do it every day just to cover this nauseated smell. We had big balcony that was unusable. Right in the front was a garage where they were pouring gasoline into containers every day and smell was coming into the room even with doors closed, next to a garage was a junk yard where wild dogswere searching for food. When you cometo the restaurant you have clean the dirty table, find utensils, get your own drinks, one day no plates, next no glasses, next no coffee cups. Came for breakfast, no orange juice, asked, OK five minutes, so you wait, wafles, you wait... One salt shaker for each five tables, people running around grubbing what they can from othr tables. Problem to get beach towels. When you look at the buildings in the afternoon, every balcony have towels hanging drying, very ugly.After dinner we were seating by the swimming pool, huge rats start running around, we had to sit with our legs up the chair. Hot water, bath towels only some days. The 24 hours snack bar is a jike, dirty,horrible pizza, cold hot dog, nasty server. When it rained our room got flooded, I called at 3 AM and ask for some towels for the floor, OK five minutes, nobody came, we had to be careful not to fall on the paddles. I didn't believe negative revews, thinking it's just picky, demending people. now I know better. i would never go back, even I was happy with food and the beach.

<Content>great place to relax and have fun It was the first we went to Dominican Republic, we had a great time. The hotel is ok not to much but very family style. The food was good, we specially liked the italian and the spanish restaurant. Contrary of what we read on this place, we never have any problems being served. Everybody smiled and at the end of the 15 days we were part of their families. They speak well in french and english, but they are happy if we try to speak spanish, please people who complains at least try. If you travel you have to understand that you are not at home. It different. If you find that there is to much kid, go to place for adult only and if you are shock with the way people dress or undress, stay at home in your US the only place in the world where people are upset to see breast. I'm sorry I'm so upset to see people thinking that they go somewhere and want to be liked home.For the hotel, it was very clean. The animation team were great and they want you to have fun.

<Content>Worst Service, horrible rooms, Rats crawling up the wall Food was a lot better than I expected, especially at the Italian restaurant. Resort itself was really nice, Huge, with plenty of room to sprawl out by their beautiful pool.Although the food was good, the service was the worst I had ever experienced. We went 3 nights in a row without ever being served a glass of water, even after asking several waiters. Seems like no one was willing to serve us, be it at the front desk, the restaurant, the bar, the baggage handlers. I usually start my week off leaving some decent tips at the bars I spend most of my time at thinking that it would land me a bit of extra service, maybe even the occasional smile... That wasn't the case here... By the end of the week, I just stopped tipping since I had to fight for a drink.The room had mold covering the ceiling. I didn't ask for a change of room only because I knew I would only be there to sleep.The club is tiny; it won鈥檛 fit more than 100. To top off my club experience, there were two rats that we saw crawling up a pipe, lucky the bartender had the official rat pole that he used to spear them and throw them in the garbage... Needless to say, I never went back.Entertainment was typical resort entertainment. We were a group of 5 (myself 25 and my boyfriend 20 with his little sister 15 and parents 40's) while the parents would head back to check out the show every night, the rest of us would head to a bar, or back to the room to kick back and watch the mold grow.A bonus is that there is always a fresh supply of Pepsi, 7up and water in the room鈥檚 fridge. We would usually buy a bottle of rum (don鈥檛 pay more than $7 or $8 US a bottle for the best rums out there, most vendors will offer it to you at $12 and bargain you down from there. With a good bottled Pepsi on hand I found the best drinks were those I mixed up myself in the hotel room. *note on the soft drinks, my boyfriend found that the 7-up tasted a bit off it was only then that I noticed the 7-up bottles still had pictured of their ancient mascot Fido Di Do... remember that triangle headed character from the late 90's??? We drank it anyways, just topped it off with some rum*A note on buying from the shops out in Punta Cana. We went out there looking to bring back 10 bottles of rum, two cartons of cigarettes, a painting, sunglasses and a necklace. The sunglasses and necklace were offered to us at $35 US each; we got them down to $8 each. The rum started at $12 a bottle, we got them down to $6, painting was $40 and we got them down to $10 and the smokes we got for $20 a carton. Be prepared to bargain like you've never bargained before, they are very aggressive and pushy, but if you tell them you have a better price, they will stop you once you start walking away and offer you a better price. There are tons of shops selling exactly the same thing, so get them bidding against each other.All in all, not an impressive stay. Despite the impressive food (still need to bring Imodium) the horrible service, dirty rooms, and poor beaches have made me never want to go back, I would not suggest this resort to anyone.Oh yeah, a note on the beaches... you are only allowed to swim out to the booies about 30 meters out, if you try to swim past them, you risk being hit in the head by one of the boats speeding by. Seriously, the boat traffic was non stop, and way too close to the shore.

<Content>great time!! my family and I stayed at the ocean bavaro spa and beach resort from march 25th-April 3rd. We all had a really great time. I would say when we first got to the resort it took us about a day or so to get familiar and comfortable with everything, as this is a very large resort. bigger than we are used to staying at, as we stayed at the LTI last year and this was a much smaller place.The grounds: grounds were BEAUTIFUL. if you are looking for a glimpse of paradise...this is it ladies and gentlemen. palm trees galore, flowers everywhere, grass is always green. and it is so beautifully lit up at night. near the little gazebo and fountain. also very cute how they have flamingos and ducks in the pond. overall the grounds are really something...alot nicer than most resorts we visited. staff: the staff was very friendly. the animation team was great! they always made sure that you were having a good time, and tried their best to get everyone involved. i would suggest trying out the dancing lessons. really a fun time! they usually had..bachata, merengue and salsa..and they would make you do it alone and then make up partners and dance with a partner. The waiters in the buffet werent as good with serving the people eating outside as they were with the people inside..i guess because inside is closer to everything so they have first priority...but if you want to sit outside then i dont think that getting up to get your own water is a big deal if you dont want to wait a few extra minutes.rooms: our room was very nice. no problems whatsoever. nice size, very clean. although our view wasnt the greatest (resort entrance) i didnt really care. i mean common people. do you go to the dominican republic to sit in your room all day?? no! so really. complaining about small things in your room is really unnecessary. entertainment: the night entertainment was really alot of fun! we went everynight, the shows start at 10pm and usually run about...an hour or so. maybe a little longer if they have people from dominican coming in..such as magicians...dance groups etc. they were all very entertaining. of course they have the mini disco for kids at about 8 oclock..where the children go up with the mini club organizer, and they sing and dance to children songs. after that at 9:00...they have merengue in the theatre and the animators usually ask some ladies to dance up on stage..or in front of the stage and they have colored lights and music and the whole bit. really fun...gives you the island feel. then at 9:30 they have the audience participate in some entertaining game where they usually humiliate themselves..but all in good fun! its a good time i promise!all in all...we had a fantastic time here at the ocean bavaro spa and beach resort. we would definetly return to the dominican republic..and possibly come back to this resort. I think that many people go to these places with smug attitudes and dont realize that we are in..A DIFFERENT COUNTRY. the people really try their best to make your vacation memorable and make you guys have a good time. so you guys are on vacation just make the best of it! if you go into it with a good attitude, theres no doubt in my mind that you will all have an excellent vacation. WONDERFUL RESORT!!

<Content>loved this resort Just got back from ocean bavaro yesterday.We booked the carabean spa suite in block six and were given thehoney moon suite which was fantastic. It was on the third floor facingthe ocean.The beach is amazing. The water was very warm in the 80s.The resort was very clean and the service was pretty good. But probably having the vip helps.The buffet food was very good. The coffee is excellent. We did havetrouble in the beginning to get served utencils and coffee but a little patience and politeness helps.We werent to crazy with the ala carts and only went to two of them.We enjoyed the buffet better.We werent ready for such an intense sun, my husband and friend whonever burn and peel did so on this trip. You really do need to be prepared for the heat and drink lots of water.There is a small coral reef right in front of the hotel. I snorkelled thereand saw some nice fish. We enjoyed the vendors and gave them canadian pins and towels theyreally like that kind of thing.We tipped the housekeeping and bartenders and the guy who bringsbeer to your room.We love punta cana and will definitely go again but probably not tothe same resort. One week is just not enough because there is somuch that goes on, never a boring moment.I have never seen poverty like this before so I think what you can givethese people is very much appreciated.

<Content>Not as good as i had hoped... We just returned from 5 days at the Ocean Bavaro. We arrived at the airport (which is very beautiful) around 3pm and was off to our hotel. The airport was very confusing! When you go inside, you need to fill out the tourist card, pay the 10$ and show your passport, then you go to baggage claim and then off to your bus. Luckily we we were the first stop and arrived within 25 mins or so. I was very surprised to see a Burger King en route to the hotel. We asked for block 6 and received it. We were two girls and they gave us a room with one bed. Tried a few times to change it and then decided it wasnt worth wasting more time at the front desk to switch the room. The room was the only place i saw Mosquitos. They seemed to love the bathroom. The smell of the room was nasty. I felt it was almost unhealthy to injest this moldy smell. You couldnt leave the door open to the balcony (no screen) or bugs/mosquitos would get in. We had a nice view of construction and if you looked all the way down to the left you could see a tiny piece of the ocean. We did have a nice maid who would leave us a flower on our bed, and keep our fridge stocked with water and soda. Their was a coffee pot (no filter) and they sent up a fruit basket and 2 bottles of rum. The lobby was really impressive, as was the entire resort. The beach was the prettiest i have ever seen. I understand you are in a different country so things are going to be different. I think that is part of the charm for most people, I not being one of them. It was really hard to communicate at this resort. If you are from the US it is very hard to make new friends, because there was probaly only 10 people or so from the US and everyone spoke a different language. We basically spent our days laying out at the beach and then would visit the pool bar in the afternoon. I do believe a vacation is what you make of it and we did have a great time at this hotel however I do not think i will be visiting the Domincan Republic again. We had to take so many precautions to go there. The Maleria meds i was on (chloroquine) made me very sensitive to the sun and on the 4th day i got a rash. This has since spread all over and is extremly painful. Having to brush my teeth with bottled water, not having hot showers, the food tasting just very different and the slow pace of everything was just not for me. When i go on vacation i want to be catered to and this hotel felt almost Self Service. Finding a decent meal was challenging. There was never any food at the 24 hour snack bar, the lunch buffet was gross. I did really enjoy the breakfast (always had to wait 10 mins or so for a coffee cup) and the a la cartes (Spanish, Italian and Mexican- all very, very good!!) My other complaint with this hotel was the nightly entertainment. It seemed like there was nothing to do but sit around at the bar near the pool or in the lobby. We ended up back in our room after dinner and usually fell asleep by 10 every night. There is shows and a disco but it doesnt start until 10pm or so. Reserving beach chairs at this place was something new to me. I have never seen such rude people in my life. I would wake up early every day and see the sunrise. We are talking 6 am or earlier out on the beach and all i could see was towels spread over the chairs, little tables on the lounge chairs reserving their spot. I think they just left them from the day before. I was up by 6am and never got a place with shade for the beach because they were all reserved from the day before. It reminded me of home after a snowstorm and after you shovel your car out you put tables, chairs, trash barrells in your spot so nobody would take it. It was really annoying!!! Another thing i should note is the amount of Topless people. I truly felt like we were at a nudist camp! i would say 80% of the woman were topless. Walking down the beach, Laying at the beach and the pool, I even saw a woman topless and wearing a tiny g string at the lunch buffet. It was simply CRAZY!! There were a lot of children at this resort as well. They would sit at the pool bar and take up all the seats so we couldnt even sit there and get a drink- they would also swim by you and splash you- Dont ask me where their parents were- probably off topless sunbathing on the beach. I was also really looking forward to getting a massage and when i went down to get one, the woman kept saying toto i guess this means get naked. I was on the beach and it wasnt very private. I guess maybe i am too modest- but i was totally uncomfortable and really couldnt relax for this massage.our best day was on saturday. We walked down to captain cooks, and had the best sangria. then we shopped in the little village. I loved the grocery store! The guys in the stores were all very nice to deal with. A little pushy but not too bad. For our departure we were picked up by our tour company (VIP- Funjet) and had to stop at 4 other resorts to pick people up. It was weird because nobody got on but we still had to stop at all of them. Once we arrived at the airport, we were told that our flight was cancelled and we were going to be bussed to Santo Domingo Airport (3 hour bus ride). I couldnt even believe it. I told American Airlines that there was no way i was sitting on a bus for 3 hours after i just got off one that took an hour to get to the airport. I had a friend going out on US air later that day, so I asked him if he could put us on US air and get us a connection somewhere to get back in Boston. This worked and would get us in 2 hours after we originallly were scheduled to. later we walked by and saw that American had a flight to Miami. I have no idea why they wouldnt have flown us in to Miami and then we could have caught a conncetion to Boston Or why they sent all those people on a bus for 3 hours instead of even offering a different carrier. It was HORRIBLE. We sat in that airport for 2 hours trying to get our information switched to US air. We are now back home. I have this horrible itchy rash and still need to take 4 weeks of maleria meds. I know this sounds like a horrible vacation and truly it wasnt awful but it wasnt the relaxing wonderful vacation i wanted either. We did have a good time, and the resort was so pretty. I just feel that next time, I will be spending my vacation a little closer to home!!!!!

<Content>Great Experience Hola, Just returned April 3rd and had a fabulous time....The weather was perfect, the staff was hard working and friendly. The food was above average and better than I expected after reading some reviews. We stayed in block 6 and it was great, nice big room and ocean view. I thought the Hotel was clean and beautifully landscaped. The pool bar was great to hang out at after a day at the beach around 4 p.m. Just be careful you will notice not to many people sitting on the bar stools in the water, leave them to go to the bathroom, and the water is alot warmer around this area (if you know what I mean). I agree with people about rude europeans and their skimpy bathing gear (don't they have mirrors in France or Italy???) Overall a great trip.

<Content>Great fun Stayed @ the resort 03/14 - 03/21Great resort, very clean, good food, great employees, great beach  pools. Alot of actvities. Go to this resort if you want to be busy or quiet. Each end of the beach was very quiet. Had alot of fund with the Dominican vendors. People complain their rude. When you go to the country, you have to play the game! Or, don't go. My daughter  I took them food  soda - got us great deals. 7 days of 85 plus and sun. Who from Ohio could ask for more in March. Loved coming home rested with a deep dark tan!I reccommend this resort. Great for small children as best I could tell there was alot of organized activities for the little ones. I don't have little kids, but they seemed to be having fun!

<Content>Awful Vacation! Where to start...my boyfriend and i went here from march 18 to 25 and had a lowsy time at the hotel. We booked through apple vacation and a travel agent here in Ohio (which we will never use again). Our first day no power and that was awful! We had no water every single day at different times. We never had water in the early morning although they had plenty to water the lawn each day! We tried to upgrade to a Caribbean Spa Room after we had read the awful reviews. We were told it would be $90 total and we asked several times if this was per night and were told no. Well of course when we go to give them our card we find out its per night so it would be $540. Against better judgement we did do the upgrade and were sent to a room with no hot water. we promptly went back and requested our money back and to just get a standard room. our view was absolutely awful as well. After a lot of struggle we got our money put back on our credit card (they tried to tell us the machine was broke and to come back in a few days) we were finally taken to our standard room which wasn't much better. the no water situation was horrible no shower for a day and a half! they just kept telling us that it would be fixed in a few minutes, but it wasn't. Our shower handle was broke so you had to hold the shower with one hand and soap up with the other that is if you could get water long enough to shower. With no water was also no toilet and outside of our blocque 4 its often smelled of sewage. our tv didn't work several days and we had to complain for a remote. the smell in the room was not really that bad although we did bring an air freshner because of the previous reviews. We were able to get beach towels if we got there by 8am and we did have to save chairs at 8am or there weren't any. i think the resort was extra busy because of the holiday week. the whistler was very annoying all day long also annoying were the activities on the beach. we were told by our travel agent that the resort was very quiet and peaceful and it was anything but. if you enjoy activities all day then this is the place for you, but we really don't. we wanted to hear the ocean and read books, but instead heard loud music and whistling all day. the toplessness didn't bother us i actually joined in and thought it was great to have no tan lines. i ended up calling home and asking my mother to call the travel agent on my behalf and complain. she did and the travel agent was supposed to take care of it and contact our apple rep, which if she did, it is news to us because they never contacted us. my mother called an left several messages at the hotel for us and even gave our room number and we never got any of them. that to me is unacceptable. Our room was cleaned daily and our maid very nice (we tipped and left little gifts for her every night). we found the serive to be okay but not great as i said they seemed very busy this week. the spa was okay but i get a better massage and facial here in the us for comparable prices. the beach is very nice the weather was fantastic! the breeze was great on the beach. pools were nice but crowded so we mainly stayed on the beach. we thought the buffet was okay and tired of it quickly although the breakfast was great. we liked the mexican restaurant (although we did see ants) and did not like the brazilian very much. just not enough selection for us. the people at the hotel were extrememly rude. this of course is not the hotels fault but we really ran into some very rude people down here. english is a minority maybe 10% of the people speak english. the hotel staff spoke enough to get by though. be careful when you get drinks you have to ask for liquor in them. we didn't realize this until we saw someone else asking. this hotel is really absolutely horrible to us. we loved the grounds and the beach. the palms are spectacular. they really need to get the building fixed. we ran into women that booked the same all inclusive trip as we did for 589 dollars for two people. we paid 2250 for two! they booked on travelzoo so it might be worth checking out. i would go back to punta cana in a heartbeat, but never stay anywhere near the ocean bavaro. all of the bad reviews we had read previously came true for us. i wish i would have found this website before i booked my trip. i will stay at a secrets or marriot or something next time. take my advice...don't stay at this hotel unless you have very low expectations!

<Content>Mixed feelings We just returned from vacationing at Punta Cana Dominican Republic on 3/25/05. It is a beautiful destination, but like most Carribean countries, the resorts sit on the coast of a very impoverished country and the overall experience is about what you would expect when you attempt to build and run a 5 star resort in a 3rd world country. I was very leery of the trip simply because our Dr. recommended and gave us Hepatitis shots and malaria medication based on reports issued by the CDC (which has a good website). My review is mixed. Overall, we selected Punta Cana and an all-inclusive as an alternative to a cruise since I do not like the structure/limitations/time in port of cruises. Based on this, our travel agent recommended an all-inclusive and Punta Cana as comparably priced. In fact, I think our trip cost considerably less than a cruise simply because we were pretty much confined to the resort which limited opportunities to spend money (besides there isn't anything that is produced locally and a good deal except for rum) and tipping shamefully ignored by most.The food is a major issue, so if you are travelling with children, be advised. Our first night there we missed dinner so went to the pizza counter where we encountered 3 types of pizza under hot lights. One was piled with canned tunafish, one with canned corn and the last with sliced hot dogs. We ended up eating a so-so hamburger that tasted mostly of soy and bun and retiring early. They were having major power issues with the whole resort going black a number of times and for extended periods that evening which did not happen the rest of the week. With the heat, the food, general travel exhaustion and lack of water for even a shower (pumps must be electric) everyone was ready to get on a plane and go home. By late that night power was restored and the air conditioning hummed away. The next day dawned bright, sunny and beautiful. We were on the 4th floor of Building 4 and liked the location (other than the 8 flights of steps) for the view of the beautiful grounds, pool and glimpse of the ocean. Breakfast is definitely their strong point with eggs/omelettes, fruit, fresh squeezed o.j. and fantastic homemade donuts. If you like cold cereal, you might be in trouble because all the milk is boxed and so has a peculiar flavor and what they called oatmeal was a very thin gruel. The food really goes downhill at lunch (two buffet locations-both fairly similar in what they offer) and the dinner buffet is a variation on lunch so not much better. Hot and cold items were neither, which probably explains my diarrhea. Each entree on the buffet had a card with the name of the food item (this should be a big flag as it was the only way to identify many things). Our favorite label was FRIED FOOD our second favoite was MEAT and the final entree available at all meals was PIG TROTTERS. There are several restaurants on the property which in general were better than the buffets, but getting reservations was frustrating until we started tipping the reservationist. We did not try the seafood restaurant because of the $40 surcharge, which we felt was too much for 6 of us.The entertainment/games/etc. were somewhat fun while at the same time being annoying. If you absolutely do not want to participate or be coerced into participating or bothered by the p.a. system/music, then locate yourself as far away from the Happy Club as possible. At first I hated the pressure to join in, but once I did a couple of the games- it was actually pretty fun and often very funny. People get up before sunrise to save chairs/palapas- a frustrating practice since it would be hours before anyone would show up to use many of them. Be advised that there are MANY Europeans (French/German) so about 1 out of 10 women are topless (regardless of how fat or old) and the same goes for men wearing speedos or thongs. Initially my kids were pretty grossed out, but they got over it pretty quickly. My husband is another story. We always had plenty of bottled water, coke and seven up-the cocktails were good, but inconsistent. Americans are in the minority and knowing some basic Spanish is essential although key staff (like front desk) can speak english. Once we started tipping our maid (at least $5 each day and some days $10 -we had two rooms), she became quite friendly and our towel supply improved. While we got through the week without illness, I seem to have brought something back with me- the doctor suspects Giardia (sp?). As far as I am concerned, there is risk of illness regardless of where you go (hell, virtually everyone in our group of 60 people got violently ill with the flu at a ski resort in Michigan last year). I feel fine in between trips to the bathroom and hopefully the Cipro will take care of this.Bottom line: the trip is a good value. If you have low expectations, you will be pleased, if you have high expectations, you will be dissapointed. If you can relax and be patient and understand the concept of Dominican time (5 minutes Dominican) and remember you are going to the Carribean on the cheap, then you will enjoy yourself.

<Content>Nice vacation at Ocean Bavaro We stayed here the week of march 12-19. Overall it is a very nice resort. The grounds are absolutely beautiful!  We paid for a standard room (garden view), but my travel agent sent in a request for block 5 which we ended up getting. Had a nice ocean view and a great location next to the main pool and beach. Very happy with room.Never had to wait long for a drink at the beach bar or pool bar, but the lobby bar seemed to be busy whenever we were there. Loved the bartenders at the pool bar! Santiago and Roberto were our favorites. I also liked the fact that the beach bar had a self serve soda machine. We brought mugs along and would fill them up before heading to the beach. It was out of ice a few days, but the bartenders always had some behind the bar. We enjoyed the buffets and could always find something that we liked. The pasta bar in the main buffet was very good. My husband enjoyed the omelets every morning. We only ate dinner twice at the buffets, so we didn't get tired of them. We went to all of the al a cartes except for the seafood and liked all but the brazilian. The Mexican was our favorite. 24 hour pizza and burger place could have been better.  The beach area was nice, but pretty busy the week we were there. Our first full day we could not find any chairs, so the next morning we headed out early and had no problem finding some. The water didn't seem as clear as it was two years ago when we were there, but still beautiful. Power and water were out on our last full day, but we were not in our rooms most of the day anyway. The staff tried very hard to get everything working again, but it did take some time. We would get power and water for a short time and then they would go out again. Luckily, we were able to get a quick shower that evening before we lost them again. By the time we went to sleep, things were fine. Two things that bothered me: 1. There is an annoying guy that walks around whistling ALL OF THE TIME! He could be heard all over the resort, all day long. Everyday he would have on a different costume and walk the grounds annoying many people. 2. We are comfortable with the topless women on the beach, as we know this is normal for them, but the ones we seen by the pool were a different story. There was a group that sat in the loungers blocking the entrance to the main pool in full view of everyone. They would walk around all day like this talking to people as if it were perfectly normal. I don't even think these women were European. I'm glad we didn't bring our children along to witness this. Overall, we had a great time and would go back to Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>Two Thumbs Up For Ocean Bavaro We are a group of 12 who just returned from a week at the Ocean Bavaro. Our first night was the pitts with moldy, worn-out rooms on the ground floor of Block 7. We complained and received 4 new rooms in Blocks 3,4  7, all off the ground floor and in good shape with a few minor problems that were quickly fixed. After that, the rest of the vacation was wonderful in every way. The food was very impressive with a great variety and plenty of it. There were many activities for kids/adults to compete in and win a bottle of rum and the animation staff was very friendly and extremely talented.The weather could not have been better - total sun from morning till night for 7 days straight! The beach was the best in the area - always clean with lots of chairs (get there by 8:00 a.m. for best selection) and no towel problems. The pool area is gorgeous with plenty of chairs in/out of the sun and great bar service and a nice little outdoor pool table and ping pong area. There was always something to do and our 6 kids (ages 8 - 17) were never bored. Snorkeling, Parasailing, kayaking and banana boating,etc. were all available at the beach area. You can do some dealing when negotiating prices (kayaking was free) - Parasailing $30 U.S. if tandem; $40 for single; snorkeling was $30 but well worth it. Shopping is O.K. but the bartering system is a pain in the ### - some shops were set prices (reasonable too) and the on-site gift store was not too bad (priced in Euros; add 25 cents per $ for U.S.). We did have a few digestive problems in the group but they were easily handled by good ol' Pepto Bismol and Immodium. The grounds are magnificent but they do need to improve on maintaining the rooms - there were way too many complaints for a 4-* hotel. Their policy of giving out the worst rooms until you complain is ridiculous and starts your holiday off on a sour note. We even emailed/faxed (several times) our request for ocean view rooms in specific blocks, to no avail.However, when all is said and done we had a FANTASTIC holiday and would do it all over again in a second (without the room hassles of course). Enjoy!

<Content>Take away the rude europeans and their breasts in your face, and its a pretty decent resort Hmm where to start, I guess Ill start with the positives, I was at the Ocean Bavaro from the 12 of March to the 19th , 2005. As far as the resort goes and its staff Id have to give it 3 out of 4 stars, If my husband and I needed anything we went to the service desk and things were taken care of pretty promptly, Dont bother to go to the head check in desk, all you will get there is frustrated. We had no problems getting towels or beach towels in our room, in fact we never used our towel cards because our maid had 2 in our room everyday without us asking. We always had hot water in our bathroom, the mini bar was always stocked and anything add'l we needed like extra pillows we just asked for and recieved immediately. The food was decent , but its not what we were used to so what do you expect? There are great guards at the resort, they do there job well, we felt safe the entire trip except for the night of the power outages. The Brazillian restaurant was really good so was the snack bar and buffets, the Italian was ok but probably not what i would consider great. The resort is kept clean, their are flamingos , ducks and peacocks roaming about. We had no rain which was nice, it did get alittle windy 2 of the 8 days we were there. There is a great bartender named Manuel in the hotel lobby who makes a mean bahama mama but its worth it , tip him often and well. The beach massage is soo worth it , just have one and youll see. Their are venders at the edge of the resort, you have to pass the guard to get to it, they are pushy but nice and will bargin, just see what happens when you name a price and they say no and you walk away, they will bargin, also bring things to trade with them, my husband traded his golf hat for a 60.00 necklace and 30.00 ring. Go see Alex he will take care of you, hes the last store on the left. Also if you want a bargain compare prices at the resort shop first, then at the flea market next to the guard and then with the vendors they allow in on fridays. There is a lady at the resort shop that will bargain with you event though they say they dont . oh i forgot to mention The swim up bartender was great too.Ok and now for the Negatives; I do not recommend this resort for people with children or couples, heres why, during our week stay there we had -- shoved in our face both at the beach and the pool everyday, some even walked around talking to people that way. I had not seen that many --- since mardi gras in new orleans #2 their were swingers there who were going around asking couples to have --- with them and trade spouses. #3 we had power outages all day the last day we were there it was scary because they had no alternate light which made things very very difficult to navigate in. The food at the restaurant Pipetos is absolutely horrendous I actually left this restaurant that required reservations and went to the buffet, there were bugs on the walls in this mexican restaurant as well. The water at the beach is pretty but more on the unclear side than mentioned by someone earlier. I scuba so I know what clear water looks like and this is not it. Oh there is an very annoying man who walks around wistling the same thing day after day it really starts to grate on ones nerves after the first five minutes and it is daily at every spot on the resort. Bring immodium or pepto most of the people at the resort has some sort of stomach issue, not just with the food but with the alcohol as well so beware. Lots of RUDE Italians and FRENCH people so beware of them too.Overall it was a decent trip/resort , if the price were right id stay here again.

<Content>The Hotel from Hell! Just returned on March 13, 2005. Rooms were dark and dingy. Food was monotonous and poorly prepared. Bring plent of Tums. We are understanding about things happening in a hotel, but no one there cared or was willing to help. When we arrived the phone did not work. Three times I made the trip to the front desk to ask when it would be repaired. I was told that someone would be right there. The next morning they told me that the phone company only comes twice weekly and was not do for another few days. No one was ever planning to fix the phone that night. That hurt. Our hotel representative even relayed that there have been numerous complaints, but management is unwilling to address them because they remain full. When our room finally had to be changed, I was left alone to do it myself. A cart was not even offered. It was not until I was crying in the lobby that anyone addressed the problem. The rooms that were suites, with hot tubs and whirlpools had no hot water for the entire week. Standard rooms did not get washcloths. All inclusive means you get only dominican liquor or beer. If you wanted a Bud or Corona it was an additional $3.00 each. I am sorry that I am going on and on, but I depended on the Tripadvisor recommendation to help me choose a resort. This time it was a let down.

<Content>Fabulous Resort Complaints about this resort:-it was too hot and too sunny...it didn't even rain once. -my tan is too dark-the staff wouldn't stop saying hola to you when you passed them-there was too much variety to the food and too many a la carte restaurants-the ocean water was too clear-the beach had too much sand-I couldn't wear long-sleeves all trip, not even at night-the grounds had way too many tropical flowers, palm trees, little music boxes playing music softly, flamingos, and lush greenery.See - even if I try to complain about this WONDERFUL resort I can't come up with legit complaints!I strongly recommned visiting this resort. The only better resort I've been to is the Barcelo Bavaro Palace, which is a 5 star in Punta Cana. I've also been to 4 arnd 5 stars throught Cuba and Mexico. I am 24 and my boyfriend is 28. The food was amazing (and I'm a picky eater). Lots of variety at the buffet for all meals, and the a la carte restaurants were fabulous. Breakfast at the buffet had everything - fresh made donuts, pancakes, crepes, waffles, frech toast, cereal, fresh made omlettes, eggs made to order, danishes, fresh fruit, fruit juice, etc. I loved breakfast!!!The buffet was also open for lunch and dinner, and again a lot of variety and they changed things up everyday. There was a 24 hr pizzaria which was phenomenal, and it also served hamburgers.We had no hassles making reservations - we made them the 2nd day there and got the restaurants we wanted at the time we wanted. We liked the Mexican restaurant so much that on our last day we booked our reservation at 4:00 and there was still room for us at the 6:30 seating. No problems with beach towels either...if you want a clean one every day you have to go in the morning and there's tons. Bath towels were fine too, they drop them off later on in the afternoon so don't fret if you don't have them right after the maid cleans your room.I loved the beach! Miles of white powdery sand, clear ocean, and never a shortage of chairs all day. The music was never too loud, there was nice latino music playing throughout the day which added to the whole Caribbean experience. I did not find the music too loud, and we sat right next to the speakers.The Animation Staff was great - they kept you busy all day playing games, doing aerobics, etc. Our room was average, and we didn't have any problems with mould or anything else.The grounds are filled with lucious greenery - you truly feel like you're in paradise. The staff are friendly and speak mostly French and Spanish. But guess what? You're in a foreign country so it's ridiculous to expect them to speak fluent English. You can always get your point across and communicate with them.Yes, the vendors down the beach are pushy. But they're not on the resort so if you don't want to deal with them, then DON'T GO TO THE MARKET. There's a gift shop on the resort if you want to buy things without pressure. Personally, the market was pretty fun.Definetly go here - I don't know how anyone could possibly give this piece of heaven a negative review.

<Content>Hola! Go Go Go Excellent Resort March 2005 Honnest review from a Qu茅bec family ! We stayed there from Feb 25 to Mar 04, 2005 and it is a georgous place. Our last trip to Punta Cana was in 1989 when we got married ( Barcelo Bavaro) and the Ocean Bavaro is even better ! The grounds are spectacular although the maids took most of the flowers to garnish the rooms. Left $1 per day on the pillow and we got plenty of towels, flowers... The buffet was very good, none of us got sick and we tried almost every thing. Those who said that the a la carte restaurants (4) were not good...I wonder if it's better at their home...we did all four and went back a second time to the Spanish El Mensor Restaurante ! Meal presentation, ambiance and quality is excellent.The size of the resort is just perfect, we were 1500 people there during that week and it was hard to believe that we were so many. You can walk fro one end to the other end in 10 to 15 minutes and we loved it. The design of the property, pools and bars is impressive. If you go to Carbella (or something like that) the resort next door you will be disappointed if you visit Ocean Bavaro. The beach is amazing with 4 to 5 feet of water at 1 Km from the shore ! Only sand, no rocks even in the ocean. Only a few algea but very very few. We went to Saona Island on a huge Catamaran loaded with 82 people, was fun and felt like in Paradise. This island is a national park with white sand, turkoise waters. A buffet is served there and Rhum ( La vitamine...) also. The shows at 10 pm varied from average to excellent. The best show is on saturdays when a troup of 30 pro dancers from Santo Domingo perform on stage...very good. We also loved the Romantic Couples show ...4 guest couples were chosen and had to compete and do different stunts to win...so funny. Daily activities are numerous, always something every 30 minutes, we took a Merengue danse introduction/refresher on the beach, had fun. The drinks are maid from fresh juices poor from distributors and rhum is added..hmmmmm luv coco loco, banana mama  banana papa.Those who give 3 stars or less to this property are not honnest. Don't miss the little meeting with your tour rep when you arrive you will learn useful things about the towels, tours etc.. If this resort is available for the dates you have in mind GO and you will not regret. Would go back without any hesitation.

<Content>Awesome time, decent food, FAKE CIGARS!!!! We had a great time, nice weather, super friendly staff, everyone says Hola to you, even the maintenance staff. Bartenders were friendly, fun and enhanced the experience. There were 7 of us, my parents, girlfriend, brother and his g/f, and my sister. Most didn't enjoy the food, I did. Rum was awesome, Columbus 7 years, beer (Presidente) also great. I had a great time haggling at the stores (on the resort, 5 mins left on the beach, and 30 mins right on the beach). Warning you in advance, I returned home and found out that the Cubans that I bought (at the store on the resort) were all fake. Romeo and Julietta's full of holes, Cohibas taste ok, but a few holes and fake. I am not happy with this, but c'est la vie, buyer beware. I would recommend this resort, although there are better. Nice beach, few problems with the rooms (outlet for us, bathroom/phone/tv in another room).

<Content>Greatly Disappointing I very carefully researched the hotel we were going to stay at for a week. I read all the reviews, good and bad. Always willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Both my husband and I are very low key people and pretty much go with the flow. So, all in all we thought Ocean Bavaro was an excellent choice of places to stay. But, when you arrive at 1:30 in the morning, through no fault of the hotel and they give you an upgrade to a junior spa suite you think, wow. But, the bathroom was dirty and there was mold all around the spa itself and in the shower. So, my initial impression was not a good one. There were no other rooms so we stayed and used a lot of room freshner in the bathroom to cover the mold smell. This was a 4 Apple hotel. Food, wasn't anything great. The place that serves pizza and spit cooked chicken was the best place for lunch. The reserved dinner places aren't worth it, the main buffet served the freshed and largest variety of foods. Sit outside, it is beautiful with a water fountain and flamingos. Food staff were very personable and helpful.Beach was windy the entire time we were there, like Aruba. So, needless to say when you leave your bathing suit cover-up on and cover up with your pareo as well, you don't get much sun. Also the beach games and music were very annoying. All day long. The whistler who was promoting the additional charge Bucaneer dinner place was obnoxious and rude. The dinner place was on the beach and the entire time I was there only saw one poor couple who had paid $70 extra to eat outside in the cold wind.No beach vendors, which was nice, but in the shopping areas the shop owners are the rudest I've ever encountered when wanting you to bargain with them. You would walk out and they would follow you down the street harping at you for trying to take food out of their mouths.All in all, we had a good time, but wouldn't recommend going there to anyone.

<Content>save your money I gave it a rating of OK because it was OK--but is that why you go on vacation---staff for the most part was friendly--food passable--skip the dinners that require reservations--not worth the effort-----beach was nice but windy all of the time----the merchants (away from the hotel grounds) were more intense and rude than any other place that I have been---next time ,, to Mexico or just stay home---I tried, as some reviewers suggest, went in with an open mind---because this is a developing country---but I won't be back--life is too short

<Content>want to be annoyed on vacation???... My boyfriend  I (29  32 yrs.) just returned on Feb.27th from a 1 week stay at the Ocean Bavaro Resort. We have travelled to many places in the carribean before (mexico(2), Jamacia(1),Bahamas(1), Dominican(1), Aruba(1))  all have been 3.5- 4 stars. The ocean bavaro should definately not be rated anything higher than a 2.5 star.We are very easy going people, who don't expect to stay in super luxerious suite just a clean room, an awesome beach, some partying but also some relaxing time(which we usually find at the beach). This is the only resort I have stayed that was truely disappointing.Here is our review:Rooms:ALL WE WOULD HAVE WANTED FROM A ROOM ON VACATION WAS IT TO BE CLEANWhen we arrived we were given our room (9313) which was shocking!as soon as we opened the door, the smell of musty mold hit you like a ton of bricks. I went to turn on the lamp, and here the lamp shade was solid gray/black with mold growing on it!!!! all above the bed on the ceiling was mold  the washroom had about a 12 patch of mold growing on the tiles. Needless to say we went down to the front desk to ask for a better room! after about 1/2 hr. of them telling us they had nothing the manager had put us in a clean room which was great during our week stay.Beach:ALL WE WOULD HAVE WANTED FROM THE BEACH WAS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF QUIET TIMEIt was great to see a beautiful sandy beach  an awesome ocean to swim in. So once we got our spot the annoying microphones came out  probably from 11 am- 4pm you would have the same song blasting in your ear all day  every 20 mins. have some guy yelling into his microphone. After the first day, we thought  We need to go somewhere a little bit more quiet. The good thing was the sister hotel Ocean Cana was a quieter beach, beautiful,  their events staff were much cooler people. They do cater their events to the majority of their guests from italy... which was fine, we were just sooooo happy that we did not have to hear the events staff at the Ocean screaming in your ear every 20 mins. Towels: The first day we did not get towels since this hotel does not have enough towels for all the guests. The second day at 9:30 they did not have any in the morning but we finally managed to get two at 4:00 pm.  needless to say we had to hold on to them all week... I know it does sound nice but we tried to get new ones a few times that week  sure enough they did not have any. The hotel needs to purchase more... but I knew from other reviews that this was going to happen. No big deal but truely I have never stayed at a place that did not have enough towels for their guests.Food/Restaurants: WE LOVE EATING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FOODS, ITS ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS TO EXPERIENCE WHEN TRAVELLINGSo to sum up the food situation, it was horrible! I have never experienced such a horrible buffet in all of the travelling we have done. In the morning you managed to get some o.k. selection ie. pancakes, fruit, breads  egg omlettes but most of the stuff was just plain poor quality. At lunch  at dinner it was absolutely horrible. the quality was aweful. We did take advantage of dining at the restaurants which were a much better quality. we did enjoy at 4 of the restaurants. We especially like the fact that it meant we did not have to eat at the buffet!If you want to eat awesome food make sure to visit a restaurant down the beach by the name of Captain cook amazing service  great quality for a great price. We ate fresh grilled veggies  fresh grilled shrimp for $20.I have to mention that the most annoying thing on this vacation was one of the resorts employees who is dressed up in aweful goofy outfits  walks around everywhere whistling very loudly all day long. I don't mean light whistling~ it's piercing. In the morning you would go to the buffet  there he was whistling soo loud all the way through breakfast  carrying a lobster plater around that he would then throw in your face to see if you want to dine at the seafood restaurant that night... that is not what I want thrown in my face at 8 am while eating breakfast then he was at the beach still carrying the lobster  whistling loudly all the time! Then it was time to eat lunch well guest who is still whistling loudly  throwing a lobster in your face .... he never stopped. It was horrible. Even though all of these problems really did happen we still had a good vacation. I have never thought before I stayed here that a 4 star hotel could turn out to be so bad. All the hotels we have stayed at have always had great food, great entertainment  I could not say 1 bad thing about any of them.We walked the whole beach  OCEAN BAVARO was the only hotel that had the annoying entertainment on the beach with the microphones  music.We did hear from many couples that the Bahia Principle? was really great it is a very large compex(1600 rooms) we originally hesitate to stay there because of the size. we walk down to the Breezes which truely was gorgeous. If we were to return we would stay there. Happy travelling to everyone! but truely think about going to another place!

<Content>Loved It! My husband and I and two other couples stayed at the Ocean Bavaro the week of January 13-20 and had a fabulous time. The resort was very clean and the grounds were beautiful, the beaches were breathtaking and after walking up and down the beach we felt that we by far had the nicest beach. The service was top notch, everyone was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. The rooms were very nice, nothing fancy but very clean and had all of the ammenities we needed. The food was good and there was always plenty of it. I would highly recommend this resort, everything about it was fantastic!

<Content>Everything one could ask for My boyfriend and I spent our reading week at this hotel. He is 23 and I am 20. I had also been to this resort two years ealier with my mother and my 9 year old brother. I've been to four resorts in Puerto Vallart, Mayan Riviera, Mazatlan, and Cuba and this is the place I chose to return to. Overall the trip was great. The bottom line is if you're looking fro exterme attention to detail and a place that feels like you're at home obviolsy you will need to pay a little more to go to a Sandals. This is not a downfall of the resort though, it's not to say the service is bad, it's just i think the biggest thing it has going for it is the location. If you're looking to relax on a beautiful beach all day then this is the place. Rooms- we requested bock 6 for fun, were put in block 5 which i would recommend. It is right on the ocean and the pool. It does get load at night when the show is going on but if you plan on staying up for it anyway it's not a big deal. I littel unclean when we arrived but we tipped $5 USD at the beginning and received fresh flowers on on our bed everyday, fresh towels and impecable cleaning. Food- Great. If you like pasta and italian food you'll be good to go. After the week we found that all the food had a certain taste, not bad but just repetative. We went to the Italian and Brazilian resturants, both good. I would definetly recommend the steak at the Italian. I found that many people didn't know abou the Italian buffet which is on the other side of the resort. You cannot go if you have a prurple bracelt, only if it's orange. It's worth the trip atleast once though, we found them serving lobster one night! Beach, Pool and Grounds- Impecable! The beach is by far the best, we tried spending a morning at the pool and it was quite busy and hot.... good if you have kids i guess but the beach is definetly my reason for going. No where have i seen a resort that is full of so many mature plam trees, it's stunning. Poool bar is good but not as popular because it's ually in the shade. Service- for the most part good. The the lack of english could be a probelm if you make it one but we had no issues. At checkout i was told that i had to pay $59 US for two phone calls when i had only made on 10 minute call but after like a half hour of making my whole bus lat e for the airport i only eneded up having to pay the 10 that was rightfully due. Excursions- We did the Sanoa on Valentines day, amazing! Be careful though my boyfriend drank more rum then he should've and on the two hour busride home there were no barf bags availible! Weather- the weather in February was not as amazing as when i went in the end of March. Still good though, atleast 25 each day, no down poors. Only a few afternoon s it would cloud over for a n hour or two. There was quite a breeze on the beach but nothing cold. Entertainment- We went to a couple shows that i though we're great, not really the reason we went though!  Towels- if you get there by 9 you'll have them for sure, just go before breakfast!  All in all.... great week. My boyfreind had never been anywhere down south and this place ensured that now he'll be going somewhere every year. Punta Cana is definelty a great choise and so is this hotel.

<Content>Best deal for your Buck Dates traveled: jan 21 to feb 4 (2 weeks)Airline: AirTransat (Montreal departure)Price payed: 1995$/per CND tx incl. for Standard roomBooked 10 days before departureROOMS As a standard room, I got what I expected. Clean with no frills. I had a TV (12 channels). Electricity is standard and a hair dryer is included. This hotel has about 15 buildings that has from 40 to 120 rooms each. If you don't get a good view when you arrive, go back the next morning and they will relocated or even upgrade you at no charge. BUT BE NICE ABOUT IT.... IT PAYS TO BE NICE.TIP: Pillows are small and had, if you can bring one from home.FOOD: With 5 restaurants, you have the choice. The buffets offer a good spread of food. A la carte dinning is ok, but don't expect high class. It's good food with good service. The italian was my fav.TIP: A la carte dinning needs reservation (1 to 2 days) so book early. Plan on about 5$US per person for tip.WATER: Fresh filtered water is offered free. Tap water is not drinkable.TIP: Bring Immodiums in case of tourista otherwise a visit to the hotel's doctor is 100$USBEACH: What a view. Great beach and clean water. If you bring young kids, with water is very turbulant so keep an eye on the little ones.STAFF: Prepare to say HOLA about 50 times a day. The staff is very nice. They do not ask for tips or beg you for anything. But remerber, it is always nice to give a couple of bucks even if this is an all-inclusive vacation.TIP: No Room service at this hotel. Cleanning lady: 10$/week min. is what I suggest.BEACH TOWELS: They have beach towles (nice ones too) but they are hard to come by. It could take you 2 or 3 times before you get one. Replace your beach towel with a fresh one ONLY if you need to.LAUDRY: If you plan on a 2 week stay, the hotel has a laundry service. About 2-3$US per item.ANIMATION: You will enjoy the animation team. The have shows for every night on the week. I was there for 2 weeks and had a new show every night.KIDS: This place is great for young kids. They have activities for all ages.SITES: Tours and sites are offrered there. Do not pre-buy via internet for tours.... alot of fraud. TANNING TIP: If you are going as white as a ghost (like me) here are a fiew tip to maximize your tan. Day 1 and 2 Lotion 15 SPF, Day 3 and 4 Lotion 8 SPF, and work down to a Lotion 4 SPF after that. This way I was able to be in the sun for 6-7 hours a day with no problem and no burns.for more info contact me at mdprosoft@ifrance.com

<Content>Great vacations at Ocean Cana We came back from Ocean Cana Beach resort on January 30th, 2005. Our vacation were A-1. The beach, the hotel, the food, the excursions, everything was great. Our room was in the lastest unit built (3rd floor so cathedrale celling) and was very big and clean. The sand is white and the water is very clear. No big waves at the time we went. The restaurants 脿 la carte (brezilian has my vote) where ok but the buffet central is as good and offers more choice. Central buffet has much more choice then the italian buffet. The excursions we did (Bavaro Runner and Saona) where both very fun. Even though Saona is a long drive I prefered it a little bit more then the Bavaro Runner. If you meet Santiago at the swim up bar, you should like him. Mostly if you leave tip, you'll never have to order your drinks. A fresh one will arrive before you have time to order! They only disapointment was the difficulty to get change at the reception (us or pesos). They also keep there share when you change us into pesos. I should of broth US 1$ bills...It's better to get change done down town at the market. Neighbor to the ice cream shop, the change counter there gives a good rate. To those interested in giving scholar stuff to a school, there is one at 10 or 15 minutes of walk from the hotel. And if you wish to leave gifts to the room mate, leave it on the bed with a note giving your name, room number, date and a description of what you give. The employees need that proof to keep the gifts. (But if you see them, they have prepared forms for that purpose). In my opininion, The shows at night, given by employees is ok but suit more for clients above 50. However, don't miss the beach party's. There is also a bus that leave the hotel for a not too far discotheque. Canadians, if you buy cartoons of cigarettes with no label duty paid except to pay a 16$ tax when you get off at the canadian airport. No deal!To finish, I strongly recommand this hotel at city.

<Content>Beautiful beach, beautiful resort, food so-so We spent 4 nights at this resort in early November 2004. We were impressed right away with the gorgeous gardens and reception area, and were greeted with yummy pina colada drinks and warm wash cloths. Our room was very clean, and very nice with a gorgeous balcony view.The beach is extremely beautiful and the water cannot be described. The sand was just like brown sugar, very soft, and the water was warm.We did encounter a few problems- they would not let us snorkel or use boogie-boards, and also they were out of beach towels the entire time we were there, so we had to use our same towels the whole time.The breakfasts and lunches were okay but we were sick of the same food after the first few days. The coffee is VERY good, but it sometimes takes a while to get it.As far as dinner- we tried the Brazilian restaurant -which was AWFUL. I would highly recommend AGAINST going there- it was terrible. We also went to the seafood restaurant, which cost an extra $40/ apiece. I would not recommend this either.... they display very large lobsters in the tanks, so you think that is what you are going to eat, but what they serve you are smaller, spiny lobsters, or langostines. I am allergic to some shellfish (not lobster) but I did have a reaction to the langostines, so I was very irritated by this bait-and-switch.The drinks at the bars are very good but the plastic glasses are small, I would recommend taking a plastic/insulated mug. I was addicted to the rum and pina coladas! Santiago at the pool bar took very good care of us after we tipped him $20 US the first night.The maid service was very good but they COMPLETELY IGNORE the do not disturb sign on the door. We tried to take naps in the late afternoon but the maid kept barging in. I would recommend taking naps on the beach or in the shaded hammocks.Again the beach and the gardens were truly gorgeous and the room was very clean, well-decorated and pretty with lovely views. The food left a bit to be desired. I would probably try a different resort the next time, but I think Dominican Republic is a gorgeous place to visit.

<Content>Lots of potential but too many inconsistencies Stay from Dec 30 鈥?4 鈥?Jan 13 鈥?5SummaryA gorgeous resort with a lot potential but far too many service inconsistencies which will prevent us from returning or recommending. Regardless, we still had an extremely enjoyable and relaxing vacation. DetailFirst some background for context: We鈥檙e married, in our mid forties, childless, both professionals, fit and active, easy going who have been on 2 cruises and visited several all inclusive 3.5 鈥?4 star Caribbean resorts. RoomOur first room had no fridge or beverages (contrary to the brochure), non working phone, non working television and mold in the bathroom. We spoke with at least a dozen couples who arrived at about the same time we did who expressed a variety of complaints about their rooms, e.g. lots of leaks, no door knobs (seriously), in various states of renovation, no mirrors, clogged bathtubs, etc. We were subsequently moved to a much nicer room with an ocean view in block 5 a day after we complained. Also everyone we spoke to who complained were moved the following day. It鈥檚 as though your first room is a holding cell that they expect you to complain about and will change once a better room becomes available. I don鈥檛 find this practice acceptable 鈥?just fix the crappy rooms. Moreover many inconsistencies 鈥?we didn鈥檛 get face clothes the first couple of days, asked about it and were told they had none. Subsequently we got face clothes? Some days we鈥檇 get a bath mat, sometimes not. Some days all new bath towels, some days not? Most days it was impossible to get a towel at the beach if you tried after 10 am.Physical ResortAbsolutely Gorgeous! Beautifully landscaped with numerous palm trees and assorted vegetation. The beach is lovely with lots of shade if you desire. The main pool is beautiful with an under utilized swim up bar, probably because sometimes you had to wait a long time to get a drink even if no one was at the bar which was part of the main pool bar 鈥?they didn鈥檛 have a dedicated swim up bar bartender unlike other resorts we鈥檝e visited. The lobby bar is wonderful with entertainment every evening and the service was very good. We found the service at the pool bar good in the evening but inconsistent during the day. The daytime bartenders weren鈥檛 all that friendly and the service was sporadic. There鈥檚 also a sister resort next door (Ocean Cana) which facilities you can use but once again no one advised us of?ActivitiesThe animation team only works from 10-12 and 3-5 and unless you lounge at the beach, as opposed to the pool, no one informs you what is going on. It was extremely windy during our stay and the main pool is somewhat sheltered so we preferred to lounge there. As a result, we generally weren鈥檛 informed what was happening at the beach. One day they set up a water polo net at the main pool. I ventured there to play but we were told we had to go the activity hut to sign out a ball? One guy went to get a ball and they gave him a basketball as he was told that鈥檚 all they had. He had to go back and get a water polo ball, which he did? Very odd. The evening entertainment is typical Caribbean; either a comedy show which involves the audience or dance themed shows. The main show starts at 10 pm but at 9:30 there鈥檚 always a comedic audience participation show involving audience members, us included, making fools of themselves (but which they don鈥檛 advertise anywhere). They were always funny. Every Thursday they have Karaoke in the disco. Again, this is not advertised anywhere. We only find out because one of the animation team was at the Ocean bar with a sign up card. We met several people who missed it and who were very disappointed because they were unaware of its existence? Also all the spa services were 陆 price during our stay which again weren鈥檛 advertised anywhere? Finally, most of the animation staff had a very poor command of English, even though approximately at least half of the guests during our stay were either Canadian or British, as evidenced during polls conducted by the host while at the shows. However, the front desk staff could communicate adequately in English. ShoppingThe prices at the onsite store are generally outrageous except for rum and cigars (you can negotiate the cigar prices 鈥?but they are still very high). For example a tin of Pringles converted to $8 U.S. By the way all prices in the store are in Euros. There is a convenience store in the vendors village about a 10 minutes walk from the resort which are more reasonable for basic items such as snacks, hair care products, suntan lotion, coffee, etc. The vendors in the vendor village are, of course, extremely aggressive and annoying. Moreover, although they assert they will negotiate prices they are pretty hard nosed. We met an American couple who had been to Punta Cana last year and they assert prices have at least doubled. For example, last year they purchased a carton of U.S. cigarettes for $7. This year the best price they found was $16 鈥?which was also the experience of someone we chummed with from our resort. FoodGood selection and tasty in the main buffet but certainly not standard North American fare 鈥?not a criticism just an observation. Again lots of inconsistencies 鈥?for example we had to forage for a basic coffee cup many days. In the snack bar we were forced to use plastic cold beverage cups for our coffee as not even styrofoam cups never mind ceramic coffee cups were available? Bizarre. The a la carte restaurants were unspectacular. Again more inconsistencies 鈥?one night in the Italian restaurant I was offered a Sambuca after supper which they wanted to charge me $2 U.S. for. However at the pool bar I got the exact same Sambuca for no charge? In the Brazilian restaurant there鈥檚 a buffet which doesn鈥檛 feature any meat. After a considerable period of time waiters come by with skewers of meat. I observed many people who loaded up their plates from this salad bar without any apparent cognition that meat was to follow. Why wouldn鈥檛 they explain what you should expect? Also our rep told us the buffet by the pool (which doubles as the Brazilian restaurant in the evening) was only for Caribbean Spa customers yet everyone used it? At the snack bar they put some pretty unusual items on some of the Pizzas such as corn and chick peas? The house wine is almost undrinkable.ExcursionsWe went on the ATV tour which was a lot of fun given we鈥檝e never driven an ATV. Great scenery and insight into what life is like at a typical Dominican Village. Also went on the 3 hour 鈥渟unset trip鈥?snorkeling tour which was ok except the sales person told us there would be 2-2.5 hours of snorkeling and it was actually only 40 minutes. We booked this through the Pelicanos water sport hut on the beach at the hotel. ConclusionThis resort has so much potential but it appears it is poorly managed and lacks any efforts to market all its offerings to its guests. Given that the prices are comparable to similar resorts and it is owned by an established, professional Spanish firm that owns several other resorts, we don鈥檛 buy the claim of several reviewers that 鈥渋t鈥檚 the Dominican and this is what you should expect.鈥?All we expected was a basic level of service that didn鈥檛 exist. Conversely, this basic level of service did exist at RIU Mambo in Puerto Plata which we visited last year (another 4 star resort).

<Content>Hola Senor! I just returned with my family from the Ocean Bavaro - we were there from Dec. 21st to the 28th. You don't have to take our word for it but the so-so reviews just aren't really true! I agree with the woman from Stouffville - it's an awesome place, especially at Christmas!!The Ocean Bavaro was awesome - every morning on the beach you knew it was time for some fun when the Happy Club tune Hola Senor came on the speakers!!! And how cool was Santa - arriving on the beach via helicopter and giving gifts to all the kids! The spa at this resort - wonderful, wonderful!!! All the spa services were 50% off for the holidays so that might be worth looking into if you like going to the spas - the staff there were great, nothing like a relaxing facial on Christmas day!The food - made to order pasta every day at lunch, made to order eggs and omelets at breakfast, etc., etc. The Christmas dinners (both the 24th and 25th) were awesome!!!!! Filet mignon the best I've ever had!A couple of things to keep in mind - if you like to go to bed early (i.e. before 11pm) you might want to bring some ear plugs as the nightly shows can go until then and are heard in some parts of the resort more than others. Also, don't hesitate to be firm about getting the right number of bath towels for your room if there are more than 2 people staying in it.A few last great things - they give you more than 1 beach towel per person and if you early in the morning, they always have plenty; the 24 hour pizza snack bar is great for the late night munchies; and the beach was beautiful, nice white sand, warm water and plenty of lounge chairs for everyone to sit on!!You will have a good time at the Ocean Bavaro - how can you not with the entertainment staff called the Happy Club!!!!!

<Content>Fantastic Honeymoon Destination My husband and I honeymooned at the Ocean Bavaro this past October and could not have been happier with our choice of resorts. The grounds were lush and tropical and the beach was magnificent. The sand is like walking in brown sugar. We had a room challenge when we first arrived, but the following day were moved into one that was fantastic, with great views from either side. After walking along the beach and seeing the grounds of other resorts, we were again very pleased with the one we chose. After reading a lot of the reviews before we went, we were prepared for something a little different than we actually encountered. The first thing that was noticable was the amount of smoking. These resorts are predominantly occupied with European travellers, and the amount of cigarette smoke is straggering for Canadians used to no smoking in public places. This was a little tough to get used to, and we were thankful for the open air restaurants to be sure! The next was the amount of French spoken. Here we were all prepared with our Spanish dictionary, and relied more upon our high school French to get by than Spanish. This isn't noted in many of the other reviews so I thought I would bring to the fore front. A number of the things that were suggested items to bring we found no use for. The grounds are sprayed for mosquitos regularily, so insect repellant wasn't necessary. We brought insulated mugs with us which we didn't use at all. You drink the drinks so quickly, they don't have a chance to get warm! US$ was better for shopping with than DR pesos, and I came home with a stack of ones that weren't really necessary for tipping.On a longer stay I could see how it would be important to forage better relationships with the staff, however, for just the week that we were there, we did just fine by being nice and leaving a few trinkets for the maid, who inturn kept us readily supplied with bottled water. We were very happy with the food. 24hr pizza is like a dream come true. It is great, but not typical North American pizza so be prepared. If you remember where you are, in a different country, a visitor immersed in a different culutre, and respect the differences, you will have an amazing time in the DR. If you are looking for a Disney like vacation, go to Florida for you'll be setting yourself, your family, and the hard working people of the DR up for a miserable experience if you try to make it into something it's not.Relax and enjoy, and you'll have a wonderful vacation! Cheers!

<Content>Nice Place, Nice Beach but lacking service Hi!I just coming back from a week at Ocean Bavaro in Punta Cana and I would like to share my own review. This is a nice resort but not a 4 stars as describes. Make it more a 3-3.5 star, no more. Take Note.Here's we go by department:RECEPTION: Chaos out there...That didn't start well after you had a delay for the flight and a long flight. It was 2:50pm and we were told the check-in is at 3:00pm, with an arrogant smile. They took our voucher and told us to come back an hour later. When we came back, they were looking for the voucher!!!! Anyway, everytime you need something at the reception, you have to wait 10-15 minutes, minimum as they are slow(they're dominican, remember) and understaff. We needed a lock for the room and I had to spend an hour to get it....Not exactly my kind of vacation. 1/5ROOM: This where you define a 3 star to a 4 star. The room we had was simply ordinary with the bathroom 'under construction'. Pillows are such in a bad shape and bed has been used just too many times. We were in building 7 and it was very noisy at night. AC was fine. TV is OK but you need to go to reception(and wait again) to get the remote. Daily housekeeping was good but they were running out of towels (tips to management: Buy 10,000 towels in one order and keep customers happy) 2.5/5BEACH: The beach is gorgeous and well maintained. They have tons of chairs, nice palm trees, water is blue and warm. You can take daily walk either on the North Side ou South side for hours(I suggest the North side). Some Dominicans have shops by the beach (outside the resort) and they try to be 'friends' in order to sell you crappy stuff but they tend to leave you alone if you acknowledge that you saw them and said no. Again, they had towels problems for the beach. Looks like management are El Cheapo when it's time to buy Towels. Beach 5/5 Towels management 0/5.FOOD: Food was average and they tend to have the same things every day, specially for the main meal. Breakfast was excellent except for the Orange juice, who was tasteless. Lunch  Dinner were OK but a lot of choices in salads and desserts. Nice bread section and never got sicks.Wine is terrible unless you go to a quality bottle (you have to pay). Bresilian restaurant is a joke. Italian  Spanish restaurant were excellent but the appetizers  desserts are still in buffet style, which was disappointing. 3.5/5ENTERTAINMENT: The animation team on the beach is doing his best. Participate in the daily crazy game. They are fun and they will have fun with you if you join them. Music in the lobby is for baby-boomers and not really for the 20-30's crowd. Nightly shows are always danceand are at the amateurs levels but they get a 10/10 for the effort. The negative side is they barely play dominican music in the lobby or at the nightly show and they tend to play a lot of american music. Yeurkkk...Overall, I would recommend you go there with limited exceptations and you should be happy. If you are the 5 starts style, you'll be in for a deception. Will I return? No, as I like to go somewhere else everytime I go in the south.Enjoy.

<Content>Not a good choice for your honeymoon We were at the Ocean Bavaro Dec 5 - 20 /04We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro for two weeks too long. One week would have been good enough (not like there was so much to offer to last two full weeks). We were on our honeymoon so sometimes we like to sleep in but the maids made that impossible, even tipping did not help. even though we had our Do Not Distrub sign posted they were still trying to come in every half hour.The 24 hour Pharmacy Doctor was a joke, One night I had a head ache and the gift shop was closed so I walked over to the Pharmacy to ask them for an asprin or advil, instead he offered me a needle because that is thier remedy, Not cool,Also no one understands English, you could go blue in the face they just nod their heads pretending to understand. This is a very European based resort, mainly Greman, French not many Canadians So don't expect too much and stay open minded.The food was OK as long as you have a strong stomach, FYI they like to put sauce on just about everything.The Club Ferro's was OK but they really like to play Dance Mix 1999, Seriously,Overall the trip was OK nothing great and I would not recommend it again.

This was our first time in the DR and we are planning on returning many more times. The whole trip was amazing. The beach was amazing. You could always know when it was 10am cause the the los panas Happy Club came alive ! They were the nicest people ever. I will never forget Eri, Junior, Daniel, Esther, Jimmy, Pepe, and Aregnas!!!!! You are all the best. They have so much energy. You will never be bored at the beach. I reccommend that take part in the CRAZY Games!! THey are so much fun and you meet so many people. Be prepared to do anything and once the happy club gets to know you they will come find you !!!! Christmas at the Ocean Bavaro was amazing. Santa Claus came to the beach via helicopter and every child got to sit on his lap and received a really nice present. The Christmas eve feast was incredible. Their was everything you could imagine available to eat that night and every night for that fact. We were definetively never bored. There is something here for everyone of all ages. Day or night you'll have a blast. Everyone here is so nice and the staff are constantly working to please the guests. We will definetly be returning to the Ocean Bavaro resort in the very near future!!!! Los Panas Happy Club I miss you! See you again Aregnas !!!!! I luv you all ! See you very soon !!!!

<Content>What a Great Trip Just got back on the 24th from the Ocean Bavarro....what an incredible place for a holiday...highly recommend it...My wife and I had no complaints. The weather was fabulous..it rained the night we arrived then sunny every day following. It gets to about 30 by mid morning and the humidity can be stifling especially if you are not used to 75-85% Relative humidity in that heat. It goes to maybe 23 or 24 overnight. There is almost always a breeze off the water which makes the beach quite bearable. The people are friendly. Topless is optional at the pool and on the beach. Speedos galore no matter what the age or size of the man..a little disturbing actually to look at. The only thing I would have changed is the orientation to the reort wasn't until the next morning making it a little disorientating arriving after a 7 hour flight at 9pm not having a clue where anything is....Suggestions..The Spanish Restaurant is by far the best place to eat.Open theatre by the pool at 10pm nightly has dancers and comedy acts....worth it to watch every nightNo vendors to worry about until you walk past the property line of the resort on the beach, and only then they are only a minor hassle..there is no comparison to those of you who have had the pleasure of dealing with the unrelenting Mexican vendorsThe extracirricular activities are a bit pricey, but two in particular we were told are worth seeing...the safari and the swimming with rays and reef sharks I belive they were calledThey deal with Euros and US dollars as well as their local currency Dominican Peso which is about 25 to one Canadian dollarTake LOTS of sunscreen...SPF 30 was our choice...we are tanned beyond recognition and lathered it on like it was going out of style...I would buy and cigarettes or liquor at the Duty Free and avoid the mini markets..it is cheaper at the airport...FYIWe were blown away at the cost of gas. A Shell gas station we saw on the way to the resort was selling gas at 68 pesos a litre...roughly $3 a litre CDN...we are spoiled having 75 cent gas here in Canada!!!!!!!!! If you need any more info, I would be happy to lend a helping hand. Just drop me an e-mail any time....

<Content>fantastic family holiday First things first. I find it truly staggering to read some of the reviewsfor this hotel. What is the point of moaning about something from 3 years ago. Foreign holidays mean, quite often foreign food, and a very different way of things being done. Stay at home if you are not up to it.To our holiday. Myself ,wife, grown children x2 and 2 grandkids.visited the Hotel from 8-22 Dec, It was the 55th country that i have visited so i have some knowledge of the industry and many different countries.The rooms were clean, cool and ideal. Spacious Hotel grounds kept clean, with well tended plants and hundreds of palm trees, no trouble at all securing sun beds on beach or by pools (3). The buffet restaurantwas well stocked and the food varied, not all spicy. We ate in 4 of the 5 alternative restaurants available and found them all enjoyable, our particular favourite was the Italian. Most of the staff were very friendly, one or two not so, but having heard the way that some of the guests spoke to them, it is hardly surprising. You get out what you put in.Their was none of the alcohol available that i drink at home, no surprise their then, so we all enjoyed what was served, Rum, Liquers, Beer and cocktails. I could go on more, but i am afraid it is all good and not negative as so many reviews are. The age range in our group went from 6 thru to 50 and all of us enjoyed this holiday. Hope you will as well.

<Content>That was great vacation OK, I hate long review. So i'll try to make it short.first don't think a 4 star in Domunicain is equale to a 4 star in usa or canada IT IS NOT!We were staying at the Ocean Cana beach. We have one restaurant buffet extra but we did not had a fridge in the room. room: the room was ok we tried to tip the made so she would give us bottle of water and soda it work 2 days and then nothing. so we stop after a week. Food: Of corse it doesn't taste like home you are not at home. I'm picki so I ate chiken all 2 weeks long. I love the breakfast though. I even had the milk for cereals and it was fine with my stomach. We love the mexican, Burritos are great . Italien was ok, Bresilien is very good but take your diner a 18h30 or 6h30pm the food ( all meat) is a lot better. The Spanish is no good. (well i don't really like fish but my boyfriend do and he didn't like it either. don't miss tyhe buffet on the Saturdays it is the Gala night and there is something lobster or shrimps. beach: is great but there is some sea weeds. nothing to worry about though.ok some tips.: There is the best restaurants at 5 min from the resort. it is call the Coconut beach. if you are face to the ocean it is on your left . The restaurant sell lobster (languste) for 23$ instead of 40$ at the hotel. this restaurant is Fantyastic. the owner is french and very nice. he can give you almost what ever you want. you choose yourself what's is gonna be in your plate.the best tour is a half day catamaran in a small catamaran . The owner is ,again, a french guy call Lorenzo (Laurent). I knwo the compani Air transat sell it you should ask to your rep. this catamaran is only for 15 persons. ok that's enough sorry I wanted to make it short! the hotel is the best we visit... really beatiful place.don't miss the pool bar the best !

<Content>Spend the Extra Go to Secrets!!! The weather in Punta Cana can not be beat, it is lovely exactly what you need in the winter. This was our SECOND trip to Punta Cana and we were very excited to be going again. We use Apple Vacation and got a real good deal. I use this site when choosing resorts and though most were good I should of paid more attention to the bad ones. I know that Punta Cana is the European Caribbean and I accept that and enjoy meeting other people from around the globe. I am in the hotel industry so I am very understanding of the hotels side and all the hard work and effort that goes into the daily activies of a hotel, so I rarely complain so let me begin my story. Upon arrival we were very excited because we get to leave Ohio in December, the resort is only a 20 min ride away(Secrets is about 90 min.), when we got our resort location our first Rep from Secrets Albert was our Apple Rep again (Love Albert he's awesome!!) and the weather was warm and sunny. We get to the resort and were met by Sandra (she's from Germany very nice and friendly she's with Guest Relations) where we were given cool wash clothes and a refreshing drink. We were informed we were given a complimentary upgrade to a Caribbean Spa room, with Ocean View (the room was very large and spacious and the view was spectacular, room 6302) So first impression I was pleased. Got to room and put our DND (Do Not Distrub) on the door and left to see the resort-when we got back there was a fruit basket and 2 bottles of rum left for us on the desk inside our room which still had the DND on the door- A huge NO NO, but I shrugged this off b/c nothing was bothered and it was a welcome gift and I would note it for the end of my stay or if I ran into a manager I'd give them a heads up comment for this really didn't get to me, and usually I end up making friends with one or two of the management staff and life is good. On our second day it was our anniversary and we wanted to take a hot tub in our room, well there was no drain cover. Reported to the front desk at 4- got back to our room at 10 and it was not taken care of. On Wed. not only did we not have a drain cover for our jacuzzi tub but my sink did not have a working drain plug(the drain plunger found at the faucet was gone entirely, had to manually do it from under the sink) and our closet door fell off track. Reported it all to the front desk again who wrote it down in front of me (I was impressed they have a log and I felt confident that it was going to be taken care of from the desk clerk, so I was good) again got back to our room that night and eveything was still broke. On THURSDAY found the Guest Service manager Silvia( she is awesome a bright point in our stay, helped me 3 times with my issues) and she assured me personnaly that she would make sure this was resolved. When we were back in our room we noticed that the closet had been fixed, went to the tub and it still was not fixed and neither was the sink, about 10 min after we got into our room Silvia called to see if all was fixed, told her the closet was but the tub still wasn't fixed, again she appologized and maintenance was back to our room in minutes, and finally 3 days later it was fixed. The sink never got fixed but the most important thing for us was the jacuzzi tub we wanted to use. On Wed we went to the towel exchange to get fresh towles at about 11 am, we were told that we could not have fresh towels because we did not turn our towles in the night before so they did not wash them and they did not have enough towels to exchange them. I about blew, this resort has 788 rooms, it's a family resort so figure 70% have a quad occ, so in my biz. a hotel of this size should have on hand for its guests 1 towel per max occ per room multiply by 2, so roughly this facility should have 5200 beach towels in stock, yet they didn't and even at the towel exchange never had completely full shelves. Also that bathroom only had 2 bath towels, two face clothes-which once you used them they never were replaced, and two hand towels-very poor amenity selection. The service in the buffet is nill, you get better service at a Ponderosa and that is not saying much. We would wait every morning about 10-15 minutes to get coffe cups and another 15 min to flag down a server with coffee. The moring selection was horrid. Nice Euro Selection of meat and cheese but for the american palete nothing at all about 8 hot dishes which I don;t consider mashed potatoes as a breakfast food- NASTY!! The fruits were amazing as they are all very very fresh and the breads were good. The 24 hour snack bar is a joke, the Brazillian restaurant has a good lunch buffet, the main rest. does have a pasta staion which was very good. I can't say enough good about the ala cart restaurants, they were amazing-except never went to the Seafood Rest. had to pay $40 for a spiny Lobster and to me all inclusive means that all inclusive (Sandals is the BEST they have spoiled us so much that nothing can compare to them, but they were out of our budget for this year, just bought a new house). Even though it is makreted as a Spa and Resort you can not charge the Spa services to your room, have to pay at time of Service because the Ocean Spa is not the same company. Your drinks are basicly rum and draft beer, want a bottle pay 2 bucks, not used to that at all. Bar service slow. Maid service was ok, they really don't annouce themselves or know before entry which was annoying they got us 2x. They do triple sheet the bed which is very nice, a very good look and a great standard to have yet our sheets had holes in them. We took a gift card with us and still should of had a balance of $95.00 left on Sunday yet we were told insuffienct funds, we only used it in the Spa and tring to get them to understand to help you was useless. This lead to a 90 min circle chase for me on Monday trying to get a manager to talk to because we believed that we were doubled billed and I knew that once back in the states trying to fight this and reserach it would be near impossible. We missed our inital shuttle for at 10:15 I found the reservation Manager who finnally got Silva for me who took me to Victor the Resident Rooms Division Manager for me to talk to. Finally after all was said they got the reports I asked for so I could research my cc# to see if it was doulbled billed. I found that a duplicate auth. was made and due to a Debit card and not a Credit card the funds were frozen and I was fine with that, it gave me the answer I needed to calm my husband sown who thought we were scammed but WE WERE NOT and although I have a VERY Bad experience I don't think anyone there would have done that to anyone. The non-motorized sports are basiclly kyaking and the hobies. All other what I would call non motorized and have been at other resorts cast $$$$$ and again you can't charge it to your room, differant company (and for me the whole inclusive thing is so you don't have to carry cash on you) like snorkeling, you have to pay $35.00 for them to take you to the reef to snorkel. Banana Boating costs $6.00 pp and the dbl tube costs $12 pp and we thought not worth is b/c banana boating is very fun and a bigger thrill. We did parasail and that was awesome. Booked it at the Water Activity building and it was nice. There are tons of vendors to bug you which is horrible, the resort should not allow this activity it is not very relaxing to reroute your walk because you see a land shark w/ flyers. Avoid the Tower Casino, they have about 3 employees per gambler and they are on you like flies on ----. The gift shop has no quality gifts and is pricey, def. walk to the little shops right outside the hotel, you can barter and get good deals. The area I would definatley return to. This resort I would not. Even though I felt better once I left Victors office and his appology was sincere and his route of action was made known and both his and Silvia's invitaion to come back and expericene their service b/c my experience was not what they provide I still have had much better experiences at All Inclusives that truly are inclusive and have made me feel welcomed and the level of service is beyond the call. I ran into many people woth similar complaints and one lovely lady from Quebec City who after one day was asking her tour operator to switch hotels for she could not spend 14 days of her holiday there has alot to say. I did enjoy myself to a point b/c it is beautiful there the weather is high 80's -low 90's in the day and mid 70's at night and rain if it happens comes and goes, although it did rain all day Thur of our stay but we stayed in the Spa (Maria is great!!!). Oh, don't hot tub or Sauna at the Spa it's $5.00 pp and for only 20 min, the hot tub is cold and not relaxing and it is advertized as free and the gym is a joke, equipment is old rusty and malfunctioning. The resort I believe is more Euro friendly as to American friendly and it shows in the service. The management I met were great but not enough to bring me back. GO TO SECRETS or they also have a Fiesta Palladum here which I stayed in in Riveria Maya and enjoyed myself emmensly.

<Content>Food warning In 2001, My wife and I went there on our Honeymoon. The room was damp, full of wierd bugs outside the door anytime it rained, including a frog that scared he heck out of a staff member whom I asked to remove it. (When he saw it he jumped, ran to get a towel and chased it out, frog OK, but I am assuming it was poisonous) and the worst of all, I got a severe case of Salmonella poisoning as did most of the people in my group. As of now, 2004, I am still on Dicetel.  Resort denied any problem. We're going to Cuba this year!

<Content>2nd December - 16th December 2004 The Hotel - Clean, Well presentedThe Room - Clean spacious, sattelite tv, cleaned daily and fridge stocked up daily also, But Something happend to the air conditiong a few times and we where getting a smell of diesel through it and i think the rooms where sprayed with pestacides and its affected two of the people who travelled with us, (Breathing Problems), One ommited to hospital back in UK and other been told they have Bronchitis. And also when they where checked out at the on site doctors they wer charged 拢100+ for the treatments they recieved.The Restaurants - (Only ate in buffet) Alot of choice but not what i am used to back in the UK, Most foods have got spices etc in them which where not to my taste. (Gave 2/4 of us diarrhea)The Bars - All alcohol is locally made and pretty rank.The Entertainment - Crap really.The Shops - Extortionate, dont shop there, if you have to buy something go out of the complex and down to Amelias everythings really cheap there and theres alot of choice compared to inside the Hotel.The Beach - Pretty nice though the locals trying to sell you stuff on the beach front is really annoying, they dont leave you alone.Overall - Pretty Terrible holiday , wouldnt go fully inclusive again either. (And try to avoid one of the Reps Bill probably the most annoying person on the planet, always whistling loudly and bursting out in song and tryin to be the centre of attention from 24 hours a day) Not Exaggerating.

<Content>DOUBLE D just came back from the dominican, dec. 6. just a little history, we have gone to cuba(TRYP CAYO). mexico(BAHIA) and puerto plata(BAHIA) (just last year) so, if we are a little bit harsh.. u cant blame us.we travelled with another family. we ourselves have a 19 month old baby and the other family has a 5 year old and a 8 month old. the flight to the resort was ok. though it took us almost 8 hours because there was a stop over at puerto plata-but overall we were happy. when we got to the airport, we knew where to go. we were directed to a van that took us to the resort. the drive to the resort was short--i believe it's less than an hour. still, we we're all excited to see what this resort can offer us. when we got there...no one to greet us, no one to direct us where to go...but still we knew what to do. finally, lady gave us some drinks and towels--to wash our face? the other family had no problem getting their room...us on the other hand had alot of trouble. still, we decided to head to their buffet for lunch. after lunch (reviews belows about their food). we waited for a couple of hours and then we finally got our bed. our room was the standard room. it was ok, with the furnitures a little bit slanted because of the floors, we we're put on a third floor ,so having an 19 month old didnt help everyday, carried her up and down. we had trouble with our bed, when we sat down and the leg fell off...they fixed it no problem though.food:their buffets were weak and a definite double D, they only had 8 hot foods, pasta bar, and the cold bar. yeah, u probably think that's alot but for us that has been to different resorts--8 hot foods where weak. the food was ok--it was liveable. we only used their buffet at night twice the whole time we were there, breakfast was ok--the best thing they had was the egg bar--when someone makes ur egg.---oh yeah, i loved their croissants--i had those everyday i was there. for lunch times, we went to the bahia restaurant by the beach, food again was ok for me. they had fries and sometimes good hot food. dinner, was alright..not alot of selection of foods.a-la-cartes, we took advantage of their a-la cartes restaurant. we knew we didnt like the buffet so we pre-booked all their restaurant. the first one we went to was the brazllian restaurant. it's set by the beach, so that was good, they served different kind of meats, i thought the food was alright still, we never went back to that restaurant. the next one we went to was the mexican--this was a good one. food was delicious--the selection they have for their appetizers was double with what the buffet has. we liked this so much we went twice to this restaurant. the spanish restaurant was the other good restaurant. they served real good food. oh, by the way--deserts for those restaurants were to die for...they were so good we asked if we could bring some back to our room. the other restaurant was the italian---we didnt like the food that much over there. so, for me and my sister in law, food was ok, we're picky but not as picky as my husband and my brother. they rated their food especially the buffet very poor and they were totally dissapointed. the restaurants ( a la carte) for me and my sister was good ( we even went twice to 2 restaurants) but my husband and brother--they thought it was ok.the beach.--wow!! this is the nicest beach we've gone. we all agreed that this was the highlight of the resort. they have it lighted at night for people like us that wants to walk around. enjoyed the nice beach everyday.the pool--was good. they had kids pool and our kids enjoyed it alot.the entertainment--was good. they have great costumes and great chereographer.trips- we only took one trip outside the resort. we rented a taxi and he agreed to drive us to the nearest city--higuey. the city was ok, we did some shopping over there....they really try to price things over the top and then from the haggling...it drops to 75%. on our way home we stopped by plava bavaro- did some shopping over there too...again they price things too much. still, we got some good deals.overall, i think it was an ok trip. still, i wont come back to this resort. would i recommend this to someone...nah--probably not.my husband thinks it was a dissapointment--and would not even consider coming back.

<Content>A Wonderful Holiday... What can I say, this holiday was amazing. I am actually sitting in the VIP suite at Punta Cana airport waiting to fly back to the UK after 2 wonderful weeks at Ocean Bavaro Hotel. We paid an extra $25 approx for the VIP suite but its well worth it, free drinks, snacks, free internet (hence me writing this review!), films and air conditioning! If you do book this make sure you go get your Duty Free first as you are not allowed to leave the VIP lounge once you are in.Now about the holiday....from the moment we arrived we had a fantastic time, when we checked in we found that we had been upgraded (free of charge), I don't know why as we werent a honeymoon couple or anything, but I am not complaining, the room was out of this world, we were in Block 6, room 6304, we had an ocean view, huge bathroom, a beautiful 4 poster bed, and a few steps down from the bed we had a seating area and a spa which looked out over the ocean - amazing! The maid came in every day, she was ever so friendly and although she spoke no english we still managed to communicate as we took a spanish phrase book! We left 2$ or so each day for her and she always made sure we were looked after.Food - The main buffet was good, breakfast was great, so much to choose from omlettes to waffles and doughnuts. Evening meals were ok, although sometimes they had strange choices of food on the menu, and they like using bananas in lots of meals! We ate at all the restaurants and liked them all, although at the spanish restaurant my meal was a little cold. My favourites were the Mexican and Brazilian.Beach - the beach was great, just like the pictures in the brochures, white sand, palm trees, turquoise blue sea, although at times the waves were a little rough. Also it is on the Atlantic side not the Caribbean side but it was still great.All the staff were friendly, and tried their best to speak English - they cant do enough for you and always say hello as they walk past. We only went on 1 trip which was to swim with the dolphins in the sea - it was amazing and an experience I will never forget - this costs $85 each but its well worth it.All in all this was one of the best holidays we've ever had and would recommend the resort to everyone.

<Content>For those who already booked ...., and others ofcourse :-) Hi,We just returned from a 12 days stay at this hotel. I'm Dutch speaking so please dont mind my spelling.I'll try to be brief.Chapter : overviewBasically the hotel is OK. So if you've already booked, relax :-).Nice beach, very nice pools (3 pools). Its the ocean side of the island though... very strong waves and some seaweeds will be part of your stay there. Personally i found the waves to be fun. If you like to snorkle you'll probably be less happy with them.Different kinds of non-moterised water-sports are available. There is 24/24 security at the beach and on the hotel terrains.Apreciation : 4 1/2 starsChapter : RoomWe explicitely demanded for a recently renewed and quiet room. So they put us in blok 100. The room was OK. Not fancy, but certainly within expectations. No problems here.Apreciation : 3 1/2 starsWe went out to buy cigars early during our stay. That same day we got a breakin in our room. I'm pretty sure they were after the cigars. Somebody tried to force open our suitcase. They failed. We did rent the safe after this. I strongly advice to rent a safe. Chapter : FoodThe main buffet is quite nice. At the right side there are usually 2 cooks roasting meat / fish. At the left end of the buffet there is a custom pasta bar. The sause is made 'on demand'. These 3 spots give the best food :-). There's always rice, potatous, chicken or pork and local veggies. You'll learn how to cook bananas at 1001 ways.Me and my wife both got troubles from the food. If you want to be safe stick to rice and pasta. It worked for me.Appart from my choise to limit my diet after getting sick, the buffet does not realy vary a lot. The offerings are quite similar day after day.Apreciation : 3 1/2 starsWe only tried 2 specialty restaurants : the italian (very good, best crew at the hotel) and the brasilian (wanna be grill, would'nt recommend it). We also went to a seafood restaurant outside the hotel. There are 3 of them at 10 minutes to the left at the beach. We went to 'Captain Cook'. 40 dollars per person for an all-in seafood mix including 1 big and 2 smaller 'langousts' (per person). This is cheaper than the seafood offer by the hotel.Very anoying issue regarding the specialty restaurants is the obligation to make reservations. No reservation, no service. Regardless available tables.Chapter : BarsThere are several bars at the hotel : main pool bar, 2 beach bars, bar at the reception, may be forgetting 1 or 2. They serve the usual soft drinks, beer, local cocktails. the main pool bar and reception bar also serves other alcohols like whiskey etc. Service is regular. The bartender at the pool-bar seems quite a specialist at coctails. The softdrink-machines suffered some breakdowns.Apreciation : 3 1/2 starsChapter : ServiceMost employees are friendly. Although at least half only speaks espanol they generaly try to understand you, or get someone who does speak englisch / french.They do their best to help, but within their 'job'. Do not expect them to do extra or 'care for you'. They dont. If you ask something to the wrong guy, they will be very friendly and all, but nothing will happen.Nice example : we had a fire-alarm in our block. Response time was over 1 hour. The alarm kept on sounding all the time. I think reception must have gotten 20 calls about it and eventually another guest went out, grabbed somebody and brought him back. 15 minutes later the alarm was turned off.Apreciation : 3 starsIf we ever go back to the domenican republic we will probably look for a higher rated hotel. The one thing that eventually got on our nerves is the personel. At a 4 star hotel you do not expect anybody who is in place (at a bar / a restaurant , wherever ...) to answer a request by something like 'we start serving at 10h'. Especially not when its 9h50. It makes for the hotel to 'experience' or 'feel' way below its 'looks'.General rating : 3 1/2 stars

<Content>Not a place to return to... I鈥檓 rather late in posting this, so apologies.My partner and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro in May/June this year. After extensively reading reviews from Trip Advisor we felt we were well prepared鈥?Latin American Spanish phrase book and a positive attitude we landed in the Dominican Republic for one very well deserved holiday.We had upgraded our room 鈥?i.e. a suite with Jacuzzi and International Alcoholic drinks included, plus a few extras.The hotel 鈥?Immaculate, always cleaning every area.The room 鈥?lovely, had a leak in the bathroom they tried to fix but couldn鈥檛 鈥?no problem we lived with it. Light bulb out 鈥?replaced within a couple of hours.Maid service everyday 鈥?left a Two Dollar tip each day and Five at the end of the first week.Restaurants 鈥?The Italian does the best fillet steak in the world and the staff were lovely.The Brazilian 鈥?Yuk 鈥?Don鈥檛 bother unless you like meat that has been cooked for a month! 鈥?Staff 鈥?miserable.The Mexican 鈥?Only if you like VERY spicy food. 鈥?Staff 鈥?efficient.Buffet - Nice but repetitive 鈥?however the staff there were the best. One of the waitresses gave us a gift of coffee beans on our last day, which was really sweet of her. (My fianc茅 ended up giving her a twenty dollar tip before we left 鈥?smart move on her part鈥?Warning! - All the food have spices in them, even the bread. You can鈥檛 detect it but if you suffer from a fragile stomach you will know about it! It cost me Forty Two dollars to get a prescription of Ten Zantac from the doctor!Make sure you take enough Imodium and ant acids to last you twice what you thing you鈥檒l need.The Bars - These spoilt our holiday and will ensure we do not return to the Dominican Republic. I have never met such rude people as those working in the bars at the Bavaro.One guy rudely told us to 鈥榟urry up鈥?and decide when we were choosing what to drink 鈥?you quickly get sick of Rum (And I鈥檓 a Bacardi drinker at home).They also hated giving us international drinks even though we had the wrist bands to prove we could have them. One guy used to say they didn鈥檛 have any Baileys even when they did鈥?br/>And it wasn鈥檛 through lack of tipping either.I don鈥檛 think they knew what a smile was鈥?br/>The Beach 鈥?hope you like seaweed and the cold鈥?Punta Cana is on the Atlantic side of the ocean NOT the Caribbean as the travel agents advertise.Go to the south it鈥檚 got fantastic beaches.Oh and water sports鈥?No motorised ones at all. That was 鈥榠ncluded鈥?in the upgrade鈥?The worst part was the language barrier though鈥?remember the phrase book, well we really did try and it got us nowhere. The staff just weren鈥檛 interested in trying to understand us and that was disappointing. I found out when we got back after speaking to others that had gone to the DR that they don鈥檛 really like the English鈥?br/>Overall the holiday was ok but I wouldn鈥檛 return to the Dominican Republic if the Ocean Bavaro is a typical representation. There were other things that added to this, but as this has become a very long review鈥?br/>Try the Bahamas, it鈥檚 really beautiful and very very friendly.

<Content>Maybe americans are a bit picky !! I passed 2 weeks in this wonderful resort with a lot of facilities: 3 large pools, 1 buffet with a lot of choices, 5 restaurants 脿 la carte (mexican-brasilian-spanish-fast food and seafood $), a big-large-wide beach with purely white sand. The animation was wonderful every night and every day. By the way, this hotel is made, basically, for Europeens. It's like the Club Med but a bit cheaper. Maybe americans dislike the people there (80% of French, German, Spanish and Canadian). Americans are always critical about what's out of their country, so that's why there is some bad commentaries that, by the way, are all from American people. THIS HOTEL IS EXCELLENTOpinion: 3 1/2 stars for the rooms, 3 1/2 stars for the buffet, 4 1/2 for the restaurants 脿 la carte, 5 stars for the Spa, 5 stars for the beach. Il you're going there for relaxing, you will be served !!

<Content>Relaxing Vacation... I just returned from Ocean Bavaro on 10/26/04.Room:We were first given a room in block 2. I had requested a room with a king size bed and this room had 2 doubles so I immediately went back to the front desk to ask for a change. Person at the desk told me they had none available but had a room where there was 1 double instead of 2. The bellman took us for a ride to take a look but when we got to the room we noticed the room was occupied. We ended up getting a room in the caribbean spa suite in block 6. The room had an odor but half a bottle of perfume took care of that for the rest of the week. We had a problem the first night with the AC. There was water all over the floor from the AC. They told us to keep the temp in the cold/cool range and the problem was solved.We pretty much had to ask every day for more towels and water. Food:I would say the buffet was below average only because there are birds and insects flying around all over the place. The insects hover around food and I just couldn't eat much after seeing that. I found a bug crawling around one vegetable dish one night. As for the a la carte restaurants, I liked the Brazilian the best. Mexican was pretty good also. The Spanish and Italian were decent.The waiters were very nice though. Pool/Beach:The only problem with the pool/beach was getting towels. They run out of towels and are slow in replacing them. The beach was kept decently clean. There were seaweeds and branches in the water but since the waves were pretty strong it would be pretty hard to clean up everything. The poolside bar was very nice. Bartenders here were nicer than at the reception area.Excursions:I only did 1 excursion and that was to Saona Island.A bus picks you up at the resort early in the morning. You drive through a village/town to get to the main docking area. We were on a medium sized sailboat for the ride to Island. They had music and plenty of rum and beer. We had about 2-3 hours on the Island. It rained pretty hard but people were still in the water and having fun. They provided lunch. We then went on a speedboat to a natural pool and snorkeling.Weather:It was mainly overcast during our trip. 3 out of 8 days were very nice days. The other days were overcast with occasional thunderstorms. Overall:I would say this trip was very relaxing. I had some complaints about the resort/service but nothing that made my trip miserable. But if I returned to Punta Cana I would probably want to try a different hotel.

<Content>Loved this place Went here in July 2004. Loved the place! Was wary of going from the bad reviews that I read on here, ignore them all I say! The hotel was immaculate, people where always cleaning round, although there is a small language barrier the staff do know basic english, if you do have any problems the best people to see are the reps. Relating to those reviews who critisise the lack of English they should respect the fact that they are in another country, these people are the rude ones who are ignorant enough to think English should be the main language in every country!!!I would definetly reccomend this hotel, It has everything! If you tip the waiter at the bar as soon as he sees your drink getting low there is another without even asking!The food is nice although it is reccomended that you take immodium with you. All resturants where nice, my particular favourite was the Spanish!Overall a great place to go!

<Content>Great Vacation Little background before I begain. I'm 32 and own a nightclub here in VA. Melissa, my wife, is 33 and is a inside sales rep for Furgeson Enterprises.We went to Ocean Bavaro the week of October 2nd. We had a great time and would go back. It was probably one of the most enjoyable resorts that we've had gone to. Previous experience includes Antigua's Jolly Beach Resort, Playa Del Carman's El Dorado Royale and Montigo Bay's Half Moon Club to name just a few. I'll go over the basics.Resort: The landscaping was emaculant. The lay out is from east to west. The beach was on the East side of the resort. Powdery white sand. Very large beach. The water was not as clear as some of the other resorts and beaches I've been too but it was warm and inviting. There is a bit of seaweed both on the shore and a few feet in the water from the beach. Not a big deal. It's still very beautiful. Next is the relaxation pool next to a restaurant that is buffet style during the day and then the Seafood restaurant at night. Didn't eat there at all as neither my wife nor me are seafood eaters. The 24 hours quick serve (pizza, burgers, grilled cheese sandwiches) is attached. Above is the spa and workout rooms. The relaxation pool is exactly that. Quiet for the most part and under used. Great place if you want to chill. Most of the villas are also located around here. Next up is the main pool complex. A swim up bar is the highlight. The pool is quite big. Has a couple of islands in the middle that was landscaped with coconut and fig trees? The swim up bar is probably the focal point of the sun up hours. Always bustling with activity and party goers. We enjoyed most of our days lounging or drinking around the main pool. Here we partied with people from all over the world. Germans, English, Italians, Canadians, French, and even a couple from Belgium. Language barriers do exist but everyone seemed to understand the word Tequila! English was limited though. We only met a few Americans here. Learning some Spanish will go a long way in being able to fully communicate on this resort. But it wasn't a huge problem. We got by. So will you. Next over are the majority of regular rooms for which we stayed in and will go into a little more later. The main dinning room is attached to the Lobby, and the rest of the specialty restaurants. The Disco is also located in this complex. It appears they are undergoing some renovations to the villas and other areas while we where there.Rooms: We read the stories about mold and other problems people with their rooms had. We stayed in the 100 block which was the closest rooms to the main road. Yes, we had the glorious view of the road and another resort across the street. But that's okay, we didn't really stay in our rooms for long. Other then the view, the room was quite perfect. We had a huge king size bed that was rather comfortable. A 27inch TV that had 11 English speaking channels. ESPN, ESPN2, CNN, CNN HEADLINE, NBC, FOX, Spike TV, HBO TBS, TNT and Showtime were it. Not bad. Couldn't watch any of the Sunday day NFL football games. If you like Soccer, you'll be in heaven though. The decor and furniture was quite Spartan though. Only one chair, a small dresser was all. My wife unpacked, but I had to keep my clothes in my luggage because I had no were to keep them. Not a big deal, but could have used extra space. The bathroom was very large and the shower had excellent water pressure. Which by the way doubled as a hand held shower head.Food: Lot of variety but nothing like home. The main dinning room was a buffet and we ate the majority of our meals there. The fruits and vegetables were very fresh and high quality. We ate plenty of both. My wife loved the tomatoes. Simply the best she thinks she's ever had and she's a tomato freak. There was at least one dish every all the major meats available. Pork, Beef, chicken and Fish. There was also a pasta station where you picked your own ingredients and the chef put them together for you. Very nice for pasta lovers. There was also some funky things like cow tongues, pig snots and kidneys available for you exotic eaters. I stuck to the safe side and didn't really experiment with the stuff I didn't know. The food was pretty good for what I did choose to eat. No problems. But like I said, it's not home style, it's local style. We only eat in the Italian and Mexican specialty restaurant Good but not exciting. We never made it to the Spanish and Brazilian restaurants. I heard the Brazilian was okay. Never heard anything about the other. The Chef's restaurant was closed the entire week.Staff. Never really had any problems during our stay there with the exception of hooking up with the Expedia rep. He kept missing our meetings which really ------ me off because he was the one we had to set up our pick up with. Finally, I went to the Guest Relations person and she personally handled everything for us. Thank God! Unlike other resorts I've been too, one thing about this staff from the maintenance man to the manager, everyone said Hola to you. Everyone was friendly and as helpful as they could be. Our favorite member of the staff was Luis who worked the main dinning room for breakfast and lunch then moved over to work the swimup bar after 3pm. Great kid. Loved him to death and he really went out of his way. We tipped him very good before he went home for a couple of days to see his family. The maid kept our room very clean and well stocked. We left here small bottles of perfume everyday and tipped her at the end. Just remember one thing. This guys and girls only make around 120 US every month. Try to leave them a little something. We tipped a few of the other bartenders and servers too. But that's just us. The vast majority of the employees of the resort knew at least a little bit of English. But not all. Okay, here the only things that really bothered me. The towel spot was located on the beach. A VERY long walk for those of us staying in the 100 block. Not a big deal but I wished they had set up shop near the main pool. Make more sense in my opinion. The resort also did let a few of the excursion vendors walk the property. While chilling at the pool, at least one a day, Joel from the rancho ranch or whatever the hell he was selling was approached us. We ended up not doing any outside activities as we enjoyed the resort very much. One couple we partied with earlier in the week, the Belgium couple went on the trip that involved the dune buggies and got VERY sick. Ended up having to stay in the hospital, not the clinic for 2 days. Not very good. That might have influenced our decision not to do any excursions. But hey, we didn't feel we missed anything. Anyway, that pretty much it as to our negatives. Not very much at all. Also, be careful of your single women. The entertainers were closely along the lines of Dirty Dancing as they tried to hook up, some very aggressively, at the disco at night.In conclusion, this was a very good trip. A lot of activity goes on from day to night. We partied all week and enjoyed ourselves. We definitely hope to return.

<Content>Great We went to the Ocean Bavaro hotel back in july this year. The staff were great and they worked really hard and long hours and always smiled. The food was nice but nothing over the top. Our room was amazing. We will go back there again in a few years time..

<Content>What a Laugh - Even with the Hurricane. We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from 02/09/04 - 18/09/04. We were due to fly home on 16/09/04 however got delayed due to the hurricane. My only problem with this holiday was with our tour operator Thomson, who were crap!!!! On our departure date we had no reps around to tell us anything, eventually we checked out as we were convinced the coach outside was for our flight. It was not, and we were left with no room for 24hrs as we could not contact anyone from Thomson, even going via England.Apart from this fact we had a wicked holiday. We were 2 single girls aged 23  26 who were actually quite worried we were gonna be bored stiff on a couples holiday. This was not the case, there was something for everyone and we met some brilliant people and had a lot of laughs!Also another point. Not many of the websites say much about the disco on site at the hotel. It is like a small nightclub, we had some real laughs in there (do not worry it is not like a kids disco). All I can say is I would go back in a second!!!!

<Content>Had a Blast I went there in March 2004. We had an excellent time in Punta Cana. Hotel was very clean, room was great with a wonderful ocean view and a balcony, and everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The bartenders were great, had a lot of fun with them especially at the swim-up bar and they DO NOT water down the liquor. The only drawbacks were English was a thrid language; Spanish, French, then English; but the front desk and bartenders do speak english so it isnt that difficult to communicate. The food was pretty good but i was not very happy with the breakfast; eggs were runny or over cooked and the milk for cereal was cool. Other then that was food was pretty good and available 24 hours. And i must compliment and thank the hotel staff, especially the PR gentlemen, Ebert. The day we were to come home we got to the airport and I lost all of my fiances identification. We went back to the hotel and were met by Ebert who took us all around the hotel looking for it, made a bunch of phone calls to help us and came back to the airport with us to talk to the head of the airlines, since neither of us speak Spanish. It all worked out and we got home the next day, but any hotel that would do that for a guest i would highly recommend to anyone.

<Content>Excellent w/a few flaws I must say this was truly a relaxing vacation. My husband and I enjoyed just laying on the beach, or visiting Rapheal at the swim up bar. My biggest problem was the food. It was not what we expected, but we were able to make selections that were okay with us. The room was excellent, but has a mold smell that made me sick by the time we were ready to head home. All in all, it was great fun the rooms were nice and the amenities were okay. May just try a different resort next year.

<Content>It was just OKAY! My husband and I have been to the follwoing resorts: Breezes Varadero, Breezes Bahamas, Melia Cancun, Paladium Riviera Maya, Tryp Cayo Coco, Marival Puerto Vallarta and several cruises. Well we have ranked this the worst place for several reasons. Staff was very slow and disrespectful. It seemed they were forcing themelves to be nice! We realized that there was a three tier braclet system which we were not aware of: Gold is VIP and you get everything including champagne and special international alcohol, every other bracelet (violet and orange) does not get these perks. The first room we got in block 7 looked like it went through war! After complaining that the safe was broken and hanging by one screw (which we paid for $20 USd plus a $15 USD deposit), bed sheets stunk like vomite, the bathroom was filthy and tiles were coming apart. We had two sepearte beds when we requested a king and at that point we complained since we felt this was a little outrageous. The hotel manager was kind enough to give us an upgrade to the corner room in the same block overlooking the ocean. Well just put it this way, the previous room was like paradise compared to this new hell hole. The bell boy who helped us change rooms felt really bad and he had the manager change us to another room, but this time we went to the really nice ones in block 100. Day two was when our vacation started; nice room with high ceilings, colorful walls, king bed, clean bathroom and everything was just brand new; by the way the bed sheets smelled good! The manager sent us a nice fruit platter with 2 rum bottles for the grief we went through which was very nice of him to do (Heronimo thank you). The food was alright and other than the pile of ants eating our bread at the italian restaurant, the al a carte restos were OKAY. The best meal was the meal we had to pay for at Bucanero (lobster resto), however after 6 days of similar foods from the restos and buffet, its worth the $35USD per person. We realized that US money is still more valuable than any other currency including their own peso and also the EURO. It seems that the Domincans math skills are better than ours.....they seem to multiply well but do not know how to divide when converting currency!!!! Just put it this way, they want only USD. My husband was able to get a price for a charm necklace from 1200 pesos ( about $110 CAD) to $5 USD???? That math does not work????? Anyhow, this is the BS we had to put up with. We understand they are poor people but someone must tell them we are not idiots either. The beach was probably the worst we seen in the carribeans; water was hazy green with tons of sea weed (maybe due to Hurrican Frances???). The nice thing is they had plenty beach chairs. The animation team and entertainment tried very hard and we gave them an E for effort. The light water show was the best show. We spent more time on the Ocean Cana side where the italians were harbored, however their buffet was awesome. The pool on that side was quiet and had a nice waterfall.The landscape was really nice and great for romantic pictures (they also had flamingos in the pond). Anyhow, to make a long story short, it was probably worth the $760 CAD per person we paid, but I would not pay more or rate this higher than a 3.5 star.

<Content>Almost bad ! Today麓s 8 of Semptember, and me and a group of 16 persons we spend a week in this hotel, well for me was my second time in Punta Cana, the first time i was in a nearby hotel ( Melia Tropical Caribe ***** 5 stars ). I rated this hotel a two stars ( ** ) hotel , in what concerns food , this wasn麓t at very good quality and not many diferent kind of it , the beach is fantastic, with a bar in it (very good too), the gardens were good and clean, the tematic restaurants : Brazilian ( bad food, no quality at all), Italian (good), Spanish (good ) Mexican ( good ) .The room was the worst room that i have was in my life, when we arrive i could fell in my feet some sand, so this wasn麓t very clean , the bathroom was with troubles some water fall from the upstairs room (i talk with some of my freinds and most of them have problems with the room, this wasn麓t a exclusive problem of mine ). When i was in Punta Cana for my first time (5 yares ago ) in Melia Tropical Caribe, i felt kindness in the employes, in Melia they were very professional, for instance when i sit on a table for a meal , i don麓t want to wait 10 minuts or more to have my drink, and this is a exemple like others .When i start to search hotel i read some reviews, and i expected a 4 stars hotel , belive me if you are waiting for it in Ocean, forget.

<Content>Loved our Room This is the first trip my husband and I have taken by ourselves. We have been to mexico 5 times and jamaica and we had the best time by ourselves. We enjoyed the ocean bavaro. We had a beautiful room. 6304. The best room we have ever had. I still dont know how we got it but it was wonderful.. The shows at night were ok. Nothing great. The food was pretty good. We liked the Italian and mexican speciality the best. The buffets were the about the usual. I am a beach person and I was disappointed. I thought the water would be more blue but it wasnt. It is more of a teal green. It also had some seaweed. So far the riviera maya in mexico has the most beautiful water that ive been too. Shopping uneventful, it is a pretty poor country.

<Content>Loved it!!! I just spent 7 nights in Ocean Bavaro with 3 single female friends. The resort is beautiful and big, with 3 swimming pools, bars, spa, airconditioned rooms, watersports, nice beachfront, beach parties and lots of activities. How can you go wrong when the hotel activities staff is called the Happy Club. The staff was friendly, and there were classes throughout the day and cheesy performances every night. It's not a luxury vacation, but it's very relaxing and fun, and I would definitely go back.The tourists were mostly couples and families, with a smattering of other singles. Nightlife was somewhat lacking, but we created our own (including a trip to an offsite disco called Mangu). I would definitely recommend this place - it's one of the best vacations I've had in a while.If you're going, here are some recommendations for you:Get a room on the third floor of bloque 5 or 6 (the upper floors seem to have newer rooms)Reserve dinner at all 4 restaurants ahead of time. They book up quickly, and it's a nice change from the buffet.Bring: singles for tips and 'extra requests' (for example a few bucks to the maid will get you lots of extra bottles of water), mosquito repellant and calamine lotion, box of immodium (we had a couple of short bouts of diarrhea that immediately went away with the immodium), credit card or extra money for motorized watersports (banana boat, scuba diving, parasailing, etc) or excursions (the Ocean Safari trip was fun)Avoid buffet food with mayonnaise if it's in the sun, and have your meat cooked a little more than usual.Say hello to Santiago, the poolside bartender. He's great.Have fun!!!!! (and don't sweat the small stuff)

<Content>Mixed feelings about the resort We held high expectations for this resort and were somewhat disappointed. The rooms were acceptable and clean. Most of the staff treated us respectfully and graciously. We did have problems with making reservations for the other restaurants. The person messed up the dates and there was no recognition that a mistake had been made. We saw this happen with someone else two other times.Be prepared, however, to hear little American English spoken. You can take Spanish lessons each morning, but it is mostly vocabulary words. Polishing up my 25 year old high school Spanish before we went would have been of great help after I broke my rib our first day of vacation when I fell off the banana boat...The English at the hospital was fairly clear, but I had trouble communicating my pain and understanding what the medications were. This probably won't happen to you!Lots of German, French, and Italian guests. Oh, and don't be shocked at the topless bathing. Everyone is very European about it! It did take my daughters by surprise.One plus is that there are many activities for all ages. The entertainment team is lots of fun and always had a crowd for their activities on the beach. One reviewer noted that your kids would be able to eat freely of the ice cream and pizza and burgers. This is true, but the pizza is nothing like American pizza! One bite and it was in the garbage. Burgers ok, but again, not what we expected. We usually ate at the buffet, which had loads of choices. Just not things my kids were comfortable eating. The fruit was fresh tasting and we ate a lot of that, along with bread. Freshly fried doughnuts every morning! I actually think the food would have tasted fine if you are familiar with local cuisine.We were able to eat at the Italian, Mexican, and Brazilian restaurants. Again, the Mexican food definitely had a DR flavor to it so was not a big hit. The Italian restaurant was probably the best, though it wasn't Italian like we are used to. The Brazilian restaurant serves LOTS of food: at least 3 different types of meat and lots of rice and starch.It can be difficult securing a shady spot on the beach. In fact, one day two people argued dreadfully over one stealing a shady spot from the other. Lots of chairs available, but you definitely want some shade from the hot sun. Quite comfortable in the shade, even in July.You will find little in the way of souvenirs. There is some jewelry and clothing in the little gift shop, but don't leave your sunscreen or toiletries behind! A bottle of sunscreen was $21 American! You can walk down the beach where other vendors are located but be prepared for agressive selling! If you show the remotest interest in an item they assume a sale. Great for people who love to barter.It was difficult for me to be staying in a luxury resort with such excess in food and drink when the village appeared quite poor. A little hard to justify the American tendency for overindulgence. However, if your palette is eager for different foods, you take some anti-diuretic medicine with you, and enjoy the beach, this place will suit.

<Content>Paradise! Just like the 'Litl' adverts - beautiful and totally relaxed!! Two weeks of total chill out! A great resort where you can do as much or as little as you want. Gorgeous place, great room, friendly staff and the view is to die for!! What more can you ask?? Food is great, although its tough for the British digestive system to deal with the cocktails and tropical fruit, so do remember to take immodium! Definately reccommend this resort - wish I were back there now!

<Content>Don't forget Imodium Just came back after 2 weeks of bliss but as the title suggest DONT FORGET THE IMODIUM. All my family had the raging trots. It didn't ruin our holiday though. Take plenty of $1 bills for tips. We left $1 a day for the maid and she done a top job, leaving towels with petals on them and made swans out of them. Always see the bar tenders are ok as well it really does help.  The food was ok. Book for the Italian restaurant, we went twice and was not dissapointed. Make sure you book early as both times we could not get in for 3 days. The Brazilian wasn't bad but an awful lot of meat. The main restaurant had hell of a lot of choice. Best meal was breakfast. watch the birds don't start helping theirselves. Pools were clean but a little cloudy. beach was beautiful and clean. Never had trouble getting a sun bed. Entertainent was very good and professional but a little repedative. One thing I did not like was having to use plastic cups all the time, even for cocktails. Go down poolside bar and see bar tender Santiago. Tip him well and you never have to wait for a drink. He's a legend. One trip which is worth every penny is the Aquatic tour. Speed boating where you drive then snokelling. The guide was brilliant. Take an underwater camera.  So in all it was a lovely holiday. Totally chilled out for 2 weeks. Now back to reality. Love to Chicago couple Bruce nd Suzanne if they read this

<Content>FANTASTIC RESORT Just returned on augutst 21,,,THE Ocean Bavaro is a wonderful place...I kept wondering where people with negative reviews were staying. I was in block three, room was very large, big bathroom and the air cond was perfect, The beach is so beautiful, alot of huts where you can get plenty of shade,,just go before breakfast put your towel on the chair to reserve as they get filled quick.The ocean water is the best on the island along with the fluffly white sand,so warm and clean. The workers at the happy club were all so friendly and kept alot of activities on the beach all day. T he food in the main buffet was very good,,there is something there for everyone..One night we did go to the italian restaurant and the food and service was perfect.Dont be afraid to ask for more food if you want, they will be more than happy to bring you another plate..I just cant say enough about all the workers at the resort, everyone of them went out of their way to give you perfect service. There was a show every night and the mc kept everyone laughing..Pool bar wonderful,and pizza 24 hours. This is a wonderful resort,will be going back in december. TREAT YOURSELF YOU WILL LOVE IT..

<Content>It was wonderful one of the best vacations we've ever had !!!!!!!! We just returned last week from one week at the Ocean Bavaro Beach resort. Ten of us in all went. My self, My husband,Our 3 sons,My sister-in-law,Niece,Nephew and my Mother and Father in-law. We all had a great time. All the men and women in the Happy Club were wonderful and kept you as busy as you wanted to be. The resort was very clean and all the staff were very helpful and friendly. Don't forget when you pack to bring EVERYTHING you will need.Because if you have to buy it there the prices on things like aspirin,sunscreen and things like that are outragous.Also a float for the ocean or the pool. My husband and I went into the shopping area to find one and the guy wanted $25 for a pool float which I could buy in the USA for $4. WE ate mostly at the buffet restaurant.We tried the Italian restaurant one night and none of us cared for the food.The next night we ate at the Mexican Restuarant the food there was good but the service was horrible. You will definately need extra money for water activities(parasailing,crazy banana,my husband and sons also went 4-wheeling they had a blast. The kids made alot of friends and we hardly saw them except for dinner time. Everyone wants to go back again.

<Content>Best trip ever!!!! i travelled to the DR for a week on August 7th and although I had some doubts and worries (mainly due to this sight), I had an incredible time. Ocean Bavaro surpassed my expectations and wowed me to say the least. Please do not take harshly the poor reviews on this site, the one rotten egg shouldn't ruin in for the dozen...The staff were incredibly sweet and made great efforts to attempt to speak english and were enlightened when we made the effort to speak Spanish. The food was great. For those who thought it was bland and repetitive, it's not the resorts fault, you have to remember this is a third world country and all the things that are offered to us (i.e. selection, spices, etc.) are not offered to them. taking that into consideration that food was wonderful. the buffet changed about half of what it offered every night and the a-la-carte restaurants were fantastic. the spanish one was by far my favorite and the mexican one was great too. the 24 hour food and drinks made it well worth it aswell .... the ocean was beautifil, white sand, warm water, not too much seaweed. the great thing is they don't let the locals on the resorts part of the beach so if you don't want people trying to sell things to you while you are tanning, it's great. if you like that ... walk about 50 feet to the left and you'll get it!! but hey, it's their country and you have to respect it. got massages on the beach for $25 US and my hair braided for $25US as well ... most of the time you can talk them down from whatever they are asking. we went on the saona island excursion which was by far the best value for your money as you are gone from 730am - 7pm for $85US pp. It was amazing though ..... it's a sight you will probably never see in your life again so it's a good choice .... manati park is no more than a children's zoo so if have your hopes up for swimming with the dolphins you might be disappointed ... you are in the tank for about 15 minutes, the tank has 3 dolphins and 12 people, the tank is very small and it costs you $75US....other than that the rooms were great. we were in bloque 8 and the only downside was it was the only bloque without a mini fridge but it was connected to a bar and opened out to the third pool (which is semi-private and rarely found) and was not even 1min walk from the ocean... it was wonderful. the rooms were always spotless and for the most part bug free ... the nightly entertainment was fantastic, the MC is absolutely hilarious.... again, for what i thought was going to be a nightmare, this vacation was by far 4.5 star quality....I would go back there in a heart beat........ ciao!

<Content>Paradise! I spent two weeks at the resort with my boyfriend. I would just start by saying ignore the negative reviews. The beach was absolutely beautiful, clear sea, white sand and lots of palm trees. I was worried about the rain before I went, as looking at the forecast on the internet it said it would rain the whole two weeks. It did rain a few times, but it would only last about half an hour and then the sun would be shining! I would definitely advise going on the jeep safari and to isla soana. The bavaro splash is also great fun as you get to drive speed boats then snorkell with beautiful tropical fish. Our air conditioned room was great, cleaners did a brilliant job every morning. I would reccommend booking up some restaurants as the buffet does get quite repetitive and not much choice. The mexican and brazilian restaurants were good, although it was difficult to book up as we didn't speak much spanish. I have now decide dI am going to start spanish lessons as it would have helped a lot! If you want a relaxing holiday, then this is the place to go! Didn't want to come home!

<Content>Great I spent two weeks in the Ocean Bavaro in June 2004. I loved the place. The staff are great - tip them whenever you can. There was plenty of food at meal times and a good variety too. The beach, pool areas and gardens were ideal, very clean and plenty of space to do your own thing. The Happy Club were great they work very long hours entertaining guests on the beach and with a variety of shows at night, they were always smiling. I would recommend this hotel. I intend to return again next year.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!! The Ccean Bavaro may not be a 5 star resort, but we had a 5 star vacation. We stayed in the Carribean Suite, 1st floor beach front. It was the most amazing view of the ocean and Palm Trees. The food was good, the pizza and hamburger place was the best. We met so many wonderful people from Belgium, and Ireland and Florida. Santiago, the Bartender at the pool bar at night made our vacation even more fun. He was amazing. Like the previous review, these workers do not make much money, so leave them a tip every once in awhile and you get great service. They all work very hard, and I was very impressed with this hotel. Your on vacation so just relax and have fun. WE DID.

<Content>So-so After reading all the reviews we were still a little surprised about the resort and the food. Our first impression of the resort was good. The check in was very fast, everyone was friendly and we had called ahead to reserve a room in bloque 6 and ended up with one of the honeymoon suites (even though we were not married and took my 14 year old daughter). The room was fabulous - right on the Ocean on the third floor. They did not have another bed in the room for her when we checked in (about 1:00 p.m.) and it took them until 10:00 to get a roll away bed which was extremely uncomfortable. By the next night, however, they had another single bed there for her and that part was much better. The people in Dominican Republic and Apple Vacations are wonderful. They are always friendly, considerate and try their best to help out and make things right. And they work extremely hard for very little money.The food left a lot to be desired. I felt like I was on fear factor most of the time. If you could stomach looking at it, which was half the battle, you could possibly find something that was edible. Birds were flying around the tables and the buffet all the time, landing and picking up food and flying away. That was gross. The buffet area is not air conditioned so besides the birds, there are insects. Also the cold food got warm quickly (cheese) and the warm food was sometimes cold. We stuck with bread, fruit and pasta most of the time because of the stomach problems that we encountered. The restaurants at the resort are your best choice. The food was much better (particularly in the Bahia and the Spanish restaurant). At the Italian restaurant, I got the beef which was pretty good. At the Spanish restaurant, the chicken is very good (if you can order 2 orders you should - portions are small and after not eating for a few days, we were very hungry!). The Bahia had a variety of food that they brought to your table. The sausage made my fiance ill for 2 days, but the turkey and the chicken were great! The wine was pretty bad as well.The beach was nice, although the seaweed in the water made us chose the pool 95% of the time. If you can, get out to the beach early and reserve a chair undercover. The 'umbrellas' go fast and it can get very hot during the day. Their is always a breeze, which is VERY NICE!!! The catamaran was a lot of fun. The spa had 50% off all services while we were there and that was great. If you want to buy anything, it is best to check out prices ahead of time. Their stone is the Larimar, which is a light blue mixed with lighter shades. Again, it is pretty but before you go off to vendors or stores along the beach, it is best to price it in the states or at the resort. Their better rum is Barcelo, which at the resort sells for about $5 a bottle; vendors will try to sell it to you for $24 (ha!) They invited a lot of vendors to the resort on Friday, so if you can go through the store first to compare prices you will be ready for them. They have nothing marked and depending on what country you are from will ask various prices. Americans are thought to be wealthy so you can usually offer them about 1/3 and they will accept it. Cigarettes are cheap ($1.00 a pack), if you smoke.Take Imodium and cortizone. They are expensive there and will most likely be used. If you get insects bites and you don't have cortizone, try ice on the bites - it helps a lot!!! All in all, I would go back to Punta Cana but not to this resort.

<Content>Loved the Ocean Bavaro We were extremely pleased with our stay at Ocean Bavaro. The weather was perfect, food was great (loved the desserts), and the people were very friendly. The massages were amazing, I think I miss them the most. Check in and out was about 5 minutes total. The room was comfortable, the humidity kept our clothes a little damp but it beats cold and dry. We had no trouble with communication even though we didn't speak anything besides english. We enjoyed bartering at the shops down the beach, we didn't really care if we got the bottom dollar people need to live. The palm trees were amazing I hope development doesn't cut them down. Go,enjoy relax don't sweat the little things. If you want Ritz type vacations you may not enjoy but if you just like to relax enjoy people and work on the tan this your place!

<Content>About the 2 previous rewiews ! I guess U had extreamely bad luck in this hotel ,it could happen anywhere else hotel too.We spend 3 weeks there in Feb. 2004, and enjoyed our trip all 8 persons who travelled together. In THIS time the food was great,weather was great,employers(esp.room cleners and No english-speakers,we managed still fine talking by using our hands,legs,faces...) Happy club was great,cids club was great...Everything was great ,really !! Best time i ever had.And a advice to anyone travelling in D.R. :most of the salary of the workers there ,comes from the tips, SO if u like good service,who not use few extra pesos/dollars ,Because this really works .About the italianos and other european tourists, MY oppinion is, some of them really do act like pigs, not all , but think,the are also in vacation like U do. So why not get friends whith them !?

<Content>Our Nightmare Our week here (February, 2004) was so bad, the management gave us a certificate to return for free. Unfortunately, I will never return to Ocean Bavaro - or Dominican Republic. Our first night, we were bumped to Casa de Campo, another resort 2 hours away via bus. When we got to Casa de Campo, there were no rooms for us, so we were placed in a villa with other people (some we didn't know). We were like boat people. We had no phone, no food, nothing to drink but beer and water. None of us spoke Spanish, so it got a little scary at times. We shared a bedroom with another couple that night. We had no food, other than dinner that night, in the main hotel, and at the hotel, they didn't really want to serve us, because we weren't really guests. (We ended up paying for part of our dinner, despite the fact that we had an all-inclusive package.) Later, we were moved back to Ocean Bavaro, but we were not given the upgraded suites we paid for. Sometimes there was no power, or no water. The bathroom leaked all over the floor.Meanwhile, each day, there are busloads of people arriving in the lobby of Ocean Bavaro, with many being bumped like us. At this point, we realized it was all a scam.At first we asked our travel agent (when we could finaly cal her a day later!) to come right home. But there were no flights to Boston, MA that day. So, we stayed on through the next day, and by then we started to relax and get into the caribbean mentality. By then we started to have fun. The beach was very pretty. So, we stayed our full week.If you do go, forget the promises of good wine, and great food. Some food was OK, but the wine was awful. Stick with rum and coke, or beer. The frosty fruity drinks are ok, too. (And in the restaurants eat by 7pm and you'll get fed.)When we returned home, our travel agent gave us nothing back. Our tour agent (Air Transat) gave us back $250 Canadian and the return of our upgrade fees. This wouldn't even buy an air ticket back to Dominican (if we were ever crazy enough to try and return).All that Ocean Bavaro gave us was a certificate for another free week at Ocean Bavaro. I will never use it, and I wouldn't even give it away (unless I really didn't like the person!)If you are booked and paid for at Ocean Bavaro, good luck. If you can change your plans, do it now before it's too late.

<Content>Very bad!!! Stay away!! My wife and I recently returned from the Dominican Republic. We stayed in three separate areas of the country (Punta Cana, Santo Domingo, and Puerta Plata), the only negative experience we had came at Ocean Bavaro...and it was very negative. Here are the main highlights:- I have parasites. One of the other reviews mentions that the food is undercooked at the main restaurant. This is true, and during our stay, the food caused me substantial gastro-intestinal problems.- The guest services staff was rude and dishonest. At checkout, they attempted to overcharge us by $600, pretended to call the manager, then finally adjusted the bill, but only after our bus had left (which they were aware of). Seemed like a scam to get us to pay them off.Overall, the our experience was marred by bad food, rude service and a continuous vibe that if you wanted a decent stay, you needed to dish out extra dollars! This does not make for a relaxing experience!Feel free to make your own decisions, but when you come back with parasites don't blame me.

<Content>Loved Ocean's Bavaro Resort Me and 3 of my friends just went on May 1st for a week and had the best time ever! From the food, the beach, the pools and the animation staff-it was just amazing! The animation staff were great to get everyone involved and having fun. It was a great atmosphere to be around.Our rooms weren't bad either. All in all, I would recommend this resort. Our time there couldn't have been better!

<Content>overall a good vacation spot Okay, here is my review, I am trying to write this review without any bias and want to incorporate both the positives and the negatives. Firstly, I have extensively read the reviews and they were extremely helpful but keep in mind everyone is entitled to their own opinion although it may contradictory to the way you feel. After all, that is what opinions are it is your own representation and interpretation of the events around you. I traveled with a party of three and we try to escape to the Dominican once every year. Previously we stayed at the Bavaro Princess, which is rated a 5*. This year we all wanted to get away for two weeks and decided to stay at the Ocean Bavaro Beach and Spa Resort, as it was more inline with our price rage for two weeks. All in all this is a great property and would probably return. Airport:Since we have traveled to Dominican before we knew how chaotic the airport could be, so we devised a plan. We carefully tagged our luggage with the colorful Air transit tape (all you have to do is ask at the counter in Toronto and they will let you use it) along the front and back. That way when the luggage came off the plane we could easily identify which ones where ours. The next course of action was for someone to locate the bus and grab three seats at the very front. The other two in our party waited outside the bus to ensure our luggage was on last, so this way it would be unloaded first. The tour bus took about 20 minutes to arrive at the resort. One person promptly got off the bus and checked in and the other two got the luggage. This whole process really does work and avoids lineups and the front desk. Check in: Although they stipulate that check in is at three we were given our room shortly after we arrived. During check in you are given your room keys, two towel cards, and the remoter for the television. Since we were staying for two weeks we also got the safe. Please keep in mind there is a $15.00 usd deposit required for the safe. We were in communication with the resort and requested a room in either block 6 (preferred) or block 5. We were given a room in bock five with a partial ocean view. It was nice; after all we didn鈥檛 have any intentions on spending much time in the room. Rooms:The rooms were always clean and came equipped with two double beds. There was also a mini fridge that was stocked daily with water, Pepsi and 7-up. The washroom was a decent size and always very clean. The water pressure was good and air conditioner worker very well. Negative: Please check the throw blanket on top of the bed. We came to realize that it is not their practice to wash these regularly, even if there is a new check in. Ours were severely stained and soiled and even after complaining it was not changed. Food:We mostly stuck to the main buffet as we did not have great experiences with the ala carte restaurants. In the main buffet there was always something for everyone even the picky eaters such as my self. I noticed that most of the meats were undercooked, however, not much of a problem just ask them to place it back on the grill and they will comply. The Brazilian Restaurant was not to my liking, I found the meat to be undercooked. The Spanish restaurant, although we heard great things about it, was also not to my liking. We all had the steak and they use a very heavy and different type of seasoning that really did not agree with me. We did although like the Mexican restaurant. We all had the chicken fajitas and they were really good. We had a really bad experience with the Italian restaurant and chose not to continue (or shall I say start) our meal. We had reservations and had every intention of enjoying ourselves, however, it started to rain before the restaurant opened their doors and this resulted in people running into the restaurant, even people without reservations. Subsequently the table we were seated at they asked us to move to another table. A table that comfortably would seat two but they asked our party of three to move. When I refused stating that we were already seated and had three people in our party they refused to serve us. I was humiliated as many of the other tourists did not speak English and did not understand what was happening. None the less, we opted to leave instead. Negative: When I went to guest services to advise them what happened there attitude was 鈥渨ell we鈥檒l have to call them and see what really happened鈥? My response to her was 鈥渄id you think on the walk down I got creative and made it up鈥? She chuckled and committed to a follow up, which we never received. When I heard nothing from her and a few days had elapsed I approached her and she had told me that it did not happen. Pool/ beach:The pool was very nice. It was always very clean and always a chair to lounge in. However, we preferred the beach. The beach was amazing!! The sand was white and the water was great. I even found many small beautiful shells in the very shallow parts of the water. The beach was absolutely breath taking. The animation team always tried their best to get everyone involved in beach activities and really made our stay memorable. Staff: There is not enough I can say about the beautiful people that work at this establishment. As stated at the beginning of this review everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion so I am about to state mine. Although some may argue it is an all-inclusive resort, I believe everyone traveling from North America and other privileged places in the world should tip. These resort workers make such little money. Often working 13 days straight for about 13 hours with only three days off. On an average these resort workers make about 100-150 American dollars per month, traveling 2-3 hours daily to arrive at work. Many workers actually live at the building at the entrance to the resort and are unable to visit their families for countless days. All I am saying is a little goes a very long way for someone in need. We tipped our maid daily, we also tipped all restaurant workers daily as well as other workers that are often forgotten about ie. security, cooks, beach workers, animation team, landscapers. The staff really made this vacation unforgettable. They always tried their best to understand you and always greeted you with a smile. Guest Services:One of my biggest complaints was the manner in which they dealt with problems. I found guest services never really took any of our concerns seriously. We were always brushed off with the anticipation we would go away. Overall, I would return to the Ocean Bavaro, however, I wish management would view these reviews and take them as constructive criticism and opt to make some changes, as this resort potentially can be one of the best. But again these are summaries of my opinions

<Content>my dream come true Booked a trip to Ocean Bavaro, Conquest Vacations and Skyservice in April. Absolutely no complaints at all about Skyservice. The staff was great and freindly. Everybody on the plane was excited about their vacation. When I stepped off the plane the warm air was so inviting, after leaving the cold and rain in Nova Scotia. I was in heaven. No problems at the airport or on the bus. Henry, the bus guide, was great. Lost our luggage off the bus at the resort, but was recovered right away, thanks to Henry. The resort is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are well groomed and clean, always grounds people doing something. Very friendly staff. Take a list of Spanish words and phrases, its a big help. Not much English there. The rooms are good. We were in block seven. Could see the beach from the balcony. Great air conditioning and a really comfortable bed. Had to ask for towels a couple of times, but no big deal. The beach was unbelievable. The sand is powdery white and the water is warm and wonderful. Lots of chairs to sit on. The beach is a bit crowded, but afterall it is a big resort. Sunny and hot everday but one.It rained one day for fifteen minutes and then sun again. Take lots of sunscreen,you burn very fast. The beachbar is great. Try the banana mamas.Very tasty. The Margueritas at the Lobbybar are great too. The food was good. A lot of different varities to pick from. The main buffet restaurant was excellent. We ate at the Italian and the Mexican restaurants. Good but small servings. You have to make reservations for those. Had a bout of diarrhea one night, not sure what from. Take lots of Immodium. They provide lots of bottled water, so keep some in your room if none in your fridge. Go to the giftshop on the resort and say hi to Maria, she is very nice. She is quite the saleslady. She is so funny. Had a massage on the beach. $20US for one hour. It was great. I could go on and on about this resort. It was my first time down south and i was a little weary about going, but i did alot of research on the net, a big help. You wont be disappointed with this resort. Iwould definitley return.

<Content>There are no words, espcially for those under 30........... We just got back after 2 weeks on May 10th 2004. I don't know where to begin...I've been to Punta Cana before and there is no resort or hotel that can step up to this place.THE FLIGHT - Air transat and they suck! especially the food and there crammed planes.FROM THE AIRPORT - Find your bus, that is clearly marked and relax for the 20 min ride.CHECK IN - No problems, not many peaple when we arrived. We were also lucky enough to get block#5. Where every room on either side has an ocean view. Same with block # 6.No problems with the room, very nice.......THE RESORT - Over all un --------- believable swear I thought my plane crashed cause I was in heaven. The weather, the beach, the breeze, the ocean, the beautiful women, (and of course my beautiful woman), not to mention the music. ENTERTAINMENT - I thought that the resort show would be cheesy, I gotta say that those performers should be on braodway. They are so talented, the shows were excellent and diverse. Of course alot of latin, there was and hour long Michael Jackson show with every move to a T. There was a water light show with fire in huge pool, there was the international show all great.DISCO - Was small, but it rocked on some nights when it packed to compacity at about 1200. BEACH PARTIES - Thats right freakin beach parties on the beach with alcohol, music, and huge fires til 3am.THE BEACH - The ocean was blue as the sky 13 days without a dark cloud. the sand was white as sugar.READ THIS - The tipping we did I believe was the most important thing we did. Our maid was so sweet and graetful that the poor lady washed all our cloths daily to express thankfulness. She had 5 kids and made $100 a month. So those fortunate to vacation don't be a cheap S.O.B. and tip the staff a dollar here or there, I'm sure you can swing it!I will definately be going back to this resort along with all the others that came.. SO CHECK IT OUT!

<Content>Go and make your own decision My husband and I returned from Ocean Bavaro on Friday (7th May).We had read the reviews and had already formed opinions before we went. Don't pay too much attention to them, everyone has different perceptions of everything however I would like to say a couple of things:We personally thought that the Spanish restaurant was the best restaurant actually on the resort (personal opinion).If you like Seafood then you simply must go to Captain Cooks (it's off the resort but just a short walk down the beach). Choose the all inclusive platter for $40. It is unbelieveable and all of your drinks are included!If you are coming from the UK please note that this resort is not really targetted at us and as such (as several of the staff admitted to us at the end of our stay) we are not their favourite people however if you make a bit of effort with them it goes a long way.Finally I would like to state that the rooms with the spa / jacuzzi are the exception rather than the norm. Most of the rooms are pretty average but clean and comforatable.We met some fantastic people on this holiday and had a great time (the animation team and the entertainment are excellent).We would definately go there again.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever We just got back from a week stay at the ocean bavaro. Excellent place, the food was good the grounds were extremely beautiful, and the service was excellent even if you don't tip. The language barrier was a little difficult but the workers knew a little bit of many languages so you were able to get what you needed. The room we stayed in was beautiful with a spa in the bathtub. Air conditioning worked great. No problems. The beach was beautiful and not too crowded, nor were the pools. Lots of stuff to do, and lots of things to see. I do recommend the Spanish restaurant the sirloin steak there was the best I've ever had. I will definitely recommend this resort and we will definitely be going back.

<Content>Hola! We just got back from our stay at Ocean Bavaro March10-17th!! It was excellent! We travelled with My family, My aunt and uncle and two cousins, and 5 of my cousins friends. This resort was amazing!! The grounds were beautiful, and very well taken care of. We spent most mornings at the pool which was soo nice and very clean, and then would go to the beach in the afternoon beacause it got way too hot! The beach was perfect, we never had a problem finding chairs either. The nightlife was super the shows at the resort was sooo good, the animation team was soo friendly and definetly made the trip fun! After the shows in the evening there were discos, they were fun for us beacause there were so many people our age on march break! The bartenders were great to, but they had no problem serving drinks with liquor in them to the younger girls that were with us! haha! Most of us are very picky eaters and we had no problem with the food, it was great! Especially the 24 hr pizza place!!!! The only downside to this resort was that the rooms werent that great... We were in Block 2, The walls and ceiling were becoming moldy, and my uncles tv didnt work but for the amount of time we spent in our rooms it was no big deal, and when we called the front desk about the broken tv there was no problem coming down to fix it!! Overall this was an amazing trip that we will all never forget!!!!! I would recommend this resort and definetly stay there again on my next trip to D.R!!!!

<Content>Best time of my life BLOCK 8 ALL THE WAY!!! There was a group of grade 12/13 students from Glendale that went to this resort on march 11 for there march break trip and I can speak for the majority of them that it was the best time of their lives. Everyone was great and the Happy club was the ----. There was a few people staying at the resort that were a little moody (ie the italian guy that wanted to kick my ---). The drinks and food were great and the rooms coulda used a little work but that don't matter cause we didn't spend much time in them anyway. Kim the him was the ---- she/he was the meanest lookin thing i ever saw, damn was she big. The night life was awsome, Disco, and Beach party were both a blast. PEPE and CHOCOLATE were the best guys there, half the time i didnt understand them but that din't matter. Ricardo was the Block 8 Bartender and he could whip you up any drink you want. I would reccomend this resort to anyone. Just don't go when we go there for our Glendale Comeback cause you won't get to sleep from 4-8!! DO THE PEPEI

<Content>Worst of the worse Place was bad...starting from the room which had mice and roches. Food was even worse....the meat was not eatable and old. I found a piece of bone in my salami and the area was dirty. Beach was nice but small and a lot of salesman was selling things on it. My wife's hand bag got stolen by some homeless kids. I will not go back to Dominican Republic and sure not to this hotel.

<Content>Very Happy... We just arrived back from a one week stay at the Ocean Bavaro from March 28th to April 4th. My wife and I went with another couple. We had a very good time. I had been to the Bavaro Beach resort (just a mile or two south) a few years back, so I have something to compare it to. Our flight arrived early from Toronto. We were able to check into our rooms right way and got adjoining rooms (we just asked and we received) in Block 7 on the second of three floors overlooking the smaller pool to the north. We used our patio most evenings for a few drinks around dusk - Very nice. It was always clean but the bathroom could have used some colour and maybe a little updating, but no big deal. There were a few small ants to be found in the bathroom on a few occasions. We had no power outages or trouble with the AC (we like it cold and you could have hung meat in the room it worked so well!). The Staff are excellent hard working, very friendly, helpful, etc., etc., etc.. THEY WORK HARD!!! I have no idea who these guests are that take issue with the staff and other guests not speaking English. BIG surprise some people didnt speak much English or no English, but a few gestures, a smile and bingo, you got what you wanted. The grounds are truly wonderful and the resort is not so spread out that you will dread walking to and from various locals. The pools are clean and I never waited for more than a few moments for a drink. If bar has blender, theyll gladly make youre a daiquiri if you ask. The draft beer was always nice and cold. Now for the food We ate at all the restaurants but the Spanish/French. I ordered the Calamari at the Italian restaurant one night. It was only warm, but very good. If it had been hot, it would have rocked. My friend had the some pasta and it was both hot and excellent. The good thing is that after each of the specialty meals were asked to complete a review of the food and service. The Mexican starters were good, but the mains were low average. The Brazil joint was fun and quite good. Maybe a little dry for some meat lovers, but quite good. The food was for the most part good Sometime fair and sometimes down right excellent for certain dishes. My only real complaint was it was not easy to get a HOT cup of coffee. The buffet is pretty much like any all-you-can-eat joint back in Canada. The smaller buffet was never crowded but had less selection. A good place for breakfast as there was no wait for a made-to-order omelette. You could always get pizza, fries, burgers, roast chicken (after 4pm), sandwiches (tuna very good) at the snack bar. I would go back there, if the world were not such a big place to explore. I would recommend the place to family and friends. We paid $1,100 (including tax) and were quite happy. When I compare it to the Bavaro Beach resort, I would say that it might be fair to say the food was better at Bavaro Beath but the Ocean had the better beach, pool, staff and grounds. P.S. Be a good ambassador and dont look like a jerk. If you have a legitimate beef, take it up with the tour rep or the hotel management. It is embarrassing to see a GUEST from a western/developed country screaming at some poor worker slogging away (12 days on/ 3 days off).

<Content>she's right... The last reviewer alyssa who said how amazing this resort is and how much fun you can have there is right, i feel if you don't waste your time thinking about how bad the food is and stuff, you won't get sick The other people who said the food was awful were out of their tree, we ate A LOT and EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME and we drank a ton and we felt great the whole time and still do, never got sick once. Don't pay any mind to a lot of the negative reviews, they are far outweighed by positives. and who can go wrong with the happy club, seriously..... but don't get me wrong that wasn't the only good thing. the disco can be fun, if you're younger wait until atleast 12:30 and then go, it gets hot by then we found. And if there's a beach party hit that up for sure. If you dont like the music, learn to becuase as soon as you get home to the cold boring north you will want to hear all of those hot carribbean jams again. It is a good resort for all ages because there is something for everyone, and a mixed bag when it comes to age groups, young, old, in the middle. Our room was very beautiful and we had no bugs,crawling things (well maybe one but it was just little) or broken toilets. Couples? the honeymoon suite is gorgeous, we had it for a night even though were far from honeymooners, but it was sooo romantic and pretty with a nice jacuzzi and things. Go here if you know how to have fun without letting little stupid things ruin it. fin. oh and I luvvvv you baby you luv me too?

<Content>The best resort I've ever been to! My fiance and I just got back from the Ocean Bavaro and we had the best time we ever had at a resort. The resort itself is absolutely beautiful! There are pink flamingo's walking around near the main buffet so you can watch them while you eat on the outdoor patio. The walkways are surrounded by beautiful flowers and palm trees. When we arrived, it was between lunch and dinner so the only thing open was the snack bar. I was surprised to see their selection. They have rotisserie chicken, pizza, and all kinds of sandwiches! I ended up eating there for lunch instead of the buffet. Don't get me wrong, the buffet was great! There were so many good things to eat that I overstuffed myself a few times. The rooms were fine. Nothing special but nothing bad either. The beach was beautiful and the water was so stunning that I wanted to swim all day. I could go on and on about how much we loved this resort. We've been to Hawaii, Bahamas, Mexico, Cuba and Dominican several times and all I can say is this is the only resort we would go back to twice. If you have already booked this resort you are going to have a blast!

<Content>Must Read this if you are between 21-30! My girlfriend and I returned from a one week stay at the Ocean Bavaro Beach Resort and Spa on Saturday April 3rd 2004. FIRST OF ALL - this website had us very nervous about the hotel - BUT fortunetely it was faboulous! We flew Skyservice from Toronto, Canada ( 8 hours North of New York City for Americans) and the flight was perfect. No delays or lost luggage. When we got to our hotel we were very taken back. The resort was stunning. It was clean, fresh, a paradise. There were peacocks and flamigos roaming the grounds and there were about a million workers ensuring that the grounds were always maintained. The palm trees were beautiful and in all the right spots so there was just enough shade if you needed it but not too much when you wanted to bask in the sun... We arrived at noon but could not check in until 3:00pm so it was a bit of a waste since we didn't really feel like going to the beach having just come off the plane - best advice is to eat and chill by the pool - wear your swimsuit on the plane! When we got our room is was the block that we wanted 5 - which we requested due to this website. It was amazing. Ocean View balcony, I gave the cleaning lady some perfum I had brought with me that I was not wearing at home and she kept our room tidy and neat everyday. Block 5 and 6 are the best, block 6 has the honey moon suites. The food was not great - but most people seemed to enjoy it - I think I am too spoiled with Italian home cooking....: ) THE NIGHTS: My girlfriend and I would head to the restaurant of choice at around nine, and then to the lobby bar at around 10-10:30. We saw one show at the theatre and it was very good. The dancers are professional. The disco did not open until 11:30pm. It was filled with many adults and parents - but with a group looking to have some fun wherever you can drink for free and dance, it was good. For 8$ US you can take a taxi to MANGU, a night clud at the Flamenco Grand Hotel about 15 minutes away...it was much more like a club with a lot younger crowd. There was a 3$ US charge at the door but you got a free drink with your ticket. I have been to Columbia, St. Marteen, Puerto Vallarta and Mayan Riviera - I know my stuff. This was a good time, but you HAD to make it a good time. Meet people (mostly Europeans - about 80%) and be friendly to the staff. I noticed that many people complained that the staff AND other guests did not speak any other language besides spanish, there native tongue...well I'd like to ask them....do you speak another language? It should not make a vacation poor because the bartender did not understand that you wanted a Rum and Coke instead of a Vodka and orange...I asked for a Cherry Brandy with coke and I got a plate of marachino cherries....I loved it. In short, the place was lovely, the people were lovely, the beach was gorgeous and we had a fabulous time. You may ask why I only gave it 4 stars...it rained for two of the 6 days we were there...that put a damper on things. Enjoy, wish I was still there. Caterina, toronto, Canada.

<Content>A nice trip. I vacationed for a week starting Feb 16th with 5 girlfriends. A little bit about us - we are 23 and in graduate school, we went on vacation to relax not party (we were in bed every night by 12). Overall we had a very nice time. Two of us were lucky enough to be in block 6 (near the beach, new, whirlpool tub).. the other rooms were very nice as well. However one room was without hot water for a few days and they did have to be persistent to get it fixed. The resort grounds are beautiful, the pools clean, and beach is amazing!! We had to get up pretty early to get chairs on the beach (esp. if we wanted to be under an umbrella) and one day they ran out of beach towels (they were ready by around 3pm).Now on to the food -- I do not know where these other people were eating. The food is not GOOD by any stretch of the imagination. Having said that it's not horrible either. I didn't go hungry, but I was happy to be home and have a good meal. A couple of us did have some minor stomach upset, but nothing a little Imodium and a good night's sleep did cure!My advice... go in with realistic expectations and you will have a fun and relaxing week. Be ready to ask for maintenance and other needs more than once and for adequate food.

<Content>Very Nice!! I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro in August of 2003 and have just been late at getting a review on here. The resort is very beautiful! Don't let the snobby reviews get you down. The pools are wonderful, the main pool tends to get crowded but you can always move to one of the other two if you like to have less people. The huts on the beach are very nice, but you must get to the beach early to reserve one- but its not that big of a deal. Some minimal seaweed- but its an ocean! The restaurants were wonderful! My whole family loved the Italian (try the Lazagna!) and Mexican- we never had a problem getting a reservation. The buffet is also very good, always something to eat even if you are picky. The rum is always flowing at the bars- and the bar is quick to get you a drink. I've read reviews that the staff speaks very little English- true but I got everything that I needed. Plus we aren't in the United States so I don't understand how that was a shock!!!!! The staff is always willing to help and the rooms are kept very clean. They leave a gift daily in the room- fruit basket, bottled pop, etc. Its just a fun thing to look forward to. Be aware that the resort caters to an array of people- Americans, French, Italians, Germans.. so don't be surprised to hear multiple languages and some topless women on the beach. So basically, if you want an Americanized resort go to Cancun. Feel free to email me about any questions and I'll be happy to help out!

<Content>Okay resort Stayed at Ocean Bavaro from March 11 - 26/04. Signature Vacations. My husband and two daughters aged 16 and 19. My sister and her boyfriend joined us for the last week of our holiday. We were forewarned about the problems at this resort by reading the reviews. We booked our holiday, then some of the negative reviews began being posted. We tried to change to another resort last minute, but weren't able to do it.Pros: Nice lush landscape and well-kept grounds, easy to get around with not much walking time, beautiful beach, average food, decent snack bar. The Spanish restaurant was good, nice pool.The staff really seem to work hard at this resort, and work very long hours.The location of the resort is great for walking to see other resorts and to El Cortecito.Cons: Rooms were horrible in Block 7. We had to move to Block 4 after one night. There were dead bugs killed on the walls and just left there. The lamp shade was torn and hanging down, the frame on the mirror in the bathroom was ripped off and full of mold, the faucet fell off the wall when having a shower, walls had mold growing on them. In Block 4 it was better, except in my sister's room there was water leaking from the light fixture in the bathroom (smelling like an electrical fire). They didn't know if it was sewage or what, so were moved to Block 3 where the air-conditioning wouldn't shut off. My kids room had leaking from the back of the toilet. These rooms are a disgrace and they shouldn't be renting them out.They didn't know how to make mixed drinks very well. Ordered margarita and pina colada (didn't taste anything like it), so we didn't drink much in the two weeks which was probably a good thing. Okay if you like beer, rum and coke, and other plain mixed drinks.This resort was extremely noisy. Lots of spring break partiers (after the disco 2:30 to 4:00). Had to call the front desk about this problem. You could sleep okay between 4 and 8 a.m.Don't mind Europeans, but there were just too many.We have only been to all-inclusives in the Mayan Riviera rated 4 star, so maybe we don't really realize what a 3 star in Dom. Repub. should be like, but were very disappointed. I would rate it a 3 except for the rooms. In any country, I would rate them a 1 or 2 star. Sorry, cannot recommend this resort, and would not go back.

<Content>Great value for your money We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro Resort form March 18 to the 25, 2004 and had a great time. The beach is beautiful, the staff is very energetic and fun and the food is decent. We travelled with our two kids, 3  7 and they had a great time too!!. The buffet restaurant is your best bet or the 24 hour snack bar that has pizza, rotisserie chicken and hamburguers. A la carte restaurants are not so good but the service at the spanish one (La Meson) was outstanding. There are a thousand activities to do. We actually couldn't enjoy the night shows because the kids were too tired by then. I think the Ocean Bavaro is great value for your money and we would go back tomorrow if we could.

<Content>great beach I visited the last week of March. The beach is beautiful. Lots of shade, because of the palm trees or lots of sun, depends what you want. The food was excellent. After talking to others at the airport, I guess we were lucky that our food was so good. They reported that at their resorts the food was not that good. I especially liked the early evening snacks that were left in our room - fresh fruit, cookies, strawberries dipped in white chocolate, and cream puffs. The resort is clean and the landscaping is beautiful. The pools are large and nice. We had a wonderful time and would return to this resort.

<Content>Much better than I expected We had a group of 12 in 5 rooms from March 7-14. Reading the past reviews I was concerned about the problems some people encountered. We had no problems. The resort was beautiful; the help friendly and eager to please; the food was very good and no one got sick; the beach was great; and our rooms were nice (block 5). I could go on but won't. Sure I have stayed in more elegant resorts but for the money this was as good as any where I have been. I would recommend Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>Great Resort Just got back Saturday night. Reluctant to go to this resort after the bad reviews. Don't pay attention to them, this place was very nice. Best beach , nice staff, beautiful grounds. Food was ok, skip the speciality restraunts the buffet always has something you could try. We were up graded to a jr. suite which was a nice surprise. Check in was very fast and the customer service desk was great if you need anything. Most staff execpt the maids spoke some English. The bars were fast and they remembered you and what you liked to drink. Leaving your towels an a beach chair all day wa no problem, no one ever took them. The spa was wonderful it was 1/2 price the week we were there and I would have liked to use it more but couldn't get myself off the beach. All in all it was a great place.Talked to many who have been there several times and keep coming back.

<Content>March Break Dominican 2004 A group of students from glendale high school just arrived back from our stay at the this resort. Mar 11 - Mar 18. I think i speak for everyone that this resort is with out a dought a 4 star and the only thing needed to by a 5 star was a little room maintance. The grounds were amazing with nice white beaches with only a little seaweed. The pools were excellent, and very well layed out. The weather was nice all the time and it only rained once and a while at night. The night life was very good and for a group of students it was exactly what we had paid for. The only thing I would have to complain about is the rooms. Some didn't have fridges and the airconditions are about the bathroom ceilings, which ment if it leaked, so did your ceiling. In my case our bathroom ceiling leaked a bit, but it just bent the tile had to be drained every day. NO biggie. The drinks were pretty good, but they don't go light on the liqour. 90% of the workers love there jobs making the stay even that much better. Overall the resort was amazing and deffinatly a 4 star. Its also not a bad resort for just relaxing but its more keyed on have a good time a night, so some may find the music to be a little loud (which usually played until 1 or 2 am). So if anyone is looking for a resort to relax during the day and let loose at night, i would deffinately recommend this resort to anyone.

<Content>Loved the Beauty of the Ocean Bavaro This is our second time in Punta Cana. We had a great time last year. We stayed at the Grand Paradise last year. This year we decided to try something different. On the advice of our travel agent we tried the Ocean Bavaro Spa and Beach Resort. It was the most beautiful place I have seen in a very long time. The vegetation is very mature and lavish. The grounds, although large are easy to navigate. We had some trouble at the front desk and our two rooms were not together or adjoining. I asked for adjoining rooms and they said it would be impossible. I pressed and I received 2 rooms in the Vera Club, which were adjoining. The Vera Club is a new section of the resort and much nicer! The food was great and all the a la carte restaurants were great. Last year we had bad food that made more than one of us sick so it was refreshing to have well cooked, tasty food that didn't make any one sick. There was entertainment if you choose to seek it out or quiet if you choose it. This resort has something for everyone. But, if what you want is total quiet and relaxation this may not be your resort. It worked for our family of 5, ranging from 41 to 13 years of age. Thanks for a memorable week, it will not be forgotten!!!!!!!!!!!! Rosemary Rooke

<Content>fun, fun and more fun Hello Carlos from the beach bar, hello Black Bananna, hello Pippy from Ontario, hello Santiago, hello helicopter pilot from Alberta, hello Peter and wife from Antwerp (no we dont want to play, but it was an honor that you asked) Hello to all of the wonderful friendy people we met. we had the best time we have ever had at any resort. The place is immaculate, the staff is genuinely friendly, happy, and very hard working. They genuinely have fun and enjoy their jobs. We saw a few people arrive who had been there before, they were greeted with hugs and they all had tears in their eyes. The beach is one of the nicest we've ever seen. There are games and fun and dancing and more fun every day. The grounds are breathtaking, especially at night. The rooms we had were great. We were in the 6000 building, each room has a balcony from which you can see the beach and chat with your neighbors and the people accross the courtyard. which we did extensively (hello ottowa, new brunswick, nova scotia) Don't miss the sunset cruise (which is at 2:30 in the afternoon) They take you in a small boat about 15 people. They have dancing and singing and fun and snorkeling and cocktails and more fun. Bring some bread with you to feed the fish while you snorkel at the reef. We are definately going back next year, hope to bring some friends. Bravo Ocean Bavaro.

<Content>Mostly True Previous Reviews We stayed for 2 weeks Feb27-Mar14. My husband, 3 year old daughter  I. The best preperation for our trip was reading these reviews from previous stays from Nov 2003-Feb2004. I read 37 reviews and found grains of truth in all of them and felt we thus had realistic expectations about Ocean Bavaro. We figured it would be adequate and were always pleasantly surprised when it was good to above average. Grounds are spacious, well maintained with mature plantings (i.e. tall palms and full/blooming plants) Ask for room in block #6. Newest, nearest beach  good shower water pressure. Robes in room, slippers (great for cold, clammy floors)  jacuzzi. Staff was responsive when we had complaints (for example: safe not working) Just know that you have to ask 3x to get something done. Room had poor lighting (hard to read a book.)Our 1st 3 days there were WINDY. Not breezy, but monsoony. Overall weather hot (78-80F) but comfortable due to persistent light breeze. We liked to keep our patio door open, but discontinued it  turned on air due to nasty mosquito bites. Food: Main buffet ok. Ala Carte restaurants TERRIBLE. I renamed the Brazilian Buffet Meat-on-a-Stick. Gross Mexican, Cold food at all the restaurants--always. Best bet is buffet. After 2 weeks, its very easy to get sick of even the buffet food. We enjoyed European flair  liked that the language spoken least was English. Nice to know that those seemingly worthless years of high school Spanish actually came in handy. We didn't mind topless bathing or overweight men wearing thongs--Do Americans have a hang up about this?? The Entertainment team was AWESOME. Very good dancers. The kids program was nice and our daughter seem to find other kids to meet. Friendship for small kids knows no language barrier. Europeans were especially gracious to her 3 year old antics. We booked through Apple Vacations, charter plane. Plane food was actually decent (!). Thomas Cook airline. Our transfers were smooth. Based Ocean Bavaro's food alone, I would recommend this resort as adequate  we had a nice time. But when we return to Bavaro Beach/Punta Cana area, but I would consider a 4.5 or 5 star rated property instead.

<Content>Satisfaction garanteed... Just got back on march 13th, and really enjoyed our stay at this resort. Went there after reading bad reviews on different internet sites, but i'm glad to have been there and would recommend this resort without hesitation...The beach was very nice, althought lots of weeds beacuse of the winds, the pools very nice and clean, the restaurants and buffets very good. The grounds are kept very clean and the layout is excellent with the palms tres and the ponds. Lots of activities to do, and shopping close by.

<Content>Great Holiday in the Sun We left in the morning, plane was very small, SkyService is not the way to go if you like space. It was sunny and hot when we arrived, beautiful airport. Went straight to the hotel, checked in, looked around, then got our room at around 1pm Dominican time. Nice rooms, airconditioned, balconies, tv with english channels. Beach is Amazing but kind of seaweedy, they could have cleaned it a little more often. The water was cloudy, and had some seaweed floating and on the bottom. The resort is beautiful!!! Especially the main pool, which includes a swim up bar. The smaller pool is a lot colder. Entertainment was Excellent, all shows were in Spanish, English, French and German. Mostly all the stadd understand basic english, just don't ask them anything complicated, keep it simple. Our maid didn't speak english. The shows every night were filled with dancing and a lot of different cultures. These people are so talented and work VERY long hours. We saw some staff thee from 9am, until 12:30am that night, just entertaining us all day, all night is a challenge for sure!!! You don't get bath robes like they say, or irons, or booze in the mini fridge, there is a 24hour bar though so no need to worry. THere liquor isn' that tasty, they put a lot in your drink, we started to think they were fooling us and serving .5% beer because you had to drink 20 of them to feel it. So stick to the liquor. Don't drink eveyday or you'll be sick. There food is great to a peron that likes anything. I am a very picky eater and mostly ate pizza all week. The french fries were good, and the chicken was excellent. They also have very good breads there. All their juices are freshly squeezed, and you can have pop which is pepsi, 7up, Miranda (which is orange pop), Club Soda, and Diet Pepsi. The a la carte's were ok, but the mexican was a little gross. I had a chimichonga, and I asked for no mushrooms they gave me all mushrooms. (Good advice don't ask for modifications) All in all the Buffet is your best bet. It changes, and there is something for everyone, no matter how picky. Well there is nothing else much to say but to say that I had a GREAT time and I love the people there. I would recommend this place, it is a great spot to vacation, just don't fly SkyService!!!! P.S. Make sure you go to Saona Island, this all day trip will make you vacation!!! Guaranteed!!!!

<Content>Most Relaxing Vacation My husband and I with another couple went here from Jan. 31-Feb. 7, 2004. We had an amazing time. It is true that Americans are the minority here, but most Europeans speak English. All you have to do is ask them a question and they'll reply in English. Everyone was very nice and accomodating. Not all the staff is well versed in English and that can be difficult. We lost our luggage en-route to our room and had a hard time telling them that our bags didn't make it. Within 10 minutes though, our bags arrived. Just had to have patience. Our friends got given a room next to us that was already occupied so they ended up on the next floor down from us which was fine. The rooms aren't spectacular but they are clean, make sure you throw your dirty towels on the floor in the bathroom. You'll get clean ones then. Don't be afraid to ask for more towels. Bring 100 U.S. dollars for tipping and lots of small bills. This helped us a lot. The people of the Dominican really appreciate getting tipped. The spa is wonderful and CHEAP!! Manicure and pedicure with parafin dip, $25. for both!! One hour massages on the beach for $20. We all loved this because we never get this kind of treatment at home. It's too expensive. I would go back just for this alone. The beach is beautiful. The lounge chairs are plentiful. There are lots of thongs and topless sunbathers. Men and women. A little strange at first, but you get used to it. We went on the James Bond speed boat/snorkeling trip. I didn't think it was worth the $60. we paid p/person. Pick a different snorkeling trip. The guys went deep sea fishing and one got sick, had to lay down in a bunk for the whole trip, take Dramamine at least an hour before you go!!! They did catch some fish, the owner of the boat keeps it but we have some cool pictures anyway. The food was really good, I thought. I am not a picky eater. My friend ate a lot of french fries during the week (lunchtime), and her boyfriend was always after the steak. This is at the restaurant down by the beach. There is a lot of variety. The fresh fruit is awesome. I ate salad everyday with my dinner and had no problems. The Spanish restaurant was good, the wine list better. My husband had the fish and said that was excellent. I had the Honey Chicken which was chicken tenders(not breaded) with honey and potato sticks on top. Kinda weird, could have made that at home! Anyway, the Italian restaurant was good too, starts out with anitipasto which I liked. The Brazilian was very tasty, filled up fast, lots of good meat. Never tried the Mexican, ran out of time. The buffet was the best. It changed every day. Yet the basics stayed the same. Always fresh fruit, bread, salads and desserts. We didn't really watch any of the entertainment, couldn't understand them. It's a real good idea to brush up on Spanish before you go. The basics can go a long way. The weather is great. I checked the 10-day forcast before we left and it said rain and clouds all of the days. It was wrong!!! There was a 5-min. shower one day while we ate lunch, then it rained a couple more times at night. I've never been so tan in my life nor has my skin ever felt so good. Everyone should go to the Dominican!!! Buy some Larimar jewelry, it's beautiful. We took a taxi, (make sure you ask how much it will be before you get in, also, when you come back to your resort) went to Plaza Bavaro, shopped at Harrison's Jewelers. Talk them down as much as you can. I got a pendant, one side is Larimar, the other side is Amber, set in gold. It's beautiful. Spent $208. My friend got a Tanzanite and Diamond ring, also very beautiful. Spent $498. Go and have fun!! Bring a piece of the Dominican home with you!!

<Content>Awesome Vacation My husband and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from Feb 26 to Mar 4. We had a fabulous time. I am not sure why the last several reviews were so bad. I can't say enough good things about this resort. The pools were great, the beach was endless, there was an excellent variety of food at the buffet, the grounds were spectacular and the staff was very friendly. We only speak English and didn't really have that hard of a time communicating. I was actually surprised at the staff as they are required to answer questions in five different languages. Give them a break! We had a harder time in Mexico talking to the people there. I suppose we were lucky because the only problem we had was that our fridge wasn't working one day. We placed a call to guest services and it was working by the time we returned from the beach. We had one day where it was way to windy to sit at the beach and we had to go to the pool that day. Not a problem at all. Although it was very packed at the pool that day there was an adequate amount of lounge chairs. I wouldn't call this a topless resort although there were a number of women who did go topless. We walked along the beach on two different days and it was the exact same at every resort that we passed. We had fun walking to the town that is about a 15 minute walk down the beach. We got a real taste of their lifestyle. The vendors are aggressive in trying to sell to you. I didn't really like it but my husband loved it and did a great job bartering for souvenirs. We booked with Sun holidays and for the price we payed I can't imagine expecting anything more. We would go back for sure.

<Content>the beach is beautiful This resort was supposed to be a 4 star and in some ways it was. We booked through World of Vacations from Halifax and were there for able to use the Ocean bavaro and The Ocean Cana parts of the hotel the Ocean cana is booked mainly with Italians nad a few Canadians thrown in. the shows in Ocean Cana were totally in Italian but the buffet was much less crowded and noisey so we tended to eat there alot. The buffet in Ocean Bavaro was very busy food was repetitive. You can reserve the alacarte returants as many times as you want they were all very good except the Mexican (they really do put cheeze whiz on almost every-thing. this resort does do made to order omellets at breakfast but no blender smoothies at the bufftes or any of the bars all drinks like banana mamas and pina coladas were in a machine and not realy very good. The loby bar was the only one that made some original drinks such as sex on the beach Our room was in the 100 block which was far from the beach etc. but was at least new ,quiet and very clean. The beach is realy nice and lots of chairs at the pool as well I've never seen so many no need to save chairs except to get shade and even then you usualy can find it.. We took a catamaran out several times if you know how to sail (they give you a test) you can go yourself at no charge if not they charge a fee for a captain. We took one excursion to go on a sunset horse back ride on hte beach, very fun but kind of long for us since we hadn't been on a horse for about 30years. we looked for soft chairs for a couple of days after. Service at the Buffet and the bars is often very bad you see very little tipping (no wonder)

<Content>A mixed bag We just returned from this resort last evening and because I've found reviews on this site very helpful (and mostly on point), I thought I'd offer mine.Overall, the resort is very well manicured, and the grounds are beautiful. The rooms themselves are very plain and we had very little water pressure in our shower (had to unscrew the shower head to get enough water pressure to adequately wash our hair), but otherwise acceptable.We found the service (other than the story below) very good. A rudimentary understanding of Spanish is helpful as only about half the staff speaks any English, but not that difficult to overcome (hand gestures tend to translate very well). One warning, though. If you are American, be prepared to try to understand French as 80% of the guests seemed to be Canadian or French and the resort really caters to them. I was really prepared to speak Spanish, but when a few employees greeted me with Hola, bonjour I wanted to scream. To be fair, everything in writing is translated in English/French/German, but there is definitely a favoring of the French there.The quality of the food varied widely. The buffet restaurants were very average, but the Italian, Spanish and Brazillian restaurants were very good. The Mexican restuarant is to be avoided at all costs (made me long for Taco Bell).The beach was nice, but it seemed like the wind never let up - not a nice ocean breeze, but a real wind. The pools, however, are very nice and protected from the wind. And the bars are closer to them anyway.The spa was wonderful (we paid for more than the 20-minute massage below) and very professionally run (by a separate company).Now for my horror story. The first night we were there, we were very pleased to be in Bloque 7, a building right by the beach. We were on the 3rd floor in the last room - great view overlooking the beach itself. Well, after we went to sleep, I was awaken at 3AM by something crawling up the back of my neck. I instinctively threw whatever it was off of me and turned the lights on to find out what the heck it was. After searching high and low, and shutting off the lights several times and listening for any sounds, I finally found the cuplrit - a big brown MOUSE. I had to call the desk twice for them to send someone up to help me catch it and when they finally did, they acted surprised to see a mouse at all. To wake up to a mouse like that was disturbing, but the part that really bothered us is that when we reported the whole ordeal to the guest services people the next day, they acted like we were making up the story. To their credit, they eventually gave us a massage at the spa (albeit a 20 minute one) to try to satisfy us, but they really treated us like liers. It's one thing to be woken up by a mouse crawling up your neck, but then to be accused of lying about it?Anyway, I had to tell myself several times that we had gotten a phenomenal deal on the place, and given that, we had a good time. I'd recommend the place if you get a very good deal, but it was very, very average and not a four-star resort as some others have indicated.adios (and au revior)

<Content>Beautiful property, bad front desk service Stayed Feb 21-28. It's a beautiful property with lots of palm trees, flowers, and the best beach set-up in that section of Punta Cana.There are lots of options: two distinct pool areas (one kid-oriented, one quiet.); many restaurants and snack bars; and a large beach area (some sections quiet, some noisy.) Rooms ok -- plain, spare, lighting awful. Room locations vary widely. We were in the very back of the property, a long walk to the beach. Buildings 5, 6, 7 and 8 seem to be the best (near beach and pools.) But we grew to appreciate our quiet room location when the evening concerts and performances began. They are very loud and I suspect the rooms near them hear it all.HOWEVER -- the front desk staff are horrible. Very rude. Always argumentative. They fight you on every request or discussion. There's always a crowd of guests at the front desk trying to get moved from rooms with problems (blocked toilets, no shower heads, broken A.C.) Luckily, we had none of those kinds of problems, but the front desk spoils your impression of the entire resort.By comparision, we found all the other staff (restuarants, bars, etc.) to be warm and friendly.We went with very low expectations of the food in the D.R. so were pleasantly surprised that a lot was quite decent. But definitely don't plan to dine gourmet. Also -- avoid the main buffet (crowded) and book the a la carte restuarants for dinner. The Brazilian is grilled meats -- often dry but good variety. The Italian was good -- simple pastas, chicken, steak. The Mexican was the worst -- bland, boring, overcooked.The buffet breakfast at the Bahia restuarant at the beach is a much better choice than the main buffet. Avoid the local wines, particularly, the white (very sweet.) The wine selection available for purchase at the restuarants is limited -- but there are some good Chileans. We bought wine at Duty Free on the way down and took it to the dinners. They're happy to uncork for you.You need to get to the beach by 8 a.m. latest if you want to grab a palapa. There are lots of palms and palapas (many more than at the neighbouring resorts) but there are also a lot of people!There are a lots of games and non-motorized sports if you want to do them. We had a great, low-key timing, lazing by the beach.P.S. -- re: the person who commented about the resort being topless... hello, it's not a topless resort but it does have a large European clientele (Italian, Spanish and German) many of whom do tend to go topless at beaches. If you want to have an American experience, go to Florida.

<Content>Worst vacation trip ever! My family and I just returned from what we condersider to be the worst vacation trip we have ever taken. We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from Feb. 18-24. We were completed dissapointed and put out with our vacation. Upon arrival to our hotel it took over an hour to check in. Once we checked and got settled in our room we went to the beach. We were given cards to get beach towels only to find out they didn't have anymore. It took us until the next day at 1pm to get some.As for the food, it was horrible. We lived on frech fries. The alcoholic beverages were also nasty. They didn't even have any blenders to mix drinks. Depending on which bar you went to depended on how the drink was made. There was no consistency.The resort included all non-motorized water sports so we were looking forward to snokeling everyday. You couldn't snorkel because there were waves coming in all of the time. It was completely dissapointing.We also didn't know that it was a topless beach. In none of the reviews that I read or with dealing with my travel agent was I made aware of this. We went as a family and took our 10 and 13 year old children. I wasn't happy with this at all.The people at the resort spoke very, very little English. It was very difficult and frustrating to try and communicate with them.To make matters worse our air conditioner in our room quite working on three different days. We were without a.c. for several days. For one entire day they had the ceiling ripped down in our bathroom trying to fix the problem. On another day the power went out for three hours in all of the rooms. On yet another day we had no cable for an entire day.The only thing that I have to say good about the resort was the grounds were kept nice and the landscape was pretty.I can't say enough how completed dissapointed we all were with our vacation. It was a complete waste of money. We will never go back again.

<Content>Nice holiday despite screw-up  A few days before departure, our travel agency called to inform us that the hotel was overbooked and we had the option of getting a total refund or accepting a transfer to a 5-5 1/2 star resort (Casa De Campo). Anyway we accepted the move. To make a long story short, an employee for the agency (in the DR) hired by the Ocean Bavaro to book us in the new hotel stole the money and over 150 people were left stranded in the parking lot of the Casa de Campo. We stayed in a 4 bedroom with 4 bathroom) villa complete with Jacuzzi, maid and cook adjacent to the 17th green. Whoo-how! If you can afford this resort (2800US a week and not-inclusive, it is great) After 1 1/2 days of phone calls and meeting, the Ocean Bavaro found some rooms and we were transferred back to our original destination. Big thanks to Benedicto and his staff for making our stay at the Ocean Bavaro resort enjoyable and for arranging various compensation packages for the trouble, despite getting constant verbal abuse by a bunch of obnoxious and arrogant people from the Land of the free, home of the Brave whose primary goal was to eat and drink and who had no compassion for the resort and its staff who stands to loose a bunch of money over this screw-up. Most visitors come from Canada and Europe (mostly from France) with a few Americans. The review; beach, pool and surroundings were great. The food was excellent with lots of selections. Don?t go for the langoustines supper-dinner, it?s a rip-off. The shows and activities were good. The room was ok (we stayed in a villa); we had problems with the AC (called twice to fix it), the hot water was lukewarm during last two days and the hotel key (e-card) had to be reset twice; anyway you don?t go south to stay in your room. Our friends stayed in Bloque 1 and had no water pressure. Other than those minor problems, it was a great holiday and at that price I would probably return. Sucks to be back?

<Content>Amazing Beach-Had a great time!! The Ocean Bavaro Beach and Spa Resort was a great hotel with beautiful beaches and lots of entertainment. My boyfriend and I stayed the week of Feb 9th-15th and really enjoyed ourselves. The food was good at the buffet. The only speciality restaurants that we tried were the Mexican (Good) and the Italian(not good). The hotel grounds were beautiful with unending palm trees. It was beautiful. Our rooms were ok. They do need some updating. As for the drinks-the Presidente beer(draft) was not too good. However, I was drinking them in a mug at lunch and dinner and they seemed to taste better in a glass. The frozen drinks were not frozen. The Bananna Mama's were good though. The staff was friendly. The animation team was amazing. Always getting everyone involved and just having a good time. My boyfriend and I participated in several games. This hotel was great for us. If you have children there was a lot of activity for them as well. There were a lot of children at this resort. We did go to the new casino down the road. It was very small and not worth the trip. There were only 20 slot machines and four tables. We both lost $20. No big deal. Overall, it was a nice place. I would go to this resort again.

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful Like some other people, I was a little bit worried about previous reviews, but as it turns out it was fabulous! I'll give a reference of the main pos and cons BEACH PROS the beach was amazing, huge strech of fine white sand, tons of loungers to sit on, the water was crystal clear blue and warm, perfect for getting a tan, the beach bar was never packed and served great drinks - strawberry daqueries were great but the pina coladas were really strong BEACH CONS there were never any towels afetr 12 noon so get there before 10am STAFF PROS most of them, about 95 per cent, were friendly and helpful (theres about 1000 staff so not everyone can be in a good mood) and even though not all spoke english you can always find someone that does STAFF CONS make sure you bring a travel alarm clock as we did not get our wake up call twice! I was really mad about that because you have to get up early to make a reservation at any of the themed resturants early in the morning so if you slept in all the resurants were booked. Also the day we left they missed our wake up call and we had barely anytime to soke up some last rays on the beach! THE GROUNDS there are no cons about the grounds, there are absolutely beautiful, many paths to walk on, ponds with fountains, flamangos, ducks, peakcocks, tons of flowers and palm trees, very, very well kept and clean (there were tons of matinance staff grooming the grounds) THE POOL I cant think of any cons here either, although I did not use it (I have a pool at home and not a beach!), there is a swim up bar and it was always clean, and warm (don't use the hot tubs as there are not hot and were not in service most of the time. if you want to use a hot tub the spa has one that you can use for 5 dollars US per person but it was not hot either but it had a nice view over the beach). THE ROOM PROS we had a standard room, 2 double beds, t.v, dresser, big closet, and a patio. There was no mold and it was very clean, you have to put your used towels inside the bathtube to get fresh ones, so that may have been some peoples problem. Also the air conditioner worked great! THE ROOM CONS When we first got to the room the bathroom light didn't work and we asked 3 times to get it fixed and someone came the next after noon. RESTURANTS PROS the food at the main buffet was good, lots of selection, great deserts and we had no complaints here. We only went to 2 themed resturants, the Italian which was o.k and the Brazilain which was great! They had a buffet and then they come around with fresh of the BBQ meats (pork, beef, chicken and turkey!) In the after noon this resturant also has a buffet thats smaller but very good. There is also a pizzaria opened 24 hrs with great pizza, and during the after noon has roasted chicken thats amazing! We didn't get sick at all but we did take some IMMODIUM just in case. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER not even to brush your teeth! THE BARS all the bars were great. The pool bar got busy when the nightly entertainment was done though (by the way the previous posting said men get served faster was WRONG women definitely got served faster!) The beach bar is only opened util 6 pm except when there are beach parties (where you can dance on the beach) The lobby had some live music where there is also a bar and then there is the dico...small and smokey beacuse they use those fog machines but there is a terrace outside where it is quiter (its the only bar opened until 2 am) EXCUSIONS we went snokerling on a sunset catermarran that leaves at 2:30 amd takes you to a natural pool...not that many types of fish but still very nice, all you can drink as well so a good price for 34 US$ per person. There were 6 of us in total on the excusion and one other couple gave the boat driver 20 dollars canadian to take us out futher! We also went on 4x4's on a different excusion which was neat because you drive yourself! You go through the forest area and then along the beach were you stop to swim in the ocean. I would only reccomend this to the adventerous type because the ride is a little rough and would not please some people. They also had some animals on the ranch but nothing crazy. This excursion was all you can drink and eat as well THE SHOPPING PROS lots of beach venders, with many nice things, larimar is a local stone with is light blue and is beautiful and abundant, also necklaces, cigars, amazing paintings and crafty type things SHOPPING CONS there are very persistant! They ask about 300 per cent more than its worth so bargain HARD and I mean HARD. Also don't buy any watches, my boyfriend bought a watch and when we got back to our room we noticed it stopped working! Also they say amber is abundant but I didn't see much that was actually REAL! becareful because most of it is plastic except for some. The gift shop had some really nice amber but it was really expensive (as with ALL the gift shop items - try to buy as little from the gift shop as possible) Some last notes...almost all guest spoke french, there were many topless sunbathers (guys most are NOT attractive), bring your own snacks like chips (too expensive to buy), everything is in US and if you bring travellers cheques the front desk doesn't always have US monsy so you can cash them, and thats about it! Overall it was fabulous! It was the first time my boyfriend and I went away together and altough we loved Punta Cana, we are young and want to explore other places! I do reccomend this resort though so don't be worried about previous reveiws and go have fun!

<Content>great trip My husband and I just returned from a 4 day trip to Ocean Bavaro. Everything about the trip was great from the beginning. We were greeted at the front desk with drinks and told our room would be ready in an hour, which turned out to be an hour before regular check in time. Then, we were upgraded to a Deluxe Suite with a whirlpool tub and told it was there gift to us. I do not know if they overbooked our category or what happened, but we were not going to complain!! Our room was great! The food was good. We never had any trouble getting enough to eat. The thing you have to realize is that you are in a different country and their spices and tastes are different than ours. If you want American food, don't leave the country. The beach and the pool are great and we never had any trouble finding a spot and we were there Valentine's weekend, so I'm sure they were busy. All in all it was a great trip and we will probably return, next time with our two kids. The staff was friendly and I did not feel at a great disadvantage not speaking Spanish. Most staff spoke some English and went out of their way to understand what we needed. Punta Cana airport was a breeze getting through and it is adorable. Cannot wait to go back!

<Content>Exceeded our expectations!! My wife and I just arrived home from the Ocean Bavaro, we had great time. I was a bit nervous after reading some of the comments posted on here. I must say this place was wonderful!! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had a great time. The staff was great, friendly, helpful and not a problem. Our room was wonderful as previously described in a post. (block6) The only downside to the trip was that we were not accustomed to the European style of sun bathing!!! We will be returning for sure!!!

<Content>Definitely recommend this resort My boyfriend, daughter (6) and I just returned from a week at the Ocean Bavaro (Jan-Feb/04). We had a wonderful time. The grounds are beautiful, clean and constantly being maintained. The beach is incredible with soft, white sand that never gets hot and the ocean was warm, although a bit rough for swimming. It was 30C every day, with only two half days with a bit of cloud. There were lots of good chairs, many shaded, on the beach and around the pools, although beach towels are hard to get. We stayed in the new Block 6 ? Caribbean Spa Rooms ? the nicest rooms we?ve seen in the Caribbean ? large and clean with two comfortable double beds and ceramic floors (bring slippers); a sunken living area with day bed, tv, mini-fridge (stocked daily with water, soda and beer) and coffee-maker (with D.R. coffee but no filters); and a beautiful marble bathroom with Jacuzzi tub. We had difficulty getting towels in our room, and the towels were not changed daily, even though we left tips for the cleaning staff. Included with our room was a day at the Metamorphosis Spa with an aromatherapy sauna, whirlpool bath, natural product body exfoliation, fruit body wrap, facial and massage, plus use of a fairly well-equipped gym overlooking the ocean ? very relaxing. I also had three massages on the beach ? the ones by Metamorphosis staff for $15 US/half hour were the best ? warm breeze, ocean waves, warm silky hands ? heaven! My massage at the ?Massaje? hut for $10 US/half hour was less appealing as it was crowded, there was a musty smell and the linens were not changed between customers. The food was very good ? we were worried about food poisoning, but after a few days we were eating almost everything in abundance (except raw vegetables and milk/cream, though we ate lots of ice cream; and we never ingested tap water, even brushing our teeth). The meat tended to be overcooked, but we preferred this to food poisoning. Our favorite restaurant was the main buffet. The Brazilian restaurant, Bahia, was very good ? a meat-lovers dream ? as was the Italian, Mezzaluna. We also liked the smaller Bahia buffet and the pizzeria. We disliked the Mexican restaurant, Pepito?s, partly because all the dishes include raw vegetables, which we were avoiding. Warning ? if you agree to a shot of tequila at the Mexican restaurant, the waiters twist your head about quite violently after the shot ? amusing to watch, but not recommended if you have neck problems (or even if you don?t, as you might after). The house wines were awful, but you can order from a decent wine list at reasonable cost. Near the pools, there is a games area with ping pong tables, pool tables and darts, all in good condition. There are two hot tubs near the pools, but the water is tepid at best and emitted a foul odor, so were rarely in use. The Animacion staff were always busy organizing fun activities during the day (volleyball, bocchi ball, water polo, aerobics, dance lessons, bingo, drinking contests etc.). At night, there were live shows with a very outgoing and personable host and decent dancers in colorful costumes, always smiling and energetic, but don?t sit in the front as it is very loud. There is very little live music, just CD?s of merengue playing. Once or twice a week, a talented artist hand-paints custom t-shirts near the beach bar ? a keepsake that is definitely worth the money ($18+US). We went on a jeep safari excursion, which covers a lot of the area around Punta Cana, including a beautiful remote beach on the north east (amber) coast, but it involves about 5 hours of straight driving with no stops for scenic photos. We went snorkeling, arranged through the water sports center at the resort rather than our vacation packager for a fraction of the cost ($24 US versus $68/person), and saw quite a few fish and coral. We shopped in the markets along the beach ? prices are all negotiable, but higher than we expected (e.g., $5 US for a small candle). Most of the guests are European and the staff Spanish, so if you enjoy meeting people on your vacation and you only speak English, this may not be the ideal place. One complaint is that, although the majority of the staff were very pleasant and accommodating, we found on several occasions that staff would agree to a request we made, then walk away never to be seen again ? my boyfriend speaks Spanish so it was not a language issue ? in the end we learned not to ask or to help ourselves. My only major complaint, as a female living in a land of equality (Canada), was that males are favored, particularly at the bars, where women are only served after the men (no matter what order you arrive), and sometimes not even then. Apart from this, I loved this resort and would recommend it.

<Content>Not Quite 4-star We were a group of 9 who stayed at the Ocean Bavaro resort 24-31 January 2004. This resort is rated 4-star by most Tour companies, but Signature Vacations rates it 3.5 stars. We have been to several resorts in Punta Cana over the last 7 years. The weather was fabulous. Ocean Bavaro was average to above-average in most areas, like the beach, the food, the drinks and the entertainment. No complaints, it was good value for money. Nothing is perfect in life, so I simply want to point out three areas where the hotel needs to be improved. (1) Towards the second half of the week, the house wine (both red and white) was terrible; it tasted as if it had ben mixed with sherry. We ended up buying bottled wine at about $14 US per bottle. Not 4-star level. (2) We stayed in Block 1. The room was definitely not a 4-star room - there was mould on the ceiling and the walls; it needed a good paint job. The patio door would not lock and the bathroom door would stick.(3) The public washrooms near the beach were too few and most of them were either closed for repairs, flooded on the floors, or had maintenance people working in them. Not 4-star quality. If these kinds of issues do not bother you, then I repeat, Ocean Bavaro is good value for money, but I have to agree with Signature Vacations, it is no more than a 3.5 star hotel.

<Content>Never Again! The staff was rude and untrained. The first room they gave me there was mold on the cieling of my room, no shower head and the door lock and TV was broken. I was moved to the room I booked which wound up being across from a construction site. They did not change the cloth table linen between guests in the dining room. They ran out of silverware, ice and soda. DO NOT GO TO OCEAN BAVARO. Book a hotel room in Washington Heights, NYC instead and save your $.

<Content>We'll go back! We journeyed to the resort January 16th - 24th. We picked this resort primarily because of the positive reviews and the great price on the internet from sun holidays. Short drive from the airport (25 min). The resort is beatifull! Great gardens, nice mood lighting, excellent walking paths through the resort and a gorgeous beach. We'll point form for some quick points; Pro's: nicest pool weve visited (clean, large, 3 islands, etc) and we've seen many, very kid friendly (both the pool and the resort itself) amazing beach front with great white sand,lots and lots to do if you want or beautifull enouph to sit back and relax for the week, staff was extremely friendly and polite, variety of food was fantastic, something for everyone, the ala carte restaurants were tremendous, great service and quick, lots of pool and beach chairs, clean room and well stocked bar fridgeCons; very few staff spoke english, brush up on your spanish before you go, a little agressive animation team when it comes to the beach activities, included local wines are bad but a great variety of quality wines available for a reasonable cost $24. US), If you don't love spanish music bring your own, staff seem to lie about what everything costs, if they say 25 expect 40, Followed all the rules about the local water but still got a case of Montazumas revenge (BRING IMMODIUM).A quick money saver, we were told that if we make a long distance call to be sure and use the outside phone service (not hotel room) as it would be cheaper. I discovered that if we had used that service it would have cost us $15 US for the connection charge and $1.95 a minute US. It ended up costing us .50 a minute from the hotel room to call Canada with no connection feeWe will definately be going back next year with our 5 year old son.

<Content>Great Room, Great Beach, Great Time!! my husband and I stayed for a week at the Ocean Bavaro Beach resort Jan 15 - 22 / 2004. It was a great experience! We had a great room (#6204) which had a jacuzzi and overlooked the beach/ocean. We woke up everyday to see the blue water just outside our balcony! The beach was by far the best in Punta Cana! We walked along the beaches and checked out other resorts and ours was the whitest, cleanest, most chairs, most shade umbrellas, and most room. We never felt crowded there. The swimming in the pol or the ocean was great too. We took some bananas from the buffet one morning and snorkelled in front of the hotel. we fed the fish and saw sea snakes, and sand fish! So Cool! The food was pretty good.....we definetely always found something good to eat! The a la carte restaurants not so good....the Brazillian one was our fav. but the Italian one was pretty bad. We stuck to Buffet for all of our meals after that. We did a snorkelling excursion called Catamaran reef. Our guide was Lorenzo and he wqas so informative and made the experience unforgettable. Definetely reccommend that one! We didn't really take part in any of the night life (disco / beach party) as we were sooo tored after a long day of beaching it! The staff were friendly and some knew a bit of English. Lots of French  Italian guests too. overall it was a great time and we would go back  reccommend it to others! One more thing.....we brought some of our favorite snacks....peanuts, chips, licorice etc.... They are rreally expensive at the gift shop. Also, leave little things for the housekeepers...nail polish, barretts, candy, etc... They love it and clean your room really good. Have Fun!!

<Content>looky looky just got back from this hotel last night. overrall this was a nice relaxing vacation. i thought that this hotel wouldn't be as busy as say a barcelo hotel. getting off the plane and walking to the airport was cool and the drive to the hotel didn't take too long. we didn't arrive at the hotel until after 7:00 pm. so i was very tired. we wanted to check in but they said that the rooms weren't ready yet and said that we had to go eat supper first. that was the last thing i felt like doing, just wanted to go to the room already. found the staff to be very friendly and i find that even the littlest bit of spanish goes a long way, even just by saying hola! they gave us the wrong key for the safety deposit box, so we had to keep bugging them about it. the food wasn't the greatest, lunch time was the best. pool area was very nice, 3 different ones, one with a swimup bar. there was always nightly entertainment, started a little too late but the anamacion team was awesome, really got the crowd involved. the beach was okay, still lots of garbage along most of the beach. do not keep the patio doors open that's when all the bugs come in, geckos and cockroaches. really enjoyed the tours that we went on; 1 to saona island and the bavaro runners. the saona tour is very long and way too many people. if you can barter well you can get great deals! the only thing that i didn't like about my trip was that everything had to be translated, english speaking people were a minority.. they had special events and areas for the italians and the french people made up at least 85% of the tourists. i've never seen so many rude, snobs! never said hello and they just stared at you like you were from a different planet, that really annoyed me. i think next time i would like to go to a resort where it is a bit more quieter but the staff made up for it

<Content>Enjoyed It I enjoyed my stay at this hotel (first week of January 2004). I found the check-in easy and the room spacious and clean. Everything in the room worked and smelled fine and the mini-fridge was well stocked with water and soda. The grounds were beautiful and the pools were large and clean. There was never a problem finding a chair by the pool or on the beach.The buffet was very big, with seating inside and out and the food was fine. The hot stuff was hot and the cold stuff was cold and there was enough food for everyone, with a lot of variety (esp. fresh fruit and juices). The red wine they served at the buffet was truly awful - be warned!!!The only big downside was the mexican buffet. The cooks have obviously never been to Mexico. I am NOT a fussy eater at all - I happily eat absolutely everything. However, I was surprised to find that the so-called natchos and cheese which they served everyone were chips with cheese-wiz. My friend and I were even more alarmed to discover that they put this stuff (which looked, smelled and tasted exactly like cheese-wiz) all over our dinners. My friend orderd the Encheladas which the menu said came with cream cheese. I orderd Chimmichangas. We then realized that cream cheese was not cream cheese at all, but the cheese-wiz stuff (and it was all over not only his food but mine as well). Oh well!!!!The resort seems to cater to couples and families, mostly from Europe - not a lot of English spoken. I visited some of the other resorts on the Bavaro beach and believe that the grounds and pools/beach at the Ocean Bavaro are extremely nice, clean and well maintained compared with the others. I had a massage in the spa for $20 US for about 45 minutes which was very good. I am not sure I would go back to this resort but I enjoyed my time there and have no complaints (other than the cheese-wiz incident which was not really a big deal at all).

<Content>pleasantly surprised I was at the ocean bavaro from jan3/04-jan 10/04.I was a little leery due to other reviews.it didn't start too well as check-in took an hour so 'come on beer' while i waited.Our room was in block 5 which was recommended by another reviewer.Thank you!The room was right by the beach.the room was very nice with a balcony,satellite tv,fridge stocked daily and a fair sized bathroom.The grounds are gorgeous, beautifully landscaped[complete with roaming flamingoes]. It has 2 big pools,one with a swim-up bar. The beach and ocean are beautiful. There is some seaweed in the ocean but it's no big deal.The food was fine. We ate at the reservations-needed restaurants as well as the buffets. We preferred the buffets as you could get in and get out. Being a typical Canadian; i like my beer.Unfortunately, it was draft beer{not bottled} so by the 5th day there my stomach was killing me. I switched to bottled corona which was $2U.S. each.As i said, i'm not a draft drinker so i didn't care. English is not widely spoken there so communication can be a slight problem. The staff is all over the place and well managed. The music is all spanish so if u like north american music,take some. I had 2 massages by the beach which was 20US for 1 hour{cheap}. I probably tipped about 100US over the week which the staff really appreciated. I know some cheap prick will say that wasn't necessary but that's how u get served while others are still waiting. My girlfriend went to the shows at night and said they were very good. I was usually pretty drunk by then so i would go to the room. I am writing this off of the top of my head so i'm sure i'm leaving things out. The weather was sunny and hot. Overall, i was quite impressed and i would go back to the same place.

<Content>very clean but the food is horrible My boyfriend and I were at this hotel from december 21st to december 26th 2003. I thought the hotel was very clean and the room very nice. The beach is great and the staff very friendly although they didn't speak basic english. The down side to this hotel is the food. We are not fussy people at all and eat just about anything but 3 days after our arrival half the hotel was sick so something must have been wrong. The other 2 things which I didn't like were the price of the excursions which were very expensive although very good. We did the outback jungle safari and we recommend it to everyone. The other problem was that our hotel was also a vera club which means that certain restaurants and the entertainment for italians and spoken in italian only. If you did not have a blue bracelet, you were treated like ****. All in all we enjoyed the place but there wasn't much to do or visit outside the hotel. We will not be returning.

<Content>wow what a week We just got back from the Ocean Bavaro and we have nothing but rave reviews for this hotel. The food was simply amazing, the staff almost overly helpful and the grounds were to die for. The food was clearly maked in the buffet and the wine lists were more than complete. At one point we had a problem with our safe and we also had some water dripping from the bathroom ceiling (not a good sign). For both problems we had help at our door within ten minutes. By the way, the water from the ceiling was just some excess condensation from the A/C. The hotel was booked solid but the lineup at the main desk was never more than two people long (they seem to have at least three people behing the counter 24/7). Check-in was a breeze. Yes you do have to get up early to reserve a place by the pool but if you are one for the beach there are always chairs available. By the way, for those of you who have read the reviews mentioning loud music at the beach; there is over 300 meters of beach available to this resort and only ONE place where they play music. There are helicopter flyovers on the beach every 45 minutes but who cares!? They are gone in less than 10 seconds. The boats DO NOT come to close to the swimming area (which is CLEARLY marked) and not once for a week did a see any boat passing the swimming area markers. All in all, this was an unforgetable trip and I would recommend this resort to everyone.

<Content>A Fantastic Time A groug of us travelled last minute at a discounted price, it was such a price that I was certainly concerned about what we were getting into. The staff were friendly, rooms were clean and well appointed and aside from construction outside our window, it couldn't have been better. The resort has some of the best beach in Bavaro, it is deep, with good shade (but not too much) and very clean. The food was good (aside from lunch) - the buffet was good, although selection was limited, tonnes of fruit and fantastic breads. Lunch was poor, with only a handful of leftover dinner dishes - so we stuck to a liquid lunch of Presidente! The a la carte restraunts were fantastic and the Spanish and Brazilian were the best! Swimming Pools were large and clean and many an afternoon was spent at the pool bar. Having travelled to many a Caribbean all-inclusive, this would be one of the best as of yet!

<Content>ignore early reviews! Having read early reviews of hotel i too was somewhat concerned! It was however a pleasant surprise and we had a great time. Our room was in block 5 nr the beach overlooking the sea - a good one to request as has great view! The room was fine with all things working as they should. The maids however were selective on how many drinks you got each day in the fridge- sometimes 1 sometimes 6! It was clean and well maintained and no faults there. There was a little noise with the new blocks being built but should imagine theyll be finished in the next few weeks.The resturants were all above average but having spent 2 weeks there they were a little boring after a while! But saying that theres always something for everyone and you wont go hungry! As for the stomach situation everyone i spoke to including myself and my partner had an element of dihhorrea for the entire time. It wasnt an overwhelming issue but it depending how well you cope with it. My partner did vomit one nite after eating fish but some people ate fish every nite and were fine so again it could happen anywhere.The staff were in general great. The resturant staff were always attentive and helpful as were the bar staff. The evening entertainment was really quite good. The dancers are too good for hotel entertainment and were a pleasure to watch. Apparently the hotel had a number of complaints concerning lack of staff and have since taken on an extra 300 staff and it does show. There is always someone to help you in any way they can. We also used the gym a lot and the guy who runs it is very helpful and the equipment is above average. The spa staff are sweet but watch out for the massages - they have some odd technique of pulling your toes - not relaxing!!!Overall we had a great and even tropical storm odette and 30 inches of rain in 24hrs didnt hinder our enjoyment! Id recommend you go with an open mind. Many people whod visited a number of hotels in the area said it was by far the best and i get the feeling its greatly improved in recent months. The staff are good, the trips are good, the resturants are good - the illness could happen anywhere! And the beach is one of the best ive ever seen - and thats including thai, indonesian and fijian beaches so thats saying something! Just enjoy it and soak up the sun!

<Content>Simply wonderful! I visited Punta Cana from December 12th to 19. Staying at Ocean Bavaro Beach Resort made the experience at truly remarkable one. The animation was terrific. The beach....well....WOW! A tropical storm had just passed and seaweed would make its way to the beaches but the hotels staff would be hard at work taking those weeds off the beach. The staff is extremely friendly and the landscaping is nothing short of spectacular. The food was good and the specialty restaurants great. If one decides to go down there I would strongly suggest the Saona Catamaran expedition. this expedition will take you to a natural pool, in the middle of the carribean ocean. then you will head off to saona island in the carribean were you will stay at a beautiful beach with plenty of seashells in the water. the waves are great and the water a never been seen blue.

<Content>Will be going back for sure! Was there from 11/07/03-11/14/03. It was awsome...n I WILL be going back! ROOM: Pretty nice...A/C worked perfectly, TV n fridge weren't working but one of the staff came n fixed it right away. I didn't have any problem with the room through out the whole vacation. But there are many little aunts around the sink in the bathroom. FOOD: Main buffet is good but very repetative. Italian restaurant was not that great but Brazilian restaurant was awsome! Snack bars r awsome! I ate most of meals at the snack bar~PIZZA!!Very good! BEACH/POOL: Can't describe it in words...absolutely amazing! It rained almost everyday while I was there but dat still didn't ruin my vacation. Swimming in the ocean when it rained was so fun. Kayak was also fun~The pool was pretty nice. Wasn't too crowded but the pool closes at 7 or 8 so...dat I didn't like. BAR/DRINKS: Only went to the lobby bar once n it wasn't too good. Only went to the beach bar once n the staff was extremely blah~not rude...but maybe he was tired or sumthin~?!Swim up bar was awsome~Fun music..Fun staff!BANANA MAMA STAFF: Loved them!!!I'm so bad with names but met 2 lovely girls(1 braided my hair n the other worked at the Brazilian restaurant-Hope you liked my make-up!haha) Never got the chance to really get to know the animacion team but they were very nice n entertaining~!(Miss you Walter my temp.BF haha)Neways...Don't wanna make this too long~If you goto Bavaro go on Bavaro Runners day tour~!I had SOOO much fun!Miss everything about Punta Cana so much n this CHINO will b goin back for sure!!

<Content>Fantastic From the time we arrived the locals were friendly and helpful. We were given a cool towel and non-alcoholic cocktail on arrival (not what you get in Europe!).We were shown to our room by our rep (Claire) who was extremely helpful the whole holiday.We had upgraded for a small amount extra and it was well worth it. We had a jacuzzi in the room, massive bed, mini bar refilled daily, towelling robes provided and fresh fruit or biscuit/cakes each day. We did have a problem with the jacuzzi which was fixed with 30 minutes - you couldn't ask for better.We took advantage of lots of trips. We swam with the sharks and rays. We took the helicopter flight over the bay. We hired a speed boat and snorkelled off the reef (the guides are exceptional). We visited Saona Island, which is beautiful beyond belief. And we went to Manati Park and swam with dolphins. All these trips were made easier by the rep and the helpful people who run them. I would go back tomorrow.The food was plentiful and enough choice for any taste bud.The beach was, as you would expect, tropical and clean. The large pool and pool bar were being repaired when we were there and opened on the last day but it didn't stop any enjoyment.The entertainment was non-stop. I would advise if you don't like dancing then don't go because you won't get away from from it. Even the 'rockery' in the gardens play music!!We went in the middle of September (for two weeks) and watching the evening entertainment was ridiculously hot - take some cool clothes - the evenings are as warm as the days if not more!!The locals have a lot of respect for you and it shows.Highly recommended.

<Content>beautiful grounds I have just gotten back from the Ocean Bavaro resort. The grounds are very beautiful but the rooms are average. There is a big problem with staff who understand english, not many do. There is a separate area for a tour group from Italy called Veraclub, and certain amenities are only for them which we did not find out about until we got there. Tons of people from France. Barely any english speaking tourists. Also, their food is not clearly labelled. I have a severe life-threatening seafood allergy and had to have my husband smell most of the dishes first. One night happened to be seafood night and I could not risk eating in their buffet restaurant. We requested to eat in one of their a la carte restaurants and were told no, we needed a reservation. After a few choice word with the manager he got us into the Italian restaurant. Other than that the pool was nice and the nightly shows were pretty good.

<Content>What are they talking about? I read these reviews before my departure a week ago and frankly was apprehensive, as in: What have I got myself into?. My main purpose in posting this is to clear up some of the BS that has been posted below. This hotel is clean, spectacularly beautiful, and (imo) decently maintained. My room was spotless, the shower was hot, the A/C worked fine, the maid was courteous, the grounds and the beach were immaculate. The variety, quantity, and quality of the food offered on the buffet was excellent. Although personally I would like to see some spicier items on offer, this is a Dominican Republic problem, not an Ocean Bavaro problem. These folks like bland food,period. On a negative note, there should be a toaster available in the main dining hall every morning, not just when someone thinks about trotting it out (there is one in the secondary dining room - this is a merger of two hotels). The beaches are beautiful and well-maintained. and are probably among the nicest in the D.R., certainly compared to the Puerta Plata complex. OK, lets talk about your fellow guests: Yep, there's a lot of Francais-de-France (as opposed to Francais-de-Quebec - a totally different person, not necessarily with the same points of view. Yeah, you may consider them rude, but this is a cultiral thing and how does this become the establishment's fault? Is the fact that you find your fellow guests might have different values than yourself something we need to read about? If I had to find a major fault, it would be the gift shop. It's pricy, when there are marked prices they are in US dollars. This hotel is not in the United States, and at least 90% of the clientele is not from the USA. A rip-off, as there is a supermarket a five-minute walk from the hotel with a mixed trade of locals and tourists that treats all their customers equally, prices are marked and are in pesos. I made the mistake of trying to buy an after-dinner cigar here one evening. The clerk attempted to sell me a cigar for US$25. Even after I explained that all I wanted was an after-meal smoke, the reply was Well, how much will you offer?. No prices were marked on any of their cigars. Solved the problem by visiting the supermarket and not buying so much as a newspaper from the gift shop. With this noteable exception, this place is a four-star facility with three-star pricing. I'd be happy to spend another spur-of-the-moment holiday there.

<Content>The best vacation ever!!!!! Where do I start? This was the most amazing trip I have been on ever. I went from Oct 13 - 19. From getting off the airplane and landing onto paradise was just pure heaven!!!! When we first arrived at the hotel, within seconds the hotel have us a wet towel to cool down along with a very tasty tropical drink. After we got our bands put on, we headed our for lunch....The Food was awesome! I really liked how everyday they had a theme for the day,and food...Ex. Dominican Night, french Night, Mexican Night...It was also nice that the Los Panos Hapy Club, and performers did amazing preformances each night to entertain the guests. And, the preformances were AMAZING!!! You would pay BIG BUCKS somewhere else to see that. They were like Broadway preformers, yet so friendly as they all interacted with the guests after the shows. EVERYONE who worked there was so friendly. not one person didn't say hello, which made me feel so welcome there! We also went to Manati park, and that was a pretty nice outing. Swimming with the dolphins was so cool! The only thing was, it went by too fast! I wish we had a longer time with them! The performers at the park as well performed execeptionally well! Also, onw night they had a beach party at night! Wow...that was a beautiful sight! The beach was just how you would dream it to be! Just like those magazines! The rooms, were very big, clean, and the maid was so nice...Carlita was her name! For, all the members at the club animacion, and all the bartenders, and everyone that worke there made such an excellent impression on us! Oh...and the flee market...make sure you bargain HARD! Once you stay strong...you'll get things there very cheap! Bottles of booze for as low as 2.00 US!!!! Anyways, to finish my story....whenever I am going away on vacation..now..it will ALWAYS be Punta Cana Ocean Bavaro!!!!!! THIS WAS MY BEST VACATION EVER!!!!

<Content>Had a great time i just returned from the ocean bavaro. we loved it! had a great time, once we found english speaking visitors! there are a lot of europeans there, so we had to look around a bit. it's mostly french and spanish, but the staff know all languages. the food was good, rooms were nice, good service, nice beach. what more to say? i would go back for sure. the a la carte restaurants were really nice. also a show every night. i think it would be a great spot for families, there's quite a lot of activities going on during the day. check it out!

<Content>Excellent resort Came back 3 weeks ago. Had a fantastic time. I really can't fault the resort at all. The people are friendly, the food was really nice....always a variety and the beach was gorgeous.You must try the lobster restaurant which cost $30 for 3 courses, amazing value.Our room was perfect, clean and spacious. The air con was too cold at times but that's just an added bonus!!I would definitely come back again.Don't believe all the reviews you read, I must admit that I was abit hesitant about going as some people gave bad reviews. Personally I loved everything about it.

<Content>Enjoyed it I took this vaction on my own which I often do. It was my first time in Punta Cana.It was a package with Apple Vacations that I booked on line and the airline was Champion, a charter airline that left from JFK. My flight out was great, we left on time and had a smooth flight.Unfortunately it was raining when we arrived in Punta Cana. I was a little worried knowing that it was close to hurricane season and you never know what type of weather you're going to get. The Apple rep was there to greet me and took me to the bus that would take us to our hotels. I was the last to be dropped off and it took about a half hour.I couldn't get into my room until three and was told to go to the lunch buffet. I did so and realized that everyone was speaking a different language. I can speak some spanish so that was helpful if I needed something. In most of the hotel reviews people were complaining that the hotel workers don't speak english. Why would they when 99% of the guests are from Europe. I was amazed that they speak three to five languages, spanish, french, german, italian and portugese. Imagine speaking all those languages and making $200.00 a month. Come on you guys give them a break!!!My room was nice and big and I was really lucky and got a room with a view of the beach in the building right on the beach as opposed to the garden view I was supposed to have. Everything worked toilet and ac. I always had towels and room was always cleaned.The beach is really nice, a great beach for walking. The water is clear and warm. Oh and the weather was really beautiful for the rest of the week. It did rain a couple of times but would only last a couple of minutes and that usually happened at night.I didn't really like the food and I did get sick twice. Luckily it happened at night. I would wake up with stomach cramps and got sick but by the morning I was fine. I must admit I did eat everything and maybe should have been more careful.I had a good time and really relaxed which is what I wanted from this vacation. Punta Cana is an inexpensive vacation, much cheaper than anywhere else in the Caribbean and Mexico and believe me you can have the problems anywhere you travel. So just be open and positibe and learn to laugh about life instead

<Content>What a Terrible Hotel What a #@*# of hotel. Horrible, horrible conditions.It was so bad I will never recommend this hotel in Punta Cana. In this respect, we got two rooms in front of a construction site (workers arrived at 06h00 in the morning and stopped working after 23h00 in the evening). Furthermore, the rooms were marked by rot on the ceilings. Needless to point out that the air was marked by a bad enclosed smell. By the way, we noticed a lot of people changing on a continuous way their rooms! My wife and myself, we spent a lot of our time at the service desk trying to get another room, respectively that the workers at the building site outside should stop working after 23h00 in the evening. The service was poor and unfriendly - it was extremely difficult finding someone to help you with anything -all they kept saying was come back tomorrow. CHOOSE SOME PLACE ELSE TO VACATION, NOT HERE!

<Content>Loved it!! Great for my kids!! Having read the reviews done by other travelers, I was nervous about my visit to Ocean Bavaro with my children. I was very pleasantly surprised upon our arrival! Clean, beautiful, great activities for my kids ages 14, 15, 16. I have stayed in numerous high quality resorts on other islands, and this ranks among them! No, they don't speak much English, but your on an island visiting their country! Have patience! Regarding everyone complaining about having the runs, well, so did my wife and I. However, I do admit that we ate out half a dozen times in little run down off the beat restaurants. I also got the runs on Bonaire! Big deal. The lack of English speaking tourists was common wherever we went, and we traveled quite a bit during our stay. It is not just a situation at Ocean Bavaro. The island seems to really cater to the French and German. The excursions offered by our agent seemed rather expensive. We inquired about going out on our own, and was advised against it. We wanted to take a water taxi out to snorkle, and the agent said we shouldn't. We ended up walking to some of the local shops and met a few local people that really took care of us. Instead of spending $400 to take a snorkeling excursion to the park and have a guide show us the coral, we had Ramone give us a lift in his water taxi out to the reef, let us snorkle for three hours, brought us cuda libre, all for $75.00 for five people. There are deals to be had outside the resort excursions. My recommendation, Ocean Bavaro is a great, family oriented place. Lot of food all the time. The people are gracious, service good. Be patient. You're not visiting a bed and breakfast in the states! Just look for deals on outside trips from the local people outside the resort.

<Content>You get what you pay for! 4 stars? I don't think so. Check in was a nightmare on day of arrival. Many were given rooms with only one bed when it was a family. Heard lots of horror stories when we finally found other English-speaking guests---of which there were few. Very rude Europeans mobbing the place. They were overbooked-- met a family who were sent up the beach to another hotel for 2 nights as they had no room for them. Lots of people had plumbing problems--brown water in tub, toilets didn't flush, etc. Families with teenagers requesting 2 rooms-- one family had 2 rooms, but they were in completely different buildings. My hair dryer broke during use. Took almost 2 days to get it fixed and only after asking 3 times and getting loud! I got very sick there for about 30 hours-- stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever, chills, headache. Stomach trouble lasted for 9 days. My teenager got sick t day we got home and was sick for 6 days!

<Content>Don't Waste Your Money Well were do I start. This hotel not a resort was not at all what I expected. First off my travel agent told me of course they understand and speak English. You could count on your hand how many could understand you. At least at the front desk they should have had decent people. We were also told we would have a queen or king bed, I guess they do not exist. We never had towels. On a daily basis we had to call them to replace the towels. ANd then you only got 2. THe buffets stunk. If you want to eat at a restaurant get there early as they fill up, not enough spaces. Sure you can drink all you want but try to get the bartendars to understand what you want. I have been sick since I got back two weeks now. The only nice thing I can say good about this resort is that I thought the beach was awesome. THe price is affordable but trust me spend a little more and stay somewheres else.

<Content>Don't go here! Horrible! Stay away from this one! Horrible, Horrible. It was so bad I will never go back to Punta Cana. I spent the first two days at the service desk trying to get a safe, they advertise one in every room. The other couple that went with us, never did get their's. All they kept saying was come back. When you went back you were told to come back again. I finally got mad and they moved me to another room. Still having to go back twice for a safe. The bathroom shower shot across the floor, did not drain and the toilet worked once out of every 3 flushes. This was bad, being as 3 out of 4 of us got sick on the food. I spent the last 4 days throwing up and with violet cramps and the ****! I now call it Punta Cana Pukes and Poops. Food was horrible. This is the worse place I ever went in my life. Very few spoke English and communication was almost impossible. The beach was never cleaned of the seaweed. Due to the high volume of boats and recreation trips by the beach, it was always full of floating seaweed. Lots of seawood. Ruined the view and the water. Do not go to Manti Park! You wait for 2 hours to swim with the dolphins in a small, small, pool. It is not fit for any animal to live like that. It is a dump as well as the hotel. Don't waste your time, money at this hotel.

<Content>All ok but... The hotel was very clean. The lunch was good too.. But all services wasn't fast. You will have to discuss Severely to have what you want(Like a Safe). This hotel needs to have more activities in the days. At christmas, it's boring. We slept at 11PM...

<Content>Save your Money I just returned from a trip to Ocean Bavaro and i can tell you it was truly the worst experience i have encountered while on vacation. When we made our reservations we specifically requested that our rooms be located together because we were a party of 8 with 4 elderly people. To my dismay our request was not granted although our rooms were booked well over a month in advance by Sears Travel.  To add insult to injury our rooms were placed in 4 opposite corners of the hotel. An elderly lady who had knee problems was placed on a second floor with no elevator access. When we requested a wheelchair for her we were told there would be a charge or 30 american dollars per day to rent a wheelchair!  Now here is something that you would not know unless you are travelling as part of a large group. We all payed the same rate, yet of the 4 rooms assigned to us one had an acceptable view and had a fruit bowl there to welcome you the first day. The other room for the same rate had a view of a wall and no fruit and the air conditioner had a fould stench.  After complaining to the front desk for quite a while we were moved to a batter room temporarily for one night to then be moved again closer to the other members of our party.  We were told there would be 5 restaurants a la carte there we only found one buffet restaurant that simply changed the name on the front entrance every evening from mexican to chineese ect..... There is one dedicated mexican restaurant than can hold around 50 people maximum. A number that is not acceptable for a hotel of this capacity. There was one italian restaurant where you can not enter to eat because as was explained to me by a staff member the owners of the two hotels are at odds with each other (As if that were my problem while i am on vacation).  Our final room would have been acceptable were it not for the fact that you could peek right in through a crack on the door about 1/4 wide and the fact that i could enter the room by sliding the credit card on the side of the door (not a great deal of security there).  Simple but skip the dump as i was told by the bus driver on the way back to the airport it is the lowest quality hotel out of all the hotels in the area. I have more nightmares about the hotel but this should give you a general overview as to how bad the service is.

<Content>Great Value, But Not Perfect (Of Course) Last year I went to an all-inclusive resort in the Riviera Maya (Paradisus), and I knew that because of the price difference (This place is much cheaper) it would not be fair to expect the same from both places. I came to realize that it is just a different atmosphere in the Dominican than in Mexico. First of all, in the Dominican you have much more of a melting pot of world cultures. As a result, Spanish and French are the majority languages, with English a third and German a fourth. Luckily there are many foreigners who speak English as a second language, so we could make some sense of each other when we would try to talk. Contrary to other reviews, I did not find the French to be rude at all. My biggest advice would be to learn how to say Please, Thank You, Hello, Good Morning, Sorry, Excuse Me, Your Welcome in French, Spanish, and perhaps German. Being able to say these things will go a long way in showing them that you are not so ethnocentric. While I'm mentioning the nationalities, I want to add that the place is peppered with naked breasts. This could be a major factor if you have children, or just don't want to be around that. It also got kind of annoying that the animation team had to repeat everything in about four languages, and English was rarely spoken. I might as well just mention the bad things while I'm on it. I believe the place to be a bit understaffed. At the pool bar the one bartender was taking care of the people in the pool and those out of it. In Mexico they had 3-4 bartenders in the same type of bar. We had to wait a while for our drinks. The front desk was a bit hectic as well. I sometimes had to wait a long time just to get a simple task accomplished. And now for the good stuff. The place was beautiful. The beach is among the best in the world, the water clear and sand white. The room was clean and nice, though a bit smaller than our last resort. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The grounds crew is on top of everything, it's as nicely manicured as a country club. The restaurants don't take reservations, so as long as you beat the European crowd (which eats after 8), you're sure to get a seat. The food is good. I would not recommend the Mexican restaurant though, I ordered fajitas and they came out as a non-sizzling plate of meat and two tortillas. That's it, no tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, guac, etc. The other restaurants were awesome though. The Brazilian allows you to get side dishes and a salad, and every five minutes they bring you a sample of some kind of meat fresh from the fire (very tasty and varied). There were plenty of activities to do, including snorkeling, windsurfing, kayaking, ping-pong, pool, volleyball, darts, bocce, soccer, and whatever random contest the animation team is running. One nice feature was a siesta time from 12-3pm where they would have no activites so people could rest on the beach or do whatever they want. However, once 3 rolled around, the speakers were pumping music again and the animation team was recruiting people again. Don't worry there were secluded parts of the beach for those who desire quiet. The nightly entertainment was great, and one night featured a beach party with a professional stage, numerous vocalists and a band, and a respectable fireworks show. That was perhaps the highlight of our trip.Overall I found the place to be well worth the money. If you are wanting a good value and a good time, I highly recommend this place. If you have been to a few all-inclusives, and you are going to compare them all, this may not be the best one. My attitude is this, just compare it to a hilton, or just everyday life, and you will never be dissappointed! I would go back.If you do go, I highly recommend bringing some immodium and perhaps some antibiotics. If you want to snorkel for cheap just ask the locals with a boat (you will see them saying snorkel taxi) and for 10-15 bucks you can go snorkeling for an hour or two. Going through the hotel will cost you over 50. If you go to the nearby market place, visit a store called los Pinos Plaza. They do not barter there, and as a result, they do not jack up any prices. I know it's fun to talk a local down from $20 to $8 for a small painting, but we bought two at los Pinos for $2 each. All of their merchandise is at rock bottom prices, and good quality too (it's the same artists who paint all of them).Have fun.

<Content>Not really what i was expecting The rooms were not clean and have problems wirth the bathroom. called about 3 times for repairs , they never showed up. Food was excellent. Most of the activities are dedicated to tourist from europe. Outside the hotel people changes prices and they try to explote the visitors money for activities that are not really good. Manati Park Sucks!

<Content>Beautiful I thought the resort was beautiful but the service was poor. English was lacking everywhere we went on the resort. That should be a requirement to work on the resort. The food was good but my friend was sick the last 2 days of the trip. I wasn't effected at all and ate everything. Gorgeous landscape. The pools were nice except the one with the swim up bar, there were bugs and hair all in the water. Chlorine was not in either of the pools which is frightening. Overall I would go back to this resort but after a few spanish lessons.

<Content>Better than expected After reading the negative reviews, I almost switched hotels at the last minute. The grounds are beautiful and the beach is very nice. We never had a problem getting chairs at the beach or pool. The pool by the way does have a large swim up bar. Apple vacations web site stated that it did not. There was a large variety of food and it was good. My only complaint is the front desk service. Check-in was chaos. There was no organization at all and the people working the front desk barely spoke English. One more complaint. The majority of the people who stay at this resort are French. Enough said.

<Content>Medical Care Hope that you do not require any kind of medical atttention on the resort...Unfortunately, I required medical care on the last day of my stay as a result of food poisoning from seafood I ate at the resort. What a horrifying experience. The medical care provided by the resort was inadequate and it was apparent that the medical care provider was not trained to handle what I have been told is a very common problem at these resorts. Fortunately there happened to be a doctor as a guest at the resort who took complete charge and was obviously a trained professional. Make sure you have travelers insurance or that your health care insurance covers you outside the US...if not you will be forced to pay up front. They even charged me for the medical services or lack thereof at the resort. The ambulance was not equipped with the proper equipment and the ride took almost a half hour...riding through countless speed bumps. To add insult to injury the public relations representative from the resort advised me, in an extremely rude and abrupt manner, that the resort would not assume any responsiblity - they claim I was the only guest that got sick - she even went as far as to advise me that if more guests had gotten sick then the resort would have assumed some responsibility. This unfortunate incident cost me 3 days in the hospital, 2 additional days out of work and US$2,500.00.

<Content>Beautiful resort, but... We found the H10 (whick is now called Ocean Bavaro, by the way, since being bought by a new owner) to be beautifully landscaped, the beach is great, rooms were nice. The food was good, we thought, with a lot of variety. We had little problem with language the whole trip, from the airport on down to day trips. Our biggest complaint was how crowded it felt. They were booked to capacity, so there were tons of people. There are not enough beach chairs, so you have to claim yours early in the morning by putting your beach towels on them, or you are out of luck. The second worst part is how loud everything is. We go to the caribbean to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. You WILL NOT find that here. The Europeans must have to be entertained 24/7 because there was constant games, aerobics, dance lessons, water polo, more aerobics, more games, on and on and on. All with the PA blasting music and the instructors with microphones. I swear every day at 5:00 they had dance classes with only 10 or 15 people participating, but had a guy with a microphone blasting at ear-splitting volume going one-two-three, uno-dos-tres, one-two-three constantly for an hour straight.We did a couple of the day trips: Monster Truck Safari is great. You should definitely do that to see some of the Dominican Republic. Also did the Saona Island Catamaran. For the most part that was okay too, but they neglect to tell you that Saona Island is a mosquito infested hell-hole. We couldn't do anything but stand in the water to keep from getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. We have friends whoe also went to Punta Cana, stayed at the Melia and had none of these issues, so I guess you get what you pay for.

<Content>This Is a Deserved Review Not knowing what to expect after seeing the reviews posted, I was anxious to find sun and fun, yet a bit apprehensive. I found most of the prior reviews to be pretty accurate.The food was edible, but that was about it. If you like fruit, you will be happy. Their version of beef and pork seems to have a game flavor. I found the bar staff and restaurant staff to be very friendly and helpful, yet the front desk personnel seemed to be less helpful. Sometimes even annoying. They were the ones who spoke the best English, and weren't too willing to help. Communication was difficult for the most part, because most of the tourists were German, French and Italian. We had to play a lot of charades to communicate. This was kind of fun, but did get old after awhile. We didn't encounter any problems with the toilets leaking or the lack of hot water as mentioned in other reviews. I did have to chase down a housekeeper for towels after they took our dirty towels and left none. They also de-activated our key card 2 days early. Which meant we had to interrupt our day and get that problem solved. We didn't even get an apology which is the LEAST they could have done. The grounds and beach are absolutely beautiful with beautiful sand and are always clean. One warning is that when the floors in the hallways and walkways are wet, they are extremely slippery!! I felt myself slipping quite often, and noticed others doing the same. There are enough things to do to keep busy. We were unfortunate in that we didn't have the best weather. It rained 1/2 the time. That is not the fault of the resort, but it kept us from doing more water sports. All in all, This was a fun trip. I would do it again.

<Content>iffy A beautiful place with average food. however, we were forever having to get out room pass re- scanned, the toilet was not working right, instructions for resturants and activities are not well posted and few of the help speak English. I dont want to seem like the crude American, buuut, tourism is their bread and butter. We were there the week of March 18, 2003

<Content>Great Value Booked the H10 Bavaro through a travel agency. This was our 2nd trip to this resort. Flew out of Boston, MA. Trip went without a hitch. Weather was great (2nd week in January 2003) for the 1st 5 days, then the last day and half, weather was stormy with rain. If the weather is bad there is not much to do. Resort was well maintained, food was very good. Beach well maintained. If you want a good spot on the beach, should get out there before 8 or 9AM. Clientele predominately from Europe and Canada. Very clickish but OK. The last couple of days, had some problems with our room. The shower head was not working properly, but after calling, this was changed quickly. Also had a water leak, by the toilet. The maintenance men tried to fix the problem, but broke the pipe and it took two days to correct the problem. Also towards the end had a problem with the Air Conditioner. This was corrected in about one day. During this time, we did spend one night in another room. Outside of the above problems, we had a good time, and would consider going back.
