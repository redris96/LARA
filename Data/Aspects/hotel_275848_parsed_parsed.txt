<Content>Loved everything at Hotel Globus It was our first time in italy and certainly our first time in florence, we spent 6 nites in this wonderful little hotel. The hotel is clean, modern and best of all, it's wifi(ed)... The staff were extremely helpful and friendly... breakfast was the best in the many hotels we stayed in italy... Highly recommended for its location, friendly staff, and above average amenities... many thanks to Michael and Roberto for looking after us during our stay.... Buon Natale and happy new year :)

<Content>Very nice staff and location I have been in Florence 3 times, 3 different hotels.What I can say is that Hotel Globus is far ahead from the others. Even comparing to hotels with more stars.The room and bathroom are very clear, clean and the size is adequate. Bathroom is also well equiped.Breakfast is tasty. Free wi-fi internet and Cable TV works very well.But the main positive point is the staff. They are very polite and always smiling. They try to help you with EVERYTHING you need. Fantastic service!Cost-benefit is also very good.I recommend!

<Content>Good hotel The hotel was a very nice stop on my way through Italy. I booked on the hotel website. When I arrived via train the directions supplied by the hotel made my walk from the station simple. The single flight of stairs from the street to the first floor were a bit daunting but the man from the desk carried my suitcase up (I had to carry it down myself when I checked out). The rooms were clean and modern with private bathrooms. As I was travelling alone my single room was on the small side but I was only paying 49 euros a night so I was happy with it. The location was good. Market mere steps from the hotel. Restaurants close by. Easy walk to the Duomo and the David.

<Content>This hotel operates fake prccing on teh ir website I had booked my room at this hotel yesterday for 5 nights, I recieved my confirmation and 10 minutes later I recieved an email saying that I had just cancelled my booking. I rang them and was informed that when the guy at reception looked at my booking he cancelled it becasue he realised the rate was to low. I said he cant do that and he said yes he can, and that they made a mistake with the prices they had put in the system. I have called this morning and spoke to the manager who told me a completly differnt story, and that I was to stay there i now have to pay close to 4 times the amount. To be honest this hotel really isnt worth the money. I told them that i should have the rate as confirmed in my booking and he disagreed and told me if I didnt like then go somewhere else. I highly recomment NOT TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL; NOT TO BOOK VIA THEIR WEBSITE IF YOU DO -

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence We are a 60+ couple, just back from a super Short Break in Florence at The Hotel Globus.The location was perfect, within easy walking distance from Train and Bus Stations, and in a street with lots of character, good inexpensive places to eat (including the cafes at the Market, just a few strides away) and also easy walking to the wonderful sights in this amazing city.The stairs up to Reception weren't really a problem, as we travelled light with just a bag each.However, at the end of our stay, the heavy bag was carried down for us.All the staff we met were really friendly and helpful, and we were able to help ourselves to tea or coffee as we chatted to them.The cleanliness of the Hotel was excellent, with clean towels each day, and we rather liked the heavy curtains, keeping the room dark for a comfortable sleep in the early morning.The double windows seemed fairly successful, but we did get some street noise on our last night.. We enjoyed the breakfasts, a good variety of fresh food, and no queues for the dining room in October!The Internet access was a bonus, and the lift good for going back to our room after long days of sight-seeing. We can also recommend the excellent bus service, and the charming young lady in the Tourist Office by Santa Maria Novellawho advised us about the Tickets.We would certainly stay at Hotel Globus again, and have no hesitation in adding our recommendation to the many others on this website.

<Content>Loved the Florence Globus We stayed at the Globus Hotel in Florence for 10 days in September,2008 and found it to be a fabulous choice. first of all , it is well situated, close to the Santa Maria Novella train station and the Sita bus station.It is also within walking distance to the San Lorenzo indoor and outdoor markets,and other major attractions in Florence(such as the Duomo,Uffizi Gallery, Academia,Ponte Vecchio). we intially booked an economy room but asked for an upgrade,mainly because we were staying for 10 days. The owners obliged us and put us into a superior room, which included free laptop/internet and free minibar. The view from our bedroom window looked out to the Medici Church in the San Loenzo Piazza. The room was always very clean and well appointed in a modern style of furnishings.The Owners (Serena and Michele)and ALL STAFF were friendly and very helpful.We asked a lot of questions about tours,scooters, computers and all questions were answered with enthusiasm.THe breakfasts were always well balanced and included juice,tea,(good quality choices), special coffees from a very nice fellow, dry cereals,fresh and dried fruit, ham, cheese, tomatoes, white and wholewheat bread, white and wholewheat buns and croissants and yogurt.The breakfast room and lobby both have CNN in English,(the rooms also have SKY cable)The lobby is on the 2nd. floor,there is an elevator to the other floors.Our stay will be forever in our memories and will recommend the Globus to our friends. WE rate this hotel 5 out of 5.

<Content>Do recommend The Hotel is near main attractions and the train station; the staff are friendly; the room is clean and well-decorated. Although the breakfast room is a bit small, breakfast and service are jolly good. Plus, the price is reasonable.Definitely will come back.

<Content>Great Location and Friendly Staff We stayed at the Hotel Globus during a 3 week trip around Italy and were happy with choice of hotel due to its location, within walking distance of all the main sites, and the friendly and helpful staff. The area is quite lively with plenty of restaurants and shops. We did find it a little noisy in the morning as the market runs along the same street as the hotel but it wasn't a major problem. If, like us, you arrive late in the evening don鈥檛 be put off by the rubbish on the streets, this is due to the market being packed up for the evening and the streets are back to normal in the morning. The staff at the hotel Globus are extremely welcoming, especially the staff on reception and the gentleman that serves breakfast. Don't let the entrance to the hotel deter you, once you are upstairs the hotel is very modern and clean. The room itself was very compact, same width as a double bed with tiny bathroom but we expected this from the description and didn鈥檛 spend much time in there except to sleep. We loved the mini lift and free internet access in the lobby. The only problem was the air conditioning unit which seemed to work on a timer and you couldn't set it to your own preferences which meant the room did get quite hot especially when getting ready.If visiting Florence again, which I hope I do as it鈥檚 a truly beautiful city, I would consider the Hotel Globus due to its great location but would upgrade to a larger room. It鈥檚 a great place for people on a city break who would spend most of the day out of the hotel sightseeing and are looking for somewhere clean, convenient and welcoming to sleep after a busy day.

<Content>Great hotel The hotel was great. Very close to the train station, restaurants, shops and the vendors market. The staff was exceptional.. They were all very friendly and ready to help. The free breakfast they provided was pretty good.Rooms were cleaned everyday and they provided satellite t.v and free internet access if you brought your laptop. If don't have a laptop, you can use theirs in the lounge area. A nice added touch.Only drawback of the hotel was the walls between the rooms and the hallway was pretty thin and noise traveled well between the two. A minor detail to an other wise great hotel.

<Content>Hotel Globus I liked this place. We had a nice medium size and clean room with a view. A laptop in the room with free internet was nice. The staff was very helpful and warm. The hotel was right in the middle of things. I particularly liked its proximity to the central market, museums and great restaurants.

<Content>Highly recommended - go for a "superior" room though We stayed at the Globus for 3 nights - arrived at S.M.N. and eventually figured out that the road it was on WAS actually this small, narrow lane....!As everyone else has said, reception is on the first floor accessed only by stairs - not ideal, but if you're able bodied, not the greatest challenge in the world.Bright, friendly helpful staff - reception, cleaners, the breakfast guy - and clean  tidy communal areas.We'd booked a superior room via the hotel's website - it worked out about 10 euro more than a standard room per night - the difference was worth it. We had rm 309 - on the back - no view to speak of, but laptop with free wifi, comp. non alcoholic drinks from minibar  plenty of space to move about. Bathroom was good as well.Location is great - small gelateria right outside the door, small corner shops (UK phrase!) nearby - the market is at the bottom of the road, and Duomo maybe 10 mins walk away.Make sure you check out the restaurants behind the market (ZaZa's particularly) - at first, it doesn't seem the greatest location to sit out  eat, but good food  atmosphereAll in all, high highly recommended if you're taking a short break in Florence

<Content>GOOD CHOICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE The hotel is VERY well located but you are not able to go by car. There is a garage 300 mts before.When we finally arrive, STAIRS!! Three huge bags and no one to help us. Ok!The place is very modern with a clean-design-decoration.The room was small and the bathroom tiny. TIP: pay a litlle more for a much more room!!!!!!!!We stayed one or two nights and when they had another room avaliable, we moved wich was AWSOME!!!!!Nice breakfast, small, charming place!!!! Nearby everything!!!The neighborhood is very strange but don麓t worry, the place is very nice!

<Content>Great little hotel Just returned from 3 nights at Hotel Globus. Brilliant hotel, close to the station which was really handy. Close to all the main sights - about 5 mins to Duomo. Booked this hotel following reviews on here, and for the price - extremely good value.We had an economy twin room, it was on the small side, but was ideal when we were planning on spending time in the room!The bathroom was great, especially the shower! only downside was the sink had no plug so a hairclip did get lost down there!The staff were very helpful and one guy on reception was always smiling and happy to see us. The guy who did breakfast was very chatty and welcoming. Breakfast is included and was the usual of cereals, breads, crossiants, ham, cheese, yoghurts etc, perfectly adequate.Would definitly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again when I next go to Florence!

<Content>Excellent hotel - good location We stayed at Hotel Globus for 3 nights in early May. The location was excellent - close to the bus station, which was handy on arrival and within easy walking distance of all the major sights.We stayed in a normal double room, which was nice and clean, though slightly on the smaller side, but we did expect that having read previous reviews and the description on the hotels website. After a bit of research we booked directly with the hotel via their website as this was the cheapest rate. The rate included breakfast , which was a nice buffet with plenty of choice. The hotel also offered free internet service and complimentary tea and coffee all day. However, beware of booking museum tickets through the hotel. We did and it turned out that it would have been cheaper pre-booking directly with the museum. Also if you book through the hotel you cannot choose what time you want to go and they booked us a 9am on a Saturday morning!! Not what we wanted on a relaxing weekend break.Apart from that we could not fault the hotel, a comfortable stay and and good value for money - would stay there again.

<Content>Room with a bit of a view Super little hotel close to the train station - but longer if you can't follow the map on the hotel website! clean modern rooms, great bonus is the free wifi and also the laptops in the rooms.Photo's make hotel common areas look more spacious than they are but rooms are a perfect pit stop for a few days in florence.Breakfast was adequate, usual fair, nothing to write home about, breakfast room was small so could be a bit of a problem when hotel busier. We ate locally at the Trattoria Tuscano - super and no wait unlike the Zsa Zsa (or similar?) that had been recommended by the hotel (both located in the market square at the end of the street the hotel is located on)Hotel well located for the top attractions, all within strolling distance. On our second day we spent a long lazy lunchtime in a great restaurant just round the corner (name escapes me but italian for hedgehog) . Very attentive service with bespoke menu created - and at a time when the Serie A finale was being contested! (Bravo Inter!)both meals in the local area much better than offerings closer to the tourist haunts and half the priceunusually for may we visited and enjoyed torrential rain and no tuscan sun so most of our time was spent enjoying pasta and wine!when the sun did break out we struck lucky and stumbled across a tiny little private club located on the banks of the Arno beside pont vecchio (look for the green door just past the hotel orafi) and soaked up the rays right on the banks of the river (cheap coffee too) would recommend hotel and location for anyone visiting florence

<Content>Clean hotel in a central location This hotel is situated in a very good location. All the main attractions of florence are within walking distance from the hotel - the furthest being the Piazza della Signoria which is where the replica of the Statue of David is and even then its only about a 20 min walk. Breakfast was included in our package and you have to turn up early for breakfast - otherwise it fills up fast and you may have to wait a little bit for a table. One down side of the hotel though is that if you have a room whereby the shower is in a bathtub, you will finish showering to find that the floor is flooded with water - somehow the water leaks beneath the bath tub. But throw down a couple of towels and its all sorted. Overall the room and bathroom were very clean.

<Content>Great small hotel in an excellent location We picked the Globus for 3 nights in Florence in early April, mainly due to it's closeness to the station and also due to the reviews on TripAdvisor and in the Rough Guide. It was a real find, literally 3 minutes walk from the train station, and in easy walking distance of all the attractions and lots of great restaurants. The staff were friendly, room was quite small (economy) but perfectly formed, with all that we needed, including a great shower! Breakfast was lovely and overall a really good value, great location hotel. I normally prefer to stay in larger branded hotels, as there is less chance of getting a duff one, and more comeback if you do, but this was a pleasant surprise.

<Content>A Gem of Florence We booked a reservation at the Hotel Globus through its web-site based of the good reviews that we read on tripadvisor. Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US. This is true, therefore we are not expecting much on it.During the time to confirm our reservation, we have been offered with various rate for double standard or double executive room. Thank you to Michelle who is one of the owner of this hotel. He gave us a good deal of Euro 90 for double executive room (incl. buffet breakfast and taxes). We stayed there for 3 nights late December 2003.To us the hotel is most likely a 2 stars with a 4 stars bathroom facility. Our room is spacious with internet access, cozy modern-minimalis design and clean. The one which decreased the value of this hotel is that the lobby is up a flight of stairs. Guests must climb with luggage. when we arrived we were greeted by the front staff who helped us to bring our luggages up to the lobby.We left our luggages at the front desk since the room reserved for us was still occupied. When we came back in the afternoon, our luggages had been brought in the room at 2nd floor. The bar and breakfast place looked like a snack vendor and the only staff is very practical. Breakfast was fine european standard with fresh fruit, however we could ask for a cup of capucinno or even a glass of hot chocolate.This hotel is recommended for budget travelers who do not mind to carry on your own luggages to the room and during check out. We do not mind it either. The location is best, near the train station (5 minutes walk) and many budget eating houses nearby. Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel. The window of our room is facing the back of Medici Chapel, a warm scene in the morning of winter season.We will absolutely stay there again if we get back to Florence one day.xxx

<Content>Stairway to Heaven-Florence's best hotel We arrived in Florence via Eurostar and were a bit freaked out by some of the shady characters lurking around the train station, but our fears were relieved when we were warmly greeted at the Globus Hotel by Nick.The hotel is only a five minute walk from the train station, but far enough away from the Santa Maria Novella area that we felt very safe. The hotel may not be in the heart of Florence, but since most of the attractions are within a ten minute walk of each other, Globus' location is great. At the end of the block, you're right at the Central Market and all the street stalls that set up daily around San Lorenzo. The Duomo is about two blocks away and the Uffizi/Piazza della Signoria is another ten minute walk from the Duomo. The staff was by far the friendliest and most helpful we met on our trip throughout Europe. The breakfast staff was great at making our morning coffees (and you must try their thick and yummy hot chocolate made to order) and the front desk staff was always smiling and ready to chat up the weather and things to do around the city. They even alerted us early on about a scheduled water line shut off planned for the neighborhood due to construction work in the adjoining street. (Although this made us a bit paranoid not to drink anything for a few hours, we were fortunate to be leaving that day and in fact, the water was not turned off to my relief when I had to use the bathroom before our departure.)Since we were traveling with three people, we had a very spacious room done in a minimalist style of dark wood wardrobes, desk and side tables, padded headboards, and tiled floors. Although the room could have used more lighting, it was adequate enough to read by and there was enough light coming in through the windows during day. We had one room with two double beds and an adjoining room with another double bed and a single bathroom. The bathroom had a tub and the much-love heated towel bar. Our favorite feature of the hotel was the Sky TV channels. There was a good variety of shows that could be switched between Italian and English, which was a welcome option to having to only watch CNN International or BBC World. One can take only so much of cheeky international correspondents and anchors.The one thing that we wished we knew about was that there was no lift. Luckily we were on the first floor and only had to walk up one flight of stairs with our luggage (which was nothing compared to the three bridges we had to cross in Venice.) To the credit of the amazing staff, they helped us carry our luggage down when we checked out and wouldn't accept any tips. It was a very gentlemanly thing to do.There was even free internet access in the lobby from noon to 11:30 pm daily. They will give you a login and password to use and it comes in handy if you have to make museum reservations or check changes in flight itineraries.

<Content>fantastic and very clean hotel Me and my wife spent 3 nights at Hotel Globus. We had a very pleasant stay, in a standard double room. The rooms are well appointed, basic but with all the necessary; breakfast is good and the staff is particularly welcoming. A plus for this hotel is the free internet connection (both in the lobby area and in the rooms) and the location: very central and near the food marked where you can buy typical tuscan products. Galleria dell'Accademia is only 5 minutes walking and the staff suggested 2 or 3 good restaurants for dinner in the same area. For those planning a trip to Tuscany, don't miss a daytrip to Lucca!We will be back again!

<Content>Probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in We stayed here for three nights on a tour of Italy and the hotel was, by far, the worst we stayed in and the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Firstly, the hotel is located in a pretty seedy area and there was the smell of drains outside the front entrance. Superficially, the hotel looks OK, something which is emphasised on the website. However, once you look a bit closer it is quite rough around the edges and generally unclean. We made the mistake of booking an economy room, which was not only tiny but also quite dirty with layers of dust, mould in the bathroom and stained sheets. It was clear that it had not been cleaned properly for some time. However, by far the worst element of the stay was the discovery of bedbugs in our room on the first night. We noticed insects crawling on the walls and black stains as soon as we got to the room and, although at the time we didn't know what they were, we demanded to be moved. We were told there were no spare rooms, we were moved to a ground floor room which was in the process of being built (the bathroom was only half finished) and we were given sheets and forced to make our own beds. The next day, to their credit, the management apologised and refunded the fee for the first night.For the second and third nights we were placed in the adjoining room to the bedbug infested room, which thankfully had no bedbugs. However, we saw that the hotel had put new guests in the infested room. It was only when we returned home armed with photos of the room that I discovered that the 'insects' were in fact bedbugs, and it shocked me that new guests had been put in the room after we refused to stay there. I emailed the hotel, who replied to admit they knew that there were bedbugs in the room but that the problem had since been treated. However, it was obvious from looking back at the photos that the bedbugs had been there for some time and had either been ignored or inexplicably overlooked.All in all, it was just a horrible and worrying experience (bedbugs can travel on suitcases and invest your own home) and I wish the management of the hotel had been straight with us from the start. It was only through a bit of research of my own that I discovered what the creepy crawlies were that we had almost spent a night with. It was appalling that such obvious signs of infestation, which had clearly been there for some time, had not been picked up. Looking at other people's comments, it seems that the standard and superior rooms are perhaps a bit more acceptable which probably explains the mixed reviews. However, I would steer any possible guests away from this hotel given the mediocre condition of the hotel, general uncleanliness, poor location and the general cavalier attitude of the management, that is assuming that the bedbug issues have been resolved.

<Content>"Economy" rooms VERY small We stayed 3 nights the end of March, 2008, and sorry to be writing my review so late. I can't fault the Globus Hotel for this because I booked the economy room to save a few bucks. It was absolutely tiny, hardly room to walk around the bed. We did manage for the 3 nights because we were out and about every day and evening, but even worse was the noise from the street. We did not have AC because it was in March, but the room would get terribly stuffy in the middle of the night since it was so small, but when we opened the windows, we were right in the front of the hotel on the street and the noise was unbearable.  Now on the bright side: Nick was great and he recommended a wonderful restaurant down the street that was so good, we ate there all three nights. It was had fabulous grilled meats at a very reasonable price. The breakfasts were very good and the coffee was great. The hotel was in a great location for the train station, and I certainly enjoyed the market across the street. I just wanted to warn everyone to stay away from the economy rooms unless you are perhaps one person and really watching your $$. I wish I had spent a little more and gotten a standard or superior room, but they were booked and there was no possibility of an upgrade. We love Florence and I would stay there again, but in a larger room.

<Content>Fantastic location and hotel! Fantastic location - about a 5 minute walk to all sites including the train station. The tall gentleman at reception was extremely helpful - especially with food recommendations - we were never disappointed during our 3 night stay. Hotel was recently refurbished and everything was very clean. Breakfast was fantastic - loved all the cold meats and th hot chocolate. Try the deli down the road - you won't be disappointed!! Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Hotel Globus Just returned from a long weekend in Florence and stayed at the Hotel Globus.9 in our party in total and we had double, triiple and quadruple rooms, including for 4 children.Although the Hotel is on a narrow side street and probably not the best part of town, this is easily outweighed by its proximity to The Duomo (only a few minutes walk) and all the other city sights. It is almost immediately adjacent to the street and food market.Also, only 5 minutes walk from the rail station so no taxi required - it is better and cheaper to use the train to and from the airport rather than the coach.The rooms are very modern and clean although not much of a view from two of them. However, very quiet at night.The small breakfast/dining area could get crowded and you may well have to wait a few minutes at peak times but well worth it.Nick at the reception is extremely helpful and is a mine of information. He booked our Uffizi tickets in advance (a must!).Spare some time for Pisa. It's quite picturesque. Lots of up-market shops and photos outside the leaning Tower are a must. Although 15 Euros to get in is a bit pricey.We got a through ticket from Firenze Station to the airport (you have to change at Pisa Central Station) but you're allowed a 6 hour stop-off. Leave your buggage at the left luggage office in the Station (3 Euros per item) and do the 20 minute walk to the Tower via the main shopping street.We stayed 3 days and 2 nights and probably needed an extra day to see all the sites. Beware that the museums are closed all day Monday.

<Content>Great hotel for value and location I booked this hotel directly through the website after reading the reviews on trip advisor. It was exactly how we expected it to be - modern and clean with more character than your generic best western type of hotels. We booked a superior room and it was really spacious with an AMAZING view of the medici dome. The hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the train station (handy because we came from pisa) and a 5 minute walk everywhere else. Loved florence - book a table at the open bar restaurant beside the ponte vecchio with an outdoor seat - lovely food, wine and cocktails. Only weak point was that there werent enough tables in the breakfast room so two out of three mornings we were waiting to be seated for about 10 mins...that's only something small though.

<Content>wonderful city My wife and i spent 6 nights at ths hotel in Sept 2007. Florence is a wonderful city best explored on foot and the hotel is ideally placed for this. Very old part of the city with quaint streets, always cleaned at nght. Pity though that the cleaners didnt take the gypsys with them, as they are a pain in the neck all over the city. We had an economic room which, well, was economic on space. The rest of the room was fine. Lets face it; if you do a city break, you are not gong to spend your time in the room, so it was great to come back to and shower etc. The staff are the hotels biggest assets. They are just great. My advise to anyone, is to read the details on the website and what they say is exactly what you get. We read the reviews about smells, but in our 6 nights we had no problems at all. One minor issue was sorted out right away. The breakfast was more than adequate. The restraunt right next door to the hotel s great and very friendly. Overall a good stay for us and we would recomend it.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed in Hotel Globus for 4 days while visiting Florence.I couldn't be more positive about the hotel.The staff were so helpful and friendly.The rooms were spotless and cleaned every day with fresh towels daily.The hotel itself was in the heart of Florence and you were 5 mins from the main tourist sights and the station.You felt part of the atmosphere when u left your hotel to join the throngs on the street below.Globus hotel made visiting Florence a pleasure.I would highly recommend it if u are visiting Florence.

<Content>You get what you pay for! If you are trying to save money, it is fine to stay here but you do get what you pay for. I don't believe that this hotel should qualify as a 3 star hotel any longer. I stayed here 3 years ago, and it did then. However, in the past 3 years it seems to have become worn and a bit run down. The young man at the front desk is very nice which helped. My husband, daughter  myself were staying there (triple room) for 2 nights. First a man (apprx mid to late 20s) tried to rob my husband as my husband walked behind me on the rather narrow street near the hotel minutes prior to checking in. (It is close to the train station.) Fortunately, my husband put him into a fast headlock and pinned him to a car until storeowners came outside. Then (even though reservations were made months in advance) we were assigned to a room on the first floor that smelled badly. (I had told them in advance that I had asthma, and the hotel staff didn't even seem to notice the strong odor in the room.) After begging  pleading, I was told that we could take the quad room next door but would have to move back into the original room for the 2nd night since he said they were booked solid and a quad was coming. The quad room was fine (for the money). It didn't smell but spreads were worn (even a small tear in one) and the shower curtain (thin plastic) was moldy at the bottom. The next morning after begging, pleading etc they said to pack up all of our things and move them out of the quad room before touring and they'd see what they could do about a different room if we came back at noon. They did give us a room on an upper floor. It also smelled however and had worn spreads. There was a bit of mold on the shower curtain but not as bad as the quad room mold. Due to asthma, I also need my head elevated at night and require 2 pillows. The hotel said that they can only provide one pillow per person when they are booked solid because they do not have an extra pillow! My husband had to sleep without a pillow! This hotel was always very basic,utilitarian looking but it didn't appear worn down and faded 3 years ago. I was disappointed and wouldn't choose to stay here again. However, if I were on a strict budget and smells etc didn't bother me, I would consider staying here for the price. The breakfast is fine, the man who makes it is nice and they have free internet. It's a shame though that the hotel doesn't charge $5 extra and allot about $10 per night into a fund and segregate the money and use it to keep their rooms nice by replacing spreads and shower curtains on a regular basis and doing maintenance to prevent odors and problems. Despite someone attempting to rob us, I didn't really feel unsafe even though the hotel is in a rather narrow street.

<Content>Best kept secret I accidently discovered this hotel online and boy am I happy I did. At first from the website (and the prices!!!) I thought it was too good to be true. Well, it lived up to all our expectations. First of all, the hotel was in a great area, so close to everything. Also, the room was modern and clean and the staff were incredible! They were always so polite and helpful. Breakfast was great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone!

<Content>fab florence and fab hotel What a find. So close to the train station but not in a dodgy area. Also close to the central markets where haggling is a must. On arrival we were made to feel so welcome. The staff are simply lovely and the rooms are modern, stylish although a little on the small side. Great breakfast and free internet access until midnight. Would DEFINITELY stay here again.We recommend you go on the sightseeing bus (from the station 20 euro a ticket and valid for 24 hours) which helps you get your bearings. Line A one hour long and Line B two hours long and takes you out of the city into Fiesole. (Your ticket is valid for both lines). Enjoy people watching in the piazza near the Ufizzi.

<Content>Good base for exploring Florence The Globus is a good choice for those who plan to be out all day exploring Florence. It is walking distance to all sights/attractions and my wife and I did not at any time (like some earlier reviews) feel uneasy walking the narrow streets day or night. Although clean and contemporary, room was small and noisy (room 103) with a window overlooking the hotels generator. This was the least value for money hotel we stopped in during our trip of Italy.

<Content>Close to train - dicey area at night The rooms are what you would expect for the money and the location is an easy walk from the train station - and very easy to find contrary to prev posts. The area immed around the hotel is wonderful during the day, but at night is inhabited by somewhat shady characters depending on which direction you head. Finally, I have to admit that in the time that I was there, I didn't find the staff to be condescending all the time - there were one or two exceptions.

<Content>Disappointment We must have stayed in the worst room of the hotel- our view included an old washing mashine and a water heater. The room barely fit our luggage. The bed was comfortable though and the washroom nicely renovated and clean. The big downside is that there is no elevator to get to the lobby so if you have heavy luggage, it鈥檚 a chore getting there. The staff were very friendly though and the breakfast nice.

<Content>24th -26th May Loved the Hotel, loved the Coffee with breakfast!! Hotel Globus was a great place to stay and I would thoroughlyrecommend it. I was a little unsure about trusting an internet site review but chose this one because it didnt have many negative comments...and we were not disappointed!The location is superb as it's right next to the San Lorenzo market and because Florence is compact it is within 5-10 min walk from all the main sights. The staff were very helpful, especially Nicolas who recommended some great authentic Italian places to eat.We had a superior double room which was really quiet and within 2mins walk from the train station. Other people had said that it was quite difficult to find but we didnt have any problems at all.The continental breakfast was also good and what made it that little extra bit special was the little man who made fresh PROPER Italian coffee for us every morning. I cant quite remember his name, but he really added to the charm of the place!Globus Hotel was a definate thumbs up from us!

<Content>Good Experience in Florence It is a little difficult to find despite the fact that it is close to the train station but the hotel itself is very nice inside and the staff are really helpful and very friendly. I really liked the fact that they had an internet terminal and that you were able pick up some food and sit in the small breakfast area and eat or have a drink if you didn't want to take your food to your room. The rooms were clean and modern and the TV even worked and had lots of channels (unlike most hotels we stayed at). The only thing that I didn't like was the area at night as there were lots of people hanging around in the small streets and I wouldn't recommend coming back to the hotel really late at night. When we were looking for the hotel that first morning I was thinking What kind of hotel is this? as there were many people loitering around in the street drinking and stuff but when we got into the hotel I was glad to find that the hotel was nothing like the surrounding area!! I would stay here again.

<Content>Conveniently located A nice hotel, conveniently located in the historic center of Florence. We found it very convenient to the train station and the historic sites. Our room wasn't posh, but it was clean and comfortable. Our room faced the street in front of the hotel. When the window was open, noise was a problem. Fortunately, the window had double-paned glass and shutters. When closed they shut out the noise. However, the room would get a little warm overnight. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was good. The room had satellite TV, with dozens of channels.

<Content>LOVED the Globus I'm having a hard time understanding the bad reviews- my boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days over New Years, and it was an absolutely wonderful choice. My only complaint would be that you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the lobby- but anyone reading this site would know that before they book. Also, the staff heard us come in with our luggage and rushed down to help us carry everything up. They also helped when we left.We booked a double superior room- I believe it was Room # 201, and it was wonderful. It was not tiny- I would describe it as cozy. European hotel rooms are not huge, so we didn't expect it to be. The room and bathroom were immaculate. The bathroom was adorable, with pretty mosaic tile trim, had the best water pressure ever (standing in the shower was like standing under a waterfall), and even had a towel-warming rack. The noise in the hotel was not excessive, and we never heard the club, even though it was supposedly on the same side of the hotel as our room. The windows had both glass panes and also wooden panels that, when shut, cut out all street noise completely. We never noticed any odor around the hotel.The area was not dangerous- it's just busy, since the central market is at the end of the street. We loved wandering around it. No one ever accosted us as we left the hotel, trying to sell us watches, as one traveler stated. The merchants are in the market, not hanging around the Globus front doors. There were lots of little restaurants and shops around.The staff was wonderful, and the concierge (I think his name was Nicolas?) was friendly and accommodating. He even pulled out a map and circled places for us to check out on New Years Eve, and described exactly what festivities would be taking place at each location. The breakfast room was cozy and inviting, and the man who ran it was impeccably polite. The food and made-to-order cappucinos were excellent.We also really appreciated the free internet service- that is NOT common! No, it's not wireless, but good lord! Is it so hard to bring an ethernet cable? We paid 8 euros for one hour of internet access at another hotel! The flat-screen, satellite TV was a great perk, too. At our next hotel, an expensive 4-star place, we had an old TV which barely got 5 channels to come in.All in all, our experience at the Globus was excellent. I will continue to recommend it highly to anyone going to Florence.HeatherCharlottesville, Virginia, USA

<Content>Overated! For the life of me, I do not understand why this hotel has so many good reviews on this website. We stayed her for five nights in April of the 2007. We had to prepay, which I hate doing, but I figured with all the good reviews, it was a small risk. Was I wrong. Where do I start:- Location is not that great. A pretty dodgy area, with Africans tryin to sell me drugs and fake watches the minute I walked out the door. But it is close to the train station, as is about 50 other hotels.- Noise! The hotel has no carpet, so be prepared to be awaken very early by the slamming of doors as the maids cleans rooms, and other guests come and go. And I don't mean a small noise, but a jolting, teeth rattling noise. Also the club near the hotel is still going strong, so be prepared to hear the noise from it until very early in the morning. I suppose when the AC is on, you can just close the windows, but it was not working yet for our visit.- Room is small! And we got a Superior. When I looked at the floor plan posted on the door (for fire evacuation) it looked like most of the rooms seemed to be the same size. I had a friend in a Standard room, and it seemed to be the same size as mine. So, if you MUST stay here, don't waste money on the Superior rooms.- Hotel staff was not so helpful. When I checked in, I sat my laptop on the desk. When I went to plug it in, the only two plugs reachable from the desk where being used by the TV and the minibar. When I called down to ask if they had a extension cord, I was coldly told no, and basically told to deal with it. I also asked if the had an air fan (the air movement helps me sleep) I was again told no, sorry, with no real regret from the front desk. - Starting to get a little run down. Yes, it was remodeled, but I think it must have been about the time Michangelo was finishing up on David. Time for a little titavating. An what is up with the moldy smell???- Lift. First, there is no lift to get you to the hotel lobby, which is two flights up steep stairs from street level. Then the lift from the lobby to the upper two floors is so small, and so slow, the only time you would want to use it when you have luggage. Even then, it stopped on the very LONGGGGG ride down, and I almost got stuck!Not to be too negative, there where a few things I liked about this hotel. Free internet was very nice, though it is NOT wireless in the rooms. Also the maid service was good, and they have a pretty nifty Sky satelitte entertainment system, though for the life of me, I could not figure out how to buy a pay per view movie. This stay taught me two things. Do not count on reviews posted on this website, but use them only as reference. And NEVER prepay for a hotel! We stayed two nights in the Cosmopolitan Concept Hotel which is near the airport, but only about ten minuted bus ride into town. WHAT A NICE HOTEL! And about 30 percent cheaper then this place. Please see my review that I am going to post on this website on that hotel. It was one of the nicest hotels I have ever spent the night in!

<Content>Not worth ti stay in this hotel I stayed in many hotels around Europe and worked in a 2 stars hotel in Paris couple yeras ago. Hotel Globus is not a 3 stars hotel at all. I and my friend booked a economy room trough the website 75 euros per night. This is the smallest room i have ever been. You can hardly move in this room, altough we are not big neither tall (181 cm and 72 kg). Even the 2 stars hotel i used to work in have much larger rooms. I can say that i was mislead by the good reviews in tripadvisor. The bar and breakfast place looked like a fraternity house and smells very bad. I won't stay here ever.

<Content>Good location, nice hotel, great price We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our stay in Tuscany. The location is a few blocks from the Santa Maria Novella train station, so it is very convenient to take the shuttle bus from the airport to the train station for Euro 4.50 and then walk to the hotel. The hotel is very close to San Lorenzo, but it is on a narrow street with very little car traffic. In fact, the street was so quiet that voices became amplified during the night, and I was awakened a couple of times by the voices of people walking by. Of course, our room fronted the street. The furnishings are very pleasant and new without being overly trendy, and the bathroom was particularly nice. Hairdryer provided. Comfortable bed. Very good breakfast, complete with meat, cheese, pate, fresh fruit (oranges, kiwis, etc while we were there), several types of bread/pastry, and of course cold cereal.When we returned to stay for one night at the end of our travels, we were informed that our room had no electricity and the electrician hadn't been able to take care of it that day. Globus had already booked us a very nice room in another hotel just a few blocks away. They gave us clear directions, and there was not a bit of fuss. Our stay at Globus had been prepaid, so we were not charged for our stay in the other hotel -- Globus covered the cost. Globus also gave us a nice apology note and a bottle of chianti classico for our troubles. It went absolutely as smoothly as you could hope, in the event of that kind of a problem. The best kind of service imaginable.

<Content>Excellent, would recommend to anyone We chose to stay at this hotel after seeing it rated so highly on trip advisor and werent disappointed. Its in a very central location, close to station and to the Duomo (although Florence isnt that big so cant be too far away!). The service was great, spoke english and very good at recommending restaurants etc. (try Trattoria ZaZa in market square-very good!). Room was very large although we had a superior one, bath and shower as well as heated towel rack which was useful for drying clothes as it rained most of the time we were there! Breakfast very tasty and served until 10pm. All in all would highly recommend it and wouldnt hestitate to go back.

<Content>Excellent location for touring Florence I recently spent five nights at the Globus and had an excellent stay. All of the employees I came into contact with were friendly and very helpful. The hotel is an easy walk from the train station and is situated so that you can easily walk to all the sites.I had a great rate on one of the standard doubles and had no complaints about the room. I had two twin beds pushed together to form a large king with bedside tables on each side. On the wall opposie the bed was a large wardrobe (with free electronic safe), a small desk, and TV. The bathroom was modern and the shower was a good size. There is also a towel warmer which is great for drying your hand washing. By the way, there is a coin laundry just around the corner with the instructions printed in English.The only downside was the noise level in the hotel. All of the floors are tile and the walls are a little thin but I never dug out the earplugs I always carry so it wasn't a serious problem. My window looked out onto a wing of the building so there was no street noise although there was a dance club nearby you could hear on the weekends but living in a college town, I'm used to the sounds of music in the background.If I'm ever lucky enough to make it back to Florence, I would definitely stay at the Globus.

<Content>Awesome Position and great place to base yourself Our first visit to Italy so we used Expedia and read the reviews here - and we were thrilled with the hotel.Easy walk and to find from Santa Maria Novella Station - the position is in a cute narrow street - just down from the markets which are busy all day and into the early evening with great bargains and souvenirs. We walked everywhere in Florence and it was an easy walk from the Globus. There's a laundromat just around the corner and it was great to wash you clothes after handwashing !The breakfasts are good and the service through-out our few days was excellent there. Our italian was limited but everyone made us feel comfortable. There's a great deli over the road with amazing food - check it out for a lunch.The hotel is an easy walk to the Duomo, Ufussi, Arno and everything.Our room was great - although no view it was big. clean, and a great bathroom.I'll stay there anytime and highly recommend it !

<Content>Not as good as we expected I was expecting this hotel to be very modern and have great rooms. Unfortunately our room didn't look like the photo on the website, and the standard double was so tiny we could barely move around. It also said in the distription that they had modern bathrooms, but ours was tiny and old. The shower was very awkward to use, and there was no ventilation. Whilst the reception looks modern like the photos on their website, everything else was a bit drab. It is a fairly central location, and is particularly good if you are coming by train, as it is only a 5 minute walk to the station.

<Content>Great location Once again the Globus was great. We just stayed there (October 27-29), and loved it again. The staff are always helpful and friendly. Great location, Medici Chapel, Duomo and San Lorenzo Markets are within a 5 minute walk. Great food at the restaurant across and to the left of the hotel (loved the spinach ravioli). Reno and everyone at the wine bar across from the hotel offered great tidbits on food selections in Florence. At night we had no noise from the Disco around the corner and found the Dublin Pub to be a lot of fun with a mix of locals and tourists.Many thanks to Nick, Alessandro and the rest of the Globus staff for making our stay very enjoyable.

<Content>Good experience and nice location We stayed 7 nights at the Hotel Globus and it was a good experience. The staff (especially Nicolas) were helpful with directions, dinner recommendations and/or reservations, etc. The hotel was clean and a light breakfast was available with excellent coffee. Also, you can get to almost any attraction within a 20 minute walk from the hotel. The photos of the rooms suggested a much more upscale hotel than it actually was. Also, the noise level was high especially in the morning as other hotel guests were leaving their rooms. This is likely due to the fact that the only flooring in the hotel is tile.

<Content>Excellent experience We enjoyed every aspect of this hotel! Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful staff member. We did not even have to ask for a map, he had it at the ready and was incredibly helpful, even recommending places to eat. For our entire stay this gentleman was very helpful. The other members of the staff that tended to the front desk were also very helpful and polite. Our room was compact but clean. I had read a previous review about the potential noise level in the area of the hotel so I took ear plugs. My husband did not feel the need to use them but I did. There is noise from the street outside but we found that it quiets down quickly around 11:00pm, the only thing that I noticed was the interior noise of the hotel. I think it is because all the floors are tile so there is a lot of echo's especially in the hallway. Like I said a pair of earplugs and you won't notice a thing.The breakfast that is served is very good, with a nice variety. There is a gentleman who runs it very well. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence, it is a very quick walk to the train station and all attractions!

<Content>Very small rooms We spent 3 nights in the Globus and I would not return. I agree the location is good and the staff are very nice, but our standard room was very small with a view of the boiler!

<Content>Good value Globus In terms of location The Globus is pretty good. It鈥檚 a 5 minute walk from the train station which is very handy if you鈥檙e transferring from Pisa airport. All the main attractions North of the Arno are all in walking distance in the opposite direction. Our superior room was clean, in good order and of a reasonable size. But our friends opted for a standard room which looked a bit on the snug side. I can only imagine how small the economy rooms are!The hotel was generally furnished quite nicely and offered a good range of amenities (wi-fi, Sky, mini-bar etc) given that it was a fairly small place. However, the stairwells could have done with a lick of paint and 1 or 2 things were starting to look a little tired. The bedspreads in the room for instance.We found all the hotel staff very friendly and helpful. We particularly liked the chap that ran the breakfast room during the bulk of our stay. Didn鈥檛 catch his name but he was always very cheerful and chatty in the morning 鈥?he makes a mean cup of chocolate as well, so the wife tells me!One tip for the morning is to make sure you get yourself down for breakfast by 9.15 or you could find yourself waiting in reception. Breakfast is served in the bar area which is not biggest of rooms.Overall, a good value, well located option to use as a base for exploring Florence.

<Content>Exellent Hotel! Excellent Location! Excellent Staff! - From Toronto Me and my 2 daughters (16  11) stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We had a triple room on the 3rd floor which was very spacious and spotless. Had view of the Medici Chapel. Staff were all very helpful and Nicholas was a sweetheart. Very helpful with luggage as there is no elevator. Breakfast was perfect for us as we are Nutella freaks!...Location was also excellent as it was close to everything. The only negative was that like other reviewers, the area around the hotel is a little seedy at night, but nothing too terrible. Remember this is a 3 star hotel and is excellent value for the cost. If you want your little chocolates on the pillow, champagne on your coffee table and a doorman to open your doors, then please go to the Ritz! hehehe...Thanks for everything! See you next year!

<Content>Amazing Value My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Globus during our honeymoon. We travelled all over Italy for almost 6 weeks. The Hotel Globus was the cheapest hotel we stayed at and it was one of the best.The room was very nicely decorated, well air conditioned (a godsend!), and very clean.The location was awesome, the breakfasts were good and the service was very attentive. Alessandro the concierge on duty from the afternoon to around 10PM tipped us off to some amazing restaurants which were some of the best meals we had in Italy (high praise I assure you).Definitely stay here, the value for the price is great!

<Content>I was skeptical, but this is a really great hotel I stayed at the Hotel Globus at the end of July. Before the trip, I contacted the hotel because I read some reviews that mentioned the loud music from the dance club next door (I had booked the internet rate that does not allow you to cancel the hotel). The hotel quickly emailed me back and assured me that the dance club would be closed when I stayed there- which it was. I booked a double standard (same price as a smaller cancelable room). The room was small but what I expected for a European hotel in a big city. The room was very clean, quiet and had a view of San Lorenzo dome which was very beautiful. The air conditioning was fantastic and it felt great after a hot day of walking around in 100 degree heat! Friends that stayed in other hotels and did not have a/c. The breakfast downstairs is really great and the location is close to the train station and all the landmarks. Other reviews mentioned that they felt the area was sketchy at night but I never had a problem - yes, the streets are narrow and dark but no one ever bothered me and I was out late several nights. Because you have to climb two flights of stairs before you get to the lobby and elevator, I would not recommend this hotel to people who might have difficulty carrying their baggage up stairs. Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and staff.

<Content>Really small The stop at this hotel was part of our honeymoon. We stayed there late July. The hotel is literally 5 mins walk from the station which is fantastic.The hotel itself is tiny, also reception in not on ground level and there is no lift until you get to reception so you have to carry your luggage up some stairs which isn't much of a bother but if your suitcases are heavy then not too good and obviously this hotel in unsuitable for wheelchair users. Thankfully our room was on the first floor because it would have taken 4 trips in the lift to get ourselves and our luggage up to any other levels (1 person lift).When we got upstairs I was really dissapointed because it wasn't how I imagined. Everything looked really grubby. Our room was clean but really dull and small. The view outsaide our window was of a roof and an unused kitchen sink but the size and view didn't bother me, we paid for a standard room at standard prices and that's what we got. What bothered me was the lack of light I think.Apart from that the staff are nice enough, breakfast was nice and the locaton is great. I reccommend budget travellers to stay here.

<Content>Loved Hotel Globus! The hotel globus is the right mix of friendly, attentive service, local knowledge and a beautiful, modern, clean hotel! The staff are extremely helpful in booking tours, suggesting local hidden treasures, and even suggesting other cities to visit. If you have ever stayed at a W hotel you will have some idea what the hotel Globus is like but add italian hospitality and warmth! The hotel could not have a better location! It is literally blocks away from the market, church, ponte vecchio! It is the right mix of local atmosphere and all the tourist sites you could wish for on your doorstep! And it is only a five minute walk to and from the train station! You could not ask for anything more convenient! I visited the hotel two years ago on a family trip with my mother. Nick the day manager was extremely accomodating when we arrived early and arranged breakfast for us and a tour to keep us occupied for the rest of the day. Just one example of their excellent service. Not only is it my favorite hotel in Europe to stay in but I have sent numerous friends as recently as this summer, and all have raved and thanked me. It truely is a hidden jem! My only reason for not giving this hotel an excellent rating is that becuase of its growing popularity I am scared they will not have room for me the next time I am in Florence!

<Content>small, but very professional I stayed in Globus for two nights in late June. I was very pleased with it. the staff was very friendly and professional. the decor is modern and very sharp. the location is very central. the breakfast was adequate. my room was quiet and well conditioned, which was very important since it was +33C outside. my single room was very small, which is not a problem for me, but if it is a factor for you, it is best to book a double room. the only downside was a complete lack of any shelves in the shower, i had to turn off the shower and reach out each time i needed a soap or a shampoo. i will definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Room?? I have seen bigger cupboards! We stayed in the Globus for 2 nights in June. The hotel was modern, clean, served a decent breakfast and was in a central location but the double bedroom was a joke! We are pretty sure it was a single room with a double bed squeezed in (it was so small we had to pile our bags on top of our bed to have any floor space and we had to climb over each other to get into bed as it was up against the wall), any longer than 2 nights in this 'box' would be too much.

<Content>Very pleased with Hotel Globus Our family of four (adults in mid/late 30's and sons aged 13 and 11) really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Globus. The hotel is very well run by a professional and welcoming staff. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate and the cappuccino was served with a smile! We stayed in a quad room (#202) that was very good sized, clean and quiet. Staff made excellent restaurant recommendation as well. Give Cippolo Rosso a try...it is very close to the hotel with great service and delicious food (divine minestrone) and Brunello by the glass for only 4 euro!We would recommend the Globus Hotel for families and we would be happy to return there again someday! Pleasant journeys to all....

<Content>Noisy and small Having stayed here based on the Trip Advisor recommendations, I am surprised it gets as good of reviews as it does. All the rooms must be very different to account for the different experiences. Our room was small but the bathroom was fine, we were on the street though and the noise was terrible! You could also hear everything going on in the hotel and we were even on the top floor. The area is a little sketchy, I wouldn't have wanted to stay there if I was just with other girls but my husband and I never felt unsafe. The stairs are also definitely annoying when you have a lot of luggage. It was fine for the price (if you get the book ahead discount) but I would not stay there again.

<Content>Great hotel!!! This is a lovely hotel. I went there with my mum, aunt and cousin. We had a lovely quad room. The room was huge as an european standard. Double bed and 2 singles. The shower was a double shower as well.The room was like brand new with proper satellitic TV. The air con was always cool.With regards to some people saying the room was tiny. Yes, I can see on the map there are some small rooms, but these are the economy room.There wasn't much noise. We had a room viewing San Lorenze Church.The location was perfect. 5-10mins to Train station and Dumoco.There's an amazing food market just few steps away. San Lorenza market were leather goods can be bought is around the corner.The staff are really friendly. Plently of choices at breakfast...... AND internet access!

<Content>great location WE enjoyed our stay . The staff were extremely helpful and friendly . The location is perfect , the market is right beside it , and lots of places near to it . The rooms were clean and comfortable , one was extremely small but the other one was a good size but that was fine as we only were in it to shower and sleep .We did not find noise a problem either ! Overall we would go back !

<Content>Not completely satisfied I would not say that it is the 48th best hotel in Florence. Perhaps it depends on the room. We stayed in a standard room and it麓s pretty small (more suitable for one person). Location is okay and the staff is friendly and helpful.Breakfast not very good and the place not very confortable.Yes, the free internet access is definitely a positive.Overall a little bit disappointed with the hotel. If you carry some luggage perhaps you can not enter into the room!!!!!!!!

<Content>globus is ok overall but not for safety conscious single females. stayed 5 nights there for 118euro a night in may.ok here are the pros :FREE internet LAN and for me that was a huge plus as i was travelling for 3wks and this was one of the longest stops and i wanted to use it to really catch up on my mail Great breakfast - nice fruits, cereal toastGood location : San Lorenzo - in the heart of the town, easy access to everything but I agree with everyone - i didnt feel that safe and neither did the hotel. at 10pm, they gates are locked and they will buzz in the guests. the concierge admitted that it could be a problem.Great staff : lots of useful advice bout restaurants. I'd been to Florence but its still nice to get more recommendationsCons :Rooms -its a real hit and miss, we got a pretty tiny room- our luggages lined one side of the wall and we just hopped onto bed. thats was pretty much it. and tiny tiny bathroom by any stds but we heard some guests were happy with theirs i think the room config are all diff.Value: i'd been to florence 3X and i think for the same price you can get much bigger places if you're willing to forego the Hispeed internet  cable. Summary : i would not recommend this to single female travellers but if you're need your high speed net  good english cable (eps if you've been travelling for quite a while like me) then i think this place is ok overall. hope this helps.

<Content>Stylish and friendly Stayed for four nights at the end of March.The major plus point of this hotel is that it is spectacular value. The rooms are spotless and stylish and the staff really friendly and welcoming. It's certainly much much better than you would expect for the price. I paid the same price for a 3 star hotel in Pisa with old, worn rooms that felt like a cell. Walking into our smart, comfortable standard room in the Globus was such a relief! The ensuite had a shower big enough for two.The building is also steps away from the Medici Chapel and San Lorenzo, and a couple of minutes from the Duomo.The downsides are what people have already mentioned- the stairs and the noise. The hotel is not accessible if you have mobility difficulties because the reception is on the first floor up a flight of stairs. Rooms on the top floor are another 2 flights up from there. This is fine if you're young and fit (and your reward for all that climbing are views of the Medici Chapel dome!), but if you're unfit and creaky like I am it's a struggle! There is a (unique) little lift, but if it's not on the right floor you'll wait ages for it to arrive.Although I agree that there is noise from the nightclub, if you close the window most of it is blocked out. I found the most noise was made by other guests. The halls and stairs are not carpeted and any noise echoes around the building. Doors slamming and luggage being hauled through the halls was a particular problem, and note that anything you say in the halls can be heard in the rooms.The final point I would make is that as a woman I did feel slightly uncomfortable with the area. There were some groups of men hanging around on the street corners so I wouldn't advise solo female travellers to stay here if they are nervous; nothing happened to me, and there are plenty of people around- but you might feel a bit intimidated. However, on the upside there's a fantastic chocolate shop right next door with more sweets than you can imagine!I have rated Globus above average because I think you'd be hard-pressed to find such a friendly hotel with such good decor and pleasant rooms for that price anywhere else in Florence (or Pisa, or Rome!).

<Content>Nice and clean but would not go back Hotel was clean and appeared recently renovated however, it wasn't on the greatest street (lots of graffitti and not many tourists around) Our room felt like we were in a basement and our view was of pipes. Concierge was very helpful and breakfast was good.

<Content>clean modern hotel The hotel's location near the train station was perfect. We were able to walk in 5 mintues to the train station. The hotel is within walking distance of all the major sites. Breakfast was tasty. The breakfast room was small, but the hotel itself is not very large. Internet access in the lobby area was very useful. The room is quite standard in size for a European hotel, but the bed was comfortable. There is a bar/club in the neighborhood that may wake someone up who is a light sleeper and if your window is left open. We stayed there two nights. The first night I slept right through, but the second night I woke up and heard the noise. The staff was very helpful and gave us good recomendations for dining. The hotel also made reservations for us at the Uffizi and at the Academia galleries. Reservations are a must at both of these to avoid the long lines. I emailed them a request; and shortly thereafter, I had an email back with both reservation numbers. On the whole, I would recommend this hotel to someone.

<Content>Hotel Globus-- A great place to stay! We recently stayed at the Hotel Globus (from April 1 to April 5) and absolutely loved it! We arrived a day earlier than scheduled, so our first nite we were in the economy double, then in the standard double after that. Yes, the economy double is a pretty cramped space, but the standard double was quite nice. The room is nice with a view of Via Sanantonino, and the bathroom is nicely equipped (although I still don't know how to use a bidet). The breakfast provided was very good, with a wide selection of breads, cheese, fruit (kiwi, oranges, apples), yoghurt, juice, NUTELLA (man I love that stuff), and excellent cappucino/tea/chocolate. The breakfast area is nicely decorated and modern.Hotel Globus' location is great. It is within walking distance to the main train station and about a ten minute walk to the main area of Florence (Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, etc). I will say that at nite it can get a little bit loud on the street down below, but it did not affect us that much.Finally, I think the biggest plus to staying at Hotel Globus is the quality of the staff that works there. Nicholas, Nick and Alessandro are an excellent source of information and were a big help to us! They really went out of their way to make sure that our stay in Florence was a good one. They gave us recommendations on cool places to eat, jazz clubs to go to, places to visit, etc. Internet access is free from noon till midnite, which is pretty huge. All in all, our stay at Hotel Globus was excellent. If you want an inexpensive (~ 110 euro/nite), very modern, clean and friendly place to stay, I'd say that you should stay at Globus. You will not be disappointed!Sorry I don't have pictures for you all right now; I will try to post another review with pictures included at a later time.

<Content>Reasonable and well located. We stayed in a superior room, the best in the Hotel, with a view to the Medici Chapels, in the back of the Hotel.The room and bathroom are ample but not very quiet at nigh as there is a bar nearby. In the winter we prefer traditional central heating but the air conditioning worked although with some noise. We could not spot an emergency stairway, but there are plenty fire material in the corridors. The elevator is hidden and very slow running as is intended to be used specially by disable people. The breakfast room is very small and the meal only average.The location is very good, less than 5 minutes from both the central railway station and the historical centre. The staff people are really great. The web site gives an idea of superior hotel but the Globus is actually a Hotel simply average.Florence is fabulous and eating in the nearby Trattoria Mario a great and unforgettable good experience.

<Content>fabulous! I backpacked through several European cities, and HOTEL GLOBUS is the best hotel I have ever stayed at: very reasonable prices, good location, delicious breakfast, free internet, free SKY TV in the room!

<Content>Hotel Globus, Florence, Italy March 23rd 2006 - Hotel Globus, Florence, ItalyBooked through Expedia. Thought would get a standard double room but turned out economy twin! We stood in the middle of the room and could touch each side wall with our finger tips. Needless to say it was all a bit claustrophobic. I would have said their ecomomy was more a single room for two people. The windows did not open nor the shutters. When you see the hotel video showing the rooms be aware they are not all the same. We didn't have intentions of being in our room much on a three night visit anyway but this made doubly sure of it. There was no air conditioning on to give some air either as they had heating on because the weather was still chilly. The saving grace was the shower room which although compact was newly fitted out and more than adequate if you didn't need/want to put anything down onto a surface. Toiletries included shampoo, showercap and soap. No bodylotion or shower gel. Breakfast was good as long as you didn't want brown bread, or a healthy cereal. The juice was too sweet whether grapefruit or orange. Our room was to the front of the hotel and although windows and shutters were closed there was shouting and noise until about 4 a.m. each night. (I knew this because I couldn't sleep very well in my cell and was aware of it on the hour!) I have learnt my lesson and when going to a city I will book the best room available from now on.The staff were very accommodating and helpful. All in all a central hotel well placed, everything within walking distance. Would I stay here again? If I book the best room I might it was clean and convenient with helpful staff.

<Content>Great city centre location We chose this hotel because we were arriving in Florence by train and wanted somewhere that was within easy walking distance of the station. It was only five minutes and no problem to find - down a narrow little road with lots of shops and other places to stay. We had a lovely, friendly welcome and found our room to be very large (a double superior), clean and quiet, due to the double shutters and curtains - this blocked out all light and most noise and we could have easily overslept! There is a church behind the hotel and the bells start ringing at 9am though, so maybe not! We had a great view of the unmistakeably Florentine church from our window which was a nice surprise.The hotel was refurbished in 2002 and on the whole it still looks good. The breakfast was nice, as was the facility of free internet provided in the breakfast room/bar area during the day. My favourite thing about this hotel though was its handy location for the market and shops - perfect for dropping back into to whenever you need to dump all those shopping bags in your room. The bathroom had really cute 'Hotel Globus' toileteries in as well, and the minibar was pretty inexpensive compared to other places I've stayed in.Our only minor quibbles were that the double bed had a crease down the middle where it was made up from two singles stuck together, also the lift is really slow and a bit scary so we only used it to move our luggage in and out. You have to climb steps into the lobby as well so this wouldn't be a good choice of hotel for anyone who has problems with stairs.

<Content>Well done the Globus My wife and I went to the Globus on 21/02/06 and were allocated a Double Superior Room. We found that it was not very spacious but was adequate as we didn't stay in the room for long spells. It was quite cold and we needed the additional blankets that were supplied. It was very clean and towels etc were replaced daily. The room was on the third floor and you felt like a mountain goat by the time you reached it. It was simply furnished but had the essentials that you required. The bathroom was fine and the shower was excellent. The room was situated to the rear of the building so no problems with noise other than the church bells in the early morning but what do you expect in Florence. Nothing to complain about there.The reception was fairly sparce and you wouldn't want to linger there too long. The breakfast was fine. I made do with good old corn flakes and my wife enjoyed the pastries. Don't expect bacon, eggs etcOverall the Hotel was fine and the staff as stated in other reviews could not be more helpful. Overall though, I am amazed that so many have given five stars. We would give it 3 to 4 at best. I can only think that the five star ratings are based on the attitude of the staff alone. We enjoyed our 5 day stay in Florence and if we went back we would be prepared to stay at the hotel again because the price was right. We would have been disappointed if we had paid the full rate however. If the price seems right when you book and your expectations are not too high then I don't think the Globus will disappoint. Location of the hotel for the attractions was excellent. Nothing was too far away

<Content>perfect hotel Based on the reviews here we booked the Globus. We had a lovely superior room with a nice view of Medici Chapels. It was clean and quite (soundproof windows worked fine). Staff was gracious and helpful. Loved the free Internet access in the room for my laptop and the new service: Sky Tv channels. You really can walk everywhere. Everything else is close by. We will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Great choice for any traveler I just returned from Italy les than a week ago and one of the things I keep telling my friends was how wonderful my hotel was. I went with 17 other people (school trip) and we didn't encounter a single problem. The service is excellent. The rooms are very spacious. My room had three other girls in it and we each had our own twin sized bed and plenty of room to keep our suitcases. The bathroom is large enough for two girls to get ready in. The tub/shower is large and always had hot water. Breakfast starts early (7:30) for the early birds that can't wait to see the sights and runs late (11:00)for those who enjoyed the night life the night before. The breakfast has a lot of variety including cereal which is hard to find in Italy. The staff is incredibly helpful and kind. Alessandro works the later evening shift and is very helpful in recommending excellent restaurants around town. Just ask. Everything was very clean and the maid service is excellent. We left our passports out on the desk one morning with money on accident and when we returned, they were all stacked neatly on the corner of the desk with nothing missing. It is difficult to find such amazing service. They are very inexpensive and centered in the middle of everything you want to see. They are close to the train station, the Duomo, walking distance to the Uffizi, and the Galleria dell' Accademia (Michelangelo's David). Enjoy your trip and let Hotel Globus make it even better.

<Content>Glorious Globus - Strange name, nice hotel Great location. 5 minutes from the station, 5 minutes to the Duomo.At least 3 very good restaurants close by.We had a room at the back of the hotel so didn't get any noise from the street. However, there a nightclub close by, the music starts around midnight.We found the thudding soothing and easy to sleep though but it could disturb during warmer months.In general, very clean, hospitable and helpful staff.The inclusive breakfasts very good value for money!

<Content>thank you Globus Thank you for a lovely stay, during the Biennale. I feel very lucky to have been recommended the Globus Hotel, because it was perfect for our needs: warm and friendly, helpful, comfortable, and with all the modern luxuries one could want. As our stay wore on, my appreciation of the hotel increased (which is a very good thing): all of people, owner and staff gave a very warm and helpful feeling, and all of the extra conveniences added a very luxurious and modern touch.  Thanks again, and congratulations on such a fine hotel. The feeling and tone of a hotel are so important, and you are to be congratulated for what you have established here.

<Content>excellent 3 stars hotel We spent only one night at Globus, but we really enjoy the hotel. It is very near from the rail station and just 5 min to the Duomo Square and lot of restaruants. The room (on the third floor) which was given to us, had a small private terrace and was spotless clean. Big surprise: Sky tv channels in our room.I really recommend this hotel.

<Content>Cheap, clean, and helpful hotel This was a nice, very reasonablely priced hotel in Florence. It is only about a 4 block walk from the train station. The rooms were small but very clean. There was a tiny elevator that the staff used to bring up your luggage. The hotel reception is on the 2nd floor, the rooms are above that. It was a 4 or 5 block walk to main business area but only 1/2 block from the outdoor market. At night the streets were quiet but not deserted, we were never hassled. The price can't be beat, we paid 150Euros for two nights. Breakfast was ok, the staff was very helpful. If you like hanging out in your room, this is not the place to stay, the rooms are small, no lounge area in the lobby, but if you are planning to sight see all days, it is fine.

<Content>stay there again Overall we were very pleased with our room. The hotel is very small (only 23 rooms) and the room (we booked an economic twin) was small but that's to be expected in most of all of Europe. The owner and the staff were very efficient and friendly. We were able to walk to our hotel from the train station in Florence which was a real plus. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>great place The owner that runs the Globus is wonderful -- I felt as if I were visiting friends who wanted to ensure that my trip was perfect. Location was great, and the hotel was lovely. They gave excellent restaurant recommendations and made reservations for me at the galleries I wanted to visit. They also offer free internet access, which is a nice bonus. I would absolutely stay here again .

<Content>perfect hotel Perfect location, next to main train station and no more than 5 minutes walk from the Duomo and the Uffizi Gallery. Our superior room was very clean and spacious, the bath-tube was lovely and we also enjoyed a nice view of Medici Chapels. It was also very quiet, although it was at the back of the hotel so this may have helped. Free internet access for my laptop in the room was a plus. The staff were very helpful, booking restaurants and museums. We would not consider staying anywhere else if we return to Florence.

<Content>Great stay at Globus Only a one night stay for us in Firenze but were really very lucky to have found Globus (thanks to everyone who bothers to add good as well as bad comments on hotels through Trip Advisor).We booked two single rooms but both had double beds in any case overlooking front of building. Both rooms had big storage units and spotless bathrooms and were cosy and warm given it was freezing outside. It was genuinely amazing to us that we'd found a hotel with such friendly multilingual staff and a clean and comfortable place to stay very close to the historic centre for the price paid. Do get yourself a good map to find the place because it's in amongst some interesting but tiny streets. It's very close to the station but don't let that put you off at all.The trattoria Palle D'Oro practically opposite was also a good place to drop in, given we'd arrived quite tired - with a good range of typical traditional favourites including steaks at very normal, not touristy prices.So congratulations to the management and staff of Hotel Globus, you've got something going that some of the higher star establishments could learn from.

<Content>Perfect location, a wonderful stay The Hotel Globus is in a wonderful location. An easy 5-10 minute walk from the train station and 5-10 minutes to the Duomo area or Accademia. The street market area is just around the corner for great shopping.We had a double superior room which was the largest room we have ever had in Europe. Plenty of room to keep 2 large suitcases open and out of the way. We had a back room on the third floor with a view of the Medici Chapel. Wood floors and contemporary decor. Bath with tub/shower combo was also very large although counter and shelf space is minimal. Room kept clean and towels replaced each day. Satellite TV gets you more English language channels than just CNN for the little time you will spend in the room while in fabulous Florence.Breakfast each morning was fresh and attendant on hand for made to order coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Computer access available in breakfast room in the evenings.Staff was helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. Several nice restaurants and tratorias within a short walk. You do have to carry bags up one flight of stairs to the first floor lobby upon arrival. From there the staff will get your bags to your room. There is a very small lift hidden away and most guests are unaware of it and use the stairs.Reasonably priced. Clean. Great location. Discount offered for advance payment with internet booking. We would definately stay at the Globus again.

<Content>3-Star Price, 5-Star Treatment What can I say?My girlfriends and I toured all over Europe this summer, stayed at a number of three and four star hotels, but the best hotel for me is undoubtedly Globus.First of all, the location is fantastic. The Duomo is a 5-minute walk away, and so is the train station where tourists can catch the bus-tours (w/c is the best value for a quick overview of the city). We were also only a half-block away from the Mercato Centrale and street markets.Second, the room was actually pretty big compared to most European rooms we've had. We had a quad, and the room was neat, spacious and quite modern. No view, but we weren't expecting one. We even had a flat screen TV, which, given our addiction to MTV europe, was a huge plus. Third, free breakfast! Need I say more? Oh fine, we had pastries, meats, cappucinos and hot chocolate, cereal, cheeses... quite a spread really! Free internet was available in the breakfast room too.Best of all, The staff is friendly, without being obsequious. They treat you warmly, like old friends showing off their city, and hey, can even make intelligent conversation about art and history. I stayed at a 4-star in Paris, with golden-key rated conceirges, and didn't get service as good as at Globus.The staff are very friendly and helpful. Nicholas gave us great restraurant recommendations and carried our 200 lbs bags up two flights of stairs. Alessandro was very knowledgeable and helpful in recommending which museums (and museum tours) we shouldn't miss when rushing through Florence, and even helped us find train and bus schedules for our Tuscan day trips. And of course, we got made to order cappuccinos at midnight (thanks Andrea, good luck with architecture).Also, they were very patient with us, when we couldn't figure out that the AC does *NOT* work if you open windows, and when we flooded the bathroom because of shower-curtain fiascos. Oops.I miss Florence. And I love Globus. When I go back, I'll definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great location, great staff Just back from our stay at Hotel Globus. The hotel had a lot to live up to because we had read some good reviews on this site, but I am happy to confirm that it's all true! The hotel is well placed for the sights;the rooms are small-ish but very clean and just what you need for a city break;the breakfast is good to start you off; and, most of all, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.My only piece of advice is to make sure you close the window at night. We had a room at the back of the hotel and did get some noise from a nearby nightclub. One night had great difficulty sleeping before we realised the outside window was still open.I鈥檒l be back in Florence and I鈥檒l be booking Hotel Globus for my stay!

<Content>My favorite memories of Italy are from Globus I stayed with my three girlfriends in the Globus Hotel in Room 101 this past summer.We had been staying in four star hotels throughout our European vacation, so we thought we would be roughing it by going to a 3 star hotel. But the only rough part about this hotel was leaving it. ;-) Ha ha! No seriously, I had a great time at this hotel, but mostly because of the people I met there.I thought the staff was so great. Nicholas is very handsome, and since he was the first person we met, I knew it was going to be a good stay! ;-) Anyway, when we arrived at the hotel, he came down the stairs to greet us (they can see you coming) and he carried all of our luggage up the stairs. This was no easy feat, considering we had been shopping uncontrollably and somehow amassed a ridiculous amount of stuff. And he was very patient when I mistakenly told him that our air conditioner wasn't working and that we didn't have a phone. It turns out when you open the windows, the air conditioner doesn't work (I think we read this somewhere on this site by another reviewer, but we had forgotten). And we did have a phone, but it looked like a stapler. Anyway, Nicholas also had good recommendations for restaurants.Alessandro was so extremely helpful. (He's tall and distinguished looking, just in case you're wondering.) He gave us such good information about anything we needed: directions, schedules, information about nightlife, etc. And he also graciously helped download pictures for us so that my friend could take more on her camera. He was so accommodating, which I totally appreciated. We did cause a lot of trouble for him, unintentionally though, and actually most of that stuff really wasn't our fault! I swear! :-) When our t.v. seemed to blow out because a wire got knocked out, he came to fix it for us. And Roberto and the night-porters were cool too. Anyway, one of the guys there is very amusing. I won't mention him by name though. I thought the staff was great overall, and that's why if there were any defects in the hotel, I was able to overlook them.I agree with everyone that the location of this hotel is unbeatable. It was only a 5 minute walk from the train station and within walking distance from lots of sites. I also liked how it was close to all the stands selling leather goods. I thought the room was a good size. We had 4 twin beds in our room, so we fit comfortably. The bathroom was a decent size too. A thicker shower curtain would be good though. Breakfast was yummy. I had prunes (because I actually like them), and bread (and butter!! how I missed butter at dinner-time) and ham and fruit juices and croissants. Oh, I think housekeeping has limited hours, so you might want to consider that if you sleep in as ridiculously late as we do!While we stayed in Florence, my friend and I took the tour of the outlets which is a little outside Florence. We went to Prada, Gucci, Dolce  Gabana, etc. I think it cost us 28 euro. I think this tour was very fun. The Fendi store seemed to have lots of good deals.Anyway, one of my favorite memories from Italy does come from the Globus Hotel because that's where we heard the funniest line EVER. So this helpful guy says to us, There are three categories of people who come to Italy: those who come for the Italian food, those who come for the Italian culture, and those who come for the Italian men. If you fit in the first two categories, I can tell you where to find those things, but as for the third category, what can I say, I am here! Ha ha!

<Content>Great staff, convenient location Stayed at the Hotel Globus for three nights in September 2005. Good location, within walking distance to the train station and major sights. Also very close to the Mercato Centrale where I did most of my gift/souvenir shopping. Clean, comfortable room. I asked for a single and was pleasantly surprised to see that the room had a full sized bed instead of the usual twin sized bed. Room had a nice view of the dome of the Medici chapel which I did not expect. The staff at the Globus was the friendliest and most helpful of all the hotels I stayed at during my three week trip in Italy - especially Alessandro who always took the time to chat and offered great tips on restaurants and places to visit. Breakfast was also the best I had while in Italy - wonderful coffee, wide selection of bread, pastries, cereal, juice, cheese and jam. I highly recommend the Globus and would stay there again if I return to Florence.

<Content>Decent Hotel The staff, breakfast, location and free internet acces are great. We were a little disappointed though with how noisy the maids were at 8AM. The rooms were clean but the beds were less than desirable and felt like the hotel needs to invest in some new linens.Other than that, the Hotel Globus is a pretty good value.

<Content>perfect location, staff and room We stayed at Hotel Globus in September of 2005. The room was small but stylish and spotless with a great view of one of the Duomo's. The staff were all fantastic and could not do enough to make sure our stay was great. The breakfast was very good . It was also very easy to find and very close to the railway station and Florence's attractions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Better than most hotels in Florence When we first checked in to this hotel, we though this is kind of small and not as modern as the promotional materials show. However, after walking around Florence for a day and seeing other hotels, we realized that it wasn't so bad afterall. It is very close to the train staion, so it is great if you are doing day trips from Florence to Pisa or Bologna, for example. The only negative is that the proprietor of the hotel is a bit unpleasant at times. But, overall, not a bad hotel...

<Content>Great Location What a fantastic place Florence is.....when contemplating a trip here with so many hotels it is difficult to know where to stay. I used trip advisor to rate the available hotels and we ended up at the globus hotel. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the train station....we took a taxi not realising how close it was! The hotel is in a fantastic location right at the heart of the city right near the dome! The hotel room was small, modern but very clean and served the purpose and for the time you are actually in the room you would not need anything else. The reception staff were friendly and assisted us with dinner reservations and suggestions. At the end of the street there is a restaurant in a small square called ZA-ZA's, which is a fantastic,cheap italian which the hotel recommended and the house red wine is fantastic at 10 euros a litre. I would also recommend the restaurant at the Lungarno Hotel on the other side of the river - stunning food and location.I would go back and stay at the Globus.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We have just returned from four days at this hotel, it was everything i could have wanted. Convenient for all the sights 5mins from Duomo, 10mins from Accademia, 20 mins from Uffizi.Staff were so helpful especially Alessandro, who gave us directions, restaurants details and sight seeing tips as we had not been to Florence before.Breakfast was great with all you could want. Rooms modern with all the facilities you needed, as well as excellent value for money.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, in fact we have relatives stopping next week.Thank you for making our trip to Florence.

<Content>Good Choice We have just returned from a short stay at the Hotel Globus which we booked based on the reviews from this website. I booked the hotel over the phone as there was a problem with the website. Although I anticipated communication problems as I can't speak Italian, the man I spoke to was really nice and language was not a problem.We weren't disappointed and from the moment that we arrived at the reception desk, the staff were really friendly and cheerful. We had a standard room which was clean and nicely decorated. The breakfasts were really nice (parma ham for him and croissants and fresh bread with nutella for me) plus proper cups of tea!Easily within 5 minutes of the station concourse, we thought this hotel was really good value for money bearing in mind it was round the corner from the Duomo.In response to other reviewers: No problems with the shower (it was great - although why two heads?) or finding the hotel.If you fancy a really special meal whilst you're in Florence - Try Cibreo on Via di Macci near Santa Croce. Totally amazing (but expensive) food in their restaurant with cheaper meals in their trattoria next door.

<Content>Stylish and great staff I stayed at the Hotel Globus in May 2005 as a single female traveller. The room was small but very stylish and spotless. The staff were all fantastic and very friendly. Good breakfast and excellent location for the railway station and easy reach of all Florence's attractions. I'm going back to Florence in December and will be staying there again.

<Content>The Best Hotel of Our Stay We stayed in the Hotel Globus for four nights in the summer of 2002. Serena and Michele now have honorary spots in my scrapbook. The rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. The staff was the best part about our stay. They helped with our museum reservations and other advice. The breakfast room and service were lovely. I have recommended this hotel to several people who were travelling to Italy and all gave the hotel high marks. We even bought flowers for the staff before we left!

<Content>Large superior room with a lovely view We stayed at the Globus across June and July 2005. Our superior room was nicely decorated, large and had a lovely view. There was efficient air conditioning and a large bed. The bathroom was large and tastefully tiled. There was good TV channel choice with BBC and CNN. We'll definitely stay at the Globus again!

<Content>Nice modern hotel in an ancient city The Globus Hotel is very nice, it is located close to the main railway station.It can take a few minutes to find the hotel as in Florence there are two different coloured numbering systems in some streets!!!The staff were very friendly and the breakfasts were excellent.It is a good base to visit all the sites in Florence, the Duomo is about a 10 min walk away.

<Content>Very Good Hotel The hotel Globus is a modern, clean hotel in a central location. The staff were friendly and the price was reasonable.There was secure car parking available in a nearby hotel again at a reasonable rate. This was a great benefit as parking in Florence is a nightmare and usually very expensive.I would recommed this hotel

<Content>Perfect location My 13-year-old nephew and I stayed at the Hotel Globus for three nights during the first week of June. The rooms are, as other reviewers have stated, very small. Nonetheless, we were quite happy with the Globus as our Florence home for three days. It is only one block from the Mercato Centrale which was fascinating for both of us (and even more fun for shopping than the street vendors). The staff members were terrific, helping us with tickets, train schedules and dinner recommendations. In fact, the restaurants they suggested were among the highlights of our trip. Our room was clean and comfortable, and I would stay there again.

<Content>Big Problem Hotel I cancelled a reservation with the Hotel Globus, Florence. After nearly a year, they still refuse to refund the money. They charged for a whole week when the deposit was only one day. Their response is that they can keep the money. Do not stay here, stay at a place where they follow good business practices.

<Content>Lovely hotel My sister  I stumbled onto this hotel when we were looking for directions. The man at the front desk was extremely helpful. He even offered us a room at a discounted rate, 80 Euro in June, which we took. The rooms were VERY nice  much bigger than most European hotel rooms. I can't recommend this hotel enough.

<Content>Globus a good deal for family We stayed at the Hotel Globus for three days and liked it very much. Nick was very helpful in coming down to the street and carrying my bag up the stairs and everyone at the front desk was pleasant and helpful as well. At first, I was a little put off that we didn't get the 'view of the dome' room we had requested and when I showed Nicholas the confirming e-mail he was very apologetic and offered to move us. As we were only going to be there for three days, I declined, and he did offer us complimentary drinks in the bar. As it turns out, the room was fine. The view left a little something to be desired as each window looked out on to an airshaft but on the other hand, that made it very quiet. This room (101 I think) would be excellent for someone travelling with a child or teenager. Our bedroom was very large and then there was a small separate bedroom with a single bed in it which led to the large bathroom. We loved the area right near the outdoor market and the wonderful food market and everything in Florence seems to be about a five-minute walk from everything else.

<Content>1st choice next time Next time we go to Florence this will be the first place we try to book. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff are friendly, helpful and efficient, the rooms are clean, modern and well equipped and the breakfast bar has a free internet connection to check e-mails. A lot of thought and care has gone into the design and running of the hotel - and it shows.The best thing about the Globus though is not the hotel, although it is excellent - it's the location. Step out side the door and walk ten meters and you find youself in the middle of the San Lorenzo market and dispite that, it's still very quiet. Excellent place and we'll be back.

<Content>Great folks at the Globus As I learned from other online reviews, the folks at the 3-Star Hotel Globus in Florence are wonderful! Friendly, helpful, polite, generous with good advice for one new to the city. They willingly booked tours for museums that were not taking ticket reservations; they gave directions to help me find places I've planned to see during the day, and gave me instructions for finding particular bus stops and avoiding lines. The breakfast is a full typical European buffet--meats and cheeses, several kinds of breads, croissants, buns, cereals, two juice choices, yogurts, and best of all: coffee given with hot foamed milk in separate pitchers. There are stairs to climb to get to the hotel lobby, but that's true of many hotels in Florence, they're located on upper floors of large old buildings. There's a lift to the floors of the hotel from the lobby itself. They will hear you coming and help you carry bags up to the lobby and of course carry them down again. Fully airconditioned, mini bar and in-room safe, clean new bathrooms with bidet, TV with CNN and BBC in English. A great thing about the Globus is its location: a block from the Central Market, the San Lorenzo cathedral and market, two blocks from the train station and Santa Maria Novella church and the bus station there. A short walk to Accademia Gallery.

<Content>Modern, comfortable and clean... great! I discovered Globus as a beautiful small Hotel in the central area of Florence. I recommend this Hotel for all people in search of modern hotel with great feeling for detail: Globus is unique because is probably the only modern 3 stars hotel in Florence. The Room was comfortable and clean: I had a spacious single room, that's great for the european standards, expecially for the italian 3* cathegory. The presentation as well as the quality and variety of the breakfast were amazing, as well as all the other services provided (free internet connection at the bar). A great souvenir for me and a recommendation for everybody.

<Content>Nice Modern Hotel We stayed at Hotel Globus for 3 nights in May 2005. Was the only modern hotel we stayed in our trip. The front desk was very helpful. Nicholas works at night and was great. The economy rooms are very small and are two single beds pushed together. Everything was very clean and comfortable. Great breakfast and free internet from 8am until 11pm. The office is on the second floor and the elevator starts on the second floor so get ready to carry your luggage. 5 minute walk from train station. Good location in Florence. We rented a Smart car one day and drove to the outlets and Chianti. Highly suggest doing this. Was our best day in Italy. We had our laundry sent out by the hotel and was very expensive although it was in our room and folded when we arrive that night. Would definately stay at Hotel Globus again. Please remember the AC only works when you shut the window in Italy. I learned the hard way.

<Content>Not so bad.... This is a complicated place to rate. We stayed at The Globus for two nights in May. There are some great things about the hotel. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The location is very close to the train station (easily walkable), the San Lorenzo market is a block away and everything else is easily walkable. The breakfast is also very nice and plentiful. We stayed in the economy size room which was VERY small but I knew to expect that as the hotel makes that clear. The hotel is very clean but somewhat dingy. There are minor marks on the wall and such. As far as the bathroom and sheets everything is perfectly clean. There was no smell in our room but we were told we could upgrade to a supperior for free. When we went in we immediatley noticed the smell. I am not sure that this is the fault of the hotel though. I think it just may be a sewage problem in that neighborhood of Florence. Avoid the first floor and you will be fine. I am not a small person and the bathroom in the ecomony room suited my needs fine. The walls are not thin. You can let in outdoor noise or block it out with their windows. Bottom line, it is a great value but it does have some significant problems if you are in the wrong room. Keep in mind, they are trying their best but in the end it is still a budget hotel.

<Content>A small but cozy 3 stars hotel The hotel is on a small street (not an alley as someone reported, just a small, very old, pre-auto, cobblestone street) only about 5 minutes walk from the train station. It is in a typical old building converted to hotel use. It's up one flight of stairs and some rooms are a flight or two above. There is a one person lift from the desk area.The place is surprising modern, looking,very clean and very well kept. The desk was always staffed and the people were very professional and helpful. We stayed in the economy twin rooms and they were very small, but adequate. It was nice to have a TV with CNN and BBC to get some news. Breakfast was hands down the best we had in Italy. Fresh rolls, fruit, some dessert cake type things, ham, cereal, milk, juice, and real cappuccino Very nice man oversees it all. There is also a laptop with internet access in this room from noon on.

<Content>Stay there again After much research and some helpful reviews from this fabulous website - I booked a stay for 5 nights at the Hotel Globus and I highly recommend it. We stayed in Room #101 (one of largest rooms they have) and hated to leave: when we knew we were assigned to room 101 we were afraid because of some reviews on this site. Anyway, we found a big bathroom with a bathtub, and pretty new fornitures, as well as a wide LCD Tv on the bedroom. The room was also quiet, you won't hear anything from outside thanks at a noise-proof door. The hotel was absolutely spotless...could have eaten off of the floors. A great breakfast in the nice bar and even free internet access.Everyone of the Staff went out of there way to make us feel special. The location couldnt be better: in a safe area just a few steps from the S.Lorenzo church, you won't need any car or taxi to get around, you're in the historical center.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful, spacious and clean Stayed here two nights with family including two kids. I enjoyed myself. Beautiful spacious and clean room on 1st floor (I think it was 101). Can't believe the person who said it was smelly and dirty was staying in the same place. Facilities seem new: nice LCD tv, a bath-tub and room鈥檚 door. The hotel always seems full, and yet at night you don't hear a peep in the hallways, thanks to the heavy door. Service was great and the location couldn't have been better. Front desk very helpful with dinner suggestions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence!

<Content>Confortable Stay Our stay at the Globus Hotel was comfortable. The superior room was clean, adequate and quiet being at the back of the hotel with a view of the Medici. Palle D'Or Restaurant (I would recommend) across the road and Restaurant Za Za just at the other side of the Central Market. I would say the Hotel was one of the better one's in the area and I always felt safe walking the streets around it.

<Content>Too small for comfort The Hotel Globus is near the termini, and close walking distance to the sites of Florence. The neighborhood is what I would consider seedy at night. The room we were in was so small, the two of us could not open our luggage at the same time - and the shower was not large enough for anyone other than a slender woman. They may have bigger rooms but this is what we were given booking on Expedia. The room was clean, and the breakfast was very good with a nice variety of rolls, ham, cheese, and juice. There is not a lift from the hotel entrance you must walk to the 2nd floor with your bags (not easy if they are heavy). The 2nd floor has a really small lift - 1 person 1-bag at a time. The staff made the stay enjoyable - they were all very nice and friendly, and spoke very good English.

<Content>Excellent little hotel Just got back from a couple of nights in the Globus in Florence. Can't believe the person who said it was smelly and dirty was staying in the same place! My daughter and I were in a basic twin room (103). OK, it was small and the view was non-existent, but it extremely well appointed, very quiet and spotlessly clean. Who wants to spend time cooped up in a hotel room anyway, with the whole of Firenze right on your doorstep? The location was excellent, the staff really friendly and all in all, excellent value for money.

<Content>Unimpressed The plus side of the Globus Hotel is its proximity to the duomo, train station and Medici Chapel and a helpful hotel staff.As to the negative, the rooms were miniscule, even for Italy. I have been vacationing in Italy at least one week a year for the last twenty years and I have yet to spend time in a room this small and what was more, according to the staff, it was one of the largest in the hotel. The window let in virtually no light whatsoever and as our room was stuffy as we were in the inner courtyard.Had we been staying for any length of time, we would have checked out and found something better.I would definitely not recommend this property to anyone other than as a last resort.

<Content>excellent choice This was a great value. The rooms are very clean and nice - modern design. The location is excellent right in the middle of the historic area. I can't imagine why anyone would spend more money on a hotel in this area. This was perfect. The location on a narrow street wedged between shops and cafes adds to its ambiance.

<Content>Modern but cozy hotel next to market and train station Hotel was clean, safe, modern, in good shape and 2-3 blocks from the train station. Provided full breakfast and is close to shops and eateries. Not much of a view from my window due to being so close to other buildings. Don't bring heavy luggages since the reception desk is a second floor walk-up. Since Florence was small, I was able to walk everywhere from my hotel. Considered value for the price paid

<Content>Good Location to attrations in town Two of my MBA school girl friends and I spent 3 days in Florence at this hotel (triple with 3 single beds). We booked online and that went smoothly. The site does offer some discounts so should have a look. Given that we were spending such a short time in Florence (2 days) we wanted to be able to see everything we could so location was important. We also knew we would not be spending much time in the hotel.This place is a short distance from the main train station and close to the area attractions. The only issue was that the room they gave us on the first floor smelled bad. We had to open the window and leave it open all night (we were cold but at least the smell was not so bad). While they could not change us that night they did change us the next day and the new room did not smell. I would stay here if we were only going to be in the hotel 3 days max. This is mostly because I think that the hotel knows that certain rooms on the first floor are smelly, yet they still put people in the rooms. While they are willing to change you, at least they did us, given that they did not even come to inspect the room when we mentioned this issue suggests to me they are very aware of this problem. If they were to be proactive and just address this issue, then I think this place could be fine to stay in again. But given that I have noted a couple other reviews on Tripadvisor sighting this same issue, I am not confident that they will take action to solve this problem. On another note, the breakfast was good, but I was bothered that they would not let us have an option to take it or not. But for what it is worth they do provide a selection of coffee, juice, cereal, and some deli meats, so we did eat and enjoy it. Good luck.

<Content>Great Hotel I spent 2 nights at the Hotel Globus and found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located a short walk from the train station and also a short walk form the Duomo in Florence. The rooms are definitely on the small side but they are clean and modern. I have stayed at several hotels in this price range in Florence and its definitely a great value with a lot of convenience. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>smelly and cramped rooms Hotel Globus is a disgusting hotel. The bed linens were dirty and the view was of the trash pile below. It was smelly and the room was awkward and too small to even fit one large suitcase. What a terrible way to end a lovely Tuscan vacation. The staff is helpful and the location is good but the hotel itself is a total dump. Did I mention that it smelled terrible? I spend at least 100 nights a year in hotels and this one is one of the worst. I can't believe the good reviews.

<Content>A nice place to stay I stayed in a single room on the third floor of the Hotel Globus for about a week, and found it very comfortable. The room was rather small but clean and had everything I needed. The free internet in every room is definitely a plus. The staff were very polite and helpful, especially when I was having trouble connecting to the network.The hotel is a good location, you exit onto a busy side street near the Mercato Centrale with few cars but lots of pedestrians and many interesting small shops and plenty of quick dining options. It is a fairly easy walk to the various sites like the Duomo, so it is relatively easy to explore Florence and return to the hotel to recharge as need be.If I ever return to Florence, I would be happy to stay at the Hotel Globus again.

<Content>Enjoy...!! My wife and I spent a 4 night break at hotel from 12/3/05 - 16/3/05. After getting train from Pisa Airport to the hotel we must have walked only 700 metres..the train literally picks you up from the arrivals and drops you just across the road, not far from the Globus... excellent links!! Having stayed in Italy before, we expected the rooms to be small for the rating...they were..but were ideal for what we wanted and nice and modern. Anyway, with a city as beautiful as Florence why spend any more time in your hotel than you need for (1) breakfast (2)a good nights sleep and (3) a shower before you go back out??? The staff are really friendly, good tips for local restaurants etc. but just wander yourself you can't really miss!!Biggest tip for Florence - Book all galleries and museums before you get there. It's easy to do, just call one line (--- plus country codes )and you can book all you want to see in advance because, although it was march..it is really mobbed if you don't do this.We went to the Uffizzi on the Sunday morning, picked tickets up at 9am and were inside for 9.05am..no queue, no wait but around 300 people in the non-booked queue.Superb!!!Thoroughly recommend Globus, Florence, Italy and everything within! ENJOY

<Content>Practical, affordable, In a good Location My wife and I recently stayed at the Globus for 4 nights in March 2005. Overall we were pleased with the hotel and our stay. We booked on Expedia and had no problems with our reservations. I would have rated it higher but I had some mixed feelings on a few of the hotels features. Let me start by saying that this hotel is an excellent value for the money especially for budget minded travelers. The location is also excellent we found it convenient to just about everything in Florence. Five minute walk from the train station, about 10 to 15 to piazza della signoria and 15 to 20 minute walk to the ponte vehcio bridge. If you like to shop your right down the street from a huge open market with street vendors selling all kinds of goods and crafts. The more upscale big name designer stores are only about a 5 to 10 minute walk as well. The Hotel itself is well appointed has a modern feel thanks to contemporary furnishings in the lobby as well as in the rooms. The rooms themselves are quite small however even by Italian standards. The shower is also small but the water pressure is very good. If you have a laptop computer you have a free high speed internet connection right in your room. I found that to be one of my favorite features. The walls in this hotel are very thin and interior noise does intrude. You can hear most of the activities going on in your neighbors room or out in the hallway. If you like a lot of privacy or you may be on your honeymoon you might want to think about that. Outside or street noise is just about nonexistent thanks to two very thick glass windows. The elevator in this hotel is about the size of a small coat closet. The stairs are also very steep getting to the third floor is quite a workout especially after walking all day. I found the staff at this Hotel to be for the most part friendly and helpful. Especially Nicolas who spoke excellent English and recommended restaurants and made reservations for us. I would recommend this hotel if you are a budget minded traveler looking for comfortable, practical accommodations and have a little sense of adventure.

<Content>Peaceful, modern... Fantastic! I'm writing this from the comfort of my superior room at Hotel Globus. The internet connection is free of charge. The staff is quick and friendly to accomodate requests and the room is very peaceful. I choosed the hotel based in the Reviews and found it fantastic: walking distance to everything you need to see in Florence, the Globus is so stunning you may not want to leave your room at all. Brekfast is lovely. Original modern artwork in the breakfast room and hall is outstanding. I'll stay here again!

<Content>Beware upgrade to room 101 How fitting...room 101. I read the reviews here prior to travelling and recalled vaguely something about room 101, but couldn't quite recall what it was about these rooms, when the manager announced enthusiastically that we had been 'upgraded'. The sewerage smell and the incessant slamming of doors soon reminded me of what I had read. After a tiring journey, I was looking forward to an afternoon nap, but was awakened by the slamming doors and a stench, which was by then sitting heavily on my stomach. The manager on reception was, of course, incredulous. 'We've never had a complaint before'. I decided to leave what I had read here as further ammunition, but I explained politely that if we weren't moved we would be checking out. After much tapping of the computer keys we were moved up a floor, but had to move again the following day.The breakfast, I considered to be okay, but probably erring on the side of being generally unhealthy. The staff are helpful, but no more so than any other hotel I have stayed. The comments on standard of the area I would endorse, but it is still well located, near the station and everything is 鈥榳alkable鈥?if you are fit.During my three day stay I noticed that the smell permeates around the entire floor and the toilet, which is next to room 101, is well equipped with air fresheners. A Canadian couple we met also commented on the smell and they were in one of the other 10? Rooms.I travelled with my 23-year-old son and perhaps, the manager thought that we wouldn't complain. Doubtless they get complaints on a regular basis and the manager's incredulity is enough on its own for me not to recommend this hotel. Would I stay there again....No. There is nothing to really to commend this hotel above any other, except perhaps, better the devil you know....

<Content>I highly recommend Hotel Globus The location of Hotel Globus was great. It was right in the center of Florence and walking distance to shopping areas, restaurants and transportation. The website describes hotel as being 200 meters from the train station, which is not true. It is a bit farther. It would have been nice to know that before I carried heavy luggage to the hotel and up the stairs. You have to walk up two flights of stairs to get into the hotel. The staff was more than willing to help with the bags so this really wasn't an issue. The hotel and the common areas are very nice. There is a nice lounge area with a flat screen TV and high speed internet access. The staff is very professional and very helpful. The owner/manager, Micheal, is very good about dining suggestions, location of sights and Italian culture. The hotel was very accommodating for families with children and the rooms are very nice and newly decorated. The room temperatures were comfortable and the bathrooms were spacious and clean. The breakfast that was included was pretty good as well.

<Content>OK Nice location in the middle of the city and literally next door to the Mercato Centrale shopping area. The hotel was clean and the staff very helpful and nice. What was bothering me was the fact that the walls were very thin and you can here every move your neighbour makes... Not to mention people walking in the corridor... You don't want to go to the bathroom yourself very early or late, since you know it's going to bother everyone else around :-( Breakfast was ok. Best thing: location Worst thing: noisy

<Content>a very comfortable 3 stars hotel We stayed at Hotel Globus from February 10-12. Our superior room was large and our bathroom was spotless and also large. Staff at the front desk and breakfast room couldn't have been nicer. Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Location was also excellent.

<Content>Excellent choice Hotel Globus is an excellent choice of where to stay when you are in Florence. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful even in the face of our many requests to book advance tickets for the museums and day tours. The location is excellent - near to the market if you want to haggle for some bargain gifts, a few minutes walk from Duomo and the main tourist sites and with plenty of good restaurants nearby. The rooms are nicely done and very comfortable. I would definitely return to this hotel when I'm next in the area and would wholly recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Nice, clean, good situation When we stayed there the hotel had just been refurbished. It was very clean and modern (nice bathroom, internet access in your room). Very small hotel and the reception is on the first floor (not elevator from the ground floor). Very well situated and good value.

<Content>a nice 3 stars hotel After a long search on the net we found Globus Hotel, and what we found at the arrival met our expectations. We stayed at the end of January and staff and service were great, breakfast was tasty; our rooms were very clean -our family group booked 3 different rooms, 2 standard rooms ( not very large) and one small for our children -the two categories were different in size but all well appointed- and all the bathrooms even if not very spacious had an adequate shower box. Remember that Florence is an old city and space is precious especially in the centre.Globus Hotel is for sure a Superior 3 star hotel compared to all the others 3 stars we stayed during our trip to Italy.We would stay here again!

<Content>not for a young family We stayed at the Globus in October of 2004. The hotel is near the train station but somewhat difficult to find as it is down a back alley. The sign for the hotel was not obvious either, it was merely a computer printed paper adhered to the door with tape. This should be ones first warning! The hosts were gracious but the rooms were quite musty, small, windowless and had crumbs in the bedding. Bathroom had a shower in the middle of the room with folding doors that collapsed in as you showered, subsequently soaking the room. The complimentary breakfast was adequate. The accomodations would be the equivolent of an american 2+ star hotel. Also beware for the gypsies outside, they accosted my three children outside the doors in an attempt to pickpocket my husband. Luckily we had read about such incidents and were prepared.

<Content>21st century jewel in a 14th century town! Extraordinary modern hotel in a museum-like city. As soon as we arrived in the hotel, it was like entering the 21st century, in a 14th century city. All amenities were first class. Service was impeccable. Rooms were specially large -considering Europe's standards, with comfortable beds, great smooth cotton sheets. Since the floors have tiles and not carpet (versus other hotels in Europe), the sense of cleanliness was extremely gratifying!Even though the hotel is rated as a 3 star, it could very well obtain a 5 star rating based on quality... but not on price! Even with the strong Euro (Dec '04), room rates are very affordable in US$!I would definitely return and recommend this hotel.

The effort the staff makes to please their customers is very noticeable. The hotel is clean and comfortable. I definitely reccomend this hotel.

<Content>GREAT STAFF and location, Just spent 3 days here in florence Have to say that the Hotel staff was GREAT! As well as location (easy 10 minute walk from train station and near all the major sights)best thing was the Staff was VERY helpful getting info on sights and reservations, our room was clean and spacious. Breakfast in the morning was nice and the staff very helpful. the only negatives were our view overlooked a rooftop and had some noise at night club noise at night (but I ALWAYS TRAVEL) with earplugs so no problem.I'd recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to Florence.

<Content>spotless, charming, stylish Globus We walked in off the antique streets of Florence into this stylish, modern environment. It was so clean and so comfortable with great views of the city. Florence is wonderful but I really appreciated having a calm, clean place to go when I wanted a break. Then, just outside the front door you're right back in the very heartbeat of Florence...the central market.I highly recommend Hotel Globus to everyone. It is modern (they said they did a total renovation just a few years ago and there's internet in each room), English speaking and friendly staff, clean as can be, central location, affordable, and charming all at the same time.

<Content>NEVER going back! Did I stay in the same hotel that others are raving about? Can't be! Here was our impression...Smelled terrible, comforters were dirty and had stains, our room was on the same floor as the reception area and we heard every phone call that came in the whole night, not to mention all the conversations the staff were having. (If the smell didn't keep us awake, then the chill from only using a bedsheet without the comforter did, then if we finally fell asleep the reception phone rang or a conversation with someone was had at the reception area.) And... what was with the shower? (For those of you that have stayed here, you'll probably chuckle at this comment.) We would NEVER stay here again!

<Content>Clean, neat but Tiny Great location, clean, neat, but unlike the other reviews here, we must have been given the tiniest room in the place (at the end of a hall). It had two twin beds with no room to spare even for suitcases. Overall, I would still recommend it for it's clean, neat, new style and extremely helpful staff who were quick to help with a map, reservations, or anything else you needed to improve your stay. Easy accessibility to train and tourist sites were also points to highlight about the location. Web access and TV in breakfast room were nice touches. Only complaints to note were that the breakfast room was always crowded with not enough places to sit (Oct 2003) and the problem with lugging your suitcases up that first flight of stairs.

<Content>loved the Hotel Globus The Hotel Globus is wonderful. The location is perfect. It is located within walking distance of the Duomo, San Lorenzo, Piazza della Repubblica, Santa Maria Novella and even Ponte Vecchio. The complimentary breakfast is delicious. The hotel staff is extraordinary helpful.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Globus! We spent 3 nights at the Hotel Globus this November and we had a wonderful stay. Our room was quite large for a European room and it included a Queen Bed and a separate room with a twin which would be perfect if traveling with a child.The bathroom was clean and a nice size. My only complaint would be that the shower doors were fold-away and it took some skill to keep them closed so that the bathroom floor did not get wet. Our price included breakfast every morning which included pastries, cereals, yogart, fresh fruit and cheeses. The hotel provided free internet service on a laptop in the lounge which was very convienent. We also had Satellite TV in our room which consisted of 2 english speaking channels, BBC and CNN World which is customary for Europe.The location of the hotel was great since it was a 5 minute walk to the train and it was right near the Duomo. The hotel staff was fantastic with providing us with excellent restaurants and sights to see. I would definetly return to this hotel if we visit Florence in the future.

<Content>Nice Hotel This is a very nice hotel. The staff was very pleasant and the location was great. It is walking distance from Train Station. You can't beat it for the rate. The only downfall is the hotel has a lot of stairs. I had to drag my luggage up two flight of stairs. I was surprised that they did not have elevators that go to the street level. If you can get over the sewer smell then this is a lovely place to stay.

<Content>GREAT Staff - makes the hotel a step above After reading the reviews here we booked this hotel for 6 nights in November. It was great. We had asked for the room with the balconey but it was booked at the time we made the request. When there was a cancellation they gave us the room.The staff sent us to excellent places to eat. They also got us reservations for the Uffizi. All of the staff was friendly and helpful.I would stay here again and would definately recommend it to friends.

<Content>Highly recommend the Globus We stayed at the Globus in early Nov. and were very impressed. Not knowing what to expect from a 3 star at bargain prices, I booked it based on reviews from this and other sites. I must admit, the exterior lacks the 'WOW' factor, but the hotel is absolutely wonderful- a very modern boutique hotel. I changed reservations several times via email and the staff was consistently prompt and friendly. When we missed our turn while driving to the hotel the man at the front desk stayed on the phone with me until we reached the hotel. We stayed in a 5 star last year during a trip to Florence and our room at the Globus was actually larger for hundreds of euros less. Try the Globus, you won't be disappointed!!!

<Content>Great staff This hotel has a great staff (so helpful and great recommendations), great location (easy to walk everywhere and the Central Market is at your front door), and great perks (the breakfast and Internet access). I chose this hotel based on the reviews here and I would say the only disappointment was the room itself. It was clean and an okay size but the bathroom was funky (toilet and shower and one) and smelled *really bad*. The walls are thin, so if you're a light sleeper maybe not the best. I did have a great view of the dome at San Lorenzo from my room though.

<Content>Honeymoon in Globus We had the first week of our honeymoon at the Globus Hotel. Stayed in a Superior Double which was large and spacious. The rooms were very clean (if a little sparce ) and came with a bright, modern bathroom.Staff were extremely friendly and helped us out with restaurant and attraction recommendations and even did museum phone bookings for us.Breakfast good (why do they put sugar-coating on everything in Italy!) and we found the free internet very useful.Location was superb, handy for all the major tourist attractions. At the weekends it was a little noisy at night (from about 11pm) due to the nightclub that backed onto the hotel...but we were really too tired from the walking for this to be a real problem.Would have no trouble recommending this hotel.

<Content>Second stay here We stayed here first week in October, 2004. Courteous and helpful staff as always. Clean rooms and a great location near the train/bus station which is great if your arriving or leaving by bus or train like we were. Keep in mind, finding a good view in Florence is tough so you might want to splurge for a front room at the Hotel Savoy if that is what your looking for. Alessandro or Nicholas will get you great restaurant reservations and breakfast is a good value.

<Content>A little disappointed with Hotel Globus We just returned from our trip to Italy. Hotel Globus was the most disappointing. The room was very dismal-lighting very poor. It was clean, the staff was very helpful and caring, breakfast was good and we loved the free internet access. Location was also a plus. However, after a long day of sightseeing it was sad to return to the room-clean but needs an update. Others in the area were less expensive-didn't deserve 4 stars.

<Content>Would definitely stay again We've just returned from two days at the Hotel Globus. The location is great and the hotel was extremely clean. We had an economy twin which was pretty cosy (but how long are you in the room for anyway?) and would probably opt for a larger room on our next visit. The staff was more than welcoming and helped us with our bags immediately upon entering off the street (reception is one flight up from the ground level). Breakfast is a great bonus in a nice, welcoming environment. Complimentary internet access during the day was also a huge plus as was the generous water pressure. My husband and I would definitely return.

<Content>Room with no view. We stayed at the Globus in September 2004. After reading the reviews here...I was expecting more than I got.The rooms were a decent size and very nicely appointed however there was only a tiny window that opened to allow a view of the adjacent building.Florence is a nightmare of one way streets and this Hotel was not the easiest to find.The staff was pleasant and helpful but overall I would rate the experience as just okay.

<Content>Very Up to Date, but Tiny Rooms I stayed at the Hotel Globus twice on a recent trip to Italy. The location is conveniently near the train station, but the narrow street is deserted at night. My room was clean, the bed super comfy, the bathroom more than adequate, the breakfast lovely, and the staff very helpful. However, my single room was the tiniest space imaginable. My choice was to be in the closet, on the bed, or in the bathroom. It certainly encouraged me to get out and sightsee!

<Content>Good Value The hotel staff is very helpful. They gave us great restaurant suggestions, places locals frequent. The bathrooms are very clean and relatively big!!!! The superior room is a good size. The bed was a little too firm, but I'd stay there again. The location is perfect. A few minutes from the heavy tourist areas, but still central to all of the attractions.There's even a good market right out the door.

<Content>#1 Choice in Florence The Hotel Globus was fantastic. The rooms were modern, clean and comfortable and having free access to the Internet was huge perk. Perhaps the best part was the friendly and helpful staff who made you feel immediately comfortable and went out of their way to make your time in Florence that much better. I would absolutely stay here again and will be sure to spread the word as it was definitely the best of Florence.

<Content>We really enjoyed it!! The Globus is a fantastic hotel in Florence - near the railway station and the markets, very clean, modern bathroom, staff at the front desk extremely helpful, free internet!!! in the bar area.Lovely white starched sheets, good breakfast, we cannot recommend it highly enough and would certainly stay there again.If coming by train, as one other reviewer mentioned, it is a bit of a nightmare walk to the hotel with the cobblestones, narrow streets and the traffic. However, it's all an adventure!!

<Content>wonderful Best breakfast we had through all of italy. Having internet available was very nice. Hotel staff always available and helpful (they even gave me change so I could finish my laundry). Central location, easy access to everything. Bathroom was large for europe with great water pressure. It was nice to have air conditioning! Only minor complaint was that the walls were very thin, but that is not unusual, and since our room was down near the end of the hall, not that disturbing. Would recommend requesting a room in the back. I would stay here again! thanks hotel globus.

<Content>Thanks Hotel Globus! We stayed at Hotel Globus on 2 separate occasions on our 12 day trip to Italy. We really enjoyed it. The first time I had a room with one large twin bed. The next time we had a quad room which worked out great for all 4 of us. I really appreciated the CNN being from Florida with the hurricane hitting. I could keep up with what was going on. Also the internet in the bar area was great. The staff was great. They were friendly, helpful and spoke beautiful English. They were kind enough to hold our luggage after check-out until late afternoon.The location is close enough to the train station but far enough so that noise is not a problem. They have clean, modern rooms and built in adaptors for plugging in hair rollers etc. The location is close to most everything you will want to visit. Thanks Hotel Globus!

<Content>Felt Like Home We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Globus. The best aspect of this hotel is the people and the service provided. They were warm, friendly and helpful and made us feel at home. It was great coming back to the hotel, coming home, after a long day of site-seeing to be greeted with smiles. The hotel has an updated contemporary feel with small rooms that are sufficient but not special.The hotel is located just blocks from the train station which is great. Pulling luggage to the hotel was not without a bit of a struggle given the uneven pavement and significant traffic. There is much to offer around the hotel (restaurants, stores, market) but with the exception of some of the restaurants, much closes after 6.The lounge offers a nice breakfast in the morning, convenient internet service and a place to gather with friends or family.I recommend staying at the Hotel Globus if you want a reasonably priced, no frills hotel with great service in a convenient tourist location.

<Content>Hotel Globus is wonderful Of all the places we stayed on our vacation in Italy, Hotel Globus was our favorite. The english speaking hotel staff was very helpful, made us feel welcome, and gave us a map of the city upon arrival. The breakfast was nice, and the free internet access during the day was an added bonus we all enjoyed. We also enjoyed the lounge area in the evening, where my family and I congregated and talked about our day, while drinking a glass of Limoncello.The hotel is in a great location, close to the train station, so you don't have to take a taxi or carry your luggage very far if you arrive by train. It is around the corner from the daily street market and walking distance to all the major points of interest. For the money, this is a great hotel, and we would all recommend it to anyone traveling to Florence.

<Content>Great Value I booked this hotel in a hurry, but was pleasantly surprised. The best is free high speed Internet in all rooms. We took the quad room which an earlier review complained a bit. They have fixed the shower - all have glass surrounds. Staff very helpful. A/C control had to fixed by the staff as the min setting was pretty high. Location is very good, near station  other sights within walking distance. Self-service laudry around the corner. Open air market in the next street. Only hassle is with luggage - taxi dropped us off at street corner  no lift to reception area, though staff came  helped with luggage. Very clean  highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic service and great rooms! From the moment we walked into Hotel Globus we received excellent service. Our bags were immediately carried up to our rooms without us needing to request it. We received a map and details on where to go in Florence when we were checking in. The rooms were small but nicely furnished and the beds were very comfortable. This hotel has many touches that others do not in Italy - personal and attentive service, a bar fridge in the room, excellent breakfast and a fantastic central location. We will definately stay here again!

<Content>This hotel is the best!!! My daughter and I stayed at the Globus for two nights on our month long trip through Europe. All of our hotels were of similar size and price, but the Globus wins hands down for being the best of them all. The staff made it our most wonderful stay in all of Europe. Nicolas and Nicola helped make my daughters fourteenth birthday one she will always remember. They also recommended a reataurant, Anita's, which was the best food of our trip. The breakfast was terrific, but the staff makes this place an absolute gem. I would Only stay here. We never wanted to leave.

<Content>A gem This little hotel was one of the best we've stayed in in Europe. The staff was outstanding, very informed and accomodating. The breakfast was decent, the waiter slings a mean cuppa coffee. The rooms weren't huge but that's what you get in Europe. Globus is a two minute walk from the Duomo and about 5 from the train station. A/C worked great. You will not be disapointed with Globus!

<Content>Great value and staff, but avoid room 101 Stayed at Globus July 18-21 based on tripadvisor reviews, and was extremely pleased with the value. My only complaint would be to avoid room 102 - there was a faint sewage odor, which explained why an automatic air freshener was in the room. It didn't always mask the odor, and was quite loud when it went off. Also, 101 is near a door that leads to the breakfast room and common computer, which resulted in frequent door slamming and loud conversation that could be heard in the room. Maybe a better insulated room door would help this problem. I would have asked to change rooms, but the hotel was completely booked. To clarify a comment by a recent reviewer - there is no elevator from street level to the reception desk, which is one floor above street level, but there IS a tiny elevator from the reception area to the upper floor rooms. When I arrived and rang the bell, someone came down to help me take my bag up the stairs. Globus has a great staff!

<Content>So cool! I'm actually staying at this hotel right now and writing my review on the free internet service they provide. It is so awesome to stay here. Florence is so beautiful and this hotel is in the perfect location. We've been traveling for about a month now and staying at hotels that range about 100-150 US $ a night and I would say this is probably the best so far. Really nice rooms and very cool interior.

<Content>A bit too spartan for me I will say that I booked a room for 4 which is always a gamble and I lost this time. Very tiny bathroom with a shower stall that is level withthe rest of the bathroom floor so it is impossiblenot to get water everywhere. With 4 people thatsa disaster.We were also very squeezed. Two beds weresqueezed into a tiny room that was almostmonastery-like. There is no elevator.The hotel staff was very friendly . It is a shortwalk from the train which is helpful. Pretty mucheverything is walkable in Florence so I considerthat a plus.

<Content>Hotel Globus--Outstanding The Hotel Globus is truly a gem, and a part of me wants to keep it secret from the traveling hordes. Obviously this hotel owner has taste, and appreciates good design---the modern yet comfortable interior (tastefully decorated with understated flair, Jacob Jensen phones, sleek and solid furniture, personal safe), small but functional and very clean bathroom (all rooms have showers only, I'm told), and sharply dressed staff. The breakfast was great, the coffee outstanding---not an extensive selection, but made up for by the quality of each item, from the ham to the selection of fresh fruits and yogurt. Each room has TV internet access, and there's also a PC you can use in the small but impeccably furnished interior. One look at the Globus webpage and brochure, and you know the owner/manager is trend savvy and insists on good design. The little things added up to a great stay, but best of all, what a staff---young and courteous, and friendly in a comfortable way without being superficially chummy (if you've traveled through the US midwest, you probably know what I mean). Just minutes from the train station and the city center, too. Best hotel in Florence for the price, no doubt.

<Content>Loved the globus and the neighborhood! We booked The Globus based on reviews we read here and were so pleased. Great location; we took the city bus from the airport to the train station, then pulled our luggage to the hotel from there! We were on the third floor on the back with great view of the Medici Chapel dome and bell tower over the tops of nearby flats, which had laundry hanging on clotheslines out their windows...perfect! We were there in mid June and the nights were cool. The room was air conditioned, but we kept our fabulous big windows flung open to enjoy the night air and woke to the pealing bells and cooing pidgeons on the roof next door. Just up the street was the city market with outdoor dining in the square until quite late. We loved it! A very pleasant breakfast was served each morning by an equally pleasant gentleman. Small hotel, but well appointed with quality furnishings and grand windows.

<Content>Great value!! We spent 4 nights at Hotel Globus and thought it was an excellent value for the money. We had chosen it based on these reviews and it did not disappoint. We had a superior double room. It was a very good sized room and the modern decor was cool. The AC went full blast and the bathroom was a good size for a European hotel. The room was very clean and they gave us fresh towels every day. The people were very friendly and helpful - we especially thought the man who set up breakfast was very accomodating with the made to order caffes. Breakfast had a nice variety with fresh fruit, pastries, yogurt, cereal, etc. The hotel is in a very convenient location - only a five-minute walk to the Duomo and a two-minute walk to the train station. I wouldn't hang out there really late at night or anything but I felt very safe at the hotel. And yes, to get to the reception requires climbing a flight of stairs, but really no different then carrying my luggage up the stairs at home. All in all, I thought we lucked out with the Globus and we would definitely recommend it to other visitors to Florence!

<Content>fantastic hotel with an amazingly welcoming owner  My sister and I just stayed at the Hotel Globus for 4 nights and we were so sad to leave! The hotel is an incredible find: affordable, immaculate well-appointed rooms (with strong air conditioning), a wonderful, high-pressure shower, but most importantly, the people who own and work there are simply incredible. They are so friendly, warm and accomodating: they made all our museum reservations for us, and were just great to spend time with. Plus, you can't beat the location: right near the S.M.N. station, but down a block so you don't feel like you're too close to it. And a short walk to everything in the historic center. Go and you will enjoy your stay in Florence!

<Content>Very nice hotel We stayed overnight a couple weeks ago, and thought the hotel was very nice compared to others we had stayed at in Europe. We had a double twin room, which was VERY small, but clean, nicely decorated, and with good amenities. Our internet access wasn't working in our room, but the hotel management took off 10 euros, which made us happy. Breakfast was great, with staff preparing fresh cappucinos and other hot drinks, and plenty of food available, including fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, and baked goods. Reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful in recommending restaurants and sites to see. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Comfortable hotel, fantastic staff We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The rooms, although small, were nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel was very close to the train station and within walking distance to all of the touristy sites. The staff at the hotel was absolutely fantastic. We could not imagine a more friendly and helpful staff. They gave us great suggestions for restaurants, made reservations for us at numerous locations, and were they were always cheerful.

<Content>A brilliant place to stay A friendly, spotlessly clean hotel - wonderful power showers, a huge breakfast buffet and delightful staff who couldn't do enough to help 2 first time visitors to Florence. The central location meant we could walk to just about anywhere on our list of tourist 'must-sees'. The little market square was a moment's walk and had good restaurants to eat at each evening. When we go back to Florence we will stay at the Hotel Globus again!

<Content>A great hotel, surpassing our expectations We booked on the internet based on the comments of previous customers. We were delighted with all aspects of the hotel. The room was clean, well decorated and furnished. The bed was large and comfortable. Whilst there was no bath in our en-suite we had a spacious and powerful shower and the tiling was tasteful and appeared quite new. The staff on reception were very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. We tried out their recommendations for restaurants, all of which proved good. Breakfast in the bar was a very pleasant surprise. The choice was excellent with dried fruits, cereals, meats and cheeses, croissants, rolls and bread (with toaster provided), preserves, fresh fruits and yogurts, and a selection of fruit juices and hot drinks. It was great to have such a comfortable hotel to crash out in after long days slogging round Florence. This hotel comes with our strong recommendation.

<Content>NICE HOTEL TO STAY I stayed 2 nites @ the Hotel Globus last summer  loved it. The hotel was a little pricey but after my debacle of apartment rental in Rome, spending some extra money  having a nice hotel to stay was exactly what I needed. The hotel is located only a few blocks away from the train station  very convenient. The staff was extremely helpful  breakfast every morning was a treat. Our room was huge w/ webtv which was great to be able to send emails home  hear from the rest of the world. I would stay there time  time again  would recommend it highly!

<Content>Can't b beat for value and location What can I say? Three nights there, and I would recommend it! The rooms, while sparse, were immaculate, contained a shower, and were swept each day. The breakfast presentation was superb, and the staff very consciensious. Definitely a good hotel for couples away on a romantic weekend!Beware, though... Located right beside a massive cathedral, and the likelihood of being awoken by bells is strong!!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel with a great location Extremely friendly staff. Quite, clean and roomy. Decent breakfast. We stayed for two nights in the beginning of April and requested a deluxe room with a view. Paid a bit more, but it was well worth it. Bathroom was huge, as well as the room itself. (#309) Internet connection was only available in the breakfast room which was convenient but not available in the room as the hotel web site indicated. Hotel is very convenient to all sites and train station. Would definitely stay at the Globus again.

<Content>Excellent hotel with a warm, professional and friendly staff When I booked our various Italian lodgings, it was with great trepidation since we had never been to Europe. Reading guide books and hearing the experiences of a friend who had been in Italy recently were our only preparation. Arriving at the Globus dispelled all fears. From that moment forward, every member of the staff bent over backwards to welcome us warmly, answer any question, offer advice, make arrangements or recommendations or help a guest with anything whatsoever that he or she might need. The rooms were clean, modern and completely comfortable. There was never a shortage of hot water or clean towels. A laptop computer in the breakfast room was available to guests most of the day and into the evening. The breakfasts equalled or surpassed those at our other Italian lodgings. Our superior double room had a balcony with a grand view of the Basilica di San Lorenzo cupola and Medici Chapel rooftops. The location is exceptionally convenient to the San Lorenzo markets, Santa Maria Novella church and the rail/bus stations. Of course, in Florence, all the hot spots are in a relatively small area. If, like me, you want more than the very modest mom and pop pensione but not the price or luxuries of a 5-star hotel, book the Globus with confidence.

<Content>Clean, modern and central but small - good shower and comfortable beds! Very clean and recently decorated but the room was very small. Our economic twin room was very narrow (only just wider than 2 small single beds)and the bathroom was very cramped with no where to put your toiletries (no shelves or vanity cabinet - just a free standing basin). The reception area and staff were all very good and quite helpful. The breakfast area was modern and clean and a nice breakfast (ceral, fruit, bread and croissants, juice and hot drinks) was avaialbe from 7:30am. The location was good if you like to be central and don't mind a bit of noise (recommend ear plugs for a good nights sleep). The Duomo is just 3 mins walk away and the other sites are all within 10 mins walk. For those with a car I recommend you park outside the restricted area. Parking on Viale Spartaco Lavagnini is free from 8pm till 8am not like the garages that will charge 24 euro a night. I would stay at Hotel Globus again - but next time in a larger room :o)

<Content>little lovely hotel We spent 4 nights at the Hotel Globus and did not want to leave! We found their attention to detail and overall service to equal that of a five star hotel. Having spent a month travelling Italy we are happy to say that Hotel Globus was by far the the best. We miss Michele, all his staff and can't wait to return.

<Content>an excellent 3 stars hotel I would highly recommend the Globus. Of all the hotels I stayed in on my trip to Italy, this was by far the best. The hotel is perfectly located within walking distance to all of the main sights in Firenze. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and stylishly decorated. The staff at the Globus is exceptionally nice and very helpful. Every time we entered the lobby, we were greeted with a smile and a ciao. The continental breakfast is very good with many different choices. There is a internet connection set-up in the lobby where you can check e-mail any time of day. The vast majority of guests were American and the hotel definitely seemed to cater to Americans, but it did it with an Italian flair. I was travelling with an Italian friend and she said that this hotel is most definitely the best hotel for your money in Firenze. I will be staying at the Globus again the next time I visit Firenze.

<Content>Best Value, Staff, and Location! My friend and I just returned from our trip to Florence and were extremely impressed with Hotel Globus. Recently renovated, it boasts classy simplistic design with personable staff and most importantly, clean rooms! Our room happened to have a nice view of a church nearby! The breakfast is great also! Best of all, there is free internet at this hotel IN YOUR ROOM! If that doesn't satisfy you, there is also free internet in the breakfast room.I can't say enough good things about the staff! You're not just another face at this hotel. They go out of their way to make recommendations and make sure they are doing everything to make your stay great!The location is outstanding! Just a 10-15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio...10 minute walk to the Duomo...5 minutes from the train stations (where the hop on/off buss tour of the city starts)...and just around the corner from the best sandwich/pastry/pizza shop that is open 24 hours!I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Florence. I personally love family-owned hotels and Hotel Globus is by far the best family-owned hotel I have stayed in!

B'fast spread is good and the staff are very friendly. It exceeded our expectations on every counnt and we highly recommend it to anyone who intends to visit Florence.

<Content>Surpassed all my expectations I made reservations at Hotel Globus based mainly on great web-site reviews and price. I was not disappointed. Our visit was in December 2003. My traveling group included 9 family members.SERVICE - We received wonderful service from a very delightful staff who made certain that our stay at their hotel was comfortable in every way. The owners are warm and friendly and will go out of their way to make certain that your stay is pleasant and friendly. Roberto, who served us breakfast each morning, was always cheerful and friendly. Each morning we received a friendly greeting and warm smiles from him and all staff members. Even the cleaning personnel was warm and friendly. We were a bit sad to leave the hotel and move on to Rome.LOCATION - The location was great. We were able to walk to our destinations, return to the hotel to rest, and then walk on to another destination. There is a small grocery store, Cherubino, down the street from the hotel where we walked to several times for cheese, crackers, wine, etc. The woman who works there (maybe the owner) remembered our individual purchases and treated us graciously each visit. A washateria, bakeries and food places are only a few feet away from the hotel. Very convenient!ROOMS- The rooms were cleaned thoroughly each day. Having a quiet room was important to me and I had requested one. I was thrilled to discover that my room was towards the back of the hotel and was very quiet. Even rooms in front of the hotel were quiet. The room I was given was large, including the bathroom.All my family thanked me on numerous times for finding this great hotel! Whenever we return to Florence, I will definitely stay at the same hotel.

<Content>Modern-minimalis design and Clean We booked a reservation at the Hotel Globus through its web-site based of the good reviews that we read on tripadvisor. Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US. This is true, therefore we are not expecting much on it.During the time to confirm our reservation, we have been offered with various rate for double standard or double executive room. Thank you to Michelle who is one of the owner of this hotel. He gave us a good deal of Euro 90 for double executive room (incl. buffet breakfast and taxes). We stayed there for 3 nights late December 2003.To us the hotel is most likely a 2 stars with a 4 stars bathroom facility. Our room is spacious with internet access, cozy modern-minimalis design and clean. The one which decreased the value of this hotel is that the lobby is up a flight of stairs. Guests must climb with luggage. when we arrived we were greeted by the front staff who helped us to bring our luggages up to the lobby.We left our luggages at the front desk since the room reserved for us was still occupied. When we came back in the afternoon, our luggages had been brought in the room at 2nd floor. The bar and breakfast place looked like a snack vendor and the only staff is very practical. Breakfast was fine european standard with fresh fruit, however we could ask for a cup of capucinno or even a glass of hot chocolate.This hotel is recommended for budget travelers who do not mind to carry on your own luggages to the room and during check out. We do not mind it either. The location is best, near the train station (5 minutes walk) and many budget eating houses nearby. Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel. The window of our room is facing the back of Medici Chapel, a warm scene in the morning of winter season.We will absolutely stay there again if we get back to Florence one day.xxx

<Content>Excellent value for money I couldn't find a better value-for-money 3-star hotel in Florence. We stayed 4 nights in the inexpensive small room (70 euros!!! end of november) and we got more than we were expecting (fridge in the room, electronic safe, new and clean toilet/shower, and free internet access).Staff is very friendly, specially Nicolas who gave us excellent restaurant recommendations (if you like to eat where the locals eat, ask about Contadino and Rocco).Location is convenient - near the station and very close to San Lorenzo church and market.Highly recommended for a 3-star hotel.

<Content>It was fine I went with the Hotel Globus because of the good reviews on this webpage and other sources. The hotel was clean and in a great location if you are taking trains/buses in and out of Florence and want to be near the Central Market. The rooms are clean but very basic. Most of the hotel staff are super friendly - all except one who we didn't like at all (and the free laptop in the breakfast room was an added feature) but it wasn't special or anything to write home about. After 5 nights the breakfast was boring - of all the places we went it had the least amount of fresh food. If you want average, clean, safe this is a place for you. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary try somewhere else. While our room overlooked a busy street we heard very little from outside b/c of new double windows but we could here all the comings and goings of everyone on our hallway. A little noisy in that respect.

<Content>Central with 'chic' decoration I stayed for 3 nights in October 2003 - very central, just a few minutes walk from all the main tourist sites of Florence and a 10 minute walk from the railway station ( although the website map could be a little clearer - I know Florence well and I got lost getting to the hotel from the station ).A double flight of stairs from the street is a drawback, but you could wait at the bottom and wave to the Reception staff via the security camera to get them to carry your luggage up, I suppose. Very nicely decorated in 'earth' colours with touches of black - modern breakfast room, like a small, coffee house - good breakfast. Room very clean, tiny bathroom (with a shower surrounded by a curtain, straight onto floor ). Room overlooked the dome of the Medici Chapel, although double glazing did not cut out all the noise from (I presume) a local night club, open to 3am !! Reception staff very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely recommend Hotel Globus to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Dary, Dingy, and Cheap I booked a reservation at the Hotel Globus in Florence based of the good reviews that I read on Trip advisor and the hotel website. Boy was I mislead! This hotel is no more than a one star hotel. I have stayed in Holiday Inns that are nicer than this. The room might be cheap. Mine was 170 euros but you definitely get what you pay for. The room was pretty clean but the hotel was dark and deserted. I arrived and found that the lobby was up a flight of stairs which I had to climb by myself with all my luggage at midnight and once I got the the room that they were calling lobby I had to yell hello before the one person who was on staff at the hotel came out. The bar and breakfast place looked like a fraternity house and the staff was rude. Needless to say I stayed on night and then checked into the Hotel Lungarno and had a fantastic stay there. Don't believe the other reviews! This place is a DUMP!

<Content>Not bad We had just the one night in Florence and the hotel was near the train station. The staff was very helpful but the rooms were just OK.

<Content>Good Value We reserved a small twin room after reading reviews here and Expedia. The room was small but this is what we expected and did not spend much time in the room anyway. Our room was 206 overlooking the Via San. Antonino and the windows were great, quite soundproof keeping out the extensive street noise when we desired. We actually liked having it open during the day listening to the sounds of the market and the street.The location was great. It wasn't in the midst of the touristic chaos and was easy walking distance from the Duomo, Accademia, Uffizi and expecially the train station.My favorite part of this place was the service. Allesandro made just great restaurant recommendations and was even willing to help us with our train reservations....even though he was swamped with other stuff. He never missed on the restaurants....someone commented to me that they probably get a kickback on the recommendations....WHO CARES...it was great food and didn't cost us anything extra.Great value and location....not the lap of luxury but perfect for the common sense traveler who isn't fluent in Italian.

<Content>Great Hotel and fantastic location We spent 8 night at the Hotel Globus and loved it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room had a small balcony whist was nice. The room was spacious on european standards. The breakfasts were good too. The location could not be better, just a short stroll at most main sights, eg Duomo etc. The corridor noise was a little noisy due to the tiled floor but soundproofing between rooms was very good. We would definately stay here again without hesitation.
