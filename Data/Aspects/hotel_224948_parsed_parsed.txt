<Content>Great Place to Stay in Heart of San Francisco We stayed here for a weekend in San Francisco. When we were there (fall 2008), quite a bit of rennovation was still going on in the lobby area so things like the restaurant and lounge were not totally available. However, despite that we really enjoyed our stay here. It seemed to be more of a place for business people. During the weekend we barely saw another person, but once Sunday night rolled around, it was crowded. We had a renovated room, which was stylish and comfortable. We had no complaints at all. Our view from the window was not good, but this didn't bother us. We were there during an unusually warm time and I felt the air conditioner could have worked better. It wasn't bad or unacceptable, but it was really the only non-stellar part of the stay. Since it was in the upper 80s, I doubt this would very often be any kind of issue. One great thing about the room besides the typical hotel amenities was that it had plenty of outlets so we could easily charge all our various electronics. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is totally convenient to the trolley cars and also some bus lines. We didn't have a car at all except our last day and had no issues getting around. This hotel does have somewhat high fees. The wifi was somewhat expensive (maybe $12) and the parking was very expensive ($20+ a day) so I would keep that in mind, but we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone desiring a comfortable and stylish base for their San Francisco trip.

<Content>Great place to stay! We booked the Emerald Bowl package which was fantastic! This included two tickets to the CAL football game and a very nice room. The staff was warm and friendly. We especially want to recognize Carmen who went above her job to make sure we had our questions about the game answered. The hotel bar was very nice, great bartender and waitress, but they do need a happy hour! If one existed, we weren't aware of it. The hotel is near many bars, restaurants, and shopping. We had a great time and will be back!

<Content>Best Vacation in Years From the moment my cab pulled up and I was warmly greeted, I had the idea that this was going to be a very special vacation. Check-in was easy, no fuss, friendly, and efficient. Our room was spacious, welcoming, efficient, and warm, all at the same time. Because we were tired, we ordered dinner in the room. This and breakfast every day in our room were tasty, well-presented, and took very little time to arrive. The robes were warm, towels plentiful, and the shower comfortable for our romantic weekend. The bed was large, yet cozy, the comforter snuggly, and the mattress great for sore backs. Throughout the stay, the staff treated us warmly, and in a dignified manner. There were always little treats available in the lobby, including fruit, cookies, cider, and coffee. We plan to return whenever possible, and make it a Christmas tradition. The location is perfect for shopping and touring.

<Content>Loved the Omni...well it was pretty good anyway I booked through a conference website for $160/night including tax. The location is good, near to Union Square, China Town and the Coit Tower and on a tram line. I was initially not impressed since everything seemed expensive (e.g. $6 bottle of water in the room - I used the tap). Also I didn't bother with breakfast at $20 for continental and $26 for cooked (perfectly good Chinese deli next door).You just need to join Select Guests and not only do you get free internet access (not Wi-fi yet though) but you are also treated to a free 2 morning drinks (e.g. posh tea and grapefruit juice) and a turndown service (which I'd never heard of): you come home to find relaxing music on and ice in the wine cooler and a chocolate mint!Any problems I had were dealt with well (free internet help line) and overall a positive experience. I don't usually like these rather souless posh city hotels, but this was pretty good after early reservations.

<Content>Nice hotel in a good location! This is nice hotel in a good location. Reasonably priced within financial district and short walk to Chinatown. Short distance to public transportation and cab rides are a short distance to tourist attraction. Rooms are clean and staff is friendly.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel in SF Very friendly and knowledgeable staff (from the operator for directions to the bell staff for restaurant recommendations). Room was spacious and beds were incredibly comfortable. Flat screen TVs were a nice luxury. Valet parking was incredibly quick. Lobby entrance was filled with dramatic Christmas decorations by the end of our stay. Will definitely be back.

<Content>Best hotel ever! We stayed here for 3 nights in an upgraded room, and it was heavenly! The bed.. oh my god.. I would love to have one at home, everything was perfect. The friendliness at the reception, the bell boy, door man, the bar... I cannot compliment them enough. We got some excellent dining tips from the lady at the hotel bar, and had one of the best meals I ever had in my life!I forgot my lap top in a taxi, and everyone helped me to get it back. The door man even lent us his mobile phone and sent ut to the bar while we waited for the taxi company to call us back. And, I got the lap top back, how lucky wasn't I???Thank you so much for the best nights I ever had in a hotel, and I travel alot.

<Content>The Omni is beautiful with great accomidations. I would say the front desk staff was very helpful getting us there over the phone. Check-in and check-out was very smooth. Overall they were very helpful and accomidating. Valet was great and they were very prompt both taking and bringing our car.We stayed in a really nicely furnished Suite. The internet was fast and had no problems the entire stay. Two flat screen tvs and a very nice compact stereo. The Room was spotless and the house keeping staff did a great job keeping the room up and helping us with special requests.I will definitly stay at this property again. My compliments to the Management and staff.

<Content>Above  My partner and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco for 8 nights. I knew about this hotel from when I lived in San Francisco and worked in the Financial District. We booked an entire vacation on Hotwire and paid a little more to stay at the Omni only because I'd always wanted to stay there. Little did I know what an experience we were in for.We checked in on Saturday night. Crystal at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a concierge floor room. She was genuinely friendly, professional and outgoing. Check-in was quick and easy.The room was elegantly furnished. The only drawback was that it seemed small. We were there for eight nights and we found that it lacked storage for all of our clothes. I think for a shorter stay, the room would've been absolutely perfect. From the bellman to the front desk attendants to the valets to the doormen to the room service people, the service was nothing less than spectacular. Everyone remembered our names, what room we were in, had our car waiting for us in a timely manner. We had breakfast at Bob's Steak House one morning. The french toast is to die for and the portions are big. Though the food seemed expensive, the portion size made up for the price. The room was appointed with a plasma TV, king size bed with down comforter. We had turn down service nightly with water and fresh fruit waiting for us when we returned from the day out. We had drinks of our choice and newpapers waiting at our door every morning. The hotel was originally a bank that was gutted and rebuilt in early 2000's. It was beautiful on the inside and out. It didn't seem overcrowded at all. As a matter of fact, it seemed nearly empty most of the time we were there. It is located on California Street @ Montgomery, on the California Street Cable Car Line and in the heart of the Financial District. I liked this location because it was out of the way of all of the tourist traps and it was nice to come home at night to a quiet, much more relaxed environment. Though we are planning to move back to San Francisco in the coming year, I do believe that I will stay at the Omni again before we move and I will definitely, definitely suggest it to anyone coming for a visit.

<Content>I LOVE THE OMNI We stayed at the Omni over Labor Day weekend for 3 nights...I had stayed at this hotel before the year before in December, and fell in love with it... From the fresh fruit and refreshing lemonade in the lobby to the nightly chocolate on my pillow. Its all about the details for me and customer service.The Omni delivers. I love the fresh flowers in the lobby,the warm greeting from all staff members, the housekeeper's friendly notes, the rooms...I can go on and on...But I really love where The Omni SF is located. The financial district is bustling during the week, but on the weekends its quiet. The hotel is walking distance from the Ferry Building,Chinatown, and Nob Hill. You could even walk to Union Square. When we went in September, we spent a day in Napa Valley.The concierge helped us book a rental car for delivery at the hotel the next morning.However, when we went to the lobby the car wasnt there.Because it was Labor Day weekend, the rental car company was slammed.We understood and went to go pick up the car.To make a long story short, we ended up waiting 2hours in line, and it ruined the whole day for us.Although it wasnt The Omni's fault, when we returned that night, I informed the concierge and he took care of the valet.Upon returning home, I received the Omni Hotel survey,and let them know about the mishap.I promptly received a response from the hotel's general manager Carmen Serra and she apologized for the inconvenience the rental car company caused us,and refunded the rental car fee back to our credit cars.She also helped me book another stay at the Omni in San Diego for next weekend.I was very satisfied with how she handled the situation...just another reason why I love the Omni! No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but I appreciated their efforts to resolve the issue.

<Content>Great Hotel After a very poor experience at another SanFran Hotel it was a pleasure to check into the Omni.Great hotel and great staff. Service was impeccable throughout and that is the hotels strength. Genuinely warm and helpful staff make a big difference.It could do with decorating I think as its a bit dated now. Its not worn or anything, just could do with bringing up to date. Excellent location, excellent rooms. Bobs Chop House downstairs is great and Town car to airport a blessing.

<Content>Good experience We stayed at The Omni in San Francisco for 3 nights while we went on a wine tour in Sedona. The service was good, the rooms were fine, and it was an overall good experience. I have stayed in nicer hotels, but this was in a good location to sight seeing and shopping. The rooms were quiet and the beds were confortable enough. We did, however eat at the restaurnant downstairs for dinner and breakfast and had some issues. The food was good, but the service was not. Waiters were slightly rude and one night at dinner we had to go find the hostess to be seated. We stood there for over 15 minutes. Across the street there is a stop for the trolley and the bellman was good about helping us hail taxis. One night they even had the hotel car take us to the pier for our alcatraz tour. Overall we had a good experience at this hotel and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Loved the Omni - so friendly! Had a great stay at the Omni. Everyone was so friendly and remembered our names:o) Check in was a breeze.Lovely, spotless hotel room. 2 nice beds and nice size bathroom. Greeted with a bottle of champagne and strawberries dipped in chocolate as it was a birthday celebration - great touch!Housekeeping were never seen but left the room clean and tidy every day and left chocolates by the bed in the evening with the TV on a chill channel.Lex and the staff were always on hand for information, directions / hints and tips.Debora was also a star performer.Darryl the doorman was great - always took an interest in what we were doing and where we had been. Made suggestions of places to go to and places to avoid. Always very friendly and made us feel special. It made the hotel a welcome sight after being out all day.The hotel was in a great location - close to everything, walk to Union Square, Ferry Building, we walked to Pier 39 and Ghiradelli Square, cable cars run past the front door etc. I wasn't too keen on the Pier 39 location - good to visit and see the sealions and found there were a lot of homeless people around Union Square area so this suited us just fine.Can't comment on the food in the hotel as we never ate there. Noah's do a great bagel in the morning - just along from the cable car turnaround.If I return to San Francisco - I'd stay here again like a flash!

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed 3 nights on last leg of our honeymoon from Hawaii. Hotel was clean, comforatable, central location  24 hr room service. All staff are very friendly...from the front desk to housekeeping leaving personal thank you notes from the tip we left in the room for her. Lex, the concierge is very knowledgable and helpful. They even gave us a late check out to 5pm no charge because we had a late flight. Its not a huge hotel with all the ammenities such as pool/spa, but its everything we needed. Bob's steak house which is attached to the hotel was very good...expensive, but good. We dined at both the restaurant as well as the bar. I signed up on Omni's website to be a member...well worth it...we received free coffee, juice, and newspaper every morning. Cable car is out front of the hotel and easy to get anywhere from this location. We would definetly stay here again.

<Content>Omni, Great Hotel! Stayed at the Omni from October 24th to October 29th. We arrived very late on the 24th and were thrilled at the quick and easy way the whole check-in process was handled. Everyone we came in contact with were very happy and willing to help you in any way they could. Need to make a reservation for dinner, day trip, tour? All you had to do was ask the people at the front desk and they were very happy to provide all the information you might want and and make the arrangements for you. Had a partial bay view room, very nice size, perfect size bathroom didn't have any complaints about that at all. The hotel is in walking distance to the ferries that will take you over to Sausalito. Union Square, and Chinatown are within walking distance too. If you needed to catch a cab all you had to do was ask one of the doormen and you had one in a flash. There are always town cars out front too if you prefer a little more plush ride somewhere, not much more expensive than a cab and a lot nicer. I have to say I don't know what anyone would have to complain about when staying at this hotel. Would certainly stay here again!

<Content>Love this place! This place has quickly become my hotel of choice in San Francisco. It's a wonderful location, and the staff is exceptional, top to bottom. From the start of your stay and your dealings with the front desk, through check-out and having the door man hail a cab, all in all you're treated with great care and attention to detail. Highly recommended!

<Content>OMG!!!! It was just perfect Service, service, service!!! It was phenomenal. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. It was so very nice to be treated to such wonderful service. Another wonderful recommendation from previous Trip Advisor guests and one that I will highly recommend to others. We were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and when we got to the hotel, our room had been upgraded and I was handed a long stem red rose. Later on that night we received complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries that were left in our room.The concierge new perfect spots for us to try in our afternoon travel on foot. We were close enough to walk down to the warf and enjoy the open air market Tons to see and do we enjoyed every minute!

<Content>Pleasant Stay The Omni was where we stayed for the first few nights of our honeymoon and it was lovely- but it wasn't take your breath away stuff.The lobby is beautiful, with free starbucks coffee in the morning and the concierge is very helpful.The rooms- i think we had a deluxe- are nice but a bit dated in style and small. The bathrobes they give you are amazing however.They gave us chocolate dipped strawberries and champagne to greet us which was nice.The location is good aswell, particularly if you like chinese food and want to be near china town.I couldn't really fault the Omni- but as you can probably tell from the tone of my review- i'm not overly excited about it either!

<Content>Absolutely Fine - but not didn't set the world on fire Lovely hotel that is period USA - well situated in downtown San Fran, all staff without exception were excellent and very helpful. Gym facilities good and clean.The hotel has 1 bar which is more like a small TV longe and a steak resturant that is like a traditional old style steak house. Meat was of an excellent quality and cut but the Chef did a weird thing with a 8 inch whole carrot that was stuck in the middle of the plate........???? Really not sure what was going on there !This place is absolutely fine and ideal for down town shopping location, im quite suprised it makes the top 6 in the trailfinders list but hey ho !

<Content>More like Oh my Booked Omni on Trip Advisor recommendation during busy/expensive period in San Fran. Yes, clean, quiet,comfortable,convenient for Union Square. But bland. Creepy handwritten messages from Faye in housekeeping everyday, assumed angling for tip but maybe management think this is being welcoming? Concierge helpful but a bit like a robot on speed (no doubt having to say the same things day in and out)Strange check in lady did not listen that we wanted to split the bill ; intolerable male check out desk guy lectured us when we complained that Omni had deducted whole amount from my card BEFORE we had checked out. Told us that in 30yrs of the hospitality industry he had never heard of guests paying when checking out. Funny that, the 4 Seasons in Vegas we stayed at afterwards, had no problem! (nor the many hotels we stay in internationally)We stayed in the Orchard a few days later; definitely prefer for service.

<Content>Omni is very nice.... We spent 10 nights at the Omni in September and had a fantastic time. The hotel is convenietly located in the Financial district within walking distance of Union Square, Fishermans Warf etc. Our room on the 5th floor did not have a great view but was very quiet and well worth sacrificing the view for. The rooms are in excellent condition, and the maid service is first class. The staff are very helpul and courteous at all times, ensuring our stay went without a hitch. The only small complaint we have is that the one and only bar in the hotel (Bobs bar) is very small and gets very crowded from approx 5pm onwards, and getting a seat was almost impossible around those times. However it is no reason not to stay here. When we first arrived after our lengthy journey from Scotland, we were informed that our room (booked and paid for 8 months previousley) had been cancelled by Octopus travel who we had booked the room through. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful in rectifying the situation.San Francisco is well worth a visit and has plenty to offer for all. We would recommend visiting Alcatraz and taking the coach tour of the city, however book your Alcatraz tickets online as far in advance as possible to ensure you get the dates you require. We also hired bikes from Blazing Saddles and rode over the Golden Gate bridge to Tiburon via Sausilto. This is a fantastic way to see the bridge and surrounding area (weather allowing). Sausilto is a must see when you are there and can be accessed by Ferry if you prefer not to bike it, dining is recommeded at Angelino's while you are there. We also took a wine tour to Napa valley etc and would recommend this trip, with plenty of samples included in the day ensuring the hoilday spirit was flowing. Union square is packed with all the usual big name shops, but visit the hippy district at upper Haight street for some of the funkiest shops available. We visited the zoo but found it to be dated and shabby with many of the animals not available to view. Of course you must take a ride on a tram while you are there, we would advise getting a day pass for 11 bucks, which allows you to hop on and off all day at your leisure. Finally Lombard St aka the most crookidest street in the world is worth a look with camera in hand.We had 2 days of cloud followed by 8 days of glorious sunshine while we we there.Book it up, you will enjoy!!!!

<Content>Excellent hotel, Great location, Good Value! Based on reviews about this hotel, we decided to stay here the weekend of October 3rd to attend a wedding in the city. We were just as pleased with the hotel as the recent reviews and high ranking indicate.The Front Desk and Concierge were very pleasant and always willing to assist with questions. We had a great room with a very nice city view. Housekeeping was very detailed and the room was impeccably clean. I thought a very nice touch/detail was a personalized handwritten note from our housekeeper welcoming us. You dont see that too often.We did room service on Friday night and ordered off of the Bob's Steakhouse menu, which is the hotel's restaurant in the lobby. The food was awesome! The filet was so tender and by far the best baked potatoe and candied carrot I have ever had! The delivery was right on time, the food was hot and the server was very friendly. I travel alot for business and I find Room Service to be very poor even in the best hotels. Not here. They did a great job!They gym at this hotel is very nice with great cardio and weight machines. Little details like complimentary bottled water and a huge basket of fresh fruit are not forgotten.The location was very convenient and the price we paid was a bargain for the value and in comparison to most of the other hotels in the area since we shopped around before making our reservation. I highly recommned this hotel!

<Content>Omni Very Nice Hotel We stayed at the Omni for 3 nights at the end of our Alaskan cruise. First impressions were great door men and bell boys and reception very helpful check in was quick and easy, and although we arrived early our room was ready.The lobby is very grand with a classy feel, we ate in the restaurant once for breakfast which was nicely presented although where service is concerned they seemed to focus more time on the business people than the people on vacation we didn't get as much attention as the business people.Our room was nice although we had a few problems phone would not stop beeping and was very loud and annoying,safe was broken and so was the plug in the sink. We reported these faults to the front desk straight away and these faults were dealt with immediatey. When I expressed my disspointment with the faults in our room Richard on the front desk was very apologetic but was unable to move us as the hotel was full due to the Oracle convention being in town but that he would report our concerns to his manager. That evening when we got back to our room there was a letter of apology and a free breakfast voucher which was a nice touch. Our room was spacious with a large flat screen t.v and large comfortable bed the bathroom was again very spacious and very clean.Its the small touches in this hotel that make your stay memorable the turn down service is exellent along with the usual chocolates ou also get a small card informing you what the weather will be like the following day. The location of the Omni is o.k in the financial district so not much around in the 1st few blocks but Union square in only a 15/20 min walk away but a taxi is necessary to Fishrmans Wharf which will cost just under $10.Despite the faults in our room on arrival the Omni is a very classy hotel and would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Omni San Fran - Great Hotel We stayed at the Omni for 4 nights at the tail-end of our honeymoon - it was perfectly suitable. I great base for tourists. Convenient for the cable car, bus, China Town, North Beach etc. Felt safe walking around at night. The room was delightful - clean and tastefully decorated, falt screen TV, light and airy feel. Nice big bathroom. Robs Steak House was quite nice, although a bit pricey. They did give us free dessert when we mentioned we were on honeymoon, which was a nice touch.Receptionists were generally very helpful, as were the doormen.

<Content>Great hotel for a vacation Good location - is on a cable car run, is near the business district which I felt it is a safe area and is also walkable to say Union Square for breakfast. The service is great - Joey Nubla made reservations at restaurants and was always pleasant and helpful. Cabs were hailed on my behalf etc. by the doormen. The rooms are large, and clean - beds are turned down each evening with a chocolate left, and TV set to a chill out channel. Bathrooms are good and clean, with a great shower and plenty of clean towels. Only thing missing are complimentary slippers - a small point! I was out before breakfast started on tourist trips but coffee is available in take out cups at reception which is just perfect.Would definitely recommend to business and holiday travellers alike, and if I were to return would definitely stay here!

<Content>Another Awesome Stay It is no wonder that this hotel won the Best Hotel for Service and the Best Luxury Hotel in 2008! I stayed here a few times before and travel to SFO frequently. This hotel is CONSISTENTLY GREAT in both service, cleanliness and dining/room service. The Front Desk and Concierge are very knowledgeable and friendly. You cannot stand in the lobby without them greeting you and sincerely wanting to assist. They recommended some wonderful restaurants. BTW, the hotels restaurant, Bob's Steakhouse, is awesome in intself. One of the best steaks I ever had. My wife had the salmon which was equally as good.I was there on business during the week and extended my stay for the weekend so my wife could meet me. I upgraded to a lovely two room King bedded corner suite. The room was clean, the housekeeping staff is very efficient and eager to please by leaving extra coffee and cream after I asked her for it on my first morning. A great marble bath with wonderful amenities too.The location of the hotel is central to all and the cable car runs right in front of the hotel. A very nice size gym too that I used each day.I will continue to stay at the Omni for both business and pleasure. You cannot beat the hotel and it is an awesome value given the service, location and rooms.

<Content>Billing issue We had a pretty good stay. They staff was nice and efficient. The location was good for us. It seem a bit expensive. When I got come I found they charged us twice for a room (on a different credit card that we used to authorize the room). I called and they fixed the probblem but it was an upsetting inconvenience and lowered my perception of the chain. It was my first time at an Omni. If they'd offered to comp us a night or something I probably would have given them five stars.The bigger concern is that they could not find the record of making the incorrect charge. I had to have my bank confirm it for them. This makes me worry overall about thier IT infrastructure abiity to charge guest accurately.

<Content>Efficient but not great value We stayed at this hotel at the end of a trip travelling around California. When we started our trip we stayed at the excellent Donatello, but unfortunately they had no rooms available when we returned to the city. The Omni was expensive and although it did everything it is meant to do it did it without any soul. We booked through Priceline a room with two double beds. On arrival Reception said that as this was booked through a third party it could not be guaranteed and so we had to have a bed made up for our daughter. I have no criticisms of the room, apart perhaps that everything being a bit too frilly - not really our style. I was irritated to have to pay $10 for access to the hotel wifi - why do the cheaper hotels and motels provide this free and the more expensive hotels charge for this?The breakfast was over formal and as their is no buffet we ordered dishes that were OK, but extremely over priced. The staff were efficient and the doorman friendly, but I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Wedding Wonderland We were very pickey about where we would stay for our wedding celebration. The Omni exceed all expectations. The front desk was fabulous--all concierge staff which is very smart. But, one person was extra special--Lex. He even met us at city hall as we were going in to be married to give us a very touching, hand-written note honoring our momentous occasion. Yes, he was off the clock, on his own time. While the entire facility was wonderful, including the upgrade to a suite, excellent room service, picnic lunch for the limo, contact for flower bouquet, etc.,--it is the PEOPLE that make this hotel truly special. We are already making plans to return for our first anniversary!

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great staff! Beautiful lobby - I was a little concerned when we arrived because I had booked a discounted rate through an online booking site and thought we might get an inferior room - but to my delight, we got a great room. The concierge was awsome, with details about restaurants (reasonably priced too!) and a great place for a drink with a view across the street. We were there on a Saturday when the hotel arranges a free 2 hr.morning walk with local historians. (different people each week) The hotel is located on the California cable car route (the front desk can sell you 1,3 or 5 day passes which cover all public transit and are a great value). Don't miss the cable car museum - free and really interesting - for kids from 1 to 100! Don't go for breakfast at the hotel - unless you want to pay $25 for bacon and eggs and don't drink the bottled water in the room - it had a price tag of $6.99 on it! Go to the fitness room where you can pick up a small bottle for free that fits nicely into your handbag! Also they have fresh fruit in the lobby - and if not there, then in the fitness room again! We would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>just wonderful -- cannot recommend highly enough Our experience at this hotel has been great.We arrived around 11 am on a Saturday and were able to check in early. The room was large and clean. (We had two double beds, a table, a large dresser with a flat screen TV inside), a comfortable bathroom with really high ceilings. In the evening, the room was turned down with chocolates placed next to the bed, together with a personal note from housekeeping. We are Select Guest members, so we got free breakfast drinks and newspaper delivered to the room. Everyone we encountered has been nothing but pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. The hotel has fresh fruit and very tasty lemonade in the lobby in the afternoon. One of the nights, when my fiance and I were coming in, the concierge presented me with a beautiful red rose (my fiance did not order one, this is just a completely random, nice gesture -- many thanks to Omni for that!). The lobby is good size and beautifully furnished. The location is convenient. We had a great time and are sad to be leaving tomorrow morning.

<Content>Formal corporate america Don't get us wrong for an okay hotel experience (desk staff and porters really good) but it was an impersonal space with no coffee making facilities in the room and a charge of $1.98 if you drank the bottle of mineral water (one third of a liter) that was available, you were also charged if you had the temerity to use the starch that was perched above the ironing board....for a large hotel chain pretty shoddy practice....If you don't mind being in with corporate USA (terrible fashion sense!) this is the place for you. If on the other hand you want a funky experience look elsewhere.....very disappointed.For the price it does not represent good value for money.

<Content>Beauitful Hotel This hotel was absolutly beauitful! We stayed here over the 4th of July weekend and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location, we were able to walk everywhere only having to take a cab once or twice. The service was phenominal, and I loved how room service happened in the afternoon instead of the early morning hours. The only down side was that when we needed to print out our tickets for a cruise they charged an insane amount of money to log onto the internet and use their printer (I believe it was $10 for just a few minutes and one sheet of paper!). All in all we would definatly stay here again!

<Content>Don't stay here This hotel does not deserve to be voted number 1 hotel in san francisco. I stayed in 2 hotels in san francisco and this one was much the poorer of the 2, the other hotel was the intercontental. This was also twice the price of the intercontenental, and i booked on the recomendation of tripadvisor. (a mistake!!!!!!!) The room was on the fifth floor facing a very busy road and was very noisy. The room was small and shabby. the toilet flooded the first night. The dinner in the restaurant was overpriced and over cooked. Not a hotel to return to.

<Content>Great hotel, great service I stayed at the San Francisco Omni twice during my 11 day trip to N. California. I have never stayed at an Omni, even though I travel 5-7 times a year. I loved this hotel, specifically because of its superb service. When traveling for pleasure I prefer BB because of the hospitality, local flavor, attention to service. I have to say that the folks at this Omni treated me and my wife as if we were at their home. We were always graciously greeted by the doorman, front desk, and concierge....they actually remembered us. It is such a surprise to get this level of attention in such a big city, in the heart of the financial district.The rooms were very, very clean. As I was there twice during my trip I was able to compare 2 different room types. Both times, the rooms were impeccably clean. All of the amenities you would expect for a business hotel are available. The hotel is located very close to the Ferry building and Chinatown. Being located in the financial district makes the hotel close to San Francisco's excellent restaurants including, Aqua and Perbacco. We ate at Perbacco and would recommend to anyone.We used the concierge services extensively and they were always courteous, quick, and thorough. It just wasn't the concierge that helped us. Everyone in the hotel goes out of their way to help. The lady that checked-us in, Crystal, was superb!!!They made a number of reservations for us and provided excellent recommendations.It's not close to the touristy areas near Fisherman's Wharf, but I wasn't looking to be in the heart of a tourist haven. If you are looking for a great hotel, with excellent service that makes you feel like you are at home this is the place to be. I will definitely be coming back to this hotel.

<Content>What makes this hotel so great is the staff, amenities and location Our family stayed at the Omni for a week during a vacation to San Francisco in August 2008. The Omni is very well managed and their staff top notch. The concierge, the front desk staff, housekeeping, security and Darryl (the Omni's very cool doorman who helped us secure transportation from the Outer Lands concert at Golden Gate Park to avoid the crowds) are pleasant, responsive and knowledgeable.We had a wonderful time in San Francisco and the folks at the Omni played a huge role in making it so pleasant.

<Content>Outstanding in every way! We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Omni. It was wonderful in every way. We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, a big birthday, and our daughter's graduation from law school. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful suite and immediately after checking we were presented with a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and roses! The hotel itself is lovely. Old world European look in the lobby, but very comfortable and updated rooms with modern amenities. Perfect location at the edge of the financial district (not overrun with tourists) but close to Chinatown and Union Square. The cable car is right outside the front door. But the best part of the experience at this hotel was the people!Everyone at the front desk was so helpful ( they even greeted me the next morning by my name); the Concierge Lex was an encyclopedia of information about special places to eat, visit etc and would sprinkle his recommendations with personal anecdotes; the bellman Ramon would often strike up a conversation and always ask about our day. This is a special hotel and made our celebration even more special.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location We stayed at the Omni in July this year. It was our first trip to San Francisco, so we weren't sure of which area to stay in, but the Omni turned out to be perfectly located for us. It's in the Financial District, so it's quiet at night, but we felt perfectly safe walking there after dark. It's also on the cable-car line, within easy walking distance of Chinatown and the Ferry Building and if you don't mind walking a bit further, you can easily walk to the Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas from here. The hotel itself is lovely and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. If I had to pick one thing to fault the room on, it would be the fixed-head shower. I didn't have a particular problem with it, but it was just ok - investing a little money in the shower would really bring it up to the standard of the rest of the accommodation. Staff at the Omni were very friendly and helpful, from check-in, where they offered to help us book any attractions we wanted to see, room service bending over backwards to make us happy when there was a slight problem with our order, the concierge recommending places to eat, right through to the doorman offering us the hotel car when we were leaving for the airport (at only $5 more than the taxi fare, this was a nice option). In addition, when we had an issue with the guests in the adjoining room holding an impromptu party late one night, hotel security dealt with it very quickly.We joined the Select Guest program online for free and this entitled us to complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juice every morning, as well as complimentary WiFi access and a daily newspaper. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant, which was somewhat expensive, but excellent quality and really tasty. There was complimentary fresh fruit (peaches, apricots, plums etc, not just standard apples) and juice or iced tea in the lobby every afternoon, which was nice when returning from sightseeing before going out to dinner. And the gym provided complimentary bottled water and apples and bananas too.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely return if we are ever in San Francisco again!

<Content>Nice, but not a wow This is the second time I have stayed at the Omni, both on business. The Omni is a nice 4 star hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are of average size, but quite adequate. The furnishings are in good condition except for the carpet which is very tired and in need of replacing. The worn state of the carpet really detracts from the rest of the room. The internet connection, although it uses a wire, was fast and reliable ($10/day). The staff was very friendly and helpful. For example, they set up transportation for me on multiple days without a hitch. The hotel food is only average in quality, but very expensive. The hotel is located not far from anything, but not close to anything either; a geographical compromise. I timed the walk to Union Square at 15 minutes via Montgomery, hang a right at Post (note this way is flat, no hills). San Francisco hotels are very expensive for what you get. The Omni is better than both nearby Hyatts. I would stay there again, but will likely try another hotel on my next visit.

<Content>Living Large In San Francisco! Giving this hotel 5 stars is easy with the type of service they deliver! I am a believer!I pulled up after a night at the newly finished J.W. Marriott hotel in Union Square, bad planning on my part. I was denied late check out and feeling a little green; I thought I would take my chances on an early check-in at the Omni. Having booked through Travelocity, my hopes were not high. I was greeted by the extremely efficient and professional Evelyn. She was kind, sympathetic and sincere. I was not a lesser human being for booking a discount room from an online service, hurray! I was feeling better. Evelyn clicked away on her keyboard and had me in a room within 10 minutes, my day was turning around. Enter Fernando, the very pleasant and chatty bellman that seemed to know everyone. He whisked my luggage away and we had a nice conversation. I arrived in the simple, yet elegant room to find a handwritten note from the housekeeper, Suyuak. I am a sucker for the personal touch. Slipping into a comfortable robe provided by the hotel, I decided to order room service, a Kobe burger would surely bring me around. The burger arrived and it was delicious! The meat was lightly spiced with a hint of pepper and the melted cheddar was just right! The fries were lightly spiced and delicious too. My high school reunion was 5 hours away and I was starting to feel human again. After a nice nap on the comfortable bed it was time to shower and head out for the evening. At the end of a long night, I decided to have a couple of classmates over to continue the reminiscing. I called over from the Sir Francis Drake where the reunion took place and asked room service to send a cart of refreshments up to my room. 30 minutes later when we all arrived, a beautiful cart with stemware, refreshments and snacks was waiting for us. Two thumbs up for Ms. Joanne, the goddess of In Room Dining that was running the floor solo and made this all happen. Mind you it was the manager the next day that told me Ms. Joanne had been alone, Ms. Joanne never complained or muttered a word. She made it all seem effortless. When it was time to turn in, I was so happy to have a minty treat on my pillow and turn down service. Most hotels in the four star genre have done away with this simple pleasure, it was a real treat to see my sheets folded down.When I walked up to the counter to check out the following day, I couldn't wait to shower the staff with praise. Crystal was checking me out and before she had the chance to ask, I blurted out I love this hotel! Crystal proceeded to check me out with the utmost efficiency and showered my with savings passes for Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and Macy's. What a smart move! Now I have to go back and book a room for a shopping weekend! All around the staff were magnificent, the hotel was well maintained and aesthetically pleasing, and I left in a really good mood!In the future I will book directly through the hotel and pay the higher price. I don't want to risk ending up at another hotel!

<Content>wonderful omni We had the pleasure of 3 nights at The Omni with our family of 4 including 2 teenage girls one of whom uses a wheelchair. The staff at the Omni could not have been more helpful and friendly and although there were not many families that we could see staying I highly recommend this place to families looking for an up market experience. Milk and cookies were delivered every night for our girls and every time we passed through the lobby they returned with red roses, a toy cable car, chocolates, postcards, an unused cable car pass left by a previous guest, and best of all a big smile. The service was quite simply fantastic and very personal. I must give a special mention to Lex the conciege who was great and even helped us when he saw us looking at the map when he was off duty and we were shopping.I would recommend this hotel to anyone - it won't disappoint. The location was quiet and yet within reasonable, relatively flat walking distance of everything we needed.

<Content>Terrific Stay My family of six recently spent two wonderful nights at the Omni San Francisco. The Omni was our last stop on a two week long family vacation. We enjoyed our stay immensely. We loved the location as well as the terrific service we received at the Omni. At first I regretted my decision not to stay in the Fishermen's Wharf area but I came to find the Omni's location to be the perfect spot to explore the whole city. We walked as well as rode the cable cars (there is a stop right in front of the hotel) as well as the F Line street cars to get around. I highly recommend the Omni.

<Content>Excellent Stay at the Omni All of the prior reviews are true - the Omni is excellent. It may have been the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in - definitely in the top two. We stayed for two nights at the end of July. We had a 15th floor room with a partial view of the city. The rate we paid included valet parking for each night, normally an additional $48 per night charge. The room was large and very clean. The bathroom had a double sink with a very large countertop.The hotel was very convenient to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. The entrance to Chinatown was only a short walk from the hotel and the cable car route to Fisherman's Wharf stopped right in front of the hotel. Our rental car was parked on Friday afternoon and we did not retrieve it until we left on Sunday.The service had the hotel was exemplary. Each employee we encountered was very friendly and helpful. The hotel concierge gave us a great overview of the area and the doormen provided excellent dining tips.As members of Omni's Select Guest program, we were treated with complimentary beverage service each morning, consisting of a pot of coffee and tea and a choice of several fruit juices, along with a choice of three newspapers. This service was very prompt - we requested 8:00 each morning, and the beverages arrived by 7:30. This service allowed us to enjoy our coffee and tea and newspaper before heading out to breakfast. Two excellent breakfast locations within walking distance were Lori's Diner and Sears' Fine Food.As several other reviewers mentioned, there is free bottled water and fruits available in the 3rd floor Fitness Center.One local feature not to be missed is the lounge located on the 52nd floor of the Bank of America building, located across the street from the Omni. The nighttime view of the city through the lounge's wall of windows was spectacular.

<Content>Excellent Service My wife and I stayed at the Omni as part of an anniversary trip through California.When we checked in late on Saturday night the person at the front desk acted as though they could not be bothered. She spoke in half sentences, didn't provide any information and just said sign here and here are your keys - and we were the only ones checking in.The next morning we talked to Monica at the front desk about our experience and she could not have been better. She was understanding, apologized and immediately asked what she could do to make it better (she sent up champagne and strawberries and also gave us vouchers for breakfast.) But more importantly she mades us feel like we were the only ones staying at the hotel- like our personal satisfaction was the most important thing.Everybody at the Omni (with the execption of the woman at check-in) was extraordinarily pleasant and helpful. The rooms were nice and the location was ideal. We'll be back for sure.

<Content>Very Nice We stayed at the Omni SF, for four nights, in a standard room. Very clean, well furnished and we were very happy. It is clear by the fact that most of the other guests were in suits, it is more for the business person, but although we did feel out of place in our shorts and t-shirts, we were made to feel very welcome by the very friendly staff. The restaurant was over priced for the food, in my view. Better to eat out. Overall, a great stay, and a great location, with a Cable Car route right outside.

<Content>Our stay at the Omni was great! My best friend and I stayed 10 days at the San Fran Omni in late April 2008. It is a great hotel. It was very clean, the room was a nice size, bathroom was large, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. There was internet available in the lobby for a fee. In the future, I will always look for an Omni hotel to stay at, especially when in a large city. It has a restaurant and a separate bar/grill also. The restaurant served huge portions, everything was cooked to perfection, we ate there twice during our stay. The bar/grill was nice also, nice menu selections, such as crab tacos (yum), burgers, sliced steak. It is in the financial district and on the cable car line also. Close to Chinatown. We also ate at Houston's, across from the Ferry Building, excellent, especially the ribs, it was pricey but well worth it. The highlights of the trip for us were Alcatraz tour, Napa Wine-tasting tour, and Monterey-Carmel tour.

<Content>Loved it! Fabulous Anniversary!!!! Everything was perfect from the time I made my reservations until the day we left. We made reservations to celebrate our anniversary and do a quick in-town getaway. The Omni is located in the financial district, but is close to many great neighborhoods. We were able to walk to the Embarcadero, North Beach, and Chinatown. It is also really close to public transportation, including BART and the Cable Car (for real tourists).Originally I was going to just spend one night in a suite, but the reservationist suggested that since we were coming for our anniversary, we consider their Hearts in San Francisco package. We decided to do this instead for 2 nights. It included a deluxe room with King bed, champagne and chocolates in the evening, and breakfast either at the restaurant on site or served in your room.I called ahead to see if they had any suggestions for a special anniversary dinner and they made us reservations at Aqua. We checked in online and simply had to pick up our keys and go straight to our room upon arrival. When we got to the room, housekeeping had put a heart of rose petals on our bed. Within 20 minutes our champagne and chocolates arrived. There was also a reminder letter with our key to give us directions to the restaurant which is only 2 blocks away. I also called for suggestions of somewhere to go after dinner and was given the perfect spot at the Bubble Lounge.The next day was just as wonderful and with the same treatment of the room the next night was completely romantic. Everyone at this hotel is friendly and helpful. It all started with Joey Nubla (concierge), to Darrell at the front door, to our bellmen Adam and Joey, our fabulous housekeeper Maria, the room service staff and John and Justin at the front desk. Thank you all for giving us the perfect getaway for our anniversary!

<Content>Absolutely great Brilliant location near Chinatown, very friendly staff, beautiful and tasteful room. Excellent breakfast! We felt at home right from the start and would certainly return. A Chinese couple next to us just got married and half of their party came with them to celebrate an after party in the middle of the night. Luckily this did not take too long. We loved the handwritten note of the housekeeping lady, thanking us for giving her the opportunity to clean our room. It's typical to this place.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We stayed at the Omni Hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of July. After a 10 hour flight and 8 hours time difference, it was the perfect place to retreat to.We had previously stayed at the Omni Parker House Hotel in Boston, which exceeded our expectations, so after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to book the Omni San Francisco.The two adjoining rooms we stayed in were spacious, very clean and comfortable; the hotel staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming and the restaurant is to be recommended, although there are plenty of restaurants etc within walking distance.Would definitely stay at this hotel in future.

<Content>Poor Experience I stayed here for 3 nights in July 07 for a business trip so a little late in posting feedback but thought I should still contribute.OVERALLI completely failed to see why this hotel is rated so highly. The location and checkin were good but everything else from the lobby, room and broadband were poor. I cannot recommend this hotel especially with other good options nearby. In particular, the Mandarin Oriental is nearby and is often priced competitively which means you'll be paying similar money to the Omni but for a VASTLY superior hotel.Let me emphasize that I do not feel the Omni is bad. The problem is that it is just ok and that there are options.GOODFast checkin. Pleasant staff. Decent location.BADSmall room. Front lobby unimpressive. Broadband speeds slow.

<Content>Good location, excellent service, comfortable rooms Excellent location in financial district, an easy walk to North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square, SFMOMA, BART, etc. Beautiful lobby. Truly outstanding service with gracious, well trained staff. Room was large with extra room for a writing desk and a good sized sitting chair. Bathroom was clean, modern, and recently remodeled. High-quality mattress on the bed; room had a small flat screen TV (37 inch?). Decoration is in a traditional style. Breakfast in downstairs restaurant was OK, but nothing special, for example the OJ was not fresh. Only real complaint was the carpet in the room was a little tired - not disgusting - but no longer new and starting to show its age.

<Content>We Love The Omni The Omni San Francisco staff made me smile every day of our stay in June. Our check in was great. My husband mentioned that we were celebrating our 30th wedding aniversary (15 years a piece) to Justin Seeto, the Guest Services Manager. Although he was not able to upgrade our room that night, the following afternoon we were moved to a lovely upgrade with a good bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. That is when I really started smiling! Lex ,at the concierge desk was delightful. He took time with us to find out our interests before making some great recommendations for dining and entertainment. If you haven't done it the Alcatraz cruise is a must. We loved Golden Gate park with the De Young museum and the Tea Gardens. A short walk from there is Haight Asbury, interesting. Good restaurant, Cha Cha Cha, Caribean tapas. We loved Mamacita, gormet Mexican and the Boulevard is a must do. We were lucky enough to catch the Frida Kalo exhibit at SFMOMA which we also loved.I digress, in short everyone we encountered at the Omni was friendly, personable and seemed to be enjoying making guests happy. The dorrmen were sweethearts, with a cold water in hand on an uncharacteristically warm summer day, the housekeepers were terrific and I had a great chat with a maintenance guy on the elevator. They all made a difference and made our stay at the Omni an absolute delight. Can't wait to return.

<Content>I'll be back! From the moment the front door was opened on our way in to check in to the time the front door was opened on our way after check out, my girlfriend and I were treated like royalty at the Omni. I've been to San Francisco many times and the Omni is the BEST hotel I've stayed in. The service is exquisite. Everyone from the doorman to the front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff is exceptionally friendly, always upbeat, and very helpful. The hotel itself is very clean, elegant, and conveniently located close to Chinatown, North Beach, and the Financial District. The California Street Cable Car line runs past the hotel's front door, and the BART station is five blocks away. The room was large, clean, and well maintained. There was a nice flat screen TV and DVD player in our upgraded signature room, though not every room may be equipped similarly. Every morning our housekeeper would leave us a handwritten note wishing us a pleasant day. We'd write her back telling her of our travel adventures and leave her a well-deserved tip for her service. She even recommended a great place to try authentic dim sum! Staying at the Omni was definitely the key to a most enjoyable San Francisco adventure! I'll be back to San Francisco soon and, without a doubt, will be staying at the Omni again!

<Content>Good hotel in central location We have stayed in the Omni San Francisco before so it was the natural choice for a return visit. The staff in general were helpful particularly the door men - it is nice to get the door opened for you! We had a few probs - the keys issued to our party did not open the doors and we were left standing on the corridor with our luggage whist the security checked our ID again before they could re-issue our cards - no proper apology from the reception desk as I would have expected. Also we had one of our rooms booked for three but only one king bed !- they sent up a rollaway - at no extra charge - I would hope so as we had paid for 3 people!We had booked a suite and a bedroom and they put us in the corner suite area which was very handy - suite was quite spacious - flowers in bathroom and fruit were supplied - nice touch. Beware double beds are tiny and really do not fit 2 people. Thet now charge for use of their internet business room - so take your laptop - it is free for 'select guests ' in the lobby - you can print airline boarding passes for free for a restricted number of airlines - but would be better if they had access to international ones as well! Overall a nice hotel - though like many hotels in San francisco it is quite pricey - SF hotels are pricier than NYC or Boston Breakfast is expensive for what you get - much better value in the Omni in Boston! - which is hard to beat for breakfast!

<Content>loved the omni The omni was a great location. The hotel was nice, with nice rooms. What made the stay so great was the service. All the staff were really grade a from beginning to end. The things I didn't like was that the room was very small, with only two double beds, not queen. The food prices were very high, even for san francisco, so eating at the hotel was not an option. Would have been convenient to eat at hotel for breakfast.

<Content>I can see why the Omni is rated so high. My wife and I stayed there at the end of June then again in early July while vacationing in San Francisco. The service was excellent, from the check in to the doorman. Everyone makes you feel very welcome. The beds are very comfortable with large plush pillows. The bathroom are immaculate and clean. The location is central to everything, you can walk to Union Square, North Beach, Little Italy, the Bart (subway) in no time. I would definitely recommend the Omni to anyone and everyone.

<Content>10 in all areas This was one of the most enjoyable hotel experiences I have had in years. The hotel was immaculate and the staff was more then accomodating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the San Francisco area.

<Content>Omni was fabulous We stayed at the Omni over the 4th of July weekend (got a great rate at $169 a night)! We enjoyed everything about our stay there. From the doormen who were super, to the front desk staff and everyone in between--fabulous service. We liked the fact that it was not in the middle of everything, because San Francisco was crazy over that weekend! The financial district is very quiet on weekends, which, like another poster said, we liked. We were at the end of a 10 day trip out west and thought the Omni was the best hotel we stayed at, and we stayed at nice hotels! We checked in early, no problem, and when we were leaving they held our luggage all day because our flight wasn't until 10:00 that night. We loved all the personal touches and luxurious bedding and robes! As an added tip, we joined their hotel rewards program when making the reservations (it's free to join) and that got us extra perks like coffee/juice/paper in the morning, get fit kit and the room and a few more things. I would recommend this!This was our first visit at an Omni hotel and would look for an Omni property again when traveling.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, great location! I just spent two nights at the Omni in San Francisco at the end of a 10-day trip to various California sites. We had three couples in our party. The hotel is beautifully decorated, had conscientious staff, great sheets. It's location is two blocks from Chinatown in the Financial District, and the street car runs right in front of the hotel. We needed quick transportation one evening in order to make our Alcatraz Tour, and the doorman provided two town cars for our party and we only had to tip the drivers. Because of its location, our 9th floor room overlooked the top of the Wells Fargo Bank and a Subway shop.There is a complimentary coffee maker in the room and a daily newspaper. We were very disappointed to be charged $10 a day for wireless internet access, since every other hotel we had stayed at in California provided this service for free.There is no parking. Valet parking service provided by the hotel is $48 a day plus tipping the driver! There is St. Mary's Parking Garage one block away with the awesome rate of $32 a day! The phone in the bathroom, lighted closet, and nightly turn-down service was nice.

<Content>Good 4-star hotel in a great location We stayed at the Omni for 3 nights. Our room was available when we checked in at noon and we had a late check-out at 2pm. The check-in staff are friendly and very prompt. The room is a good size, the bed is comfortable, and the amenities are good. The decor is a bit tired, but clean and tidy. Wi-fi is $9.95 for 24 hours. There is a turndown service every evening, which is a very nice touch. The staff at the concierge desk are knowledgable and very helpful. They sell tourist muni passports which is excellent (1 day for $11), and a very helpful female staff showed us how to get to the various attractions. There is complimentary lemonade and fruit late afternoon in the lobby. The location is excellent. The Ferry Building to the right, Chinatown to the left and Union Square to the south. Tadich Grill, an SF institution is 4 blocks right of the hotel, and we stumbled upon it by a very fortunate mistake. Unwittingly, we were in SF for the Gay Pride parade, which we happily attended. The atmosphere was fantastic. We booked through Expedia.co.nz, and paid NZ$266 per night (including taxes) which was very reasonable.

<Content>20th Anniversary Stay was Terrific I have stayed in many hotels all over the world. The Omni service was exceptional which is why this hotel is so highly rated. The premium class room on the top floor (17th) was large with the usual first-class amenities - king size bed, armoire holding the TV - mini-bar-drawers for clothing, a writing table and a chair. The room was very much like other major UPSCALE hotel chains but nothing palacial. The room was accurately described as having a partial view so I was not expecting more than this. I could see the bay but I also saw a lot of the side of the L-shaped Omni itself. The only hotel that I saw there that I would like to investigate next time was the Intercontinental Mark (somebody). It is a high rise on Nob Hill which is elevated already so I am sure the views were pretty spectacular. I am sure the price is as well. We had brunch at the Top of the Mark which is - you guessed it - on the top floor and we saw the view ourselves. Spectacular. But back to the Omni...When we told the concierge that this was our 20th Wedding Anniversary, they immediately arranged to have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room - complimentary. Having a bottle of champagne around just changes the whole mood of a hotel room - I highly recommend it. I am not suggesting that you lie about it being your anniversary, though.I had the 3-1/2 days in San Fran very well scheduled before we arrived because I wanted to make the most of our short stay, so I took the wind out of the concierge's sails when I showed him my calendar chart of restaurant reservations, Alcatraz cruise, Wok Wiz Chinatown tour, etc, but I would have missed the opportunity of eating at the Slanted Door if the concierge had not pointed out that they were in fact open for lunch (I had seen information indicating they only opened at 5 and could not work it into our evening time slots.) Tiger prawns, Vietnamese crepes, beef short ribs. WoW!One complaint: when you stay at the hotel that is rated #1, any little thing that is wrong will seem like a big deal. For instance, I had to take the coffee service tray out of the armoire and set it on the table and then I had to crawl under the table to reach the electrical outlet just to get it plugged in. I found myself getting quite indignant (silly pride) at the effort I had to personally exert just to hook up the thing. I have done this before in other hotels and not been nearly as bothered. Lesson: limit your expectations and you will always be more satisfied.Also: This is in the Financial District. While we never felt like we were out of the main part of town, it does get quiet on weekends. This was pleasant to us. You are still only a few blocks from Union Square, the Ferry Building, and Chinatown and you have cable cars running directly in front of the hotel. You will not feel isolated in the least. The location was perfect and in no way diminished our stay.

<Content>Loved the hotel, service sucked! While the hotel itself was nice, if not bit pricey, the service was not. There was a conference while we were there and a disco had been set up right below our room for the conference attendees. The floor was shaking the music was so loud. As the hotel was oversold we couldn't be moved and the only thing they offered to do for us was pay for a cab to another hotel, no offer of rooms elsewhere or anything. Oh...we did get a free overpriced breakfast out of it. Don't eat in the dining room, way overpriced for what you get...$25 for Bacon and Eggs?Would not stay there again, not for the amount we paid and the service we got.

<Content>Memorable Stay - Superb Service My husband and I recently spent a birthday week-end at the Omni San Francisco. This was our first stay at an Omni property and we were so impressed that we actually checked to see if there was a hotel in Fort Lauderdale which is where we'll be vacationing next (We have a reservation at a Hilton property but would have switched to the Omni given the wonderful experience we had with them in San Fran.).The front desk staff were very helpful and courteous. We were quite impressed with Crystal who not only answered our questions about hotel amenities but she also anticipated our needs and made arrangements to have them met. We were always greeted with a friendly hello by all staff we passed - be it at the front door, in the elevator or in the hallways. There appears to be a seamless team effort to provide polite service at all times and this was quite refreshing to experience. There were personal touches added to the room which we really appreciated. The linens were fresh and clean. Our only disappointment was that there was not much of a view from the room (perhaps because we had requested a quiet area of the hotel?). The hotel is in an excellent location, albeit sedate on the week-end as it's in the Financial district within close proximity to the shopping area on Market street, Little Italy and Chinatown. BART and MUNI are available nearby. We hope to be returning guests.

<Content>A few glitches - but nice My wife and I decided to take a long weekend, including a Monday off work, and spend it in San Francisco. We chose the Omni based on its reputation and location. Both lived up to expectations but for one glitch - the internet was down our entire stay.First the good. The location is perfect; in the heart of the embarcadero and financial districts and on the outskirts of China Town. You can easily walk to the farmers market (Sat and Tues), Coit tower, China Town, North beach or Union Square. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient and the Hotel was a pleasant level of old school; clean, comfortable and well cared for. We booked a signature room, which was a good size and high up on the 16th of 17 floors. Our package included parking and internet for $239 a night. Ask for this package when booking. The restaurant bar in the lobby, Bob's Bar (not the steakhouse) had great food and drinks and seems to be where locals and local business people hang out - it was fun.Now the minor bad - which left a bad taste. The internet, which they charge for in standard rooms and even the business center, was out all three days. Each time we called, the front desk gave us a differnt explanation and a different timeframe for its solution. We wanted the internet to search for restaurants, events and attractions. We also needed it to access our offices to justify a last minute day off. I asked if we could use the business office internet and they said sure, swipe your credit card Internet was free in our room but we had to pay - not cool.

<Content>Outstanding Customer Service/Wonderful amenities We just arrived home from a four night stay at the Omni San Francisco to celebrate our Anniversary. The Customer Service and attention to detail was outstanding. They took care of our every need and far exceeded our expectations. We had such wonderful celebration and stay as we knew if we needed anything, they we be there for us. We felt so pampered, we almost hated to leave. When we inquired how to get around by car, cable car and even buses, where to mail letters, packages the Front Desk and Conceirge staff provided every detail. When we needed to send a package, they gave us a box, the tape and even shipped it for us. The had every amenity we could need and more. When we inquired as to where to eat or get a bottle of wine to celebrate, they gave us all the help we could possibly need. The Valets and Bell hops were on top of every thing, even when we just needed to find out where to stand to catch the cable car. The location of the hotel is wonderul to get around the city and see the sites, as you are in the middle of it all. The bed was heavenly and the room was quiet. We look forward to the next time we will be able to stay there.

<Content>Where's the pool?? Its a nice hotel but contrary to the reviews, its not fantastic. Someone rated their pool as above average. Foolishly, I didn't look into it as i actually wanted to use the pool. I was surprised on arrival to find out that they don't actually have one!!!The staff are very friendly but that is usually a standard american thing in a high star hotel. The rooms are all nice and reasonably spacious for the price although a little stuffy for some reason (maybe the weather) but again, not all that fantastic as the reviews seem to suggest. The location is great in the center of town, the breakfast and the food average, the bed was okay, not fantastic. I've definitely stayed in better

<Content>This is what every hotel should aim to be like We arrived very late after a long drive from Vegas as part of our honeymoon tour of CA, and were greeted by exceptionally friendly helpful staff, unbelievably clean rooms, excellent facilities...need I go on. An absolute must for an extra special city visit.

<Content>would highly recommend this hotel We stayed in this hotel on a recent visit to san franciso and would highly recommend it, from start to finish the service was impeccable and i could not find one thing to fault. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the friendly porter and directed to the front desk where again the welcome was great (but not overwhelming) and check in was quick and efficent. Room was excellent - very comfortable with a huge bed and excellent bathroom (good shower). For me it was the little touches that made the stay so enjoyable - the chocolates, the ice bucket that was refilled every night, the weather forecast by the phone; as well as the attentive and friendly staff. As we spent most of our time sightseeing we only ate room service one night and never ate in the restauarant - both restauarant and bar looked very nice though. Location is great - walking distance from all the sights though can be a bit quiet on a sunday. If im in san francisco again this is where ill be staying!

<Content>Great hotel, location and friendly staff! We stayed at the Omni hotel after reading all the reviews on Trip advisor. I have to say that they were true! The Omni hotel is a great place with a very friendly staff. We arrived early (10:30a) and a room was waiting for us. After signing up on their website, we ended up with coffee and juice delivered to our room every morning. We also had breakfast included. The restaurant was great. The staff there welcomed us each morninng and we had the choice as far as menu. I had steak and eggs one morning. Just fabulous! The meat was very tender.We will definetely stay there again. Perfect location as well.

<Content>Best Hotel Experience Ever! We had a wonderful experience. I am 40ish and my daughter, 20. We went to SF for girl's trip. Omni staff was absolutely excellent. Genuine smiles, friendliest  kindest staff..even our housekeeper left hand-written notes daily. Clean  beautiful lobby, halls,  room. Special touches everywhere. Every single person we came in contact with was genuine and helpful. Great location two blocks from Chinatown. Paid $209 one night and $199 the other. Room size was also good for price paid.

<Content>Omni Made My 1st San Fran Trip a 1st Class Joy! As always, I checked TripAdvisor first when planning my first trip to San Francisco and based on the No. 1 rating of the Omni from previous travelers, I decided to give it a shot. Was I ever impressed. It is a lovely hotel in the Financial District of the city and very near Union Square. Not only are the common areas and the room truly beautiful, each member of the staff that I encountered was extremely courteous and sincerely willing to ensure that I was having a great time. I plan to return to see more of the city and will definitely be staying at the Omni.

<Content>Top Class Service. The Omni is a superb hotel. The Staff from Reception, Concierge, Housekeeping etc. were the best ever I have experienced. ALL HOTEL STAFF WORLDWIDE SHOULD BE TRAINED HERE!. The hotel is located within easy reach of everything with a trolley stop just outside for those who don't like walking. The only minor fault is the cost of Breakfast in the restaurant- it cost us $80 for two  as it's located in the financial district there is not a great selection of restaurants nearby, unless all you want is a coffee  bagel.

<Content>Omni is a good hotel in a good location My fiance and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco this past weekend. We found the staff to be extremely friendly. We didn't walk through the lobby once without a how are you? or Is there anything I can help you with?The room was on the small end but still very nice. The location was good but required a short walk to get to the tourist locations. The price was reasonable for San Francisco. The only downside in my mind was that we were charged $48 / day for our rental car to be parked in the garage. Seemed a bit steep. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>what a great hotel Everything about this hotel is perfect. The location is superb, near the sights but quiet at nightime with a trolley stop almost outside the door. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff are amazing, everyone of them went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. One of the best hotels I have stayed in, can't wait to go back.

<Content>A little pricey We stayed at the Omni for 2 nights we booked through Hotwire. We paid like $730.00. The room was average. They need to update the t.v.'s.It was just an okay stay. I would have rather stayed at the Westin Market street. The concierge is extremely helpful!!!

<Content>Favorite hotel in 20 years of travel Traveled quite a bit and stayed in some of the country's top hotels but as far as room quality (including value), comfort of atmosphere and service the Omni SF is at the top of my list. Great place to stay while in the city (was at the Orchard a few nights earlier bc of its reviews and it's not even close), or any city.

<Content>A great hotel We had only two nights at the Omni in May. We were on our way home to NZ after 6 weeks travelling in Europe laden with luggage!What a pleasure it was to arrive at the Omni after negotiating the chaos of Los Angeles Airport! We arrived at 8.30 am and our room was not available but hotel reception couldn't have been more helpful in storing bags, offering bathrooms and recommending places for coffee or breakfast. The manager personally hurried up the availability of our room and had us safely ensconced by 10am.Our room was a standard king but so spacious by European hotel room standards. It was immaculately clean and well appointed. Our only negative comment would be that there was no kettle for boiling water for a cup of tea. There was a coffee maker available but to just boil water in that took forever! The bed was large and firm with comfortable pillows and crisp linen. Nice range of toiletries in the bathroom which were replaced twice daily if needed-a nice touch.Our room was facing into a central area so only view was of other buildings. The upside of this was that we got no road noise whatsoever-Lovely and quiet so would probably request same on return visit.Hotel is in financial area so if here on holiday as we were, not too many restaurants or cafes in the immediate vicinity. This was a bit of an issue especially as we were there on a Sunday night and a Monday which was a public holiday so virtually nothing around. North beach though is only a short taxi ride away.The strength of this hotel though was its outstanding staff. They were respectful, extremely helpful and willing to answer all queries and wishes in a friendly courteous way.Wold we stay here again?---A resounding yes.

<Content>Great Stay at the Omni We had a great stay at the Omni San Francisco over the Memorial Day holiday. Although there was no view, our room was well appointed and clean. Staff was friendly and service was above average. Service technician replaced our television set becuase it was not working. Location, in the financial district, was good even though rather dead on Sunday and Memorial Day. Close to the Embarcadero and ferry building where restraunts were open on Sunday afternoon. We would stay here again on another trip to San Francisco.

<Content>great service The Omni is a great find for the price. We paid an average of $180.00 a night. It is a about 2 blocks off the beaten path but in a nice safe area. The great thing is that the California trolley line goes right in front of the hotel so transportation is easy. We walked to the North Beach district and to Union Square. Fisherman's warf is easy to get to by trolley. (buy the daily pass for $11 p/p) The rooms were very clean and updated as was the lobby. It is small but has a restaurant and a small bar that serves a small menu. If you want a very quiet room but with no view, request an inner courtyard. I have stayed in both and the street side rooms have the view to the street if you don't mind the city noises - not bad though.

<Content>Clean, beautiful, and amazing customer service at the Omni. We stayed at the Omni San Francisco for my dad's 65th birthday. My family was so impressed with the hotel. Not only were the rooms immaculate, the bathrooms were so clean you could eat off the floor. Omni's customer service was amazing... Everyone was so helpful in suggesting local restaurants, where to order pizza, etc. The concierge was GREAT and even surprised my dad with a small birthday cake and more. I consider myself to be a hotel snob and cannot say enough good things about this place. The location was GREAT too.

<Content>Fantastic SF Hotel! Everything about the hotel was fantastic - clean, beautiful, central location (walking distance to most everything), restaurant, bar, etc. But, the best part of the hotel was the staff - everyone we came in contact with was friendly, helpful, nice and just pleasant. Great stay. Will definitely stay the next time in SF.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Kids Room, Great City... A great classic and classy hotel. The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is luxurious, and extremely kid-friendly in a city that is not really kid-centric. We were lucky enough to book the Kid Fantasy Suite for my kids (ages 9 and 11) with an adjoining King room for my husband and I. While there is much more the decorators could have done to make it a true kid fantasy room, it made my kids feel like they were special. Bunk beds, bean bags and nightly milk  cookies -- what more could a kid want?! (Well, a pool would have been ideal, but they didn't mind too much).The restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steak House, was fantastic. A little pricey, but typical for the city and the food was worth it. There are several outstanding restaurants within an easy two block walk of the hotel.We were there over a long weekend, and it seemed many cafes and smaller restaurants were closed for the weekend, or had very limited hours. (The closest McDonald's was completely closed on Sunday -- not a big deal unless you have a 9-year-old craving a Happy Meal)But the location was great in regards to the ease in getting to public transportation. Also, there are a ton of things within walking distance -- China Town, the Ferry Building, Union Square.The service at the Omni is wonderful! Everything from the front desk staff to the housekeepers to the room service attendants. I could go on an on about this hotel, but to simply summarize: if you are going to San Fran, stay here!

<Content>Solid and convenient hotel I stayed at the Omni for 2 nights over Memorial Day weekend. I got a great weekend rate at $169 a night. LOCATION: The location could not be any better. We took the BART and walked 4 blocks (10 minutes) to the hotel. Just make sure you don't have too much luggage. The hotel is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. There are also Muni lines and cable car lines very close by.HOTEL:I knew that it was an older hotel, but I guess I expected the rooms to be nicer. It is very clean, but there was no wow factor that I have seen at other hotels like Novotel Singapore or Venetian in Vegas. It was a regular room with regular t.v. with nice amenities but nothing ultra-modern. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, although you could hear some hallway noise, but nothing from outside the building. I guess that is why they are not considered a 5 star hotel. Minus one star for the room.SERVICE:The service was very good overall. Check in was quick and all the staff were extremely friendly. We are a select guest, so we get morning beverage service (you are supposed to get a card outside your room and you hang it out with your beverages). Since this is our first stay, we had no idea how this worked. We never got a card and got no beverages in the morning. When I called the front desk, they forwarded me to room service, and I got my beverages. I also told front desk that I didn't get a beverage card, just a room service, when they asked if I hung it outside. Well, for a #1 rated Tripadvisor and 4 star hotel, I would expect a select guest beverage card the following night, but no. So, minus one star for that. However, when I wanted coffee the next morning at 11:00 a.m. (they have a pot of coffee in Bob's every morning until 10:00 a.m.), the staff got me one, so add one star.Overall, this is a great hotel with great service. I can see why it is not 5 stars, but the service really makes it above the rest.HOTEL TIPS:Get free water and fruit in the fitness room. There is also free fruit in the afternoon and free lemonade in the lobby. There is free coffee in the morning at Bob's bar until 10:00 a.m. But, you get free beverage service delivered to your room if you sign up as a selected guest.RESTAURANT TIPS:We found two great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Both are highly rated on yelp. The first is Bix. It is on Gold St., which is about 5 blocks north of Montgomery (10 minutes walk). It's in a small alley, and the food is awesome and moderately priced (entrees $25 to 35 range). Their appetizers are incredible, and the atmosphere is very nice. The second is Great Eastern in Chinatown for dim sum. This place is located on Jackson St. by Kearny. It is very clean compared to the other Chinatown places, and you order off of a menu with pictures (no carts). Service is a bit slow, but if you are looking for an adventure in Chinatown, definitely try dim sum there. Go early (before 11:00) to avoid the crazy crowds!

<Content>Great Hotel! Can't wait to go back My husband, baby, and I stayed at the Omni for 3 nights in March. I've never experienced such great service. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with great hospitality. The lady that checked us in even asked if she could hold our baby and played with him for a little while. it was really cute. We were upgraded to a suite, which was beautiful. Any questions we had, or service, we needed was handled with genuine kindness and efficiency. My baby's blanket was accidentally taken by the cleaning staff. Omni took all measures to locate it, and then refunded 1 night off the bill and treated us to a free breakfast. We thought that was really nice. We have great memories, and can't wait to stay there again. We tell all of our friends who visit San Francisco about this experience, and recommend it highly.

<Content>Fantastic weekend For my birthday this year, my husband surprised me with a trip to San Francisco, and a stay in the Omni hotel. From the second we arrived until we had to return, we found the hotel and its staff faultless. We arrived early, hoping to be able to drop off our bags until the room was ready, but were delighted to be told that not only was our room ready, but they had upgraded us to a suite! The room was beautiful, with loads of space to chill out and relax. Returning that evening after a day of sightseeing, I was surprised yet again, as they had laid on cake and champagne for my birthday. The omni certainly know how to pamper a girl. The next day, we both felt thoroughly relaxed after sleeping in the very comfortable beds. The breakfasts were fantastic, with truly excellent service. My husband booked the champagne and strawberries package which were delivered that evening, and once again the presentation and execution was impeccable. The rose petals on the bed were an extra special touch. I would highly recommend the Omni Hotel and its wonderful staff, and look forward to returning there in the future.

<Content>The Omni went above and beyond My best friend and I went to San Francisco for a girls weekend and had the best time. The hotel was fantastic. From greeting us with roses and first class service upon checking in, to our beautifully appointed room.  It was a deluxe room with two double beds, marble bathroom, with no real views but very comfortable. We are wary of hotels but felt right at home at the Omni, as everything was clean and comfortable. I have stayed in Fairmonts and nicer hotels, and I would say that this hotel was at par with a 4+ star, it was great. My girlfriend celebrated a birthday during our stay and we only mentioned it to the front desk clerk when asked why in town, after dinner one night they sent up a bottle of champagne, two small birthday cakes and a personalized card. It was perfect! The gym was great, tv's on all the equipment and was never full, or even half full. Get your water there as there is complimentary water, and the bottle in your room is $6. Oh and there is also fresh fruit in the gym, which might be a nice snack as the mini bar and room service are quite pricey. Which isn't too much of a problem since the Omni is near alot of nice cafes, restaurants etc. (right beside the Omni there is a cafe which has everything and makes delicious panini's.... which are worth the trip back to San Francisco). We never ordered anything from the hotel.... except a bagel and fruitplate in the morning.... and it wasn't outrageous. No pool, no views, but what the hotel lacks in those areas, it completely compensates for in friendly helpful staff. It is close to China town, Union square, North beach and across the street from the Carmelian room which has amazing views while you dine. Become an Omni select guest member (free online) and you can get a complimentary morning beverage and paper, turn down service and upgrade after so many stays. Being on California street, alongside the cable cars, the Omni makes it easy to get around without a rental car. I would actually say avoid renting one if possible as parking in San Francisco is expensive and hard to come by. The hotel charges $45 I believe. So we rented one to drive up to win country, and returned it the same day, just to save us the hassle of paying for parking and returning it the next day.  San Francisco is a fantastic city and the hospitality extends far beyond the hotels and tourist areas. Everyone is so nice and made our trip so enjoyable. The Omni is a great hotel in a great location. We will return and as soon as we can.

<Content>Perfect Beautifully located walking distance to North Beach for restaurants, Union square and fishermans wharf. Brilliant, friendly service - nothing was a problem. The service team went out of their way to help me - I felt like a King! The rooms are spacious (I had a king bed), and bathrooms are good size and have high quality finishes. The gym has all the gear you need, about 5 treadmills, some new resistance training gear and is very well presented.Whether you are staying for pleasure or business, this hotel is first class, highly recommend - it was also outstanding value!

<Content>Great staff From the moment we walked through the door at the Omni, the staff could not have been more helpful. John on the front desk, gave us maps with directions to all the tourist areas, recommended restaurants and because the bellman was very busy even brought our luggage up to our room himself. The location was great a 15 minute walk to union square and a pleasant 20 minutes walk to Fisherman's wharf. If you don't like walking the cable car stop is very close to the hotel.The only mild disappointment at the Omni was the high prices in the restuarant especially for breakfast.The trip to alcatraz from pier 33 is must, so remember to book in advance online as it will be very difficult to get tickets on the day as there tends to be a wait of several days.San Francisco was very enjoyable, and it helped to have such friendly staff at the Omni.

<Content>Excellent hotel This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. It is centerally located only a block away from china town and a couple from union square. The staff are the most helpful and friendly I have ever seen. From check in with a lady called Crystal she supplied us with maps gave good advice and was very helpful. Another member of staff from meeting me once remembered my name everytime he saw me. Its not the cheapest place but it is a very nice hotel and you wont regret booking here. The food is excellent as well.

<Content>GREAT San Francisco Hotel! My wife and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco for four nights recently - and we simply loved our experience!The hotel has all of the services we could have wanted: very nice, comfortable rooms; an awesome concierge service (truly!); and one of the best hotel gyms that we've come across; among various other features.The absolute best part of the hotel, though, was the staff: everyone was warm and friendly - special rave reviews go to the doormen/valets and the front desk/concierge staffs . . . who were all as helpful as one could ask for.In fact, we happened to mention to the guest services representative/concierge who checked us in (Joey N.) that it was my birthday and that my wife had just arrived back in the States after overseas work travel . . . and he kindly surprised us by sending up a bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries - so very kind and generous!As for the hotel and the city: one is only minutes away from the Embarcadero (and the Ferry Building, a join in and of itself - but also the jumping off point for ferries to Sausalito, Tiburon, etc.) and Nob Hill - and a cable car line runs in front of the hotel. Given the weather, we walked all over - but even those not disposed to do so will find this hotel most convenient!All in all: a tremendous experience - at a very reasonable price!

<Content>Extremely comfortable welcoming I booked this hotel because of the great reviews. It is all true. The decor is lovely, the beds are really cozy and the fitness room is adequate. Best of all is the welcoming staff that is always available to offer suggestions or provide directions.We also really liked the location.

<Content>Delightful hotel in a great location We spent four nights at this delightful hotel at the beginning of April. When we arrived we had to wait about 5 mins before the check-in staff were able to attend to us and this resulted in my wife being given a rose and also an upgrade to a very comfortable suite. Although the hotel is in the financial area which is a bit quiet at the weekend, it is ideally situated for most of the tourist areas. Public transportation is also very accessible from the hotel.The hotel has a very pleasant restaurant and bar, however I feel the cost of the meals in the restaurant was a bit excessive and the signature giant honey glazed carrot which seemed to accompany most of the meals was a bit wasted on us. On the last night we decided to stay in the bar as we had spent the day on a very enjoyable wine tour to the Napa valley. On this occasion we chose a bar meal which was extremely tasty and far better value for money.Although the cost of the rooms is expensive during the week, it is possible to get a good deal for Fri/Sat/Sun nights but I would recommend contacting the hotel directly. I would certainly stay at this hotel again and would recommend it.

<Content>A very nice hotel This was overall a very nice hotel, in the financial district, which was nice, as it is much more mellow on the weekend. Service was very good, but I would say this hotel is probably a bit overrated. Some sites mistakenly say it has a jacuzzi, which it DOESN'T. The rooms are nice (old world style), room service is very helpful (as were all the people at front desk, bellmen, valets etc.) but the sheets were a bit on the rough side, the shower was average (and I'm being nitpicky here).Don't get me wrong: this is a VERY nice hotel. But if you're expecting the ultimate luxury with the very soft sheets, fancy bathrooms, for those aspects, I'd say it wasn't quite up to par with a five star hotel...

<Content>Loved the Omni San Francisco I really enjoyed my 2 night stay at the Omni last weekend. The hotel is very beautiful and historic from the outside and the location is excellent to explore the city. We easily walked to Chinatown and Embarcadero. Broadway, which offers the nightlife, is also a short distance away. Public transportation is also very accessible from the hotel.The lobby is really very pretty. The staff is very sweet and helpful. They always have a smile on their face. Our room was clean and very comfortable and tastefully decorated. It also overlooked Montgomery, which was nice.The only downfall about the hotel was the internet connection. WiFi was only available if you took your laptop to a certain location in the lobby. If you wanted a connection in your room it had to be done with a cable connection in the desk and the cost was $15 per day.We never ate at the hotel so I cannot comment on the quality of the food. But overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Omni. I would not hesitate to stay there again when I return to San Francisco.

<Content>loved the omni We booked into the omni hotel after reading the trip advisor and expedia which I might add are my travel bibles. The web sites did not let us down.We were after quiet, gracious accommodation that epitimised San Francisco, and it was ordered.The hotel was everything we thought would make our San Francisco trip worthwhile. The room was well appointed and very quiet, the bar was very cosy and bar staff attentive. The breakfast was enjoyable and the counter staff were spot on in their recommendations for restaurants.As seasoned travellers I would thoroughly recommend this hotel , although it was in the financial district it did not deter in any way from transporting to all the hot spots, eg food, tourist areas etc.

<Content>Nice, not dazzling Meh. After reading all the glowing reviews here, I expected more during my two week stay. The good: The member program is well worth signing up for -- the hot chocolate from complimentary morning beverage service is dense and European-style and comes with whipped cream and cinnamon marshmallows. Umbrellas in the lobby when it's raining outside.Gym is solid, with ellipticals and free weights.Get Fit kit.Most of the staff is attentive (hit or miss though). Seem way more responsive to families with little kids.Great location, decent steakhouse downstairs.The bad:Wireless internet connection blows.Can't leave tip on credit card.My shower curtain had mold on it.O.J. is not fresh-squeezed.Inconsistent housekeeping.Room set up in such a way that trying to close the door of TV armoire resulted in almost knocking over the lamp on nearby desk.Overall, can definitely tell the difference between a four star and a five star hotel.

<Content>Good stay at the Omni Stayed Saturday night, the first day of our vacation at the Omni. Our room was on the 6th floor overlooking California St. It was quite comfortable and quiet although I don't know if it would be as quiet during the work week with much more traffic going by. Easy walk to Chinatown and the financial district. The California Cable car line runs right in front of the hotel. Easy connection to the Hyde and Powell line which takes you to Fisherman's Wharf area, Chinatown and Lombard Street. You can buy a day pass at the front desk. Our $200 rate included a Deluxe Room and valet parking ($45 otherwise.) and we thought this was reasonable for San Francisco. We were quite comfortable during our stay.

<Content>Pleasant stay We spent a long weekend at this hotel and found it to be a very pleasant place, particularly for San Francisco. Everything is gleaming, and in good taste. The staff is excellent; when we asked to have the feather pillows and feather blanket removed due to my wife's allergy, someone was completed the task rapidly and pleasantly. The location is great, with about a bazillion restaurants an easy walk from the hotel. The concierge knows what he's talking about and was very helpful. The apples and apple cider available in the late afternoon was very welcoming. You get street noise if your room faces california Street, so I would ask for a quiet room in the back and/or a room on the top floors. I would also self-park at the St. Mary's garage a very short walk away to avoid the steep valet parking charge.

<Content>Just returned from an excellent 10 day stay at a truly world class hotel! We just returned from a 10 day family vacation to San Francisco where we enjoyed 2 connecting rooms at this exquisite hotel. Every moment spent at the San Francisco Omni Hotel was truly a pleasure! I could not have expected more from our entire experience at this hotel. From the timely communication about the reservation and on-line check-in options, the attentive and warm reception received from each staff member at the time of arrival, the wonderful daily amenities received as simply being a member of the FREE Select Guest program, impeccable housekeeping, exceptional dining through room service and Bob's restaurant, the special kid's program that allowed my daughter to feel just as special as we did each and every day...this hotel has all the bases covered! If you wish for your stay in San Francisco to be a true pleasure for both business and personal travel, you will not be disappointed by staying at this truly world class hotel!

<Content>A Lovely Stay at the Omni Very impressed with the online check in. We arrived after a long flight and as we had already checked in after receiving the offer to check in via email, so we were able to just collect our key and go straight to our room without having to wait to speak to anybody.Our room was beautifully furnished and we couldn't believe how quiet it was given that the Hotel is on a main road. The location is excellent, cable car runs along the road outside the Hotel and it is only a short walk to the shops in Union Square.I agree with a previous reviewer re the cost of breakfast - a little over priced - probably worth a wander to a nearby cafe. This is a Hotel that feels initmate and cosy, it retains a very classical San Francisco look - nicely done.

<Content>Great deal for the money We stayed in Omni for 2 nights during spring break. They upgraded us to 16th floor which was supposed to have free internet but it was not clear how to get this and we got free internet through their Select membership (another great tip from TripAdvisor), it was spotty but not too bad. The room was not big but nice. Comfortable beds, outstanding linens and blankets. The shower pressure was good too. Nice touches like chocolates, bathrobes, good San Francisco map in the room. I tried to share the bed with my 6 year old, but didn't sleep well, and on the second night I requested a rollaway bed. It was also very nice and they didn't charge us for it. The toilet paper holder broke but was promptly fixed. We didn't go to the restaurant, too expensive. Cafe de la Presse, recommended by one of the reviewer, is a nice spot for breakfast, or you can walk to the Ferry building marketplace.All in all, I might have given it 4 stars if we had really paid the average price listed here, but we paid only $144 a night through Expedia, and compared with other CA hotels where we stayed during this trip for similar price, Omni was clearly in a different league.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at the Omni for four nights and had a great experience. I was attending a business conference, but arrived a day early to see the sights. My husband also came along, and we both loved the service at the hotel. All members of the staff were very attentive and accommodating, from the doormen to the front desk to housekeeping. The room was clean and comfortable and very quiet - no problems with noise. I would definitely stay at the Omni again.

<Content>Comfortable Stay, stay on a weekend! The lobby is opulent and the staff were lovely. The bedroom was spacious and the decor is high end and not shabby but a little old fashioned. The bed was very comfortable and very quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. We stayed for four nights over a weekend period and when we asked about extending our stay for a further night (Tuesday night) we were disappointed to learn that the rate was double what we had paid for our previous four nights and resulted in us checking into another hotel in the San Francisco area. The buffet breakfast is expensive (breakfast for three cost 鈧?0). The bar is lovely and very well decorated and a little music would have created an ambience here. However, overlooking this we had a lovely stay in this hotel and would recommend it.

<Content>Nice, but.... We stayed at the Omni for two nights (3/20  3/21) and were immediately impressed by the service upon our arrival. Also, the lobby of the hotel was magnificent. We had a Deluxe Room/Parking arrangement which was very economical ($200 per night plus Expedia fees which were a little high) and our request for a quiet room was certainly honored. The downsides: while the staff at the Omni is Excellent (with a capital e), it is obvious that they've been a victim of the more with less phenomenon currently plaguing the U.S. There was a false fire alarm which occurred which, while not they're fault, delayed our sightseeing as we had locked our camera in our room safe and the safe refused to open. When we informed the front desk, they assured us security would be up shortly. This took almost half an hour and two more calls. It would have been much better if we'd been kept advised as to the progress of security. More importantly, though, it would have been much better if there had been more than one security person available. This became a recurring theme of our stay. We had plumbing issues and it took, again, about half an hour for someone to come. I asked the front desk about whether one of our bags had arrived; they said they'd call me to advise me. When I never got a call, I had to call them again and inferred, from the desk clerk's apology, they'd forgotten to call me.Lastly, while our room was quiet, it was a bit run-down (carpet frayed/stained); is this how these discount rooms become available to the common masses?

<Content>One Of the Best Stayed here at the end of a long trip around the USA and have to say it was just wonderful. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the doorman and front desk staff - even when I forgot my room number! The bed was so comfortable and the room very high quality. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough for comfort and service, can't wait to go back.

<Content>Omni Hotel, 500 California Our family stayed at the Omni for our spring break this year which was March17th-21st. Great service, excellent location in San Francisco and a clean and wonderful room. Our kids, ages 11 and 7, loved the attention from the staff. We loved the location to all the attractions in San Francisco. I would highly recommend the Omni. Only down side was the water pressure in the shower.

<Content>Great place to give your car a chance to be stolen The hotel may have received a top rating for service overall, but the front of the house service is sorely lacking, the doorman, the valet and bell service. One of the jobs is to keep the area in front of the hotel open for guests checking in. When we arrived the area was full of empty limos and service people not doing much of anything. We parked further up and had to walk back to get help with the car and it seemed like I was putting them out. The real problem occurred the next day when we leaving to go shopping to find the car at the curb, (furthest from the front door) unlocked with the keys in the visor and the only staff around was the doorman, who was busy on his cell phone, not paying much attention to anything. When asked, why my car was out there, he said I don't know, someone must have called for it. No one was concerned or seemed disturbed that my car was out front unlocked with the keys in it, not even the manager who was on duty at the time. I was told that they got the number wrong when someone else called down for their car, the radios have static. I was assured that there was no way that someone else could have taken my car, they check the numbers. The next day when I checked out, I called for the car, I gave them the number, no one asked my name, no one referred to me by name. When I went out front to retrieve my car the valet asked and pointed, Is that your car? He never asked my name or checked the number. Now, tell me, how safe to you feel leaving your car at the Omni in San Francisco? Do you feel lucky? My next trip will find me back at the Mark Hopkins.

<Content>Loved the Omni and SF! This review is late in coming but as it was one year ago today that we were in SF for our anniversary it made me think of it. I LOVED the Omni (not super modern) and the service was excellent. They upgraded us to a top floor room, with rose petals and wash clothes in the shape of a heart for our anniversary with no charge. The only complaint was the kids in the room next door hanging out their window, smoking half the night. But that was not the Omni's fault. The door men were great and the location was convenient to most of what we wanted to see. Would definitely go back.

<Content>Omni-licious We recently stayed for my young daughters birthday. I was a little nervous because I did not know how they would recieve a us since we had a young child. But that was allieviated when we entered the room and there was a chocolate cake , milk and a birthday card waiting for her. She was so excited!! From the time you walk in the staff is so welcoming and friendly. The room was clean, elegant ,quiet and comfortable. Room service was expensive but prompt and friendly. The beds were so comfortable we stayed in on a Friday night. The staff really do their best to accomodate your every night.Cons: The Wolfgang Puck coffee that is supplied in the room. You can avoid this by becoming a Select member.. and you will get free coffee and newspaper in the morning. This was an inside hint that I got on from this site.Suggestions: Would like them to give a little freebie like other hotels i.e. wine and cheese or continental breakfast.Overall I loved it and can't wait to go back.

<Content>Fantastic experience I don't know where to begin. This hotel from start to finish was amazing. By far the best service I have ever experienced anywhere. The reservation process was smooth and easy and it just got better once we arrived. The staff at the Omni really goes that extra mile to impress their guests. It was my mom's 60th birthday and they had champagne and a lovely piece of cake waiting for us when we returned from our day in the city. The door man was so charming, he handed my mom a rose and told her happy birthday. The check in process was quick and efficient. We arrived early and had no problem getting our room. I requested the lowest floor available, the man at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. Our room was beautiful and comfortable. The beds are super soft and the bathroom was very nice as well (huge tub, nice bath products!). The hotel provided a black towncar to take us to dinner, the driver was helpful and also very nice. My only regret was that we only had one night at the Omni. I can't wait to return with my husband on our next trip to SF. We visit the city 3-4 times per year and the Omni is most definitely my favorite hotel ever. It is a very short walk to Union Square (about 10 minutes) and the cable cars run in front of this hotel. North Beach is also very close. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and would highly recommend staying here! It just goes to show you that there are still places out there that put the customer first and go that extra mile to make their guests happy. Bravo Omni..

<Content>Nice place but no internet... We had a great weekend getaway planned and were looking forward to our stay at the Omni. The valet parking is 51.00/day but we were directed to a garage up the street for a weekend rate of 7/day. Nice downtown location withing walking distance of shopping and dining. Lobby and restaurant were very nice. My wife's martini was $15 and my beer was about $7. Don't drink too much there. The room we had had a great king bed, super comfy. Old style TV set looked out of place but worked fine. Immaculate rooms and very nice appointments. We were disappointed that our in-room high speed internet did not work. Called customer support 2x but no dice. Mentioned it to the front desk people and they shrugged it off as no big deal and didn't offer to try to make it right for us. Needless to say we didn't get any work done in the evenings but I guess that it wasn't meant to be. So all in all we had a good time at an upscale hotel with crappy internet service.

<Content>Why I'll never stay at another Omni Hotel Just a short note to explain to you why I will never stay in another Omni Hotel.I reserved a Signature Room at the Omni San Francisco Hotel through Hotels.com for 4 nights, arriving August 31 and leaving September 4, 2007.When I arrived at the hotel I was informed that they had over-booked their rooms. I was told that I would be put in a lower cost standard room, a room without the Signature Room complimentary services. Needless to say, I was not happy about paying the Signature price for the lower cost room, this because I had paid in advance.When I complained, I was offered a free breakfast. After I refused to accept the room they had offered, I was finally given a Signature Room. No doubt some other poor schmuck got stuck paying top dollar for a standard room. A first-class hotel would never have suggested downgrading a paying customer, regardless of how or how much they paid. But then, Omni isn鈥檛 a first-class hotel.Once I had checked into my Signature accommodations, everything was fine except for one minor detail. On Monday morning, September 3, while entering the bathroom in my suite, I stepped on a carpet nail that was protruding upward out of the carpet in front of the bathroom door. I didn鈥檛 think I needed to be concerned about walking barefoot in my own room, not in a first-class hotel.I wasn鈥檛 as angry about being injured by Omni鈥檚 negligence as I was by their response. When I contacted the front desk and explained that a nail had punctured my toe and that I was bleeding profusely, their staff offered me a band-aid. Given the fact that I was in pain and limping, given the fact that I now had to contact my doctor to find out when I last had a tetanus shot, given the fact that I now had to worry about catching some horrible disease from the last person who impaled themselves on their carpet nail - I would have expected a first-class hotel to be more consolatory than to offer me a band-aid.After I returned to my room, the Omni staff sent me a note stating that they were unable to find the nail that had injured me. They insisted that I point out the nail to their building engineer, which I did. As their building engineer was pounded the offending nail back into the floor, he stated that he discovered 2 more nails protruding upward out of the carpet in the same general area. I wasn鈥檛 aware that I was entering a 鈥渕ine field鈥?when I checked into the Omni hotel.But the final straw occurred as I was checking out of the hotel. The desk clerk inquired as to my stay. I explained the whole sordid tale, the nail, the blood, the limping, everything. I then asked what was the best way to get to the Oakland Airport. To add insult to injury, she suggested that I walk 4 blocks to the BART station.Once I returned home, I contacted the Omni management to complain. The hotel manager promised to send me a voucher for several free nights stay. This never happened. A first-class hotel manager would have been a man of his word.But then, Omni isn鈥檛 a first-class hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel, Annoying fees I stayed here overnight on a quick business trip to San Francisco. The room and service were quite good.For tourists paying their own way, however, the extra fees are excessive. The business center is deficient, and the fees for using the computer and fax machine are high. Mini bar charges are also excessive. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was good but also overpriced -- $25 for a basic eggs, toast etc. As is usual with high-end hotels, the extra costs are excessive and annoying.

<Content>Great hotel with a luxurious feel - Not really for tourists This property feels very luxurious, and the rates aren't bad either.Nice lobby, accomodating and friendly front desk staff. Rooms are very comfortable with soft beds and great bathroom amenities. The shower was great too (good water pressure, which I find is often a problem). Decor was classy.Windows in room don't keep out any street noise, but at least they opened to let some fresh air in. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to tourists - it's in the financial district and I found I needed to walk quite a bit to even find restaurants that were open for dinner past 7:00 PMI had trouble with the in-room internet - the hotel was not helpful. Other than that, I had a great stay.

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic Stay We checked in for a one night stay - the Front Desk staff was extremely accommodating and allowed us early check in (and late check out). The room was lovely and very comfortable. The Concierge was great! He recommended wonderful restaurants in the area for our lunch that day. We had an evening performance 6 blocks away (all up hill) and he arrranged a complimentary towncar ride to the event.The Omni has a computer room and allowed us to do electronic flight checkin and print our boarding pass at no charge.Our breakfast in the Hotel restaurant (Bob's Steak House) was fantastic with the service rated above a 10. An early dinner in the Bar prior to leaving for the airport was equally marvelous. Best steak I have ever had (albiet quite pricey). Worth every cent.I'd stay there again in a heartbeat and, in fact, may plan a trip back in the spring and will definietly stay at the Omni.

<Content>Beautiful/Quiet The Omni Hotel is beautiful and quiet. Now this isn't the Four Seasons, but it is still along the same lines. Rooms were spacious and elegant and very comftoable and inviting. They even have turn down service in the evening, which is an added bonus. The best thing about this place was the gym. All I can say is awesome!!!! The lighting is great, the equipment was top notch, well taken care of by staff, stocked with towls, headphones, water, etc. AWESOME!Only drawback is that it is a little pricey to say the least. Items in room are a plenty, but it will cost you. My suggestion is to leave those kinds of things alone. LoL I would stay here again.

<Content>First Class Hotel My wife and I got to escape our lives and children for one night thanks to Grandma. We decided to stay at tripadvisor's #1 pick. We agree. The Omni is truly remarkable. The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was spectacular. The shower had two heads plus two coming off the wall. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the place was super clean. We got the California Suite / Sweet deal. They brought us amazing chocolates while we were napping. Then we showered and went out for dinner. When we came back, the bed was made and our used towels had already been replaced. They left even more chocolates by the bedside. I've never been treated so well and we stay at a lot of nice places. This place is top notch!

<Content>Beautiful hotel The Omni is a lovely hotel with exceptional service. We loved everything, down to the bath products, which I have been special ordering since our visit. The location is convenient- close to trolley lines and Chinatown, plus cabs are easily available in front of the hotel. At check in we were treated with kind attention and our 5 year old son appreciated the special kid's gift packet, full of goodies and activities. We also thought is was a nice touch to have milk and cookies brought to our room every afternoon (although a bit close to dinner time). Our only complaint is the lack of a pool, which nearly led us to another location. We chose to book at the Omni anyway, since it was the site of the meeting we were attending. Overall, it's a great hotel and they do their best to welcome young children.

<Content>They surpassed my expectations! I wrote a review recently regarding my stay last year in September and as you can see, the experience was amazing. After such a great stay I knew that I had to come back to the Omni, and I am so glad that I did. Let me share my wonderful weekend with you.We came to celebrate my fiance's birthday. I made sure to let the Omni know during my reservations and when I spoke with the concierges to arrange for some cider to be sent up to the room. On our way to the hotel I realized we would like a DVD player in our room and when I talked with them I was informed that we wouldn't have to worry about asking for a DVD player because we had been upgraded to a suite (which included a DVD player)! The weather was pretty nasty the day we arrived, but we made it there (sopping wet, but still...). Greeted warmly by the door-man I got my keys and we headed to our suite. It was on the 7th floor, and at first I was disappointed because I had requested a high floor, until I opened the door to our room.The suites have a separate sitting room with a couch and two sitting chairs, as well as a desk and entertainment system set-up (I will post pictures shortly after the review is posted). The stereo was turned on, playing some soft classical music as we entered the room. The ambiance was magnificent. On the table were THREE separate greeting cards, wishing warm birthday wishes to my fiance', inviting us to ask for anything we need to be comfortable, as well as a personally written greeting card from the general manager! This is why the Omni San Francisco won top honors for best service in the United States! Within minutes of settling in there came another knock at the door. My fiance' and I were both surprised to see in-room dining had sent up a slice of chocolate birthday cake! It was very good and we were wondering if they planned to spoil us rotten all weekend. While there were no more additional amenities, the Omni, as always, was very fast and professional with any and all requests that I made. The night that we arrived, for example, I called the front desk to ask for recommendations for a good italian restaurant. The concierge I spoke to (Justin I believe was his name) was very friendly and recommended the North Beach restaurant/area, stating that there were numerous italian restaurants in the area that we could choose from. We took him up on it and sure enough we found a charming little place called Franchino's to have dinner. Our room also came with free breakfast each morning we were there. I've heard mixed reviews about the restaurant from other people, but I thought that the breakfast was very good. Granted that it came with my room and I didn't have to pay anything except for the tip. I'm not sure I would say the same if I actually paid the 25 dollars for the breakfast. Still, as an amenity to a hotel-room package, the breakfast is very good.If there was one thing that I had to say that was not the best experience during this last stay, it was that Cabs were hard to come by this time. I heard something about local taxi services boycotting the Omni, but I'm not sure if that was true or not. Whatever it was, many cabs dropped off their customers and just sped off rather than pick up people waiting in the cab line. So, my fiance' and I did a lot more walking than we probably planned to.Still, if you requested a copy of the 2007 rewards for hotels, you will see the Omni San Francisco won a number of honors. Ranking in at #34 worldwide in Luxury hotels, #3 in U.S Luxury Hotels, Best in the San Francisco Destination (of the top 25), #4 in World- Customer Service and #1 in U.S- Customer Service. That's not the chain, it's this branch! To any Omni San Francisco staff reading this review, thank you so much for making my stay so memorable and I can't wait to come back and visit you again.To anyone visiting San Francisco in the near future: Make your reservations! I can't stress enough how great this hotel is. Affordable luxury, amazing customer service and a great location makes the Omni San Francisco your best bet in this very large city.Happy travels!

<Content>Very Good I stayed here for two nights in Jan 08 on the way home from a business trip. The reception was excellent, rooms and bahrooms are very good indeed and all the staff set out to please. Its a bit away from the main tourist areas (Union Square and the Wharf) but thats no bad thing. Its a 10 min walk to Union Square, and approx a 30 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf through North Beach. Its also about 10 mins walk to the Ferry Builiding where you can pick up the F Line tram. The California line cable car stops outside the door so transport is not a problem if you don't want to walk. I booked through the hotel web site directly as this offered the best deal ($169 per night) I also ate at Bobs Steak and Chop House (the hotel restaurant) on the first night. Very good but not a cheap option (approx $70-$80 a head for two courses and a couple of drinks). San Francisco is a great city and I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>I Love This Hotel!! This hotel  its' staff gives hotels a good name. It is why i love hotels; the staff is friendly/helpful/courteous/kind ( probably thrifty, brave, etc) from the desk staff to the concierge, bellmen, doormen  maids. The lobby IS like walking into the Titanic (as noted in another review). There are milk  EXCELLENT choc chip cookies left in your room each afternoon plus cider  cookies in the lobby.The rooms are beautiful (in contrast to the Madonna Inn where we had just stayed for a night), the beds are comfy  warm.The parking is EXPENSIVE, ($45/day, i think) but i got a deal on Expedia that INCLUDED parking for ~$10/day. The parking is a block or 2 away but only had to wait 5-10 minutes for the car to be brought around.The area has expensive restaurants (Tadich grill, cafe tiramisu) and less expensive ones (House of Nanking); a terrific place for breakfast is Cafe de la Presse a couple of blocks away--reminds me of Paris. You can walk to everything. I want to go again!

<Content>Classy Place to stay This was a very classy experience staying at the Omni. I stayed in the California room and which overlooked the city. It was so beautiful. You are also within in walking distance of Chinatown, and Union Square.The staff at this hotel are very attentive and make you feel special. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who can afford to stay here. Although even if you can afford to stay here, it can be competitive at times to find a vacancy.When I return to San Franscisco again in the near future I will definitley stay at the Omni again.

<Content>Outstanding value - impeccable and great location We stayed at the Omni for 2 nights (Fri and Sat), taking advantage of the weekend rates.The Omni was a very pleasnt surprise as it is a short few blocks from Union square across from the Bank of America tower. We were able to walk to North Beach for dinner.The rooms are spacious and well appointed with marble countertops and shower. Decorated with great taste throughout. The staff was attentive to details and housekeeping keeps the room absolutely impeccable.I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great stay at the Omni My fiance and I stayed at the Omni for 1 night. I found the cheapest rates on the Omni Hotel's website. Unfortunately nothing else was cheap. $45/night for parking with unlimited in and out privileges. $70 for a steak. $34 for 3 cocktails. $70 for 3 mediocre martinis and 2 appetizers. The onion rings were pretty bad. There is free wi-fi in the lobby, but $10 for an internet connection in your room. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays. All of the staff were very nice and courteous when we arrived. Security was very helpful when my fiance got locked in the stairwell (you can get into the stairwell, but you need a key to get onto the floors). There was complimentary hot cider and cookies for the guests in the lobby. I especially liked the gingerbread men. The rooms were very nice and spacious (for SF) with marble countertops and high thread count bedding. I loved their bathrobes. When we went back to our room at the end of the night the maid wrote a welcome note and left mint chocolates on the nightstand. The hotel is located in the Financial district so lots of people go to the lobby bar after work. It's a few blocks from Union Square so we took a cab to get around town. I would have given the Omni 5 stars but some of the rates for food were ridiculous and the maids knocked on our door 4 times to clean the room.

<Content>A great choice, whether you're there for business or for romance It may sound a bit strange, but I think it's true. Perfect for business and for romance too (not so for singles, partiers, families with kids and so on).Elegant, quiet, perfectly located in a very good part of town ... I think the Omni really has it all. It's obsviously not an inexpensive choice, but their rates are very reasonable for what you get.The lobby is beautiful and the rooms extremely clean, quite large and very comfortable, with incredible beds and bathrooms wonderfully appointed with marble and green and black granite. Room service was very good and front desk staff was efficient.One of the definite pluses of the hotel is the express check-out. So efficient, as you bypass the usual check-out procedures (unless you disagree with the price to pay). You gave them your credit card when checking-in, so finding your final bill in an envelope at your door room the final morning and simply leaving is always a great thing.The restaurant is average and quite overpriced, but I guess this is somewhat usual in this kind of properties. It was definitely what I like the least. You don't need to pay such prices for breakfast or dinner, especially considering you will find plenty of fantastic places to eat at reasonable prices in nearby North Beach and all over the city.The location is the very best I could personally ask for. I understand that those who visit San Francisco for the first time usually prefer to stay in Union Square (which, by the way, is within walking distance) or in Fisherman's Wharf (which I would never recommend), but, for me, the area around the Omni is the very best. for the following reasons:a) The area is very nice and you're within walking distance to places such as Union Square, North Beach, Chinatown, the Embarcadero, the cable car turntable, and so on.b) It is very quiet, as it is located at the edge of the financial district.So, when I have enough budget for it, the Omni is, for all those reasons and more, my personal choice in San Francisco, my very favourite city.

<Content>Our 3rd stay Superior hotel, beautifully decorated for Christmas. As stated, this was the 3rd stay at the Omni for my wife and I, stayed Dec. 15 - 19. We love San Francisco, the bay, the Pacific Ocean, The Golden Gate Bridge and staying at the Omni. Central, quiet and secure location in the financial district with a superb staff that starts with the doorman and includes all levels of staff and service personel. Rooms are fairly spacious (375 - 400 sq ft) and very comfortable. Stayed in a Signature room, which are located on the 16th floor. The hotel bar on the first floor looks out on the corner of California and Montgomery streets and can be crowded and noisey, but after 7p the business crowd moves on and it becomes an intimate spot to spend the evening and enjoy a gargle or two or three with the wife. Always treat ourselves to a dinner at Bob's Steakhouse. The steaks are outstanding, but as others have commented, the default vegatable is a giant cooked, glazed carrot, which is great if you like cooked carrots. I don't, so just order sans the carrot. Carrots aside, wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else in San Francisco.

<Content>Great hotel for an anniversary stay My husband and I decided to splurge on a nice hotel for our third wedding anniversary. We live only an hour from San Francisco, but wanted to eat a nice dinner there, plus we had tickets for a football game the next afternoon. We got a decent price for a one-night stay, and we got more than our money's worth at this very luxurious hotel! The staff was incredibly friendly, the standard room was very comfortable, and it's an overall beautiful place. I liked the complimentary bath robes, and the toiletries in the bathroom smelled wonderful! The bar/lounge is nice, although the bartender on shift at the time was a little stiff. Check-in was quick, although we checked in online ahead of time and they didn't have our folio ready. Loved the warm apple cider and cookies they had available for guests downstairs! The hotel is in a great location near Union Square, although we didn't do any sight-seeing since we just had dinner and the football game in mind for our stay. I can't speak to the restaurant (we had breakfast at Starbucks a couple of blocks away) or the business traveler amenities, but I'm sure they're quite nice.NOTE: Parking is a MAJOR expense at San Francisco hotels, and this one is no exception! We did our homework and found a 24-hour city lot one block up the street to park our car - St. George's Square lot, I believe. We only paid $7 for the night (although I think the cashier made an error...it still would have been cheaper than the $45 the hotel would have charged us for valet).

<Content>Hotel stay part was great, marred by concierge and steakhouse We were there the day after Thanksgiving. It had a nice upscale feel for a reasonable rate of about $160 for a regular room (Thanksgiving weekend). Perfect if you want something nice that is kid friendly. Our family had a room, and the other family we were traveling with had 2 rooms with connecting doors. Both of our families have children ages 5 to 11. We loved the pretty hotel, decked out for the holidays. We loved its proximity to Chinatown (5 mins walk), and around 10 min walk to Union Square. It was a block away from a Walgreens and McDonalds, which is convenient if you have kids. The children loved their Omni backpacks and the complimentary milk and cookies. The staff is nice and attentive, they clean the room 2x/day. Downside is the concierge. They gave wrong information on restaurants twice - once they gave the wrong address to a restaurant they recommended at the Fisherman's Wharf. Another time they assured (and refused to double check) that a restaurant will be open for Thanksgiving dinner. When we got there, the restaurant was closed. They also were not aware of a fun pack that the Omni loans to kids that contains games and activities and such.For the restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steakhouse... It was ok. One thing a steak purist would frown on is that the steak comes to you with a humongous giant single carrot right in the middle of the plate as if it is the main dish. The steak and the potatoes are to its left and right. Also, the carrot was dripping in glaze that contaminated our steak. When we inquired about this, they said that it is a Bob's Steakhouse signature (putting the carrot in the middle), but you can always ask to put it on the side.

<Content>Great Hotel in a Great City My partner and I stayed at the Omni for a long weekend, we are former residents of San Francisco and are well acquainted with The City and all it has to offer. The Omni is ideally located, within walking distance to Union Square (great shopping), Belden Place (great dining) and the Cable Car stops right outside the front door of the hotel. We found the staff to be friendly, accommodating and quite professional, the hotel itself has the feel of a smaller boutique hotel and is an excellent choice for lodging. Definitely plan to stay here again in the near future.

<Content>Top San Francisco Hotel Two nights on business. Second time at this excellent hotel. Consider this one of the best chain hotels I've stayed in and one of the best in Sand Francisco. All requests made during reservations are met by the Omni. On the way to airport left cell phone in limo and Lex Doherty, the excellent concierge, arranged for the phone to be sent by FED EX to my home the following morning. Hotel has added touches such as a creative way of giving you a semi-complimentary continental breakfast... coffee and juice are free... with minimal charges for extras. CB is delivered to your room with newspapers without all the formality of room service. They leave at door so you don't have to answer immediately early in the AM. Excellent location and very convient and friendly staff.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel A+ The hotel is beautiful and the location could not be more perfect! However it is the staff at the Omni that makes this hotel above the rest. Upon our arrival the front desk assisted my daughter and myself to plan tours, directions and transportation for our stay. Joey suggested not pushed on several choices based on our interests. As we were in the first few minutes of unpacking in our room, Joey sent complimentary refreshments via roomservice. The extra attention the entire staff including the housekeeping service was beyond our expectations. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. Chinatown and Union Square are within walking distance. Other transportation we purchased the 3 day muni pass and rode the trolley and cable cars to every destination on our list. The suggested tours of Muir Woods and Napa Wine Country were awesome. Tower Tours picked us up from the hotel front door, they were well worth every cent. The tour guide named Will was outstanding. It is recommended 100%. We will certainly return to the Omni for our next visit to this fantastic city and would not even consider another hotel. Although we did not dine at Bob's, I regret not having done so. It will be on the list the next visit!

<Content>bland  we had great expectations regarding our stay at this hotel after reading all the reviews on tripadvisor. We were also able to book 3 nights at a very good rate through omni's website. There was nothing wrong with this hotel except that it was exceptionally bland. It was comfortable (but so are courtyard hotels)  clean (as you would expect) but it had no zing.Not that we were looking for nightlife but, like much of america, it was so processed it was boring. The front desk staff where ok but lacked any connection with their guests (this is, I admit, very common in the states - have a happy day!)When we arrived to the room both my wife  I were glad that we had only paid $135USD not the usual $250-$400, as that was what it was worth.We had just come from the Signature MGM in Las Vegas which knocked us out!

<Content>Great Location, Nice Hotel I stayed at the Omni in San Francisco 11/10/07 for 1 night. I have been to San Francisco many, many times and this rates as one of the best hotels I've stayed at. They have a great location, the rooms were above average, and they have a restaurant that is definitely better than most hotel restaurants. (Bob's Chophouse)What prompted me to stay at this Omni for the first time in San Francisco was a free upgrade room pass I received for my horrible stay at the Omni in Austin, TX. I swore after that experience that I wouldn't stay again at an Omni, but wanted to use the upgrade and liked this location. Well, the upgrade (and what I was told I'd receive when I made the reservation) would have been an upgraded courtyard view. That didn't happen...we were given the inferior room anyway with an alley view so they didn't even utilize the upgrade or give us the room promised. If that hadn't occurred my experience would have been rated as excellent.

<Content>Overall a great place to stay We stayed at the Omni Hotel a family of 4 including 2 small children, for 2 nights. On arrival my children were given a backpacks with gifts from the hotel which they were delighted with, checkin was also very quick and staff friendly. Our room was a deluxe room it was very comfortable, classically decorated and very nicely finished. The lobby area of the hotel is also very grand with beautiful chandliers and staircase. The hotel is a very short walk from china town where we enjoyed a meal one night, the only downside to the hotel was the valet parking, A call had to be made to request your car 20 minutes prior, we did this 4 times during our stay and twice had to wait another 10 minutes also. Parking rates are expensive at 50 dollars a night.This aside the hotel and our room were lovely and all dealings we had with the staff , we found them to be helpful and friendly.

<Content>excellent The staff and hotel were superb. Customer service from every staff member was amazing - recommendations for dining and attractions were right on - never too busy to help. The location of the hotel was terrific for walking to many of the prime tourist areas - safe and secure. Our room on the 5th floor was opulent.

<Content>Excellent service This is an excellent quality hotel right in the heart of SF. The service from all staff was superb, location good, bar  restaurant great and so on!!This was just a quick one night stay before flying back to Europe. I was intrigued by the most romantic hotel in SF label when searching as we were at the end of our Honeymoon. Truth is it's a chain hotel that pretends not to seek out the corporate clients even though there were plenty of them. However, unlike so many other big name chains, the Omni seems to treat it's private guests very specially going that little step further for customer service. (Too often I find the chains trying to get the corporate money and just neglect those of us that want a nice hotel).Lots of nice little touches too numerous to mention here means I shall return here (and to any other Omni).And was it romantic? - Well this is not a boutique hotel - it's a large-ish city centre hotel. But given those constraints - surprisngly yes!

<Content>Great Rooms, Great Management, OK Location (for us) We stayed at the Omni based on reviews and overall pricing compared to other similarly rated large Hotels in San Francisco. We arrived quite late on a Thursday evening (9:30pm Pacific) due to our flight from Atlanta. We had booked online and I had asked for an upper level no-smoking room. There was no availability for either unfortunately I was told and initially we were placed in a smoking-permitted floor and room. I called the front-desk to ask if any accomodation could be made. The night manager, a wonderful person named Ellen K., indicated she would have us moved to another deluxe room that was non-smoking if we didn't mind moving to another room on our third day/night's stay. This was fine with us. Ellen subsequently called back a few minutes later and said the third night would be an upgraded deluxe suite room on an upper floor because of the trouble (at no extra charge of course). The entire stay was extremely nice, the BellHop area held an extra bag for us for three days while we went to Big Sur in a Miata and provided the bag as needed. Overall a great customer service environment. And the rooms/beds/furnishing was top-notch. The only possible knock is that the hotel is in the financial district. The night-life areas, such as Union Square and North Beach, are within a few blocks walking distance so this is a minor point-of-note. Don't wear heels like my wife did though.

<Content>Top Notch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The hotel was top notch all the way. From express check in upon late evening arrival, to complimentary coffee, juice and paper delivered every morning to the room.The room was elegant and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was fantastic with wonderful toiletries.The workout room was private, just the right size and had complimentary water and fruit at all times.To top it all off, upon checkout they offered to take us via their Lincoln Town Car to our car rental agency in lieu of us taking a taxi.Would definetely stay here again!

<Content>Horrible Experience with the Management My stay at the Omni San Francisco started out poorly when I requested a double room (with two double beds) but received a queen room (with one queen). I asked for a rollaway bed, and ages later received a ridiculous inflatable bed not suitable for a comfortable night鈥檚 sleep. I managed, but it was very uncomfortable. The worst part, however, came after my stay when I had a $300 charge on my credit card. I called to inquire about the charge and they proceeded to tell me it was for room damage. I had no idea what they were talking about and after further investigation, they told me there was a hole in the wall of the room we stayed in. I of course asked for the manager to call me, and was extremely taken aback at how I was treated. He was pompous and rude and immediately accused me of putting the hole in the wall. He assured me there was no way his staff would have missed the hole and rented out a room in such a state. I told him that they did, and that my friend (who I immediately phoned afterwards) actually saw the hole 鈥?but forgot to mention it to me (it was at the bottom of the wall near the baseboard in the hallway near the door, making it easy to miss). After I relayed this to the manager, he made a snide remark about how guests of his hotel are high-class and would call and complain if they received a room with a hole in the wall. Having no idea of the consequences of not reporting the hole, my friend didn't feel he needed to say anything and thus I never knew about it. The manager was horribly condescending and from his last remark implied that I was not a high-class guest and 鈥榙idn鈥檛 belong鈥?at his hotel. I again assured him that the hole was not from me and he had no proof. He again insisted that his staff does not make mistakes and would never rent out a room with a hole in the wall. I was not going to budge and insisted that he reverse the charge. After going back and forth for awhile, he finally succumbed and reversed the charge. However, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I should not have had to defend my honor, and I knew he thought I was lying even after he reversed the charge. Even though I got the charge reversed, I still didn鈥檛 feel like I won. This hotel should not be four-star, as four-star hotels would never treat their guests like this. The Omni San Francisco is a third-rate hotel with mediocre customer service and horrible management. Yes, it was bad luck that I got that room, but my experience with the management was enough to make me write this review and encourage travelers to stay somewhere else.

<Content>Excellent Service I have to say I am probably one of the most pickiest individuals with food and service. I will say the Omni surpassed my expectations. The rooms are nice enough (the beds, furniture, and TV) could be updated with more modern furnishings, but after that, the hotel is not only in a great location but their staff is extremely customer oriented and surpasses what you would get at any other hotel. I had one small problem with a smoker being in the room before me and the staff bent over backwards to get the problem corrected and comped a breakfast (with me asking) for the hassle. The check in was very easy and the food and drink in the bar was very good.I was very pleased and would stay there again.

<Content>Great staff, great location Location - - just a few blocks from Nob Hill (Cable Car Museum, Grace Cathedral and fabulous views), China Town and Union Square! The cable car stops at the corner just outside the hotel.The architecture in the Financial district is also gorgeous. That said, it is the Financial district and there is not much open on the weekend. (even Starbucks is closed on Sat and Sun!) You'll need to walk a few blocks for a coffee on the weekend.Staff - - The front desk staff is pleasant and very helpful. The door staff is fantastic. They give stellar directions, hail cabs in driving rain and even secured us a ride in an 'off duty' limo. Housekeeping is quick and thorough and very nice.

<Content>Terrific hotel in San Francisco Omni is in the business district of San Francisco on California St. The room was very comfortable for 2, clean and quiet. Service was excellent. Bob's Chop House had breakfast that ran $25 but there is a Subway across the street. The restaurant seems to cater to the Business Lunch crowd. The concierge recommended a 3 day transit pass for $18. We walked out the door and literally stepped on a cable car. In other areas people were waiting 20 minutes to do the same.Concierge also recommended we take a city tour from Tower Tours . It too was excellentI'd stay there again.

<Content>Excellent hotel in quiet location Hotel lived up to the Omni reputation from check in through to check out. Room was clean and standard high - toiletries were top notch!! Location is in the financial district so not too much on the doorstep but all within easy distance and trolley right outside the door. No panhandlers outside which for SF is a blessing!Restaurant looked good and is recommended in guides but we didn't eat there as it is very pricy. The bar was expensive too but cosy and relaxing.Staff were very helpful and you could even buy a MUNI pass (highly recommend for value and convenience) at the desk.We were celebrating our 10th anniversary and at check in I was given a red rose and in our room was complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Beautiful touch and greatly appreciated after a long flight.

<Content>Solid Four Star Property Great location on California Street, centrally located to the financial district, Chinatown, and Union Square. It's right across the street from the Bank of America building, which helps you find the hotel if you're not familiar with San Francisco streets.Check in was very professional and courteous. I was able to secure an early check in at 10:00 am. It's a mid-sized property, compact, yet business smart and understated luxurious. Getting from your room to one of the conference rooms takes only a couple of minutes at most. Elevators are fast. Rooms are average sized, very comfortable, with nice bedding. Lighting is excellent for in-room working. Bathroom was upscale with granite counters, marble floor, large mirror, nice lighting, make up mirror, scale, and a roomy bathtub. Upscale bath amenities are provided. The banquet food was excellent and well-prepared. Did not try room service or restaurants. Express checkout made my departure smooth and quick.

<Content>Four stars feels like five... My husband and I stayed at the Omni for our first anniversary and loved it! The staff was SO nice from the moment we walked in the door. They were happy to help and full of information.The location is perfect. It's an easy walk to China Town and Little Italy. It's also about a 10 minute walk to Embarcadero shopping.The rooms were great. We had a small suite, and the toilettries were upscale products that I've only seen in Neiman Marcus. The rooms are very clean and the bed was really comfortable.The hotel restaurant is Bob's Steak and Chop House. There is no wireless internet available - in the room or in the lobby.I would absolutely recommend the Omni to anyone interested in a fairly luxurious hotel experience.

<Content>Faultless After two weeks travelling we stayed for three nights here. Uniformly good service from staff. Rooms were welcoming  spacious without being too impersonal. Teenagers got cookies each night, we got an ice-bucket filled and chocolates.Good clean bathrooms. Interconnecting rooms a plus. Surprisingly quiet for central location. Walkable to main shopping  to China town restaurants. On cable car route. Don't bother with valet parking it is only one block to easy parking. Take a cable for the internet. Small but pleasant bar.

<Content>Excellent Hotel My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at the Omni in San Francisco and we were so impressed with this hotel, we were compelled to write about it. The price is so affordable that you really don't expect to be 'wowed' by the hotel. But our expectations were far exceeded.The service of every staff member we came in contact with was exemplary. The Front Desk personnel were so helpful in recommending restaurants, transportation, etc. They even booked a (future) dinner for us at a restaurant in Napa Valley, which was the next leg of our vacation.The Front Desk personnel, Bellboys, the Doormen, the Housekeeping staff---every single person treated us like royalty. Our room was perfectly clean when we arrived, the front desk staff went out of their way to see that we had a room with a view, and they always followed up by phone to make sure we received whatever service we had requested. Additionally, the location of the Omni is ABSOLUTELY excellent. We walked EVERYWHERE. To the Ferry Building every day, to Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, to Ghiaradelli Square, to Lombard Street, to dinner each night. We never had to take a taxi or other type of transportation. Granted, some of the walks were steep uphill climbs, but that was part of the inate charm of the city. What a fantastic, albeit short time we had in San Francisco. And many thanks to the Omni for making our stay so thoroughly enjoyable. Steve and Tammy Lunn, Laytonsville, Maryland

<Content>Great location The hotel had a great location - we walked to North Beach, China Town, the Ferry building and shopping in downtown and felt safe in the area. They switched out their room service menus 1/2 way through our stay and the prices went from reasonable to pretty expensive. R/S was always on time and they were friendly.Our room was small with two double beds, one chair and a desk but it was well kept and housekeeping was very good. Our room was by an elevator on the 8th floor so I was a bit worried that it would be noisy but it was very quite. Service was good in the hotel but sometimes the door staff was a bit too casual.We ate one night in the bar off of the lobby and the food was good as was the service. We also ate at the Market Bar down by the Ferry building twice - once for lunch and once for brunch. It was great and had inside and outside seating available. The Ferry building also had some great gourmet food stores and retail shops. We had dinner at Home in the Lower Haight area and it was very good. It had simple food and a nice atmosphere.Overall the hotel was a great jumping off location to most points in the city and it was a hassle free stay in a safe location.

<Content>Perfect Service at the Omni We stayed at the Omni San Francisco for 3 nights at the Labour Day weekend.It was the last stop of our honeymoon to the US and we couldn't have made a better choice.We were upgraded to a Bay View Room on the top floor (17th floor).My wife was given a rose at check in, they brought us a bottle of champaign and chocolate-coated strawberries and had arranged our bathrobes with another rose the first evening.Room service was simply outstanding.I highly recommend joining the free OMNI Select Guest programme which entitles you to complimentary WIFI, beverage and newsparer service.Staff was charming, attentive and helpful with the exception of one gruffy bellman.Dined once at Bob's Steakhouse (belonging to the hotel), waiters so so, but great food, had a perfect filet mignon.Cable Car line runs just in front of the house.The only minor drawbacks:- WIFI service doesn't work on the 17th floor which they somehow forgot to mention at check-in (however, as Select guest you can use the cable internet free of charge)- walls are quite thin (the same old story everywhere...)- parking: as usual in SF, street parking is a mess and the hotel charges a hefty 40$ valet fee for 24 hours + 6$ city tax.Hotel is within walking distance of Ferry Building, Embaracadero, Coit Tower, Market Street, Chinatown and SOMA.Would highly recommend and always return there.

<Content>Travel Agent's review My husband and I just returned from a wonderful 4 nights at the Omni, and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel.Arrival - we opted for public transportation, taking the BART from SFO airport to Montgomery st and walked up the street to the hotel (maybe a 10 minute walk) It cost us $5.15 per person rather than $42 for a taxi from the airport, and it took about 40 minutes.Check in/out - I had notified the hotel that we would be arriving early (10am) and we received our room right away. We were also permitted to check out late, at 1pm.Staff - were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. I had notified the hotel that it was my husband's birthday, and they sent up a bottle of wine (which was pretty good), a fruit and cheese platter and a birthday card. We had nightly turndown service and were given a weather report for the next day, and chocolates.Room - beautifully decorated room, comfortable king size bed, nice ammenities in the bathroom. There was a desk and an armchair with an ottoman - perfect for relaxing and putting your feet up after a long day of walking!Location - in the financial district, but within walking distance to all the sights (if you like to walk!) The hotel is very close to North Beach (Little Italy) and China town, where we enjoyed a few meals. The ferry building/market was a short 10 minute walk, and pier 39  Fisherman's Wharf were about a 25-30 minute walk away. We walked everywehre, and never found anywhere too far or more of a 1/2 hour walk. Concierge gave us maps and directions to all the places that we wanted to visit. There were also a few good nightclubs and pubs just around the corner from us.* Sign up for the free Signature guest program - you get juice and a paper every morning and nightly turndown service with a chocolate!Sights / recommendations* Alcatraz - we did the night tour (booked in advance), it was cool, and kinda spooky to be there at night.* Pier 39 - the sealions were one of our highlights, you could watch them play / fight for hours! We ate at Bubba Gump's (just for the novelty of it) but the food was lousy and overpriced.* Fisherman's Wharf - nice to walk around, lots of souvenir shops and fresh seafood stands.* Giradelli Square - go for the sundaes, they are worth the $8!* Lombard St - worth the walk up this hill / crooked street* Tonga Room - just up the street (hill) from the hotel (at the Fairmont Hotel) we went for the $8 happy hour buffet, well worth a visit for an early dinner, and the atmosphere is pretty cool, especially when it rains.* AT  T park - saw a Giants game (bought tickets there), what a nice park, with beautiful views of the bay (if you get the right seats - we were on club level)* Ferry Building / Market - there was always some kind of street performance going on there.We'd definately return to the Omni!

<Content>Excellent Stay Stayed here with my husband for one night as an anniversary weekend getaway. The hotel was clean and the lobby is gorgeous. Reminded me of the Titanic movie with its 1920's decor. The rooms are spacious...a bit old, but very clean. The front desk was friendly and the hotel really does go out of its way to make you feel welcomed. Upon check in, my husband I were greeted with a rose for me and congrats on our wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to the 17th floor and given a room with a view of the bay. Nice! Then hotel sent a martini glass full of chocolate truffles and a small bottle of red wine with a card that wished us happy anniversary. Totally cute and a pleasant surprise.The hotel is defintely worth its value.

<Content>Omni is heaven The Omni was great! The room was clean, comfortable and the service at the hotel was second to none. We loved the coffee/juice and paper deliverey to the room each morning. The evening turn down service was perfect at the end of a long day! I very much recommend the Omni and we will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful hotel I booked the Omni based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor and the Hotel was even more amazing than all of the reviews would have you believe. The rooms are beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive and helpful and the room service was fantastic. It's also extremely convenient to the cable car and Chinatown. I would definitely return to the Omni San Fran.

<Content>Downtown Hotel But with a little more soul than most This could be just a standard downtown hotel, but it's better than average. The staff is friendly, the housekeeping staff leaves you cute notes, they gave us a rose because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary...The location is very central. The cable cars stop outside and it's only five blocks to the Ferry Terminal Building.It exceeded my expectations.

<Content>The Omni is fantastic What a great stay. We had signed up for the Select Guest membership and received complimentary beverages in the morning and evening turndown service. We got to check in early - like 9 am - and were always given great directions and advice for siteseeing. Our room was in great condition - really clean. The location was great too, as it was within walking distance of transportation, shopping, dining, etc. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Perfect Omni Weekend Getaway I love staying in wonderful hotels, so when my boyfriend and I chose to escape the Los Angeles heatwave and enjoy a romantic getaway in San Francisco, The Omni was the perfect choice. We drove and arrived at 3:00 am and were greeted even in the wee hours with a perfect check in and a smile. Our room was on the 16th floor and had great architectural views of nearby buildings. The room was elegant and cozy with top notch Molton Brown bath products. The hotel location is close to everything and you can walk to all points of interest such as Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach, SFMOMA, Yuerba Buena Gardens, etc. Weather was perfect, concierge made dinner reservations to the Carnelian Room for us on the 52nd Floor of the B of A Building which has spectacular views of SF. It was perfect. We took a trolley from the wharf back to the hotel and were dropped off right in front of the Omni. It doesn't get much better than that!

<Content>Great hotel and location. This hotel is in a great location, on a cable car line, near to china town and opposite a great restaurant in the bank of america builing. Our room was of good quality fixtures and fittings, staff were very helpful, with a nice bar area looking onto the street.Hotel is about a 10 minute waalk to union square for shopping, 15 minute walk to the nearest pier area and bay bridge.Fishermans wharf is a cab or bus ride. Book alcatraz prison tour before you arrive in san fran. Open top otur bus of city worth doing as well.No free parking at hotel, have to use car parks opposite, which are not cheap.

<Content>Elegant hotel and amazing steak restaurant! We stopped here for three nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel looks very elegant and the front desk staff are extremely welcoming. They are very happy to offer you advice about 'the sights' and will make every effort to make you feel a valued customer. The price, which is not excessive, was justified in the quality. I'd told them that it was our honeymoon when I booked the room. When we arrived we had been upgraded to a beautiful room on the 16th (out of 17) floor. When we got to the room we were greeted with huge strawberries dipped in dark chocolate, chilled sparkling wine, red wine, fresh fruit, mineral water all dressed with orchid heads and a hand written note congratulating us. It was really wonderful.The room was a very good size, bathroom fantastic - Molton Brown products. Bed was extremely comfortable with very good quality linen. The whole hotel was very clean and the housekeeping staff clearly took pride in their work. There was even a note welcoming us to the hotel from the member of staff responsible for our room- very nice touch.We had breakfast and dinner in Bob's Steakhouse. The breakfast was nice but nothing outstanding. Service on both occasions was good. The steak however was simply the best either of us have ever tasted! We both had the fillet mignon, it was cooked perfectly to our request. Fabulous.I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will happily book hotels within this chain again.

<Content>Excellent Stay The Omni San Francisco really was absolutely wonderful. We got a great deal on their website, and we were really thrilled with the room, the lobby, the bar, and the location. The hotel is just a short cable car ride to almost all the tourist attractions, while also in a very safe area. We were very impressed and would definitely recommend it.As an added bonus, I accidentally left my wedding band on the nightstand the morning of our checkout, I finally noticed it when we were driving down the coast on the Pacific Coast Highway...I called the front desk, they connected me to housekeeping, and housekeeping overnighted it to our next hotel in Monterey that very day. Exceptional service.

<Content>If only other hotels can learn from this Omni Our family of four stayed at the Omni San Francisco for a too short 4-day weekend. We have stayed at a number of other hotels (including the Ritz-Carlton) over the years and can honestly say that this was the absolute best experience we have ever had. Everyone on staff was incredible and made us feel that we were the only guests there even though the hotel was sold out! This is the only hotel to be in San Francisco!

<Content>Easy walk to various sites: Union Square by muni, cable car, BART After reading the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor, we used HotWire for our one night at the Omni, at a reasonable rate. (less than $200). We experienced the same outstanding service as previous posts mentioned, so I will try not to repeat information, except to recognize our concierge Justin Seeto who sent chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne to our room while we were out, to congratulate us on our anniversary.We called the Front Desk to thank him for the treats. Later, (most likely) our concierge also surprised us with a small bottle of wine, along with more chocolates, probably delivered during turndown service.I had also signed up for Omni's free Select Membership benefits online: i.e.complimentary morning newspaper - notify Front Desk which one, complimentary morning beverages - write on Breakfast menu tag and hang outside door before going to sleep, late check out - after 12 noon but notify Front Desk, evening turndown service, etc.We parked at St. Mary's Garage (entrance on left-side, 1/2 block before California, while driving north on Kearny). $32 for 24 hrs. No in-out privileges, but we didn't need our car since we could take public transportation everywhere, or walk a few blocks to Union Square/Chinatown/North Beach/Market St.We walked less than 10 min. to the Embarcadero stop on the F line (SFMTA's Muni ) to Pier 29/Chestnut St. to enjoy a dinner  show at Teatro Zinzanni. We enjoyed this European-style cabaret, focused on fun through comedy, music, Cirque du Soleil-style feats, audience participation/interaction, and a 5-course dinner. Since the seats are arranged in concentric circles, all views are good. We hardly noticed that 3 hours had passed when the show ended as we ate dessert.We also saw the da Vinci exhibit at the Metreon (4th/Mission, south of Market), closing Dec. 31. The range of inventions displayed and re-created was astounding, especially the precursors to modern inventions. If you show a BART ticket until Aug. 31, you get a $4 discount off the adult admission price.We may take our kids next time for an Omni stay, or go by ourselves again!

<Content>Lots of Class From the minute you step into the lobby and the eager (but not overly) front desk staff greet you, you know you're in for a great stay.The lobby is beautiful with seating areas for cocktails or dining... all sparkling and impressive. Great steakhouse and bar located in the hotel too...Right on California Street on the Nob Hill cable car line, you can close the double glazed windows and not hear a thing, or slide em up a little for some ambient SF street noise... it's great.The room I had was a king bedded room in front of the hotel on the 11th floor with a view of the Bank of America building. Great pillows! Firm but comfortable bed. The bathroom was marble and antiqued. The amenities were awesome (Pecksniffs) and just everything about the room was classy. It is a very smart choice in SF compared to some of the other long standing Nob Hill establishments who have seemed to take a turn for the worse in recent years (Stanford Court, Fairmont, Huntington).A great business or adult getaway hotel.

<Content>Fantastic !!! We just returned from a long weekend visit to San Francisco celebrating our 36th wedding anniversary and stayed at the Omni. The room was beautiful and impeccably clean. The service and accommodations were wonderful. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Since it was our anniversary, the maid had arranged towels in the shape of a heart with a nice little heart shaped note beside it. Our concierge Vida Lau at check-in congratulated us on our anniversary and said that something would be sent up to us later. Well, upon our return after a little walk in China Town there was a small bottle of champagne chilled with glasses along with some chocolate covered strawberries. And Vida had sent along a little note. Whenever we wanted to take a tour or ask about transportation either the doorman or the concierge were so very helpful. We had our breakfasts and one dinner at Bob's restaurant there and the meals were wonderful and so was the service. My husbnad and I agree that this by far was not only one of our favorite vacations but these were the best accommodations and service that we have EVER had at a hotel.

<Content>Loved the Omni We stayed at the Omni only 2 nights and have never been to San Francisco. The hotel is very plush and well designed. The only problem is the walls are not thick enough to drown out noise from other rooms. We heard our neighbors come in at 1 am and they were quite noisey. The location is in the middle of many attractions so we were able to walk to most everything - although it's quite hilly! Dorian was a major attribute to our wonderful stay. He is a bell guy who was cheerful, wonderful to be around and gave us lots of useful information about a city we hadn't been to before. You've got to meet him! Overall, this is a hotel worth staying at!

<Content>Perfection What an amazing experience! Staying at the Omni was the cherry on top of our stay. Excellent service, impeccable room, and fabulous location. The staff is really great too. They even left my daughter a cookie and milk in the room our first night there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for luxury in San Francisco. Short walk from both Union Square shops and Chinatown.

<Content>Completely exceeded our high expectations We just returned after spending several days at the Omni. We booked the hotel based on in part the reviews we read here.The hotel is quite beautiful, as we expected, but what we didn't expect was the service. We've stayed in many beautiful hotels, but no one has ever treated us as well as we were treated here.The staff went out of their way to help us, giving us hints that we didn't think to ask about, planning tips that we didn't know about and overall treated us as if we were the only guests instead of one of many.Aside from the great service, the restaurant was delicious and location was perfect.What a great stay!

<Content>1st Omni stay - Great! We stayed at the Omni for our wedding anniversary. Beautiful hotel in the financial district, because of that the weekends are fairly quiet because the businesses are not working. Chinatown is a quick walk and not too far down to the piers. We would stay here again.

<Content>Great price The location was pretty good, the rooms were very nice, but the view was so-so. We had a view of another building located behind the Omni. I can't complain though cause we got it for an awesome rate off travelzoo.com.I would stay here again!

<Content>Flawless Booked a room using Priceline and was lucky enough to get the Omni San Francisco. The hotel pays attention to every detail, and I mean EVERY detail. Upon arrrival at the centrally located hotel, we were greeted by the doorman and others willing to help with baggage. There was a bit of a line at the check in desk and one of the bellmen quickly realized the need for additional resources. After advising those waiting he would secure additional help, he did just that. Soon the line was gone and everyone checked in quickly. The reservation was under my name but they allowed my wife to check in while I parked the car, simply asking that I return to the desk with my ID and credit card at some point durign our stay. Now that is service.When we arrived at the well appointed room, there was a hand written note from the housekeeper welcoming us. That is a first ever!That evening the room was turned down, chocolates were left and the television was tuned to a station that was entirely soothing music and beautiful scenes. Again, what an amazing touch.When we returned to the hotel on day 2, another hand written note from the housekeeper indicating she hoped we had a wonderful day, this time the note was personalized to us (vs. Dear Guest). We visited the bar as well and while the drinks were quite pricey ($15 for a martini) the atmosphere and service were perfect. I would highly recommend the Omni. Many others before me have given high ratings and I completely concurr. Excellent, absolutely excellent.

<Content>Consistent Quality at the Omni Stayed here July 6-8. Though this hotel is ostensibly in the financial district it is very conveniently located for walking (at the base of Nob Hill) and to public transportation (cable car, for the patient) and BART (take it to the 16th street stop to go to Tartine Bakery at 18th  Guerrero). Pleasant walk to SF MOMA, AME Restaurant at the St. Regis Hotel (recommend) and Bong Su Restaurant. Hotel is representative of the attention to detail and quality that seem to be consistent with the Omni chain. Hotel staff are outgoing and pleasant. Check-in is effortlessly efficient. With Special Guest number (only sign up is required), there is free internet in the room. They also provide free beverages in the morning with this SG #. Opening window provides fresh air in the room, though the temperature control in the room is perfect. Nice bathroom amenities - lighted make-up mirror. Superior comfortable bed. Bathroom is a touch tiny. Hotel Manager informs me the hotel is planning a full renovation in 2008, but honestly, everything there is perfectly nice. Did not have an opportunity to use the work out facilities, but they are provided. Check out was automatic and accurate. Car waiting to provide airport transportation - nice not to have to wait for a taxi (and SF taxis make NYC taxis seem positively hygienic).

<Content>Best Hotel in SF  Best hotel I've stayed in for a long while. Suberb professional service (though I wish there was a doorman opening the door each time I walked through.) Spotless modern class. Easy check in and out and no problems w/ the hotel at all. Location was alright, not that close to Union Sq though.Room size i estimate 300 sq ft. A little narrower than I would've liked but the beds were super comfy. you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Excellent Stay We have just return from our stay in Omni. Hotel was beautiful. Service was unbelievable. Bathrobe and slippers were provided. Everyone was extremely friendly. Very convenient location, in front of the cable car line, but very quiet on the weekend. We walked to Chinatown, the Coit Tower, Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf. You can also take a bus to all the tourist attractions. Great shower in the bathroom. Loved our stay.

<Content>The Omni...beautiful and convenient The Omni suited my family of four. The room and hotel were beautiful. The level of service given by every employee was unsurpassed. We found the location to be very convenient. Many restaurants were in the area including the resaurants in the foot -traffic -only alley a couple of blocks away. Union Square was within easy walking distance for my husband, me, and daughters, 18 and 20. We took the Powell cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. We took a bus to the Japanese tea garden from Union Square.. We also visited Haight-Asbury from the same location. The Market, Montgomery St. BART station is a few blocks from the hotel and is very convenient for getting to and from the airport.It may be a bit more difficult to get around from this location with small children in tow, but for us, it was perfect!

<Content>Great choice if you can get a great rate, otherwise maybe not Found a great deal for Memorial Day weekend....spent five nights here for $139/night (plus taxes).At this rate it was great and well worth my money, otherwise I don't think I'd come here again when rates reach $350+Lobby is fantastic, but as other reviews say, the glamour stops here. That doesn't mean the rest of the hotel is bad.Rooms: Standard rooms are small, but do include a nice size desk. Views from the room are just city block views, nothing exciting. Bathroom was very nice, with marble countertop and shower surround. Room staff left little well-wishing notes and Ghiradelli chocolate squares on the bed each night, a nice touch.Staff: Front desk staff was very helpful.Food: stay away from the breakfast...overpriced like most hotels of this type ($22 for continental breakfast? not for me.) I ordered room service from Bob's Chop House, which is apparently well known in SF as a good steak house. It was pretty good!Location: Easy walk to Ferry Building/Chinatown/Union Square. Beware, there's very little in the way of eating/shopping around the hotel since it's in the financial district....so if you find yourself in the mood for a quick eat, then you'll have to walk somewhere else or eat in the hotel.My next trip I'll probably stay in Union Square instead.

<Content>Another great stay at the Omni!!!!!! This was our fourth stay at the Omni and again was not disappointed. On this trip though we also stayed at the SF Marriot due to a buisness commitment. I have to say that we thought the SF Marriot was big, cold and impersonal as compared to the Omni. We loved the cozy feeling of the Omni---smaller hotel, quiet area on the weekend and not bad during the week, a cable car right out front, North Beach a short walk away, the compimentary beverages in the morning, the hot apple cider in the evenings and the fact that we saw the same staff everyday during our stay. They got to know us and were very helpful and attentive to our travel plans. Not so at the SF Marriot! The Deluxe room was well appointed but not luxurious. The bathroom was well light and had a make-up mirror as well (something my girlfriend wanted to point out). We also ate dinner at Bob's Steakhouse and I have to say that was one of the best steaks that I have eaten in a long while----be aware that the prices are not for those on a budget but if you want to splurge then it is well worth it. For the price [though the Select Guest program] the Omni is well worth it. FYI, we have stayed in a Deluxe room to a Signature room from the 6th to 17th floor. We preferred the deluxe room on the 6th floor as we actually enjoyed hearing the clangging of the cable car bell. If you prefer quit then get a room above the 8th floor. Note that the views from the Signature rooms could be blocked by nearby buildings. Overall the Omni has everything I have come to enjoy about it and is our hotel of choice in SF.

<Content>Beautiful  I loved the Omni Hotel. My boyfirend and I decided to vacation in our own city and treat ourselves to a luxury hotel for a couple nights. The Omni was fabulous. The staff was so friendly and helpful, the rooms comfortable and very clean, th bathrooms all marble. It is located in the Financial district which is a bit dead on the weekends but it is a 4 block walk to the Embarcadero and a quick cab ride to Union Square. I will definitely stay at the Omni again.

<Content>Great Hotel Picked Omni from previous reviews... Some may say being on edge of financial district is quiet, well No! We experienced a Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Saturday was very quiet to get going as most local deli's etc within 10 min walk either do not open on Saturday or open later, say 10am which is fine. It is only 10 min walk from Ferry Building which has many cafes etc and markets at the weekend. Or just hop on cable car that goes past hotel and get off further up California Street to jump on cable car down to Union Square, 15 mins tops. Loads of places to eat there. The cable cars are great, get a $11 dollar all day ticket from hotal reception, valid for the cars and buses. Rooms are lovely, nice and big and great bathrooms, all marble, rooms have air con big TV , video games etc.We used as base to explore, Lombard street, G Gate bridge, Fishermans Wharf, Italian quarter, Coit Tower. Most is easily walkable but those hills can be pretty steep so the cable cars really do make it easy. One tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy and nobody gets off, hence you can wait at a stop and not get on at all. Busiest route is from the Market to Fishermansd Wharf via Hyde Street. This one passes over Lombard Street just by the 'crooked street' bit. Great fun standing on the side and leaning out.... which you are not supposed to do of course. We did have one evening meal in the Bob's Steakhouse, attached to hotel and one brealfast. Very good quality although a bit more expensive. Very very busy during the week with business people etc. The bar gets very crowded and noisy but in a nice happy, people enjoying themseleves sort of way.All the staff were very polite and extremely helpful, whatever the question is.

<Content>First Class hotel After a work conference in Monterey (avoid the Hyatt Monterey - yuck) my husband and I checked into the Omni for the weekend on the advice from two business traveler friends. We LOVED it! From the moment we pulled up front (valet quickly greeted us, as parking was part of our $175/night rate) we experienced a very high level of service. When I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and notified that we were already pre-checked in; handed our room key; and offered some afternoon hot chocolate and fresh fruit in the lobby. The room was spacious and smelled beautiful - can't ever remember a hotel room smelling SO floral....but not overwhelming. Turndown service at night was nice (Ghiradelli chocolate on the pillow, fresh ice, robes laid out), and the doormen and valets were extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions. We were also offered (for free) a ride in the hotel's town car to any restaurant/bar/shopping in the near vicinity - nice touch! Keep up the great service Omni!! Will stay again at the Omni - anywhere in the U.S.!!!

<Content>Great Hotel- A+ Although I have stayed in many hotels for both business and pleasure,I have never felt compelled to write a review. The Omni impressed me so much that I felt it deserved some of my time to write this review.The hotel exceeded my expectations. Many city centre hotels can be dissapointing irrespective of their star rating, as the rating is normally based on facilities rather than outright quality.The Omni was very pleasant, well located and the staff extremely courteous. I stayed in one of their corner suites which had windows all round. Complimentary fruit and water was provided as well as the staff turning my bed down when night came.The only small gripe I would have is that some of the bar staff were a little green behind the ears in terms of their knowledge of cocktails!Thoroughly recommended. I would stay there again.

<Content>Excellent customer service and beautiful hotel Planned a last minute getaway to San Francisco last weekend. After reading customer reviews on TA, I decided to select the Omni Hotel. The hotel was awesome! Customer service impeccable. Cleanliness was excellent. Front desk clerks and doormen learned our names quickly and called us by name for the duration of the trip. I would strongly recommend the omni to visitors. Staff very knowledgable on what's going on in town and recommended the best ways to get around. Great location in that it was in the downtown area but a couple of blocks away from all of the hustle and bustle on traffic and people. Would definitely stay there again.A great place to eat Chinese food is the R  G lounge on Kearny Street (two blocks behind the Omni) food was excellent and very affordable.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Excellent Service From the moment we arrived from the UK to the moment we left the staff went out of their way to please us. Walking into the grand lobby everything had an air of professionalism and efficiency. Our room was on the 17th floor with a wonderful view out across to the bay. With this standard of hotel you can expect to find the usual bathrobes and nice arrangement of toiletries, turn down service was provided each night along with the next day鈥檚 weather report, which was a nice idea. The extra touches made you feel that this was a hotel that really cared for their guests. Within a short walk from the hotel were a number of restaurants, shops and cafes around Union square. We enjoyed staying just outside of the main tourist areas however being close enough to easily walk around to places. We will definitely stay again when we visit San Francisco in the future.

<Content>As great as everyone says it is We booked the Omni after reading a lot of reviews online. It definitely lived up to all the great reviews. The service is incredible, the hotel is clean and the location is great. The front desk manager went out of her way to accomodate our special needs, calling us on her day off. It was all very much appreciated. We didn't eat in the restaurant except for dessert one night and the chocolate cake could feed 4 people! It was delicious. The restuarant recommendations were wonderful from the staff. We walked to Union Square and the hotel is on the California cable car line. If we are to return to San Francisco, we'll definitely stay here again.

<Content>Worked for our weekly vacation! We arrived and were surprised at how small the lobby was. Not a problem, just a suprise. Our room was fine for the three of us (48, 12, 10) with two double beds. The beds were very comfortable and big enough for the three of us. High ceilings. Nice bathroom. Service was very good. As a Omni Club Member we received free breakfast drinks at the door, free newspapers, and free afternoon brownies. A nice touch. As with many San Fran hotels, no pool. The location was good but not great. We were in the business district near Chinatown. We like walking so this was fine. (We almost picked the Argunaut but decided to not stay at the Wharf --- a good choice I think.) We never tried the hotel restaurant but enjoyed some hearby Chinese and LOVED the food and charm of the Italian neighborhood some blocks away (try The Stinking Rose and Cafe Greco). Walking to the Wharf was not too far for us. We took a taxi back rather than wait an hour for a cable car. (We luckily did not rent a car.) The Omni --- absolutely professional and no problems, but not spectacular. Would recommend if willing to walk around town.

<Content>Overrated -- Clean, Nice but definitely not outstanding. I am a little amazed at some of the reviews I have read here. Don't get me wrong this is a nice hotel but it doesn't warrant rave reviews, there are some problems.No wireless internet, I can't believe a hotel in the financial district doesn't have wireless internet. The front desk said we needed to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to a room with wireless internet. Huh? You have to be kidding me. The doormen (as all the reviews state here) were not (a) very friendly or (b) very helpful. I would suggest hospitality training.Don't be fooled by the candid pics above you probably won't get the room that shows a duvet (that isn't the room we got), this hotel still uses bedspreads -- very unsanitary (anytime you get a room witha bedspread throw it in the corner immediately) they're a haven for bacteria. Otherwise, the bed was clean and comfortable. The bath, amenities, and towels were adequate though not luxurious. This is nota 5 star hotel or comparative to the Four Seasons though it did remind me of a Ritz Carlton.Our first room smelled like smoke but we were relocated quickly, our bill was overcharged for a mini bar item but was corrected and our room service order was wrong but also was corrected after a call. Park at St. Mary's if you are staying on the weekend it 's 1/5 the price of the $45 parking rate and catty corner to the hotel. Plan on paying for parking, it is San Francisco. We probably would not do a car if we stayed in the city again, it's too hard with the steep slopes and we are used to driving a lot.The hotel was clean and the location is off the beaten path a bit although still relatively close to everything. The rooms were really clean and the young man at check in was nice and helpful. We got a great price for the weekend so the hotel was well worth our price it but I sure wouldn't want to pay full price for my stay. I would defintely move up to higher end. hotel if I were paying listed rates.There is no view, it was of another building but that is to be expected in the city.Here are some other tips: We had a cheap great lunch at the mexican restaurant communal dining Mijita at the Ferry Building and parking was only $5 with validation, we enjoyed walking around the Ferry Building marketplace but skipped the touristy Fisherman's Wharf. We took the ferry to Sausalito and that was great. We walked from the hotel to the Fodor reccommended L'Osteria del Forno for dinner - it'sless than a mile, go late or go early there is often a line but it iscash only, tiny but casual and we enjoyed the food. Great for the price.

<Content>The Omni is awesome! Great location, great room, great stay. The hotel is central to all the tourist activity. The room had a large comfortable bed with a nice desk and large bathroom. The staff was there to help with anything from the moment we walked into the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel for couples looking for a romantic weekend.

<Content>Nice Hotel My family and I stayed at the Omni for a weekend, it was very nice, the hotel location was great, the service was great, the hotel itself is very quite,and we got the best food advice from the guys that work outside. We had the best breakfast from a place I can't recall at the moment, it had a very unusual breakfast specials that were written on a chalkboard. It was a very small place and you have to wait outside for about 30-40 minutes, but it is worth the wait. Will definitely eat there again when I return to S.F. One problem we had at the hotel was taxi service, they usually do not have cabs waiting outside the hotel like other bigger hotels, so they have to flag one down for you,but with everything said, the hotel itself was great!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Service, and Location I had a overnight flight from Hawaii and arrived at the hotel at 09:00 AM. I had a coupon from the Select Guest Program that enabled me to pay half price on a weekend and get an upgrade. The front desk representitave, Joey Nubla, checked my reservation and saw that my birthday was coming up. He then graciously upgraded me to a suite that was available and later sent a bottle of wine. The suite was large and first class with all the amenties that I have come to expect from Omni. I have stayed in many of there properties, almost always got a complimentary upgrade, and have been very satsified with the accomodations and service.Sincerely,Brent V. Marrott

<Content>Not bad at all I spent 8 nights at the Omni when attending a conference in San Francisco. The hotel's location is fantastic, bang in the middle of town without some of the grime associated with Union Square. The public areas and reception are clean and smart. The room was comfortable and quiet (courtyard rooms are quiet but with a view of the neighbouring office block), but very plain - nothing in there to denote it as special in any way. The service, however, was very good indeed - bright and attentive staff at every level from housekeeping to management. Room service food was fantastic, although for the most part I got take-aways from neighbouring Chinatown. I'll certainly use the Omni again.

<Content>Dont be put off by it not being on Market St or in Union Square A lot of reviews of this fabulous hotel say its in a quiet part of town (financial district) and coming from London you imagine this means that you'll need a taxi to get anwhere and the area will be quite eerie.WRONG.If you have a pair of legs and can walk you can be on Market St/Union Square in 5-10 minutes.I'm used to big busy cities and there is nothing worse than staying in the throbbing throng with all the tourists. For this reason the location of the Omni is a real bonus. Far from the madding crowd but no so far to be any kind of inconvenience.It is true that most of the guests seem to be there on business but its no problem. Dont eat there if you dont want to hear suits talk turkey. Go out and enjoy the many fanatsic restaurants in San Fran instead.TIPS:Join the SelectGuest programme (a kind of clubcard membership) for free in adavnce and then you get a free paper and drink delivered to your room every morning at a time you specify. You also get the option of ordering light breakfast items at an extremely reasonbale rate. (cream cheese toatsted bage was about $3 or 拢1.50).The gym is stocked with complimentary water and fresh(ish) fruit. 'Nuff said on that one!Free internet service in the lobby.If noise bothers you stay as high up as possible. (on the 5th you can hear the tram bells, on the 13th you can hear nothing).You can buy your MUNI passes from the fornt desk at their face value.If travelling without too much luggage do yourself a favour at SFO and use the BART rather than pay for a taxi. A jounrey on the BART is only $5.15 and the walk from Montgomery Station is less than 10 minutes. The BART was very safe and clean.ROOMS:Look nicer than they appear in the photos. They're quite dark which is why the photos dont do them justice. It's all very faux-Georgian but tastefully done. Bathrooms are classy too.Not enormous amounts of storage but enough. Avoid the mini-bar.SERVICE:Front-desk and doormen were superb. Extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.Room service was extremely punctual with the selectguest drinks delivery. (you book a 15 minute slot and they there on the button every time).A Maitre D at Bobs steakhouse (attached to the Omni) was a bit stuffy but thats not their problem. Remember its mainly business people eating or using the bar there so I would avoid.LOCATION:You're in the business district but this does mean the area is well served by espresso bars, jamba juice and diners for workers. Also, a tram stops outide the hotel which is handy.You can walk most places very easily or use your MUNI pass for the transport.

<Content>Perfect location for Family vist to Chinese New Year We were thoroughly pleased with our stay at the Omni. We had adjoining rooms (a King and a double) and were assistd at every turn by Omnii staff. We have stayed in more than a dozen hotels in S.F. (St. Francis, the Palace, the Milano, Hyatts, Mariott, Sir Francis Drake, Kensington Park etc.) over the years and this was definately among the best. Many hotels will have nice lobbies, but have very ordinary rooms . The Omni had beautifully furnished luxurious rooms with every imaginable amenitiy. I would recommend it to anyone. As San Francisco is developing more and more to the east of Union Square, restaurants, shopping and attractions are near the Financial District location of the Omni. Plus, the California Cable Car line is right outside. We were in S.F. for the Chinese New Year Parade (a block away), Prom Dress Shopping, (5 min walk) and to attend an event at MoMA (10 minute walk). Nearby Belden Place offers some of San Franciscos best restaurants and a truly european bistro experience, that is entirely family friendly. We had dinner at Brindisi. Make reservations for weekends at any S.F. restaurant.. The hotel valet parking is $45 , high even for San Francisco. However, around the corner on Kearny is a 24 hour city parking lot with security. A bargain. If you join the Omni's club before your stay, you also get real pampering including morning coffee delivered to your door with the paper and free internet. We loved it!

<Author>JRSanchez
<Content>Great Service, Great Hotel, Great Stay! We booked the Omni based on two factors: price for 2 rooms as given through Expedia and also reviews from Trip Advisor. This was a getaway weekend for me, 2 adult sisters, and our Mom to celebrate Mom's birthday.BACKGROUND: Each member of our gang is a very seasoned world traveler, and we have stayed in every type of accommodation around the world from the St. Regis and Four Seasons to camping in a tent on Kuaui, with many a hostel experience thrown in for good measure. We are also all veteran San Francisco travelers, with one sister having lived in the city at one time. We have stayed all over the city in all types of properties (large and small, cheap and luxury) and we ALL AGREE: The Omni gets our unanimous vote as our new San Francisco home away from home!!! From check in to check out, everything was smooth and wonderful and the staff, from the front desk to the housekeeping staff, could not have been nicer or more accommodating.FRONT DESK: We checked in on Friday and arrived quite early (10.30 a.m.) expecting to have to store our luggage until later in the day. Surprise! Two rooms were ready and waiting. However, upon getting up to the rooms, we discovered that we had one room with 2 doubles and one with 1 king. We wanted to have two rooms, both with doubles, connecting if possible. One call to the front desk, a thorough search of the computer, and VOILA: just what we wanted. Not only that, but the bellman brought up the keys to the new rooms so we did not even have to go downstairs again.The bellman made sure to get all of our luggage sorted out, gave us a run-down on the hotel's services, put himself at our complete disposal, and was just a friendly as he could be. It is clearly obvious that whomever is providing the customer service training for the staff is to be highly commended: not ONCE did we ever receive anything less that a gracious smile, a hello, and an offer to assist. We also requested a VERY late check out (3 p.m.) and were accommodated without a hitch.AMENITIES: the hotel has a great fitness center with lots of cardio options, headphones for the plasma screen individual TV units, and free bottled water. Also has reciprocity for the full scale fitness club located across the street.Guest rooms have blow dryers, good lighting in the bathroom and elsewhere in the room, full tub with shower, nice toiletries, robes, and an in-room safe. Lighted closet with lots of hangers, and minibar too. There is FREE high-speed interenet access in the room (hard wired) as well as a business center that offers free internet if you did not bring your own laptop. They will also print free pages for you if needed.....Also: the WINDOWS in the rooms open to allow for fresh air ventilation! We love this! The heating / ac unit if very quiet and powerful too. With the windows open there is some street noise (even at higher levels) but we didn't mind.BEDS: comfy, comfy, firm and soft at the same time, duvet comforters, with great pillow choice. Pillows are an issue with me  I usually travel everywhere with my own to avoid vacation-ruining neck pain, but I left mine behind in the interest of packing light. I was not disappointed!THE AREA: The location of the hotel is downtown near the financial center, near the end of the California cable car line and the Montgomery Street BART station. It is very convenient if you are doing business in the area during the week, and much quieter if you stay on the weeknd as we did. Many of the close-by cafes and coffee shops close over the weekend. However, there are PLENTY within easy walking distance (within 10 block radius) that are open all weekend. You can walk to Union Square in one direction and the Ferry Plaza Marketplace in the other direction and be in either location within 10 minutes. Also: this is a SAFE walk and you will not pass by too many homeless (a problem in any large city, sadly).TRANSPORTATION: If you are uncomfortable or unable to walk, the hotel has Guest Cars (town cars) that will happily take you anywhere in the city you would like to go (or back to the airport when you leave, crying). The doorman will let you know the cost BEFORE you get in the car, and the price is comprable to taking a cab, and much cleaner. The front desk staff can direct you to and make reservations for you at any of the terrific SF restaurants. EATING: This is a city that runs on it's stomach. For morning (or afternoon) lattes  cappucino, we would recommend a stroll through North Beach with a stop at CAFFE PUCCINI near the corner of Columbus  Vallejo (next to Tratoria Pinnochio). Also, MOLINARI'S ITALIAN DELI (on Columbus) for sandwiches  the Salami. They make their own  are famous for it. For dinner  lunch, we would happily recommend BOULEVARD (great location, fantastic food  service, very pricey) as well as YANK SING (dim sum, extended lunch hours only, including weekends, great food, traditional cart serving, moderately pricey depending on your appetite, delicious).In addition, if you go over the weekend, you MUST go to the Saturday Morning Farmer's Market at the Ferry Plaza. This is not to be missed, and go hungry, as you will be able to eat everything from pastries to tamales, with coffee bars, cheese, fruits  veggies. Definitely worth a stop an a beautiful weekend to get your picnic fixins on your way out to Angel Island, Alcatraz, or the Marina District or Golden Gate Park.Whew! Thanks for reading through to the end. I hope that if you stay at the Omni, you will be as pleased as we were. Have FUN!

<Content>Great hotel, good location We stayed at the Omni for three nights in February. A very high quality hotel, located 5-10 mins cab ride from Union Square. Although its in the business district, and so the local area is really quiet / closed at the weekend, there are some really nice restaurants about 2 mins walk away - just ask at reception for recommendations. Rooms are lovely - very clean, spacious, big bed, very quiet etc.. Some great touches like free internet access in Business Centre, free hot chocolate by the lifts - the mark of a really customer orientated hotel.The only downside is the poor choice of healthy meals in the bar - but as there are some nice restaurants nearby not really a major problem.Much better value for a weekend stay than the hotels in the tourist traps at Fisherman's Wharf. Another TripAdvisor winner!

<Content>Heart of San Francisco Our family of 3 adults stayed at the Omni for a long weekend last summer. The room was a good size for us with great amenities. As noted by other reviewers, the staff was very helpful. If returning to San Francisco, we would stay again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel I've stayed at this hotel before, and there was a reason I returned. This time the valet guys weren't as attentive, and one of the guys actually slammed the door on me to help another guest, a total over sight on his part, but nonetheless, a little annoying since my roller bag got caught in the door, and I almost fell. But as soon as I entered the hotel, again your breath is taken away by the gorgeous, ornate lobby....really quite exquisite. The rooms are always quiet, clean and beautifully appointed. Only thing is if you stay during the weekend, there are not a lot of places walking distance to eat. Everything is closed on weekends since it is in the business district. However, we did find some, If you want a real unique lunch, definitely try out the over 150 yr old establishment called the Tadich Grill...great food, and all the waiters are all men over 45/50 yrs. who wear white coats, and who are very entertaining. For lunch they have a $11 minimum per person. Another top restaurant is Aqua, walking distance, but make reservations early, and you are looking at a $75/pp prefixe menu, but this place is a rage right now.

<Content>Beautiful, luxury, no complaints What a beautiful hotel... It was in the perfect location (4 blocks from BART, short walk from Union Square and Westfield/SF Centre), but reasonably quiet and not crowded with the usual tourist throngs.The check-in process was seamless and cheerful, and the door staff was pleasant and helpful.If you're thoughtless enough to have brought a car, as I did, be warned that valet parking is expensive (we were charged $45/day plus city tax) and the nearby garages were full on a weekday afternoon. To their credit, the staffers were upfront about the price and didn't charge us extra, even though we left the car there for more than 24 hours.The room was well-appointed and luxurious, with a nice, clean bathroom, bathrobes and linens. One minor complaint we had was the quality of the bedding... my mattress was sagging on one side, and my friend's pillows were very lumpy. The mattresses and pillows seemed to be in need of replacement, in general. But it wasn't bad enough for us to switch rooms or ask for new pillows. We might've been upset if we had to pay a lot (say $250+/night) for our stay, but we got a deal, so... just something to keep in mind if you're expecting pure perfection and paying rack rates. In all, we were very happy with the hotel and would definitely recommend it and stay here again if the price is right next time.

<Content>Small for three My family (three adults) stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Although we reserved a quadruple 2 double bed room, the room was very small and just twin room. The bed was only two single beds. Moreover the room was third floor and aside ballroom, and thus very noisy. MN (JAPAN)

<Content>Magnificent and Wonderful ... An absolute gem! 4-Star, 1st Class Wonderful Hotel !! Superb staff with friendly royal welcome and greetings, each and every time we entered or exited hotel ...and we were not even royalty !! The service was world class, in very well-appointed rooms. Rooms were of classic decor...spotless and pristine, with comfortable bed, robes, in-room safe, nice toiletries, and ample lighting. The location is quiet at nite, given near financial district, but still very convenient via walk, cab, or even famous cable-car right in front, to anywhere in SF !!! All requests made with the hotel were met without hesitation and perfection by the obviously well-trained, friendly staff. Must stay here when in town !!!

<Content>Wonderful experience at the Omni We just returned from a two night weekend stay at the Omni. We stayed there based upon TripAdvisor reviews and couldn't have been happier. Everything was as expected and more. From the attentive, friendly service of the staff to the comfortable, clean room, it was all perfect. We signed up for the Select Guest program when we arrived and had free coffee and newspaper delivered to our room at the time we requested. This was a really nice extra touch. The hotel is in a great location to walk to most of the main attractions in downtown San Francisco. We will definitely stay at the Omni again when we return to San Francisco.

<Content>Great Time at Omni in San Francisco My husband and I stayed at the Omni in San Fran on 12/25 and 12/31 (spent time in wine country in between), and we had a lovely time. We purchased the Wrap Yourself in Luxury package which included free valet parking, 2 glasses of champagne at the bar, and a discount coupon for Macy's. We also used an upgrade coupon that we received for being Select Guests, so we upgraded to a bay view room on the very top floor. We have always found the Select Guest program to be very beneficial. As we were getting ready to go out for New Years Eve, there was a knock at the door. The Omni had sent us a bottle of champagne on ice, accompanied by 6 large chocolate-covered strawberries. What a nice surprise. My husband and I haved stayed in several Omni hotels, for both business and personal travel and we've never been disappointed by the accommodations or staff. We will definitely stay at the Omni in San Francisco again. Great hotel, attentive staff, and convenient location.

<Content>Omni style and service! We spent two nights at the Omni after Christmas. Having stayed at the Omni San Diego, I was curious to see if the San Francisco hotel was deserving of its #1 rating by TripAdvisor reviewers. I booked directly through the Omni website and the $199 Park and Play offer included parking and a superior room. Having paid approximately $48 a night for parking at a hotel in the Union Square area, this seemed a great deal. As a Select Guest, registration info is on file and so you basically walk up to the desk and receive your room card. I had requested and received a front-facing (California St) room on a high floor. The lobby area was beautifully decorated and complimentary hot cider and cookies were available. The bed was extremely comfortable, as was the large armchair with ottoman. The room is tastefully decorated with a large work desk, many lamps, Bose radio and armoire with television/coffee service/mini-bar and large drawers for clothing. The large closet has a safe and bathrobes. The bathroom was large with a huge shower/tub with great water pressure. Large make-up mirror, too. As mentioned, Select Guest program will get you beverages and a newspaper, delivered at the time you designate. Some breakfast items offered to SGs at $2-4 such as bagels, muffins or breakfast burrito. Great prices! More extensive menu available through room service. This is one of the few hotels that delivers a large carafe of coffee if that is your selected beverage. Bagels come toasted, wrapped in a cloth napkin and with cream cheese and an assortment of fruit preserves. The steakhouse restaurant has very good food- a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches were on lunch menu. Prices a bit high but not out of line for SF restaurants. Staff very attentive. Hotel very quiet but the city, and Financial District in particular, have a low occupancy rate during the holiday period. This hotel is an excellent choice for business travellers.

<Content>Omni shmomni... My family and I visited S.F. 12/27-12/30 and stayed at the Omni. We requested a roll-a-way bed and were given an inflatable bed. We stayed in the signature room which was suposed to have upgraded furnishings and amenities (for an upgraded price). I called the hotel directly three times to confirm and to make sure our requests of a king bed and roll-a-way bed were received. We thought it might be cleaner than the deluxe  room we stayed in on a previous visit. It was not. The carpet was stained in several places and the furniture needs refurbishing. The light fixtures in the bathroom were still caked with dust.The mgr. could not understand why an inflatable bed was unaccepatble, but moved us to a mini suite after much effort(two hours of back and forth-you know). This room was long and narrow with one small window. It was dirty and dreary and had a bowl of rotten fruit in a silver bowl waiting for us. The bathroom was even worse. It had no tub,just a huge, mildewed and cracked shower with a weird wooden bench and bars everywhere. When I called the mgr. to tell her this was not ok she told me this was the handicap suite and all she had. It did have a kingsize sofa bed in it with dirty, musty linens on it. We took this over the inflatable bed but we were not happy.The doormen are very aggressive and have never turned down a tip for us..Also, do not join select guest. I did and I also called them to confirm our reservation and got nothing that I could see. I think there have been some fake reviews here...Hmm...

<Content>The Omni Gets It Right My 3-day New Year's getaway at the Omni SF reconfirmed my committment to this luxury hotel chain. I booked a 2-night stay via Expedia at an incredible rate, about $120 per night. I normally opt for affordablility over luxury, but sometimes you just want to be pampered and are willing to pay a little bit more. For those occasions, you can't go wrong with Omni. They understand the what a true luxury hotel experience is all about. At Omni, the customer is always right, and the customer's needs always come first. Case in point- my room key did not work upon check-in (they had given me a room that was still occupied, oops), and when I returned to the front desk, they upgraded me to a 2-room corner suite for my trouble, apologizing all the while. This was followed up with a personal note of apology from the front desk manager the next morning - and a fresh fruit basket in the afternoon, again gratis. The suite (room 920) was gorgeous, with a sitting room, 2 flat-screen TVs, and a DVD player. One of the nice things about staying in the Financial District is that it's very quiet at night - no sirens, ambulances, etc.I joined the Select Guest program several years ago. As others have noted, I highly recommended joining for the free perks. I enjoyed the complimentary beverages (choice of 2 - try the coffee and hot chocolate together!) and morning paper, and was pleasantly suprised to find that this Omni also offered Select Guests a range of reduced-price breakfast items along with the complimentary morning beverages. For $3.75 each, we ordered the breakfast burritos, which were hefty and delicious, served with fresh salsa. Imagine - a delicious room-service breakfast in SF for under $5! I stll can't quite understand how this place made money off my stay....I guess it all averages out in their favor. Stay here, you'll be glad you did.

<Content>good choice Omni was a solid choice. Clean relatively spacious room. Upgraded to a signature room. Price was right for San Fran over new years. Wlaking distance to Chinatown, North Beach/Little Italy.A cable car runs in front of hotel up to Van Ness where there is a good movie theatre. Highlight of trip was walking tour of San Fran from Chinatown Alleyway Tours. They have a website and you book online. Also, if you like bookstores, City Lights is a must along with the new Cody's bookstore by Market St.Back to the hotel, a good choice/location, but nothing fancy.Note: Cab from SFO airport should be about $35 to $40. Avoid the SuperShuttle unless you want to visit all the hotels in Union Sq.

<Content>Great stay at the Omni My family (4 of us including 2 teenagers) just spent 3 nights at the Omni. We really enjoyed the location--not among the throngs of tourists in Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf--between Chinatown and North Beach and minutes from the Ferry Building and all that it has to offer. The service at the Omni was extraordinary. Everyone was extremely helpful and kind. The room was nice--but not exceptional in anyway. I would definately stay here again based on the location and service.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommended As usual, I left everything to the last minute and booked this hotel the day before I was due to stay. I got a really good deal on it (about 拢100 per night), I was a bit worried about the quality of the hotel, but it was the only decent one available. I was 100% pleased with this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and decorated very neutrally, really nice and relaxing. I booked a twin room with 2 queen sized beds. Staff are really nice, very willing to help. The hotel is on California street, only 10ish minute walk to union square and only a couple of blocks away from China Town. The Tram line runs directly out the front of the building so you can hop on and go to Fisherman's Wharf. Every evening when we returned to the hotel, room service turned down our beds, put relaxing music on the television and put a little Chocolate on our pillows that said each day must end with a reward (something along those lines). I couldn鈥檛 have had a better stay in San Francisco and I couldn鈥檛 recommend this hotel enough. I stayed in the Marriott for a few nights and the Omni beats it hands down.

<Content>Most pleasant hotel stay in years! I visit SF often and, in the past, have stayed in inexpensive hotels on the premise that it's just a place to sleep. I've always felt that I'd rather spend my hard-earned money on something more important than a hotel room (e.g. a nice meal or a theater ticket).It was Christmas night and the Omni offered a deal that was too exceptional to pass up. For about double the price of the lowest category El Dumpo (including tax), I decided to treat myself to the Omni.The glowing reviews are well-deserved. The hotel, rooms and staff lacked NOTHING. Everything was sparkling clean, the service was friendly and efficient. Replacement batteries for a remote control arrived within 15 minutes of my call. The room-service breakfast arrived punctally and hot. Free internet in the lobby and a daily newspaper on your door. Gorgeous bath with everything you could want (including cotton balls, Qtips and sewing kit). Iron, umbrella and robes in the closet. Turn-down service. All in-room electronic amenities. Get the picture? Absolutely no negatives! As long as I can get a weekend rate near the one I just enjoyed, I'll never stay elsewhere again in SF.

<Content>Wonderful Stay At The Omni We stayed at the Omni San Francisco over the Thanks Giving Holiday Weekend period and had a fabulous time. The service was faultless from our initial registration to the end of our stay. We were fortunate enough to receive an upgrade through the Select Guest Membership Scheme from a Deluxe Room to a Mini Suite which was fantastic.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the housekeeping was exceptional, I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel and as an aside, it is well worth taking the time to join the Select Guest Membership Programme.

<Content>Fabulous Experience From the moment we arrived in front of the building it was a perfect stay. Extremely friendly and welcoming lobby and quick check in service. I had called ahead and mentioned it was our honeymoon and waiting for us in the room was champagne and chocalate covered strawberries.....and let me tell you those were the best strawberries I ever tasted.The bed was super comfortable. The free internet hook-up worked great. Being a Select Guest (which is free) is key to get the newspaper and coffee delivered every morning at the time of your choosing. And for $4 we got the breakfast burritto both mornings. This is exactly how I like my hotel stays......its was the best. We did the Marriott San Fran later in our stay, which was nice but no where near as accomadating, comfortable, and personable.

<Content>Ritz-like Hotel at Hilton Prices!! All I can say is WOW!!! We booked a one night stay at this hotel because we were going to be attending a wedding a few blocks away, and I am SO glad we did. I have never stayed at a hotel in that price range (we paid $189 for a Saturday night with our Entertainment discount), that treats their guests so incredibly well. It was true luxury.....robes in the room, evening turndown service (they made the bed while we went to the wedding and left mints on the pillow), morning newspaper, etc. The customer service was amazing, everyone in that hotel is ready to help you, and help you with a smile. I wasn't expecting much, as I said, because of the price we paid, so I was really floored. The location was great too, we were able to walk to Union Square China Town, and the Embarcadero....with Fisherman's Wharf being only a short cab ride away! We have stayed in our share of hotels in SF (Francis Drake, Hyatt, etc), but I will never stay in another hotel again when I visit SF!

<Content>I used to love the Omni - but that's all over now! If I hadnt stayed at the Omni San Francisco in the past, or had such wonderful service at the Marriott Baltimore Waterfront last week, maybe I'd feel differently about my recent stay at the Omni, but I will now find a new hotel for future visits to San Francisco.Yes, incidents are usually isolated, but I had a problem with the doormen upon arrival and departure (different guys), so feel comfortable stating that the service has deteriorated greatly. Not to mention - the pillows sucked! The so called feather pillow must have been stuffed with ping pong balls!I am not some princessy woman, but it is ridiculous that a woman travelling alone should be expected to remove her own huge bag from the back of a cab when arriving at a hotel of the caliber of the Omni. Especially while the doorman stands there commenting how the driver isnt a nice guy for not removing the bag. Then the bellman standing at the bottom of the steps watches you carry your bags down them instead of asking to help (or pointing out that the ramp to nowhere does eventually lead to the lobby).But the worst - was when I asked the doorman to call a cab for my return trip to the airport and he suggested I take the house car for a couple of dollars more. Trusting the doorman at an Omni wouldnt scam me, I jumped in the house car. As soon as the driver told me the fee, I had to have him bring me back to the hotel! The cab from/to the airport was $27. The house car is $45. How would I justify that to my company??? I have to state the maid - Tina - was wonderful.I used to stay ONLY at Omnis when traveling to cities that had them - until 2004 when the receptionist at the New Orleans Omni made an innapropriate political comment when she transfered my call to voicemail. This return trip to the San Francisco Omni was probation. They failed miserably and I am done with the Omni.

<Content>Wonderful! Great location, beautiful building, fantastic service. Staff was effortlessly friendly and accommodating. Our room (the Marshall suite) was tasteful, comfortable, and large enough to comfortably entertain four of our friends who stopped by. My only advice for future guests is to try to get a room on one of the higher floors. We were on the 8th floor, but the street noise outside was still loud and clear. Bring a pair of earplugs, and your stay will be flawless.

<Content>I left my heart in San Francisco We loved the Omni Hotel, it was a clean, friendly hotel. The rooms where spacious and very well decorated. I have read reviews from others saying the rooms where shabby and had dirty carpets, all I can say is that we sore no evidence of this, some people are never happy, what more can I say!!!!!.Staff where friendly and helpful and never once pushed for a tip. The steaks are great in the Steak house within the hotel, but a little pricey, so I would shop around, there are loads a places to eat.The only thing I was'nt happy with was the bar area at night, because it was alwaysfull of people who worked in the Financial District who had finished work, and then gone into the hotel for a drink, leaving no room for paying guests from the hotel, we felt this should be addressed by the hotel.San Francisco is a lovely friendly city, and I have some great memorys that I will never ever forget, I would advice anyone to visit once in there lives, they would'nt regret it.

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights as part of a two centre holiday. The service was excellent throughout. The room was large and airy and the bathroom was very spacious. The in room films were excellent and many have yet to come out in the cinema's in the UK.We recieved an upgraded room as I had registered to be a Select Guest on the hotel website the day before we travelled - I simply passed the email confirmation to the receptionist and we recieved all the benefits - well worth doing.The hotel is on the edge of Chinatown and a short work to Union Square. Highly recommeded!!! We will definately return.

<Content>What an anniversary present!!!! I booked this hotel based on the reviews on this website. Everyone was right. This was the absolute best place to stay for our anniversary. My husband had made plans with the hotel, without my knowledge, and when we entered the suite we were staying in, there was 2 dozen red roses, in the most beautiful arrangement I have ever seen. Housekeeping had left us a note, wishing us a happy anniversary. We went to dinner that night at the resturant in the hotel, Bob's Steak and Chop House. I had the most unbelievable filet I have EVER had, it melted in your mouth. Upon returning from dinner, room service had delivered truffles to our room and housekeeping had performed the turn down service, and laid rose petals all over the bed and laid out our robes and slippers. It was terrific. I guess I'm saying all of this to show the attention to detail and how great the service is in this hotel. Room service was always delivered on time and still hot. Everything was perfect. I will never stay anywhere else when I'm in San Francisco.

<Content>A lovely place to stay Spent two weeks at the Omni and had a great time. The staff were always friendly and helpful especially Joey and Lucinda on the front desk.The hotel is in the financial district which can be quiet over the weekend but the easy access to the cable car and easy walking to Chinatown or Fishermans wharf outweigh this.There is a daily maid and turn down service and the only reason we have marked down was because they was no butter when we ordered room service for breakfast one day. Plus the hotel will only change $100 traveller's cheque per day. We were not impressed by the service offered by United Airlines. The flight attendants seemed more intent on making sure they got their sleep and disappeared for large chunks of the flight.As you are no longer allowed to take fluid on flights the amount of drinks offered was poor. I would have quite happily paid for a tea or coffee or even a water. I really got the impression that we were not going to be allowed to forget we were travelling economy class. I don't think we will be flying with them anymore and have donated our air miles to the American Red Cross.

<Content>Great Hotel ,perfect location I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni and really if you want an excellent hotel in a great location this has to be your choice. The rooms are of a good size with large bathrooms and a walk in shower, i had a premier room which was an upgrade from a deluxe room which i paid for ,to recieve this uprade sign up to Omni Hotels signature program and you will recieve this for free as well as other benefits such as late check out. As all the other reviews state the staff are excellent, i travelled with my 2 year old daughter and all the staff made a fuss of her. As far as location goes to me this is in the best location in the city union square shopping is 10 mins walk in one direction and fishermans walf 20 mins in the other and north beach and chinatown on your doorstep, although there are plenty of buses ,cable cars and taxis if you want to take it easy. I booked with hotel connect a uk website which were 拢400 cheaper on my booking than any other website. Room service is expensive but breakfast in you room is nice, go on treat yourself ,your on holiday.

<Content>If you have kids, don't stay anywhere else. We stayed for 4 days over the Labor Day holiday weekend, and we had an excellent experience.I booked directly through the hotel website so that I could make a special request for a crib, as well as give them my Select Guest number. When we arrived, the crib was already set up and waiting in our room for us, together with a handwritten note addressing us by name and welcoming us to the Omni. There were a few baby toiletries tucked away into the crib, as well.I do recommend applying for a Select Guest number (you can do this online) beforehand, as it entitles you to a few amenities including late checkout. If you do it well ahead of time, I think they might send you a 50% off coupon and free room upgrade, too -- this happens either a few weeks after you apply or else a little after your first stay. (I'm not sure which, as we registered and made our booking at the last minute.) You can also buy these coupons on ebay, and they're fully transferable. (It says so on the coupon.) This might be very worth your while if you're staying for several days. If we had known about the Omni ahead of time, we would have planned ahead to get this.You also get free morning beverages in your room for all the people staying -- 2 beverages per person. We had 2 adults and our two children (ages 3 and 1) and got coffee for 4 and orange juice for 4 every morning, for example. You need to remember to put the little Select Guest hang tag, which they give you with your key, on your door ahead of time to receive this. You will also get a morning paper (you choose which paper), as well as a scone-like cookies and milk every evening with your turndown service.The room is fairly standard for a hotel room but quite comfortable. The bed linens are good quality, and the bathrooms are very roomy and marble. Everything is spotless. I was surprised the towels were not softer -- they're thin and not very comfortable, but they're serviceable and clean. We did request a room upgrade if they were available, and I was disappointed not to be upgraded for free (they said I could pay an extra $100 for a suite), but I certainly wasn't entitled to this so that's fine. That is the only disappointment of our Omni experience, and it is extremely minor.We had two small children with us, and the Omni is fantastic for families with children. The kids got a great goodie bag with crayons, activity books, playing cards, and even a small digital clock that they could hang from their coats or suitcases. My 3 year old was delighted with the bag, and she can be a tough customer! You can also request a Kids' Suitcase from the front desk, and this is literally a small rolling suitcase full of things like an Etch a Sketch, electronic games device, card games like Go Fish and Old Maid, and several classic books (Goodnight Moon, some kids' chapter books). We had a babysitter coming in one night (not associated with the hotel) and found this suitcase extremely handy for the night we were away from the kids. You also are given free kids' straw cups that you can take down to the restaurant to have filled for free. We filled up with milk for the kids every morning and night, and they were fast and gracious about it even though we weren't staying for dinner or breakfast or anything.All the service people were wonderful (with the exception of one woman who was just a bit brusque working the front desk at night. She wasn't rude though, just minimally helpful). The doormen were great. Bell service was instantaneous when we called for it. I had to ask for housekeeping to clean up a spill once, and they came to the room within minutes. The doormen refused our tips.Oh -- and I was wary because I had read that the parking fee was $45 a day. When we pulled up, the valets asked us whether we preferred the $45 hotel parking or wanted to park ourselves at the garage a half-block away, for $7. There was no pressure at all, and they were not at all condescending. You can park at St Mary's Garage at the intersection of California and Kearny for $7 per in/out on holidays and weekends. It's very convenient, and the hotel told us about it themselves.

<Content>Service at a whole new level. Absolutely amazing!! We just came back from California(San Francisco/Wine Country) last night. We stayed at the Omni hotel at the Financial District while in San Francisco and oh my goodness, what great service its staff provides. All I can say is WOW, no other hotel will ever be able to match the quality of service we received at this hotel. From the bellmen to the room attendant, the staff is just amazing. First of all, the hotel is in a great location and it very nice inside as well. Very clean, tastefully decorated, and comfortable (even the sofa bed where my friend slept). The staff goes out of your way to make sure your stay is top-notch. We asked for a humidifier and it was there within minutes. My husband forgot his shaving-cream, he got two complimentary shaving cream packets. My son's crib was in the room when we arrived, and it even included baby lotion and soap for him. But what we were really blown away was with the cookies and milk that were sent to our room every night. Even the maid would leave notes wishing us a great stay. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night, again, excellent. Great service and great food.Honestly, I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. I was concerned that we had already been too spoil and our hotel in Sonoma would not meet our new standards, I was right. The Omni took service to a new level. Also the location was perfect, very close the Union Square and China Town.

<Content>I love this hotel! Just got back from a stay at the Omni. The rooms are so comfortable and clean. I stayed here for business 3 years ago, and the hotel is still just as beautiful as I remember it. Sometimes hotels seem to age quickly (dirtier carpets, dingier furniture on a subsequent visit), but the Omni was as nice as I remembered it. Food service was pleasantly delicious. It's a business hotel, so I think that rates go down on the weekend. Our rate was $189 for a standard room - a definite steal for a hotel that could be considered luxurious. [I've stayed at 5-star hotels, so this is not quite there, but a 4+]. We can't wait to go back!

<Content>Best hotel I've stayed in. Absolutely excellent hotel. We booked it having seen the good reviews on Tripadvisor and I was not at all disappointed.The location is great. Short walk to Chinatown and easily walkable to Union Square. With it being in the Financial District, there are is a huge choice of good places to eat - Belden Street being a fantastic tip by one of the staff at the hotel with a number of really good restaurants.Rooms were comfortable and large. Really nice little touches such as fluffy robes, turndown service with soothing scenery played on the tv, free internet service. Some street noise audible if you listened really hard - we were in a top floor room.Every single member of staff we talked to was extremely helpful and pleasant. They had all the information that we could possibly need available on request. They even sent on a full drawer full of clothes which we left behind.In summary, fantastic.

<Content>Fab But A Bit Noisy The Omni lives up to all expectations. The majority of the visitors are business people and as such, expect a high standard of effficiency. The hotel is pure class. We booked a California suite and it was stunning. The only gripe is the traffic noise at night. The suites are positioned at the corner of the hotel on California St. The noise is generated by car tyres crossing the tram track. My wife is a light sleeper and on the second day of our visit we invested in some earplugs! I have to say that this would not deter us from staying again.

<Content>Terrific Experience Just returned from a weekend stay and I was very impressed. The location is perfect; a short walk to union square without the noise. Cable car right out the front door on a route that isn't as busy. The service of the hotel from the door man, bell men, front desk and housekeeping are were flawless.I had 2 rooms, 1 a signature room on the 16th floor with a limited view was decorated very tastefully, the beds were extrememly confortatble. My room on the 17th floor (top floor) had a view of the bay, the decore was not as night as that of the signature room.I only has breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Bob's Steak House and it was excellent.I highly recomennd this hotel, much nicer that most of the others I saw including the Westin St Francies and the Grand Hyatt. I will definetely stay here again.

<Content>well above expectations my husband booked this hotel at the end of our holiday on a company discount. it wasn't where i wanted to be but....we were treated very well. although a buisness hotel it is only a few blocks away from union square and the shops. just far away enough from the tramps who spoil that district from evening onwards.it does not have the easy accesibility to restaurants that the waterfront hotels have but it does have class and for the children the hotel provided goody bags and milk and cookies every night. the cookies were lovely.it also has a wonderful restaurant, understated but fab steak, mash (smash) and creamed corn.

<Content>Fabulous Fabulous Fabulous! I have been to SF many times and recently stayed at the OMNI on a girls shopping weekend. Staff was exceptionally curteous, helpful, and always smiling! A true 5 Star experience. It was my mother's birthday weekend and on our first night we were greeted by complimentary champagne and chocolates! Very comfy beds! Lovely marble bathrooms and lots of mirrors throughout. Great home base for city exploration. Safe place for women traveling. Staff has great suggestions for breakfast lunch and dinner spots. Quiet on the weekends because it's in the financial district, but an easy trolley, cab ride or 5-10 minute walk to dining, shopping, and sites. Trolley does run in front of the OMNI however the actual trolley stop is down a couple blocks (small blocks). Keep in mind that SF is not a particularly large city (area wise) and cab fare is very reasonable. Cabs are plentiful day and late night. We opted for cabs often rather that waiting at trolley stops only to be passed by because they were full of passengers. We will DEFINATELY stay at the Omni again. I tipped the bell hops and other appropriate staff but never felt obligated to do so.

<Content>faultless service with a smile my wife and I stayed at the SF Omni for 4 nights early august. on arrival, we were a little deflated because we had travelled from one of the uber-casino-hotels in vegas, but (back on planet earth after vegas!) the omni quickly won us over with its always pleasant staff, its cleanliness and (in our opinion and not withstanding other comments) its location.our room was on the 17th floor, with OK views. the room itself was fairly standard, of average size with an acceptable ensuite. the main factor in any room is its cleanliness, and here the omni was perfect: clean bedding, towels and surfaces made us warm to the hotel immediately.check in staff were pleasant and efficient, and full of tips about where to go and how to get there. its only a 7 buck taxi down to the piers, and a quick cable car ride to union square. its also possible to walk back to the hotel from union square because much of the walk is downhill; its an arduous journey the other way!china town is literally on the hotel doorstep; step out, turn right, walk one block and you're there.san francisco is great and a visit to alcatraz a must - although you have to pre-book - don't wait 'til you arrive.we got a town car from the hotel back to the airport - the same price as the taxi on the inward leg but much comfier and a nicer drive. maybe the hotel could send a car to the airport to pick you up - its certainly worth enquiring 'cos some of the SF cab drivers are not the best we've ever met!10/10 for the omni - it deserves its high standing on trip advisor.

<Content>Outstanding in every way My husband, two middle school aged children and I had the great pleasure of staying at the Omni San Francisco for four evenings (two on the front end of our drive North on Highway 1 and two on the back end of the drive before our return home). This is simply a gem in the heart of San Francisco. One of the cable car lines runs directly in front of the hotel. Our room was perfect. Comfortable, all of the amenities, quiet. Housekeeping is friendly, gracious and respectful of guests' privacy. We even had complimentary milk and pastries at bedtime. Every staff member we encountered was well-trained, genuinely concerned about our comfort, always offering a smile, exceptionally polite. We'd be remiss if we didn't single out 'Dorian', a bellhop who took considerable time with us to offer kid-friendly (and parent-friendly) touring suggestions. He didn't steer us wrong. We took his advice and road bicycles across the Golden Gate Bridge. We went to the Monet exhibit. 'Dorian' greeted us as if we were old friends. When we encountered a glitch with our rental car (it didn't arrive as scheduled for our drive North), 'Joey' arranged for a complimentary (delicious!) breakfast in the hotel restaurant while we waited. And, as if that wasn't enough, he presented us with a cooler filled to the brim with juices, water, and soft drinks for the drive. Now that's first-class! The only thing I would add to this wonderful experience is a gift shop (there isn't one). The nearby Walgreen's closes at 7pm and a place to shop for a few snacks (other than the room mini-bar), and even a San Francisco souvenir would be a delightful addition.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel Thanks for the great ideas I got from your site - we had a brilliant holiday in the U.S. I've travelled extensively over the past 35 years and lived in 6 countries - the Omni in Frisco is my new favourite hotel- it was worth every penny - they got the little things so right and were charming and helpful hosts - the room was spotless and well appointed and the location is good. Really - I was so impressed I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else (and it's not just for oldies my teenage daughter was also impressed)

<Content>Superlative Service! Recently hosted a meeting for 18 out of state executives. Chose this hotel for its geographic location and was absolutely thrilled! The rooms were large and luxurious. The service was absolutely impeccable. Hotel restaurant/bar was tiny bit pricey but the food and drinks were outstanding. Strongly recommend this hotel to others (both business and personal).

<Content>Clean, comfortable, well maintained and well appointed We stayed at the Omni SF and found the hotel to be extremly well ran. We plan to take future trips to SF so we stopped at other hotels to compare and contrast. In general we found that the Omni was much better maintained and cleaner than most both in the common ares as well as the rooms. The Omni has a modest gym with no pool. The hotel does'nt have alot to do there, Its not the type of hotel or resort where you check in and never leave till it's time to leave. Across the street is the B of A building at the top some 60/70 floors up at the very top is the Carnelian Room a bar and resteraunt. I recommend it for drinks only. The view of the Bay is most impressive (Bring a Camera). The drinks and service is on the weak side.If you're doing business in the Financal area looking for a hotel that's near the many sites, you'll find this hotel to be a good choice. Go without a rental car and take the public transportation or a taxi, all in front and easy to axis. Complements to the bus and cable car drivers. There very imformatiive and egar to help.

<Content>Wonderful but not a good location The reviews on here were so good, I had to see for myself. It really is as great as everyone says! The beds are so comfortable and the rooms are decorated beautifully. The bathroom is large and they even give you an iron, a scale, q-tips, and cotton swabs! The maid even leaves a little note welcoming you.It was so wonderful having a scone with milk sitting there waiting for us before we went to bed. The service is wonderful.However, there is a downside - the location.The Omni is located in the Financial District and it is very difficult to find places to eat (unless you want Chinese food). It was Sunday night at 7PM and we walked around for at least an hour looking for a place to eat. We searched and even the nearby McDonald's was closed. We finally asked the person at the front desk who showed us where somewhere to eat was but it was closed.The Omni is also not close to many of the sights but the Cable Car stops right in front of the hotel.The food at Bob's had big, bland, and overpriced portions (in my opinion). Four shrimps with the shrimp cocktail for $15. Parking is $45 a night but you can come and go as you please.

<Content>Great Staff Here's just an example of Omni's service: Two of us stayed at the Omni to end a weeklong trip in northern CA. We arrived in a rental car on a busy, rainy Friday afternoon. Our plan was to check in, then drop the car at the airport and return on the train. Bags were unloaded and check-in was smooth and painless. On the way to the airport we realized that neither of us told the bell staff our names or what room we were staying in -- we both thought the other had done it. Our bags were on a cart in the lobby. I figured a 1-star hotel would leave the bags where they were, a 3-star hotel would put them aside somewhere and leave us to get them when we returned (this would have been fine in my book), and a 5-star hotel would check the bag tags, check with the front desk for our names, and have them in the room by the time we returned. Of course the bags were waiting for us in the room, and it was a great worry-free start to a wonderful weekend at the Omni.

<Content>Good, but something... was... hmmm.... I have to admit, I had a great rate for my stay at the Omni and I wonder if that is the reason for my experience. Great front desk staff, maid service was good, but my room... I walked in the room and the first thing I noticed were stains on the carpet. Normally, this doesn't bother me at all, so I ignored them. Then I noticed another larger stain in front of my window, as if someone had spilled something and it settled into the carpet. Again, I ignored it, thinking I was just being picky. Later that night, I tripped a little bit on a piece of carpet that had been pulled up as I was walking into the bathroom. I know this sounds silly, but by this time I was thinking... what is going on here? I would come back to stay at the Omni, but I have a feeling that it will need some upgrades to the rooms, soon.

<Content>Nice hotel - not the best location for leisure Stayed at the Omni San Fran from a Friday until a Tuesday for leisure. It's very close to Chinatown, but there are hotels that are closer to Union Square that are just as nice if not nicer. I stayed at the JW Marriott for a night a couple of weeks later and found that to be a better location that was closer to shopping and restaurants. There is really nothing right next to the Omni. Don't get me wrong, the Omni isn't super far from anything, but it's not just a block walk. It's a short taxi ride to North Beach. I got a pretty good deal on the hotel (average $200 a night with the discount heavily on the weekend portion of the trip), which is probably because of its location. San Fran is made for walking, and with the Omni, you will. It's probably considered more of a business hotel than I knew it to be when I booked the trip. Staff was friendly, although not too much interaction. They seemed adequately staffed regardless of the volume of people in the lobby. I liked the free computer access. The room was just OK and not spectacular. Nice big king bed, but the carpet was kind of dirty. Bathroom was good too, but, again, not spectacular. I would stay at JW marriott over the Omni on my next trip.

<Content>Excelent experience Well desrving of its four-star rating. Excellent accommodations and service, friendly staff. My only quibble is the lack of grab bars for the disabled in the bathroom and the lack of a bathroom night light. Yes, you can hear the cable cars from your room, but that's part of SF's charm.

<Content>The Omni is superb! Our family of four stayed 3 nights at this lovely hotel on our return from Hawaii earlier this week. I must say the hotel's location is excellent, as we had easy access to outstanding shopping, china town  fisherman's wharf. Our purpose was to visit wine country and felt the Omni's location gave us great access not only to a quick trip to wine country but to some great San Francisco sights. The service was superb, as all were very friendly  accomodating. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and look forward to another stay at this first class OMNI!

<Content>reasonable for a conference I stayed here 2 summers ago, and while it was a good location, near chinatown, on a trolley stop, not far from other stuff, I found that the Grand Hyatt on Stockton, where I stayed last month was a much more hip and fun location at Union Square.

<Content>Unbelievable Service!!! My husband and I (and our four month old baby) just stayed here at the Omni June 25-27. We were absolutely amazed at the level of service here - from every single employee. They all seem to be happy, they all seem to love their jobs! (I mean, TELLING employees to act this way is one thing, but how many places can boast that every single employee does it? Not even Disney can say that.) They even remembered us by name! The bellmen are top notch. The food in the restaurant is wonderful, and the atmosphere is rich. The hotel rooms are spacious and sumptuous, with every possible creature comfort taken care of. The ONLY criticism my husband and I had were the mattresses...... they seemed to slant up at the feet, making sleep a bit uncomfortable. But, like I said - we have a four month old, so what do we know about sleep? The hotel is wonderfully situated, close to everything - but not too close. We highly, highly recomment this hotel to anyone looking to be pampered. We couldn't possibly come back quickly enough. (I especially loved the attention paid to our baby...)

<Content>What a wonderful hotel! This has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! Room was spacious and clean, with a welcome note left from housekeeping. Location is 10 minutes from Union square, 5 minutes from chinatown, 5 minutes from Montgommery Bart/Metro station with a direct link to SFO international airport ($5), 5 minutes from the main shopping district.After check-in staff asked us if we were here on honeymoon/anniversary, we found a bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room on our second day!My stay here was purchased through Hotwire for $100 per night.

<Content>A most comfortable stay After flying from the UK we selected the Omni for 5 nights to recover from jet lag and enjoy San Francisco. Can only reiterate what everybody else says - excellent. Room service burger was second to none and staff could not do enough for us. Being picky did not eat at the restaurant as it was a bit lacking in atmosphere compared to the competition - however concierge recommendations were first class and within a 5 minute walk. Most important thing however was a supremely comfortable bed !!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco May 27-31st. We had a wonderful stay and I could not recommend this hotel more highly! The room was beautiful and spacious and extermely clean. I have never stayed in hotel room more spotless than this one. Even our spare toilet paper roll was wrapped in pink ribbon!!The doormen were always at the ready to open the door or help if you had any questions. The service here is impeccable. We had a problem with our toilet one night and the service person arrived in less than 5 minutes and had it fixed immediately. The location of this hotel is perfect. It's away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's wharf and the seedier Union Square. We rented a car and were glad we did as the lines for the cable cars were extremely long-being a holiday weekend. To avoid paying for parking, if you are there on a weekend and have the patience to find a spot, you can park overnight on the street if your meter isn't chargeable on weekends. Otherwise, if you park one block up at the St Mary's garage, it's about $20.00---which beats the $50 you have to pay to park at the hotel.I recommend this property to anyone who is going to San Francisco. EXCELLENT hotel and will absolutely stay here again!!

<Content>Just the best hotel in San Francisco! For the last three years, I have stayed at the Omni on business at least 3 or 4 times a year. The Omni just keeps getting better. The Service is amazing, room service is always excellent, newspapers at the door, internet service reliable and fast, the hotel staff from the front desk to the waiter to the cleaning staff - are cheerful reliable and extremely well trained.Friends tell me about new hotels in San Francisco and I'm ashamed to say that I have strayed once or twice - NEVER again. The Omni is by far simply the best hotel in San Francisco.

<Content>AMAZING This hotel is simply amazing. It is so beautiful and the employees were not only helpful but genuinely nice. The bar and restaurant are first rate. You must try the spinach salad, it's phenomenal. The rooms are spacious and elegantly appointed. This is a very posh hotel, but everyone is very down to earth so don't feel intimidated. I would HIGHLY recommend this and would defintely stay here again. 5 stars!

<Content>Loved the Omni Hi, my husband and I stayed at the Omni overnight in mid-May. Our room was lovely and clean. I am a real stickler for cleanliness and was more than happy with their housekeeping. There were plenty of towels and the bathroom was huge. Will most definitely stay there on our next visit to beautiful San Franciso. We were there on a Saturday evening, and unlike another reviewer, we did not even notice that the vicinity surrounding the Omni was particularly quiet. We are in our late 50's and walked all through Chinatown to North Beach for dinnner and back again, returning after 11pm. Area felt very safe and we enjoyed the walk after our dinner. All of the staff we dealt with, front desk, doormen and parking valets were very courteous and efficient. The parking charge for your vehicle could make you weep though. We know better than to take a car into San Francisco but were forced to do so by circumstances. We were given a late check-out with absolutely no hesitation and the bellman kept our luggage for a few hours after that. We were so very pleased with our stay at the Omni. I will add that this was our fourth time in San Francisco and I think we enjoyed it even more this time.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location The Omni in San Francisco is awesome. The people were really great as soon as we walked in the door. We arrived early thinking that we would have to ask them to hold our bags until the room was ready, but instead, the room was ready and they even took the time to move us to a more desirable floor with a view of California street. The room was very clean with everything we would have wanted. I won't stay anywhere else when I'm in San Francisco.

<Content>Great Memorial Day Getaway! Spent the Memorial Day holiday weekend in San Fran with my girlfriend  decided to stay at the Omni purely off of the reviews from this site. I must say this service really does work, we were not disappointed. Flew into SFO on Friday night  requested a town car to pick us up curbside thru the hotel. The cost was a flat rate of $60 door to door  they can charge it to your room. You could pay around $45 for the same ride with a cab but then again your pulling up to the Omni, not the Holiday Inn. First thing we noticed upon arrival was the professionalism  friendliness that you would expect from the doormen to the luggage attendant. For a relatively small hotel it has a grand entrance with brass  marble appointments all of which can be seen thru their website. Once we checked in we arrived at our rooms accompanied by our luggage attendant who pointed out all the features of our room. I chose the premier room which had a little extra room compared to the delux rooms they offered. The bathroom was covered in marble  had all the creature comforts of home including a great blowdryer, soft robes, lotions, sewing kit, etc. The room was very clean  the bed was soft  warm. The fitness room was great  offered bottled water for free as well as starbucks coffee, just go early because they run out quick. DO NOT rent a car if you plan on exploring the surrounding neighborhoods, parking there is rediculous  could probably ruin your trip. Everything you ever needed to see in SF is within walking distance. All in all the hotel was great  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to plan a romantic getaway.

<Content>Great Hotel!! We stayed at the Omni for 6 nights. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was clean and bright with a really nice marble bathroom. The hotel is located a few blocks from Unions Square in the Financial District which is busy during working hours but ghostly quiet at night. All the immediate shops close after 6pm and at weekends. We registered for the Select Guest programme on the Omni hotels website, this entilted you to a free beverage in the morning with your newspaper and also late checkout, which was great!

<Content>Excellent Customer Service We stayed at the Omni April 19-25. The customer service was exemplary. The hotel is within walking distance of most things, many good restaurants, etc. Complimentary morning beverage service and choice of USA Today, Wall Street Journal and/or local newspaper each morning was awesome.

<Content>Childrens fantasy suite was excellent Spent 4 nights here with wife and 2 small children. It was delightful.We stayed in the kids fantasy suite. This suite (only 1 in the hotel) is not bookable on the internet, only by phone and consists of 2 adjoining bedrooms one of which has had all adult furniture removed and replaced with kids furniture.. bunk beds, soft toys, games, bean bags, posters etc. It was the perfect place to be after 11 hour flight from London. The children loved it. The adult room was very nicely decorated and comfortable. The staff also provided goodie bags for the children on arrival which was a nice touch. We found the hotel to be very quiet and the soundproofing excellent. Front desk staff were very helpful. The location was good also. 10 minutes walk from downtown shopping areas, 5 minutes from Chinatown and convenient for all the trams. One tip; it is worth joining the Omni frequent guest program before you reserve; it entitles you to a later check out and free breakfast drink and newspaper delivered to your room.I'd thoroughly recommend it

<Content>Parking fees excessive!! I booked the Omni because it seemed a bit less expensive than the other hotels in the financial center, especially The Mandarin Oriental. I used the internet to book, and called the hotel in the morning to confirm, and never was I told that on top of the room charge, there was a $45 a night parking fee! I was informed of this by the valet upon check in. The hotel was nice enough, although not too special, and the staff was very friendly, but with the excessive parking charge added to the rate of a pretty standard room, I may as well have considered the Mandarin!

<Content>A Grand Hotel in the San Francisco Tradition! I booked a room at the Omni through Hotwire for two nights last month. Staff was helpful and friendly, the room was big for SF, and the bathroom tops! Everything you'd expect in a five star hotel. Great place to unwind before a ten day cruise, quiet enough so that with the windows closed I couldn't hear traffic or cable car bells' clanging. Some top restaurants within walking distance; be adventurous! Formerly a bank's corporate hq., the building was gutted down to the girders inside, and the outside restored to its original classic look.

<Content>World Class hotel Stayed at the Omni for the weekend and left very happy...Location is great since Union square is four blocks south, chinatown is one block away, better than being smack in the middle of touristy Union square. The building is newly built with larger than average rooms for San Francisco. All rooms and public areas are clean and perfectly maintained. The lobby is gorgeous with beautiful flower arrangements and the staff are very attentive and helpful. In-room movie viewing is pricey, though; $10 to watch movies they have at blockbuster! Will be back again.

<Content>Absolutely Beautiful Room I stayed at The San Francisco Omni in January during a business trip. I had heard that this chain was good, but my expectations were not high enough. This place was very nice, and because I was a Select Guest (SG) they upgraded my room to a bigger one. Very nice!Positives: Location right on California Street provides a short trolley ride up to Chinatown. Actually, you can walk to just about anywhere in SF, so ride the $5 trolley only if you have to. The room was great, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was huge (upgraded room), and they had free high-speed internet.Negatives: The staff was a bit pretentious. I work in IT and at the time I didn't have to wear a suit and tie like most of the business travellers there. The bellmen would open the door for anyone walking up, but they would just look me up and down like I didn't belong. I learned to take the side entrance on Montgomery so I could skip that whole uncomfortable feeling.The onsite steakhouse is average at best. The glazed carrot that they serve with every steak oozed it's glazing onto my steak. Not the best taste combo.For weekend travel you might find a better place to stay. The Omni is in the Financial District, so a lot of stuff is closed during the weekend. However, you can walk anywhere, even, but it might take a little bit longer to get to the other parts of the city.I really enjoyed my stay at The San Francisco Omni, and I would stay there again. It was a terrific room.

<Content>A Quiet Oasis Even though we live in the East Bay, we like to play tourist in San Francisco. Discovered The Omni while participating in the annual Dine About Town this past January. From the moment we walked in the door, we were transported to another era. Loved walking EVERYWHERE...Ferry Building (and the Saturday Farmer's Market), Red's Java Hut, a walk to SBC Park, SOMA, The Irish Bank, ending a full day at Bimbo's 365 Club for a fabulous concert, and of course a walk back home. Have and will continue to recommend The Omni to everyone!!!!

<Content>Nice hotel remote location unless in town on business... Omni Hotel in San Fran... is beautiful however it is a bit remote if you are not in town for business. During weekdays you are in a bustling business district full of places to eat, have coffee or people watch however during evening hours and especially on weekends the area is quite empty. On Sunday morning we stopped by 3 different starbucks stores that are located in the 2 blocks radius of the hotel until we found one (4th) that was open and that one obviously had a line outside...The staff at the hotel is very accommodating. The hotel lobby is stunning and the room was lovely, a walk-in closet was a plus. No complains about large windows or spaciousness of the room however the bath while quite nice and clean, lacked a hand shower or a flexible enough top shower where you can point it to the wall when needed. A squeaky pocket door separating the room from the bath was not the best either but that is an easy fix (call the staff resolved in minutes)...Overall, very nice hotel however if you are in San Fran... for pleasure pick a different area...

<Content>Nice hotel, good location We have just returned from San Francisco and we spent 3 of our nights in the Omni. It is an excellent hotel, very clean and with very helpful staff. The location is also very good, within the financial district and right outside is the California Street tramline. This line did not appear to be used as much as the Powell/Hyde and Powell/Mason lines which made jumping on and off very easy.Our only minor gripe is the bar, we thought it was little pricey, $14 for a glass of wine. But, all in all we had a great stay here and would definately return.It's easy to see why it is number 3 on the rankings.

<Content>Fabulos Luxury Resort I had an excelent stay at the Omni. The room was on the thirteenth floor and was actually named. My only complaint was the rooms were to yellow.The rooms were spatious and warm and the TV shows a lot of great channels. The only thing is they don't have many channels.Again I say I had a great experience at the Omni.

<Content>Excellent service, great room I was really impressed with the attitude of the bellhop and valet as we arrived. They were so friendly and full of information. We had a lovely big room with very spacious bathroom. Only a few blocks walk to Chinatown where we had dinner and then walked on to North Beach for drinks. We love San Francisco and prefer this location to Union Square.

<Content>Abosultely Excellent This hotel exceeded my expectations. It has a great location. We could walk to Chinatown, the shopping district, and many other places. They have a wonderful lobby and the doormen are excellent. The concierge was amazing and went out of their way to help us. The room was also great. It was spacious and the bathroom was great. I would reconmend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Exceeded my expectations This hotel was excellent. The location was great! You literally are right in between Chinatown and fisherman鈥檚 wharf! There is a trolley stop right in front of the hotel and a subway across the street. The service was wonderful and the rooms overwhelmingly exceeded my expectations. There room service is ok, but like any hotel they way overcharge you for food and water. There is a Walgreen鈥檚 a block down Montgomery street and you can get a six pack of water or one large water for about 1/3 the price. The concierge was excellent and very helpful. Defiantly buy the Muni pass they offer it WILL save you a lot of money! My husband and I are just average people and we thought that since this was the Omni that maybe we would be treated poorly but not at all. We received excellent treatment. When my husband and I return to SF we will defiantly stay here again!

<Content>Omni is the BEST I stayed at the Omni on Dec. 22-24 with hubby and two small kids. Service was great from the get go. My kids were delighted on receiving goody bags filled with toys and candies upon arrival. We were there on our anniversary and noted that on our reservation. When we arrived in our room, we had champagne and chocolate covered stawberries (and lots of it) waiting for us. Very, very nice. They really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. This was truly the best hotel experience I or my husband have ever had. I did not have a single complaint during my entire stay. I will definitely stay there again next time I'm in SF.

<Content>Excellent stay at the Omni! What a great hotel! I booked this hotel for one night using Priceline. I asked for a four star hotel for 75.00, and it was confirmed within minutes! The hotel website shows their rack rate rooms at 245.00 a night. Beautiful room, with bathrobes in the closet, Huge bathroom and the most heavenly beds! I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a luxury room at a very low price!!!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel We've had great experiences at Omni Hotels. Why change when we've always had great experiences in different cities. This hotel had what I expected. A beautiful room, it was nicely furnished and was a good size. We arrived at the hotel before check in time and the staff offered to hold our luggage so we could begin exploring San Fran. We were able to check in later on. We were within a 5 minute walk to Chinatown and the cable cars went directly in front of the Omni. Top notch hotel. Highly recommended. We would stay here again if we visited again.

<Content>great service My boyfriend and I ran away from Christmas this year and stayed at the omni for 4 nights. we stayed at the W when we were in San Francisco in October and even though the Omni isn't as stylish the service is better by far. Every thing with our room was great until the 3rd night when we got new neighbours, it was an adjoining suite so the sound and the cigarettes escaped over to our side. We still aren't sure if they were supposed to be smoking in there or not...anyhow the staff were great, they moved us to another room, no problem, and even sent us a little bottle of wine with our room service christmas dinner. Christmas dinner room service was burgers and beer which were delicious. My only service complaint actually happened that same day - after wandering around in the rain all day we stopped in the bar for a cocktail before going up to our room, but we never did get served, not even a hello or i'll be right with you, nothing. That was quite surprising given the service throughout the rest of the hotel. Anyhow, we had a great getaway in San Francisco!!

<Content>Absolutely WORTH every cent! the very best hotel EVER! We made reservations for this hotel through priceline but I must say after our stay I think I will never stay at any OTHER hotel when I am in San Francisco. Being that my background is hospitality and hotels in particular, (used to work for and open Marriott Hotels, Starwoods, Sheratons and Forte) when I say this it the VERY BEST HOTEL that I have stayed in EVER that is saying a lot.Customer service was ABOVE AND BEYOND Fantastic. To clarify yes the valet is $45.00 (in line with city parking) however we parked at the Chinese Catholic Center on Jackson st  it was $24 not far from the hotel either. The location is close to Chinatown  North Beach, although it sits in the heart of the Financial District the cable car stop is right outside your door so really no need to rent a car unless you have to also the Front Desk sells all day muni passes for $11 which is a really good buy if you will be traveling the city it is good for the cable cars as well as the buses. The rooms are spacious, nicely appointed the amenities are luxurious, linens are DIVINE, housekeeping associates were friendly and consistently available. Room service was expensive but the late night menu was delicious and they even allowed us to order desserts from the regular menu (although it was pass the cut-off time)Front desk associates were attentive  VERY, VERY helpful (Carmen in particular) complimentary in room wireless internet, complimentary business center with internet access, do yourself a favor  do as a reviewer before me recommended  sign up for the omni hotel frequent guest program the check out is at 5:00pm  every morning they bring up complimentary newspapers and beverages of your choice they do this also in the evening with milk  cookies (although I think this was done becuase we traveled with teenagers) Saying all this I was very impressed with the Omni Hotel and think that perhaps there is hope for our Hospitality industry in the Customer Servicedepartment since the past 6 years I have seen a decline this hotel has renewed my inspiration for our Industry. WELL DONE!Respectfully Reviewed

<Content>Great hotel that's just a little out of the way This is a great smaller hotel that is in the Financial District and therefore quite a bit quieter than the usual Union Square, Fisherman Wharf, etc. locations yet super close to all that and more.The hotel is a converted/refurbished old business building and you would expect it to be dark and cramped but the common areas were beautiful and the room was decent size and very clean and modern. The bathroom was nice with great soaps and things. The room also came with robes, a safe and umbrella.As I noted, after about 6:00 the Financial District is pretty much deserted, but you are only about two blocks from China Town, four blocks from Union Square (by way of some great shopping streets in and of themselves), a couple blocks from Fisherman's Wharf, a couple blocks to North Beach, a couple blocks to the Metreon, a couple blocks to the new Ferry Building. Plus, you have a great bar/restaurant right in your own hotel and the Carnelian Room (for the view) across the street in the Bank of America Building. And on top of all that, the cable car goes right by the front door so you can hop on and be on Nob Hill in no time without hiking up the hills yourself.The only negative that we have to say is that the parking was $45, which is just ridiculous. If we hadn't been so pressed for time when we arrived late, we would have parked it ourselves up the street at the St. Mary's garage for $20 (which is what you know the hotel is probably doing.) Of course, the good part was that we got this through Priceline (I had a good idea this was the hotel I was bidding on so I went for it) for $75 for a Saturday night at Christmas shopping time.

<Content>Highly recommend the Omni My husband and I stayed at the Omni for 5 nights over the Christmas weekend. We had a blast in SF, and can attribute a lot of that to the great hotel we selected. The location was perfect. Comfortable walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown, the Embarcadero and Little Italy. We also walked back and forth to Fisherman's Wharf several times along Columbus Ave and other routes; it gave us a good opporutunity to explore different areas. Don't be intimidated to walk up some of the hills; you'll be sure to get a great view once you get to the top. Some more tips about staying at the Omni: 1.) Don't drive or rent a car, you won't need one. Bring good walking shoes and you'll be able to walk everywhere. We especially enjoyed walking to Chinatown for lunch (for really good, cheap Dim Sum, check out House of Dim Sum) and to Columbus Ave in Little Italy for a mid-afternoon espresso at Cafe Puccini. Good for just relaxing after a day of sight-seeing. 2.) If you fly into SFO, just take BART to the Montgomery Street station. The Omni is a 10 minute walk from the Montgomery Street BART station and it only costs $5. 3.) Sign up for the select guest program through the Omni website. You get free drinks every morning, which doesn't sound like a big deal, but it was a great way to start out the morning - pot of coffee and OJ before you even leave the room. You also get turndown service which is great; the maid left us cute little notes every day 4.) If you like Jazz, definitely check out Jazz at Pearl's, just a short walk from the Omni.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in San Francisco My husband and I just returned from a Saturday night stay at the Omni with our two year old and were extremely pleased with the hotel. We have stayed in several hotels in San Francisco and our room at the Omni was by far the largest. We used Priceline and got a rate of $80, then upgraded at check-in for another $25 to a very spacious room that worked well for the three of us. I was really surprised to get such a reasonable rate in the middle of the holiday season in the city. We followed the advice of a reviewer and skipped the $53 valet parking fee by parking one block up at the St. Mary's Square garage (on Kearney) for $6.50 for 24 hours. Hard to believe you can park anywhere in San Francisco for $6.50, but parking on the weekend in the Financial District was a great tip. The other tip we used was to enroll in Omni's preferred guest program on their website before we checked in. Not only did it get us complementary beverages and a paper in the morning, but it allowed us to check out anytime before 5 p.m. the next day. We were able to do some shopping (and eat dim sum in Chinatown) on Sunday morning, then return to our hotel room and let our toddler take a nap before leaving town. The staff were very friendly and gave our little one a welcome bag of goodies when we checked in, and we were pleased to see other children at the hotel, although the rooms were very quiet. The Omni is ideally located within walking distance of Chinatown, Union Square, and the Ferry Building. We'll definitely stay there again.

<Content>We had high expectations, and we were not disappointed My family spent five nights at the Omni San Francisco during the Thanksgiving week, and we had a wonderful time. I have been in many hotels in San Francisco before but never at the Omni. I鈥檝e heard great things about it from my colleagues and have read consistent, good reviews on the web. I decided to give a try for our family vacation, considering someone in the family is usually picky about hotels.The room was very clean and well equipped with everything, including bathrobes. The marble bathtub was sparkling and the bed was very comfy. The entire staff was very nice. The room was serviced twice a day, and a complimentary beverage was delivered in the morning - with our choice of beverages and delivery time. There were two computers in a small room at the hotel lobby for guests to use the Internet though the guest rooms also have free high-speed Internet. Overall, I had better experience at the Omni than I had in other 5 or 4-star hotels I鈥檝e stayed in SF, thanks to its personalized service. All the good things you read from the reviews are true.Besides service, another reason we picked the Omni is its location. It is in the middle of everything and right on the cable car line. It is two blocks from Chinatown 鈥?very convenient for getting fresh Chinese pastries in the mornings. A few advices if you decide to stay at the Omni: (1) Sign up for the Select Guest program before you make the reservation. You can read the benefits on omnihotels.com. (2) Take public transportation (BART/MUNI) instead of renting a car. If you have to rent a car, rent it in the city and try to return on the same day, since overnight parking can be pricy. I like the MUNI Passport (for 1, 3 or 7 days), it is convenient if you ride cable cars a lot (we had to do that to make our 3-yr-old happy). (3) The hotel is big on great guest services, not on impressive architecture (like the Atrium of the Hyatt Regency) or in-house amenities/activities (such as a swimming pool) which is not a problem since it is close to many attractions anyway. Want be treated well on your next SF trip? Try the Omni San Francisco.

<Content>parking was outrageous I stayed here with a friend the weekend after Thanksgiving, in order to shop in the area.The rooms were very nice, and the Fitness room was very clean and modern. I also found the service to be top notch, very friendly and personable.However, the $53 a day fee to park your car was really obsene. I was pretty upset about it, and there really wasn't any place nearby to park your car yourself. This fee should have been told to us when we made our reservation, as it adds a hefty fee to your bill.

<Content>A piece of heaven... This is a classic beautiful hotel with a wonderful location near the base of Nob Hill. Step out the timeless entry and onto a cable car or take a walk in nearly any direction to find delicious restaurants. Less than a five minute walk to incredible dinning and shopping. The Hotel itself is fantastic with large luxurious rooms and truly impressive customer service. Each and every staff member down to the housekeepers was friendly, professional and fun. Within minutes we felt as though the Omni was our hotel and that we had stayed there many times (despite this being our first trip). Should anyone decide to take a trip to San Francisco and want a wonderful hotel to stay in, I give the Omni my highest recommendation possible!

<Content>Loved it! I loved the Omni. My husband and I stayed there for a week in June. The staff was very kind. The room was larger than most in the city. The bathroom gave good water pressure and nice aminities. The hotel restaurant food was good, as was expected since was a bit expensive. Parking is very pricy, but if you call 30 min in advance when you get there your car will be waiting though. We couldn't hear any noise from outside traffic. The internet worked perfectly in our room and the business center was very helpful for printing. The concerige recommended great places to eat and sightsee. They also provided great directions. It was a lovely experience. It has become our most favorite hotel in the city!!

<Content>Loved It!! This is simply one of the best City hotels we have ever stayed at. The location was superb right in the heart of the financial district and within walking distance of everything. The staff were courteous and friendly and the free internet access was a nice touch and always accessible. It was all the nice touches that made you want to stay night after night including the turndown service,mints and lovely bathroom products. This was our first stop as part of a west coast tour and it started off our vacation. We WILL definitely be staying here again.

<Content>Nice Hotel, excellent location We spent our first night at the Omni and second at the Hyatt Regency. Omni is at all levels, including service, decor and location, beats the Hyatt. Room is small but adequate and the bathroom is luxurious. They even provide bathrobes and morning newspaper. Service are great, people working there always carry a smile. It is a couple of blocks from the Union Square and Chinatown.The only complaint was that guests across the hall was noisy! Would go back and stay there again.

<Content>Loved our stay at the Omni My husband and I plus 12 year old daughter stayed for three nights at the Omni and had a lovely stay. The hotel is entrance is extremely impressive with lovely marble floors and lots of wood etc. The staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful with all our requests - Joey on the front desk was particuarly charming and remembered my name with no problem at all. Our room was extremely comfortable, at the end of a corridor with a welcoming note and fresh fruit and chocs left each night. Location is not bad either. Just over a block to walk into China town, Union Square 20 mins or so, and a good walk to Fisherman's Wharf - about 25 mins (this was no problem as we enjoy walking when we have the time!) Cable car does stop outside but we did not really try to catch as preferred to walk each day. Having tried to stay at the Argonaut down at Fisherman Wharf (fully booked and on seeing the hotel during our visit) I am really glad we chose to stay at the Omni. The hotel is extremely comfortable and offers a quiet and distinctly elegant stay. Whilst in San Fran we had an excellent meal in China Town at the Empress of China (recommended by the front desk) and also at the Stinking Rose (Garlic Restuarant) which I think was in Little Italy. Also breakfast at Mamas was well worth the queue outside. One tip is if you want to go to Alcratraz book on line prior to arriving in San Fran as this was totally booked up when we arrived which meant we could not go on the trip. Also had a fabulous tour with Mr Toad's tours in a 1920's wooden open bus and the trip over by Ferry to Solsalido was fab.

<Content>Sensational hotel with sensational service!!! You cannot beat the location of this hotel. We go to SF quite often and never stay in this area until now. The Omni will be the only place we stay when you are in this gorgeous city. You can walk to North Beach, China Town, Union Square or use public transportation for the other spots. The hotel itself is simply beautiful! The free internet access is a great perk. Who would want to fork out 20 bucks a day for internet after paying all that money for a room. Ritz Carlton, are you listening?????? The staff is very friendly and professional. My favorite is the housekeeping staff with daily notes for you. How's that for icing on the cake??? You can park eslewhere if the fee is too steep. There are plenty of parking options. The room is big and spotless. The bath salts add an elegant finishing touch. Too bad there are not that many Omni Hotels around. I want to be the frequent guest of this chain any day!!!!

<Content>Most enjoyable stay My wife and I stayed at the hotel for four nights in early August, having made the booking based on the recommendations of this site. The hotel and staff were extremely welcoming, polite and efficient. Our room was of the highest standard in terms of furnishings, facilities and cleanliness - and quiet! The location was reasonably central for most attractions and was a short walk from Union Square and Chinatown - cable cars traverse the street in front of the hotel.We did not use the restaurant in the hotel as we prefer to eat outside for a broader experience and there were many eating and drinking establishments nearby to choose from. We hired a car for part of the stay and found a car park across the street at a reasonable rate. The local transport systems are also adjacent to the hotel and offer a good range of services. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would have no hesitation in recommending it to other travellers.

<Content>My home away from home when in San Francisco The first time I walked into my room at the Omni with my family we all gasped because the place was so beautiful. The room was tastefully decorated, the beds were so comfortable and the bathroom was stunning. Plus we had nice views and we were right on the cable car line that runs up California Street to Nob Hill. The people at the front desk were nice. The lobby was elegant and inviting. Be warned that valet parking will set you back nearly sixty dollars a day so leave the car at home. I have returned to the Omni with my family and we all just love it. You are going to like this place.

<Content>great location + Great rooms... I was planning a 2 night stay in SF, and using tripadvisor...Omni turned out to be the best bang for the buck. So, i want to return the favor and put in my 2 cents since i was able to save a lot of $$$. First off, if you want to do a weekend getaway... I would suggest Sat, Sun and check out Mon..instead of Fri-Sun... the biggest money drain is the parking...$45/night...if you park at St. Mary's parking...it is $30/nite..M-F...but only $6.50 during weekends! So...by going on Sat, Sun..you save quite a bit.Ok..the good: Very nice, clean, and classy hotel...service and attitude were top notch...doormen were friendly and eager to help... ladies on the desk were knowledgable and efficient. The room is average size, but the bathroom was very classy. No motel quality here...the shower is tiled natural stone...(marble or granite)...sink was nice granite, and huge framed vanity mirror...fancy shower curtains and nice tiled floor. I hate cheap crappy plastic bathrooms...The bed was a double queen...it was pretty good as well...ive slept in better beds but this will do. Overall the room was very clean and well appointed.Signing up for the Omni select guest is worth it...you should do it well in advance so you get the additional coupons for upgrades and discounts. You must do this in advance to activate them...Location wise...it is very ideal...next to chinatown 2 blocks, 4 blocks to Union square and 4 blocks to Embarcadero center and 3 blocks to columbus ave bars.. china town is up the hill but if you can make it to st. mary's parking lot...you can make it to chinatown. Honestly though, I think getting a hotel by fishermans wharf wouldve been a better location...but then, you'd get a Motel quality place for a Hotel price tag... i chose the hotel...If you have a baby or kids... fisherman's wharf would be a better fit. But if you like bars..i think Omni would be great since Columbus ave bars is just next door...very cool place. Awesome chinese food (dimsum also) at Harbor village in the embarcadero. (order the nobleman's chicken $80..a day in advance. Its called Beggar's chicken in Hong Kong...absolutely amazing) RG lounge is also good chinese food that's walking distance... peking duck is good...but Harbor village takes all the awards. If you like steaks...and not afraid to drop $50+...Bob's chop house is awesome. I loooove steak... breakfasts/lunch is more reasonable.... but they have all the best cuts at night. Defintely worth going to.The BAD.. No swimming pool or spa... after walking up hills and blocks of concrete pavement... you'd want a spa to relax in. None. Bummer for kids. Hotel was sold out...so my select guest coupons and discounts were useless for upgrades...so call in advance. Parking is highway robbery.. they should have discounts for guests.. Overall... it is still a good experience. its no resort...its a business hotel, and maybe not a good pick if you have kids...but if you want a good place to sleep with your wife or girlfriend...close by to bars and great food. And without all the other complaints of moldy bathrooms, smelly beds, and crappy A/C... a nice respectable hotel like this is worth it.

<Content>Great hotel in San Francisco Having stayed at many disappointing four star rated spots in SanFran, this hotel was very lovely. Although they did not have the double bed rooms we requested numerous times before arrival, they provided us with comfortable rollaways, and attempted to immediately move us to double bed rooms on the second night. Everything in the hotel functioned well- super clean rooms, great service, great location - its perfectly situated - between the busy busy union square area, and access to street cars for the wharf, or going to the North End Italian district on foot. Its very quiet at night and also right next to Chinatown. Altogether a great hotel with a great staff. My only complaint is the dinky free business center they have on the ground floor, where two free computers are provided for hotel guests use (because the room web-TV is hopelessly slow and disconnects). These computers have people sitting at them 24/7, with a line of guests waiting outside the door. You can keep checking back ten times and not make it onto the computers. While it is a nice courtesy to have these, I found the set up horrible and disruptive to the immediate lobby area. What they need to do is provide guests with a log in code each day, once a day, or a set period of use, say 15 minutes. That way people can't hog the computers for hours. Even worse, when trying to remedy this situation and offer additional computers behind the front desk to guests that have waited too long - there seems to be miscommunication between the hotel staff - with one happily offering extra computers for guests to use briefly, and another (the only nasty staff member we encountered at this hotel) rudely kicking us off shortly thereafter. Perhaps they'd be better off removing their courtesy computers. This is the only flaw in the hotel, and not much of one considering all the great service and amenities. I'd definitely stay here again, but I would bring my laptop.

<Content>Pefect! My husband and I stayed at the Omni on Aug 12-14. We were starting a ten day tour of the California coast and celebrating our five year anniversary. Our stay at the Omni was a perfect way to start this very special vacation! I had researched several BBs and hotels through Trip Advisor and decided on the Omni. We got our room for $135 for night one and $140 for night two - woo hoo! I had concerns of hearing outside noise in our room, the location being far away from things we'd want to see (we had never been to San Francisco), and the price of the mini bar. Here is what we found: We never heard any outside noise in our room. I am a very light sleeper, and no outside noise could be heard. The location was excellent! We could get to the Wharf in 20 minutes walking. The front desk will tell you how to avoid the hills. We only rode the cable cars once to say that we did it. We also rode the bus once to Haight Ashbury (Golden Gate Park) which was a very interesting trip. Our favorite section was the Italian District, lots of great places to eat and cool little bars! A very easy walk to/from the Omni. Don't hesitate to ask the front desk how to get places. They are very helpful! The Omni is located in the Financial District, so on the weekends the sidewalks aren't crowded. Finally, we never even opened the mini bar because of some of the reviews that we had read. There is a Trader Joe's close by where we purchased some wine and snacks. From reading a past review I joined (free) the Select Guest Program. This is a must! Just go to --- and fill out a quick form. We signed up just days before our trip. Because I signed up late, I emailed the Omni our guest number just to make sure that they had it on file. This is an unbelievable program - for free! All of our requests were granted! You'll have to go to the site to check this program out...and sign up!We had a perfect stay at the Omni and would return again!

<Content>I left my heart at the Omni San Francisco! We ended up at the Omni from a deal another travel site. WOW! 5-star service all the way. The hotel is beautiful and the service is definitely 5-star. We had a king room on the 14th floor and it was perfect! Beautiful marble bathroom with great toiletries. Compliementry robes and fluffy towels! The housekeeping staff leaves notes each day for you and provides turndown service each night with fresh towels (our favorite!). As a select guest, they offer complimentry morning beverages and a cheaper in-room bfast menu. We had cheeseburgers from room service one night and they were very fast and ver good. We had bfast one day in the restaurant - which is very expensieve (but so is the normal Omni rate, so we understood). The business center is free 24-hours a day in the looby. The front desk/conceirge is fantastic and helped us get around on the trolley, the cable car (which runs outside) and the even use their town car! They also booked us a city tour which was great! VERY HIGHLY Recommended!!

<Content>Our new #1 choice in San Francisco We've been happy with Omni properties previously and with the Phenomenal Fridays rate that we got, couldn't pass up trying this one. Our biggest regret is that we didn鈥檛 extend our weekend another day for more time here! From the time we arrived, the service was very personable and great. Check in took less than two minutes and upon arriving in our room, found a welcome note on the bed. The hotel was clean and even the smallest request was granted without asking. One example was when going out for our anniversary dinner, it was obvious we were dressed up for a special occasion. Instead of hailing us a cab as requested, he had a town car brought over to take us to dinner, complimentary. A very nice touch!My two recommendations to anyone staying here would be to sign up for Select Guest so at the very least you will bet a free juice and paper in the AM (and a big discount on a bagel/muffin). The other would be to verify your room size at check in. Traditionally, we have found corner rooms at the Omni to be of larger size so we try and request those. Here, it was an odd configuration (and a bit smaller) with part of a wall impeding the entry. Not a big deal since we probably only spent 4-5 hours in our room outside of sleeping but thought I would pass that along if.If you want a snack, there is a Subway across the street, a Mrs. Fields on the next block and a convenience store just around the corner. We bought drinks there and put them in the ice bucket; ready to drink when we got back from the day. They even added fresh ice when both when cleaning the room and at turndown.Location couldn't be better as we walked to Pier 39, Union Square and a very small hill (more of a grade) up to Grant Street and Chinatown.The bar was perfect for what we were looking for at the end of a long day, not a major party scene and not completely empty. We could carry on a conversation, hear the cable car as it went by and just enjoy the evening. Service was quick and the drinks were actually priced good for a hotel bar. Once again, very friendly and accommodating.I'll also have to second the Italian restaurant that the concierge recommended as it was perfect for a not too expensive dinner and was a walk of only 2-3 minutes. I'll also have to second the Italian restaurant that the concierge recommended as it was perfect for a not too expensive dinner and was a walk of only 2-3 minutes.I think the best compliment came from my wife when she said, 鈥淚 figured it would be nice but really had no idea it would be THIS nice.鈥?Sure. getting a good rate helped but I鈥檒l be back again and would still be just as happy paying full rate.

<Content>Loved it! We had a wonderful stay at the Omni in August. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite because the guest staying in the room the night before decided to stay another day. The suite was handsomely decorated and good sized. Service was impeccable, with very helpful and courteous staff. The hotel is centrally located. We were able to walk to Union Square (3 times in one day!), Chinatown, North Beach and Embarcadero within 10 minutes; Fisherman's Wharf in about 20 minutes. I've been to SF many times and by far this is the best hotel in my experience. We will definitely return again.

<Content>Five Star rooms and service at the Omni Honestly... One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had and this was my first time at an Omni. From the moment we walked into the reception to the moment we walked out the door two things really stood out...the service and the room. Everyone we encountered was very nice and seemed to really enjoy working at the property. The room reminded me of a Ritz Carlton or the St. Regis in DC. Plush furnishings, classic elegance, great bathroom. I really could not have been happier with my stay.Additionally, I had left my cell phone in the room after check-out and upon my return the housekeeping staff was overly helpful and located my phone in the laundry room wrapped up in the sheets. Whew!.... thank goodness for the great service.Travel tip: SF parking can be expensive but on the weekend we found St. Mary's parking garage one block away for only $6.50 a night. We quickly used the money we saved by splurging on the mini bar. Cheers!

<Content>Wonderful surpise I stayed at the Omni for 2 nights in Jul  was pleasantly suprised. I am a huge fan of the Kimpton hotels  always use them when in SF. This time I decided to try the Omni  was very pleased. The public rooms are lovely, the bathrooms nicely appointed  the room itself more than adequate. The buffet breakfast is very good, but as is the case usually in hotels, pricey. The location is great very near the Trans American building  Chinatown. The staff really shined though. Everyone I came into contact with spoke to me  was very pleasant  helpful. They gave me a wonderful suggestion for an Italian restaurant just around the corner. I would suggest this hotel to anyone. Free use of the business center, internet  printer was great!Kim AnnAAA Travel

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Highly recommended - We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights towards the end of July and were very impressed with the hotel. We had a good sized room with two double beds, nicely decorated with a good sized bathroom which was nicely fitted out.The only downside was the restaurant was not family friendly, it looked more suitable for business dining. However the breakfast was very good but quite expensive (if you went for the full American). The location of the Omni is also very pleasant - it is at the bottom of the Nob Hill area / start of the financial district with a cable car route passing in front of the hotel. The front office staff were very helpful and helped us find our way around.The free internet access was great.

<Content>Pretty Good We stayed here for three nights at the end of July. I thought the hotel was pretty good, but perhaps did not get the quality of service I expected due to the fact it was booked as a last-minute deal. We requested a King room on a higher floor (also called and confirmed the day before) and ended up in a double room on the 3rd floor. Not what we wanted (trust me -- doubles are small!) but still very nice.The staff was great at the front desk. They provided maps and told you the best way to get there. Very friendly and helpful. In addition, they recommended a place for dinner which turned out to be close, good and reasonably priced.Watch out for the hotel bar -- a drink and a piece of cake cost the same as a full dinner for two people at the aforementioned restaurant.

<Content>Great start to our Honeymoon We stayed at the Omni as the first part of our Honeymoon. We then went to Seattle and then Vancouver.The overall experience was a pleasure with the Omni. We saw the good reviews on this site and email the hotel for room rates. With a short while we had an email back and we replied to confirm we wanted a room. We asked the guy to call us in the UK for our card details and within another half hour we had a call from a lovely guy called Matt. He took our details and we had some chat. He then emailed me a confirmation of booking and sent me some details on how to get from the airport to the Hotel.The reception was great. All the staff wished us their congratulations on our marriage and they even gave us a bottle of sparkling wine and their was a hand written card as well. The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. Their was a gym we didn't use.Location is great as well in the financial part of the city, just a few minutes walk from downtown. The Trolleys go past the front door as well.Thanks again to all the staff, we will seek out another Omni if we are in the US or Canada.

<Content>Watch the Mini bar price Stayed here for a weekend and location and hotel itself are very good but one issue I did have was the minibar.After a days sightseeing we fancied a drink to finish the evening off and ordered some room servivce. Couldn't find a mini bar tariff so presumed (incorrectly) that it wouldnt be far off the room service price.Checked bill on TV the next day to find we had been charge 60 dollars for 2 cans of coke and a half bottle of wine which would have cost 30 dollars through room servvie.When I asked at reception they said that the prices were clearly explained on the tariff - when I explained that my room didnt have one the receptionist didnt believe me and offered to come up to the room to show me!. At this point i was extremely angry and asked why the mini bar was double the price of room service (which i had called for somthing to eat anyway) the reponse was again amazing - everyone knows how expensive the minibar is so you should have known. Coming from the Uk where the mini bar price is roughly the same as room service I pointed out how the hell was I to know. I asked for the manager who quicky dealt with the situation apologised for the manner which I was spoken too and knocked off 50%.As I say nice hotel but certain members of staff spoiled it slightly

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed there for 3 days and loved it. The hotel was clean and the service was amazing. The rooms were big and nicely decorated. The bathroom was huge too. Great hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat. The only issue, if any, would be that the restaurant was a bit pricey. The bar serves the same menu as the restaurant so there really is no place to get a small meal at a decent price. We ordered Room Service instead and that was delish. But overall, this hotel is great.

<Content>Very good hotel I recently stayed 11 nights at the Omni San Francisco, first 8 nights May 30 鈥?June 7, and then another 3 nights June 16-19. I was very pleased with my stay at the Omni San Francisco. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the 24 hours business service; which means free internet and free access to Microsoft word, Microsoft PowerPoint and even a possibility to make PDF files as well; was very valuable for me. The room was big (400 sq. ft.), clean, quiet, enough with TV channels, and the turndown service with ice and some chocolate in the evening was very nice. During my second stay I was happily surprised when I came back to my room since the manager had given me some nice chocolates as a gift since I was staying a second time at Omni San Francisco. Before I went to San Francisco I sign up for Omni Hotels Select guest service and it meant that you every day during your stay received some complimentary water, soft drinks, coffee or tea in the morning. I also had a complimentary late check out until 5 pm without any problems. When I gave some tip to the housekeepers they wrote a thank note. I was very pleased with the excellent service at Omni San Francisco. The Omni San Francisco is located in the financial district and is about 15 min walking to Union Square, and 35 min walk to fishermans wharf. Two blocks away up on a steep hill is Chinatown located with its many restaurants. There is a Walgreens one block away on Montgomery Street and it is a MacDonalds two blocks away as well. One block away on Kearney Street is a good Thai Restaurant (Bangkoks best). One of the reviews I read about Omni San Francisco said that it was boring and another review says that they should not stay at Omni again because the bar at Omni was not lively enough. If you are in San Francisco and is looking for a hotel there you should party, Omni may not be your kind of hotel. However, if you are like me, that you appreciate a hotel with friendly and helpful staff, excellent service, 24 hours free internet and business service; big, clean and quite rooms, good location, and close to many restaurants, you should consider staying at the Omni San Francisco. I highly recommend Omni San Francisco.

<Content>A really great experience Having worked in the hotel business for ten years in a previous career, I am pretty jaded by hotels and their marketing hype. The San Francisco Omni, however, exceeded the hyperbole and provided me with a very pleasant stay in a city not necessarily known for exemplary hotels. My room was large and handsomely appointed, with a nice selection of amenities. The staff was friendly, gracious and unobtrusive, and the bar and restaurant were elegant spaces with good food. What more can you ask for?All in all, this was one of the best hotel experiences I have had in San Francisco. Definitely worth a stay.

<Content>Regal Omni We enjoyed our stay at the Omni San Franciso. It's beautiful and service oriented. We arrived late from the east coast and they were very accomodating and responsive to two very weary travelers. They did not blink at our 2 am room service request and the food was fresh, hot and beautifully presented. The bell staff and conceirge were knowledgeable and helpful with direction and city suggestions. The location is great and you are able to walk to many of the city's sites and shopping. Make sure you request a high floor to reduce the traffic sounds. Parking is also a bit expensive using the valet service, but there is a garage right up the street.We would stay at the Omni again but next time we will stay somewhere a little more modern with an nice, sophisticated and more active bar. We are young at heart and enjoy a drink out with good music and a lively crowd. The Omni was a little stuffy for that type of activity. This is the only reason I did not give the hotel 5 stars. Enjoy the Omni and San Fran!

<Content>Wonderful, centrally located hotel! I was a little hesitant to stay in the financial district, but I'm very glad I did! My original reservation was in Fisherman's Wharf, but it's too crowded and touristy for my taste. This beautiful hotel is located right on the California Cable Car line. I was able to walk to Chinatown, Union Square, and North Beach. The one time we went to Fisherman's Wharf was just a cable car or bus ride away.I loved the marble bathrooms and bath amenities. Nice to take a soak after climbing the hills all day long. The staff was friendly and eager to please. The one mix-up I had regarding my package was taken care of quickly and they profusely apologized.I would not hesitate to stay there again. The Omni has spoiled me!!!

<Content>Nice digs, so-so service I stayed at the Omni in San Francisco this past weekend with a friend for just one night. It's beautifully and centrally located, just above Union Square, lovely hotel, everything seemed very clean and neat, and the staff was quite friendly. However, there were, in my opinion, three minor strikes against our particular stay. They all felt like problems that wouldn't typically happen, but maybe because there was somebody new  inexperienced on staff or something like that. Nevertheless:1) Reservations were under my friend's name. She called the day before to confirm. However, when she checked in, they told her that they had scheduled us to stay there on OCTOBER 11, not June 11. ??? Fortunately, she had the confirmation printout and they accommodated us immediately.2) My friend is highly allergic to animal products, and while confirming, she requested that they remove any  all down products from the room--synthetic pillows  blankets only. Well, when we settled in for the night, she started wheezing, tearing up, sneezing. (She wasn't even in bed yet--we were just sitting around, chatting  watching TV.) Sure enough, they hadn't removed the down pillows or duvet. She called, told them she was unhappy and had to request another blanket, which they brought up immediately. 3) We ordered hot chocolate, and it came up to us extremely... lukewarm.So, the service seemed good, but... some of this stuff shouldn't have happened in the first place. I'd stay there again, but if I had any special requests, I would follow through immediately. And I'd send the hot chocolate back.

<Content>attention to every detail I was so happy we chose the omni hotel in san francisco. We were so please with all the attention to detail. It was a good size room with a very nice marble bathroom. We had fresh fruits waiting for us at arrival and a hand written note to welcome us to the hotel. The staff was wonderful and the location was great. It was within walking distance to union square and fishermans warf . Oh, one thing I forgot to mention the bed was so wonderful, I slept like a baby....We really didn't feel like we were at a hotel,we felt at home. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and we will choose this again for our next stay in san francisco.

<Content>Great Value and location Great Hotel if you want to be in the heart of San Francisco and yet away from all the traffic noise. This is in the Financial district which is only a few blocks away from Union Square. So on weekends everything dies down and you can enjoy peaceful suroundings. Very well appointed rooms, excellent service and way cheaper than some of the other big names that are not as nice on the interior. We had some loud partying neighbours and finally called the front desk at 11:45 pm and they took care of it immedately. Only issue is that Valet parking fee is $51 per 24 hrs - WOW! Suggest street parking on weekends which is free or the St Mary's Garage close by which is $6.50 per weekend night. You are out of luck on weekdays as parking is expensive everywhere.

<Content>Superlative! There's no view here, but the ambiance and level of service almost make you forget. Extremely convenient to everything - Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, Market Street, Chinatown. (And yes, there are alternatives to walking up California Street without having a massive coronary! Take a cable car or walk up Post Street) I have stayed at all the major hotels over the years and the Omni is the best - best sized rooms, best location, best staff. Treat yourself to a dose of luxury and stay here.

<Content>top notch hotel this hotel is worth the money we spent! we got a great deal through expedia. it's a little higher priced (more than $100 per night) but it was worth it! my review:1. we were upgraded to their signature room when we checked in. it's located in the higher floors with high thread count bed linens, an amazon shower head, great roomy room with luxurious features  design2. hotel itself is centrally located. if you don't mind walking about 4-5 blocks to: chinatown, nob hill  union square. you can also catch cable car which is right outside the entrance! cable car will take you to most major touristy sights in san fran, including fisherman's wharf.3. staff extremely helpful  friendly. the disadvantage of staying in this area is it's in the financial district so there are really no restaurants right outside the hotel. but the hotel's steakhouse (bob's) i understand is one of the best in the city. another thing is the parking! since it's downtown, parking is expensive or hard to find. if you park with the hotel, they'll charge you $40+ for valet!! there is a carpark building across the street which charge about $30 for 24 hour parking (or overnight). there's hardly any street parking. but if you're not driving, it won't be a problem. there are cabs readily available  of course the cable car.overall, omni is one of the best hotels i've stayed in =)

<Content>Outstanding! Just back from a (2) day stay at the Omni. After being a bit hesitant to stay at the property, only on the account that I prefer the newer, more contemporary decors of the W or Westin, I was pleasantly surprised. On arrival, we were welcomed as first-time tenants of this particular location (my wife is a Select Guest Gold member). This minor recognition was a nice touch. An even nicer touch was when we arrived in the room and found a bottle of wine, some chocolates, and a nice letter of welcome from the Select Guest manager. We were sold!Room was great. Excellent corner location. Bathrooms were amply supplied with towels and well-lit. There was a sound system and DVD in-room as well.Valet was ultra efficient in retrieving our car within 15 mins. A bit expensive (~$45), but not more than any other hotel in the area.5 stars for the Omni. With their personalized service, they have made me a repeat customer for life!

<Content>Excellent Experience!!!! After reading everyone else's review, I felt confident about choosing the Omni. It was fantastic!!!! The room was huge and extremely clean. The staff was very friendly, professional, and accommodating. It's an upscale hotel, without the snooty attitudes. I felt comfortable there, and enjoyed how quiet my room was too. Location was perfect. Just expect to pay a $40 cab ride from the airport.

<Content>Pleasant Surprise I've almost come to expect substandard service from large hotel chains. Thus, I wasn't expecting much from my stay at the Omni in San Francisco and was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the hotel and its service.The rooms are of adequate size and layed out in a manner that lets you either relax or work. There is a nice chair  ottoman and a good-sized desk. The TV rotates fully so that you can actually watch TV from the desk. The bed is comfortable and comes with an array of different styles of pillows. The bathroom is also of decent size and well-lit. There is free (i.e., no extra charge) high-speed internet service. The bathroom amenities are above average and include bath salts. There is nightly turndown service that includes, if necessary, fresh towels. For rainy days, there is an umbrella in the room and additional umbrellas are available at the front door. An array of newspapers (WSJ, USA Today, SF Chronicle) are available free of charge.The staff is unusually friendly and helpful. Check-in was a breeze. The front desk was never crowded, even though the hotel was. The concierge was helpful. Room service came promptly. Hotel staff greeted you when you arrived and left. Someone was always there to hold the door.The hotel is located a block from Chinatown and close to many good restaurants. The one negative was the elevator system. There are only 3 elevators for 17 floors and they are slow. Thus, during peak hours (7-9 a.m.), you must allow at least 10 minutes to get downstairs from an upper floor. Overall, however, the Omni gets high marks. I definitely recommend it, especially for business travelers.

<Content>Omni is excellent for business travellers Really enjoyed my stay at the Omni. I travel a lot and have very high standards for service, location and room quality. The rooms at Omni are nice and spacious and very clean. I especially appreciated the hand written note each day from housekeeping. Another nice touch was that when four of us arrived to check in at the same time, the bellman jumped right in to check one of us in. He has a little basket of reservation information with room keys all ready to go. After a quick credit card imprint, we were on our way. It's not often you see hotel staff able to do each others' tasks.

<Content>Great Location We were a little hesitant to stay at a hotel in the financial area instead of Union Square. But we were pleasantly surprised. No busy crowds. The hotel was very conveniant to all the major attractions, Embacadero, Ferry Bldg., Columbus Ave, Chinatown and Union Sq. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The standard room was of good size. Register at Omni's preferred guest on line and you will get newspapers, coffee and juice delivered to your room each morning gratis. Many nice restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Convenient, Quiet and Hospitable My husband and I stayed here for 4 days in April and enjoyed our stay very much. I am picky about hotels, especially bathrooms and I didn't have one complaint about this one. The bathrooms were all marble and the cleaning staff did a great job keeping our room clean.The staff was very friendly and helpful, this being our first trip out to San Francisco, they had good recommendations for places to eat and were helpful with directions. The hotel was much more of a business type hotel with business clientele, being in our twenties we often felt like the youngest couple there, dressed much more casually than the rest of the hotel patrons. Nonetheless, it was a good location, with chinatown being 2 blocks away, Union square 5-6 blocks away, and we often walked to Fisherman's wharf and ghiradelli square for dinner and rode the cable cars back. This is a hotel where you can do all you want during the day and have a nice place to relax when you are return. ***Advice: Bring comfortable walking shoes and a light jacket***

<Content>Stellar Service Lovely elegant room, not large, but nicely appointed with marble bath, minibar, free dsl. In-room CD player with a library at the front desk, could be more extensive, but hey. If you join the frequent stay club before you go, they will provide you with free morning beverages delivered to your room, reasonably priced room service (who ever heard of that!) and a newspaper. Parking is simply outrageous at $49 a night...I got rid of my rental car, and instead of returning it to the airport was able to drop it a few blocks away thanks to the quick intervention of the front desk personnel. The doormen, desk staff, housekeepers, all wonderful. I did have a nonfunctioning bathtub drain which wouldn't shut; a repairman was dispatched who said it was installed incorrectly and offered to change my room; after a call he kept working and pronounced it fixed. It wasn't fixed. Alas. The extraordinary amenity bath salts from Institute Swiss, down the drain...but that was the only hitch. All in all a wonderful stay in a well-located downtown property. A few blocks from the hot embarcadero center, and I even found a wine shop open Sunday at 7PM. You can't beat that.

<Content>The Best in San Fran! Went out to Frisco for vacation with my wife in April. Our stay at the Omni was outstanding. First class all the way. Very helpful staff, great room, excellent service, and very close to all the best attractions. The omni is just a few blks from North Beach which has several great places to eat and drink. One thing I would recomend is to get a limo from the airport to your hotel. A limo cost us $45 plus tip wereas a cab is just over $40 plus tip. Hey, why not arive in style?

<Content>Solid Four Star Pick in Financial District While my wife and I normally stay at newer, trendier properties, the San Francisco Omni won us over with it's friendly, professional staff and convienent location. While our 17th story King room didn't offer the best views (think portholes for windows), the room itself was clean, quiet, well appointed, but not spectacular. Housekeeping did a fine job maintaining the room, but neglected to ensure a second roll of toilet paper was available. The mints offered during the evening turndown service were a nice touch.The hotel is more of a business hotel than resort property...no pools, spas, activity rooms, or even a small gift shop to be found. The business center did offer computers with complimentary high speed internet access, and the health club offered a variety of workout machines.Located midway between the Wharf and Union Square, and on the California street cable car line, the S.F. Omni is nicely located in the center of the financial district...seemingly hundreds of ATM's within a couple of blocks. Most attractions are easily within walking distance...but beware the hills, they can be a full blown cardio workout.Parking though is simply outrageous. $45 dollars a day puts the Omni well above neighboring garages...after the first night, we found cheaper near-by alternatives. Overall, the Omni staff impress you with their friendly demeanor and efficency...and although the property won't make you say wow, it's one of the better hotels we've ever stayed at. Well done!

<Content>Awesome I have to say whenever we stay at the Omni It is above par. The entire experience is awesome. The comfortability of the bedding at the relaxing atmosphere is unbeatable. I can't say the same for the Grand Hyatt i stayed at in Union Square. Never will i make the same mistake. I am forever in debt to the Omni staff for making my stay the best of any hotel. Thank you again. You should all be commended. Ohh and give yourselves a raise.

<Content>Hard to Top This We stayed here on a Sunday night in March. Doorman was fantastic, and front desk staff were amazing. Its in the financial district, so that night there was hardly any street traffic. The next morning we walked to Union Square and its about a 7 block walk. Everytime we entered the lobby from the elevator or front door, we were always greeted cheerfully by name.This is a smaller hotel than the big monsters like the St.Francis, so there is not a gift shop, but a Bob's Steak and Chop House Restaurant. We were familiar with Bob's from Texas, but never ate there. We had planned to move the next day to the Monaco to be closer to Union Square, and noticed an immediate drop in service level. The rooms at the Omni are average size, and have a nice marble bathroom. They could use a separate shower. The room we had on the top floor, had a fruit basket and fax machine. Upon checkout, we were teased about leaving after just one night, and asked if they had done anything wrong. We replied Omni Service was great.During our stay in San Francisco, we went to the Ferry Market on Tue when they have local farmers kiosks set up. We also took a tour of the city with Great Pacific, a local small very nice tour company. Also drove one day over to Sausalito. Dined at Scoma's on the Wharf, Tadich Grill, Sam's Grill, and the Cheesecake Factory on Union Square. For lunch, there is a very busy In N Out Burger on the Wharf. Very good meals at all of them.The Cannery shops seemed to have fizzled since the 70's, and now the action has moved to Ghiardelli Square and Pier 39. We really loved our stay at the Omni, and talked about it on the flight home.

<Content>Ohhhhhh the Omni The Omni is a wonderful Hotel. I am always made to feel like a princess when I stay here. Service here is on par with a Four Seasons! Internet access is complimentary there is even a complimentary business centre. The rooms are spotless, classic well equipped. I definitely recommend this hotel for business and pleasure, A short walk to the Ferry building (San Francisco's new dinning hub) and the all time classic the Taditch (the oldest restaurant in San Fran) I have only stayed on the 16th and 17th floors (upgraded rooms) These have down comforters, Luxury linens fruit basket etc. All employees at the Omni go out of their way to ensure you stay is Memorable

<Content>My Favorite SF Hotel I used to live in SF, so when I go back to visit friends.. this is the ONLY place I will stay. When I lived there, I had about 100 guests come into town for my wedding, and they all stayed at the OMNI. (Including myself) The service is amazing, the staff is the best and this is the best priced 4-5 star hotel in the entire city. (Unless you go South of Market, but it's not as CLEAN in that area)The reason the hotel is so much cheaper that the other 4-5 star hotels, is because it is in the financial district. Most tourists want to stay in the heart of the tourist traps, but trust me the 3 extra blocks it takes you to walk to Union Square or Chinatown is worth it. I Promise!All the beds have pillowtops and are so comfortable. The showers have multi-head shower nozzles for a great shower massage. The food is awesome and the decor throughout the hotel can't be beat! I highly reccomend, if you ever need to plan an event or diiner, to do it there! I had my Rehearsal Dinner there and it was WONDERFUL! I love this hotel and cannot say enough good things about it.

<Content>Top hotel - all round top choice Stayed at the Omni with my wife and boy for 2 nights prior to Christmas. Have stayed in several SF hotels before and Omni certainly stands out. Room was v comfortable, albeit standard size, but bed huge, plenty of room for cot, good closet for all the bags and a smart bathroom. Room service exceeded our expectation and food was of a high quality whilst not being extortionately priced. As far as location goes if you are a visitor and given SF is a city to sample using your feet the Omni is in a great spot. Plenty going on up and down California to watch and get the feel, 10 mins to Union Sq, Chinatown is around the corner (although up the hill, but then where isn't in SF?) and you can walk to Fish Wharf in around 30 minutes or so via Colombus and North Beach. All round the Omni is a comfortable, classy, great place to stay, from which you can sample a wonderful city.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Service! We stayed at the Omni San Francisco Hotel over New Years'. We were originally scheduled to stay at the Westin St Francis. What a smart move! This is a smaller hotel (approx. 300 rooms) and the service is outstanding. The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful. When we were taken to our room, a member of the housekeeping staff management came by to ensure that the room was to our liking, and offered to move us if we didn't like it. The cozy bar was great! Our only complaint - the cost to park our car $25/day...but I guess that's standard for San Francisco. Also, it's about a 6 to 8 block hike to get to the stores at Union Square, but we didn't mind the walk, even though it was raining. We will definitely return to the Omni when were are in San Francisco again!

<Content>Superlative I was impressed by the service and the comfort that I found at the Omni - and I will be the first to admit that I am hard to please : ). This hotel had a knowledgeable, professional and friendly staff - their recommendations of a Chinese restaurant in nearby Chinatown or of a restaurant in close North Beach were spot-on when I made clear my price range and my expectations. The rooms had an understated elegance to them and there was considerable attention to detail - including a starched linen cloth at the foot of the bed for the slippers - a nice touch indeed. The location along the cable-car track put me at one end to Market Street and a connection near the top of Nob Hill brought me into either Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf in good time to enjoy the many things that San Francisco had to offer. Yet, being far enough away from the hectic activity of these places -- especially during this time of year -- made the hotel room a welcome refuge. Contrary to other reviews, I found the prices at both the restaurant and the lounge to be comparable and fair considering the location of the hotel in the Financial District and the level of service and quality provided. However, as I stated earlier, there are ample restaurants nearby from which you can choose. Finally, the use of a town car for a slightly higher fee than a taxi was an excellent touch. I travelled with 3 others who had a number of bags - and a Cadillac Escalade was ready at my time of booking to take our group to the airport. This truly is a superlative property. For the rate, it has to be the best value and the best comfort in San Francisco.

<Content>The SF Omni Hotel Was Wonderful! We live in a suburb of San Francisco metro area but because of a formal company Xmas party on Sat night 12/11/04 we decided to stay in the city and make a weekend out of it. I chose the Omni because of reputation, reviews, rating and price. Got it thru Hotwire, not inexpensive but a fabulous value. With Omni you can join their Select Guest Program before having stayed there. When in the program you receive room upgrades, amenities (continental breakfast, paper, bathrobes), and late checkout (5 pm). Prior to our arrival they upgraded us to a Premier View Room. The building is gorgeous. Lobby is dark wood and marble with beautiful furnishings. All of the hotel staff were professional, friendly, courteous and helpful. The room was on the 17th (top floor) and was huge. King size bed and a couch. Furnishings were similar to a very well done home. Bathroom was great also. The best feature, as promised, was the view. A panorama of Washington Square, San Francisco Bay, Angel Island and Sausalito. Wow!! We had just consumed half of the bottle of wine we had brought along when a bellman showed up with a welcome gift of champagne  chocolate dipped strawberries courtesy of the Select Guest Coordinator. Fantastic. Suggest parking at St. Mary's garage 1 block up Calif St with a weekend rate of a whopping $6 for 24 hours. Since the hotel was kind enough to furnish continental breakfast we only needed to split an omelet breakfast downstairs at the wonderful Bob's Chophouse. All in all, one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at and an amazing value on the weekend because it is in the financial district.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great location Just stayed at the Omni on December 11th 2004. great service and we thought the location was excellent, 3-4 blocks to Union square and 4-5 blocks to the heart of North Beach. The room was very nice and well decorated as was the bathroom. The fitness room was also good (free bottled water and apples in the fitness room).We found the staff to be excellent and very helpful. Overall, we loved it.

<Content>A fantastic hotel!!! We came to San Francisco for the weekend to celebrate my husband's 50th B-day. This was the perfect hotel for the event. It is beautiful and simply immaculate! Upon arrival in our room (we were upgraded to a suite) we discovered a bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries along with a note from the hotel management wishing my husband a very happy birthday. The staff were most accommodating with everything. Room service was quick and the food was delicious (a surprise to us, since we learned the restaurant staff were on strike). Considering that some hotel employees were on strike and they were short staffed we really didn't expect this kind of perfection but in all honesty I have to say it would be impossible to say anything negative about this hotel. We travel a lot and always stay in 4-5 star hotels and based on our benchmark - this one definitely makes the grade! Beautiful, friendly, safe and oh so clean!! What more could you ask for in San Francisco!!

<Content>Wonderful hotel Room is spacious and clean with free high speed internet access. Toiletries provided are only okay. Staff is friendly and nice. Housekeeping typically is very fast (although during the strike, our room oftentimes wasn鈥檛 made up until around 5pm). Location is great; in the heart of the financial district within walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown and Theater area. The hotel gym was modern and well-equipped (had free water and towels!). Room service is the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5. The food is decent and the service was prompt, but almost each time we ordered (either breakfast or dinner) they forgot a few things 鈥?one time they forgot salad dressing, another time they delivered breakfast without any utensils. Other than that, I think the hotel is great and would highly recommend it to anyone. Also, if you can grab a 鈥淧henomenal Friday鈥?rate (usually approx. $150/night), it鈥檚 a fantastic bargain!

<Content>Great Stay I hate staying in SF. Traffic, small rooms; so we decided to stay here. This hotel will definately have me coming back. Staff was very helpful, rooms bigger than the boutique hotels in the City. And a great steak house, Bob's Steak and Chop House. When we asked for a taxi, they offered a hotel contracted town car. we still had to pay but it was worth it.

<Content>Love the Omni My S/O and I have stayed at the Omni 3 times now since July 2004, and have had a wonderful stay each time. It's very elegant, tasteful, and centrally located downtown at the corner of California  Montgomery.LocationGreat location right in the heart of the financial district. The cable cars are right out front, and the rail system is only several blocks away. We walked everywhere - Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf (it's a long walk, but we like to walk), etc.StaffThe staff are very friendly and helpful. The housecleaning staff does a great job.RoomsThe rooms we have stayed in are nicely appointed, very clean, and quiet. We had a mini-bar (we took the things out and used the fridge for stuff we bought elsewhere). Plenty of room. High-speed internet access (complimentary), bathroom was decent size and very clean. The closet had extra pillows and blankets, a safe, and terry clothe robes awaiting us :) The bed was very comfortable, and the bedding was very clean.DiningWe ate elsewhere for each meal, but there is a full-service in-room dining menu available, and a restaurant in the lobby area of the hotel. It was a little too up-scale for us, but had great reviews from what we heard. Room service was a little expensive, so we stayed away from it. There were enough places within a few blocks to satisfy us. Exercise FacilityThe exercise room is very nice  spacious. There are 4 treadmills, each with it's own small TV and headphones - that was nice! There are also 3 ski-type machines, which had individual headphone sets to the 2 large TVs in the front of the room; 2 exercise bikes; a weight machine; and free-weights. Water bottles, apples, headphones, towels  newspapers were always available.Transportation to SFOThe Omni has a few house towncars available to take you to SFO if you want. If you want, you can reserve on at the front desk  charge it to your room. Cost was $57. For a slightly less amount, you can also just ask if a car is available when you are ready to go, and if it is, they will take you. The cost is $45. We took a cab from SFO to the Omni, and it was about $40, so the housecar price is pretty comparable, and it's a very nice car.OverallThis is a great hotel - we'd recommend it to anyone, and will stay there the next time we go to San Francisco.

<Content>Excellent hotel with little gaffs We just spent 4 nights in this classy hotel. Without repeating all the deserving praise this hotel receives here, I'll bring up just a few little things that I thought could use some attention.Immediately after checkin we had to head out to meet friends at the Savoy for dinner. Having never been to San Fran, we strolled out the front door and asked the doormen how to get there. They didn't know. When we mentioned the intersection, they finally gave us good directions. The woman who checked us in also seemed a little unsure of procedures, but she may have been a new hire.Housekeeping was great, but slowly tailed off with each day. Little things like having to call down at night because the in-room coffee service was not properly restocked each night. But they delivered whatever we needed promptly, at all hours.I would think a hotel like this would have a removable shower nozzle. This one was mounted very high with little adjustment.They should consider more counter space in the living area, with amenities like kleenex. When the bathroom is occupied, you're pretty much on your own. A small dresser would fit nicely.We had a room on the 11th floor, on the front of the building. It was loud, lots of street noise at all hours. But typical of a city hotel. The curtains were superb at blocking the light, almost too good as it kept us in bed thinking it was earlier.But that's just nitpicking. I'd stay there again for sure.

<Content>Great service, helpful staff We've stayed at the Omni twice, and both times the experience was very good. The rooms are nice and large - maybe not stylish, but comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. What stands out at the Omni is the service. Check-in took all of 30 seconds, and housekeeping responded very quickly to our request for different sheets (it looked like there was some kind of grease that got on them). Everyone I talked to was helpful and knowledgeable, and, best of all, not too hip for their own goodMy only complaint, which I've seen from other guests as well here, is the price of drinks in the hotel bar. $9.50 for a Campari and soda is absurd, and $12.95 for a Grand Marnier (a single, mind you) is downright preposterous. I like to have a relaxing drink in the hotel lounge before bed, but not at those prices. It may be a small thing, but for me it makes the Omni experience above average instead uof excellent.

<Content>Do you want to be treated like royalty? From the doorman to the management, you will be addressed by name and your preferences remembered. The staff is professional and friendly. All request are granted with a smile and in the blink of an eye. (I asked for an ottoman at the desk, and upon our arrival in the room, it was in place!) Anything you need is available 24/7. I had to place an urgent call at 4:00a.m. No problem, room service appeared within ten minutes.The location is fabulous. The Financial District is not infested with tourists as is Union Square, and oh so much safer. It's an ideal, central location to begin and end your daily adventures and falling asleep to the cable cars below is heavenly.Bob's Steak  Chop House is a treat. Sit near a window and watch the world go by...Look for deals on the .net, you don't have to pay top dollar for this exquisite hotel, but it is worth it!You will always remember your stay at the Omni San Francisco with great fondness.

<Content>Stay here if you're old and boring They allow dogs, which is nice. But we had to sneak ours past the front desk, because their pet fee is astronomical. The staff was alright, but this hotel is for old people.

<Content>Very nice hotel Stayed Aug. 2-5 and found this to be a beautiful hotel. Our room was lovely and on the top floor, we even had a distant view of the bay. The double beds seemed small for our family of 4, but were very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and the lighting in there was excellent. I was afraid that its location in the financial district would make it a little harder to get around the city, but we were within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. Fisherman's Wharf required two cable car rides, although we did make the long walk once. Our rate included vouchers for breakfast, but parking and cocktails in the lounge were very expensive. However, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great experience! The hotel was beautiful and the service impeccable. I highly recommend joining the guest select program as you will get a lot of nice extras. I was upgraded to a beautiful suite with complimentary morning beverages every day. The staff at the desk greeted me by name every time I passed by which was a wonderful touch.The prices for room service and the restaurant were very expensive which is about the only negative I have about the hotel. I don't have a problem for paying for a good meal, but these prices were a little exorbitant.Overall I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.

<Content>A real pleasure to 'come home to' June 2004 stay: We were starting our vacation (with 2 small kids) with a 4-hour delay from the East Coast and arrived at the hotel at about 1am. It was a real pleasure after the travel hassles to be treated so well by all the staff  finally sink into super-soft sheets! We got a pretty good deal on hotels, don't know how much more I'd be willing to pay. But I have no hesitation recommending this hotel for service  facilities.

<Content>Very Good But . . . The Omni is a very nice hotel with the usual features for top quality hotels -- but no pool. The kids were disappointed a little by that. The rooms are very nice, clean, well kept--but for two adults and two younger teenage children they were a little crowded. Included one desk and chair and one easy chair. Just fine for two, however. It's a good, well-run hotel, but with a few mild negatives.Good, helpful staff always, but so young. What happened to old, genteel hotel staff?!The two large beds we asked for turned out to be full size, not king or queen, so the two kids felt a little cramped. The room was very clean, the bathroom nice, but had a sliding door to fit the room. Closet had bathrobes, ironing board, iron, even an umbrella. Computer ports, big TV, all the usual. Our view was of the back of other buildings and office windows. In other words, no view. Our rate was about $180 but with city hotel tax, etc. we paid over $200 for each of three nights in early July. Parking for our rental car was $45 a day! Next time I'll find a nearby garage. St Mary's Garage only two blocks up California St. might be cheaper. There's only one restaurant in the hotel. Breakfasts were very nice, service attentive, but expensive. Fortunately, when we reserved and asked about their best rates the hotel gave us six free breakfast vouchers so one-and-a-half day's breakfasts were free. That saved quite a bit. Dinners would have been very expensive and were the meat and potatoes type, so we ate elsewhere.The lobby is very nice--marble, artwork, some chairs, etc., but not a good place to lounge like the Fairmont or other great old hotels. One caution is that this hotel is in the Financial District. This is not Union Square or other hotel areas. At night and on weekends it's pretty empty, no restaurants nearby, and coffee shops and delis only cater to the business crowd so they close very early (4:00 is typical). But Chinatown is only two uphill blocks away so that's nice. Summer in SF is very windy and chilly, so we battled winds every day. Take a windbreaker for sure. I'd stay at the Omni again for $200 or less. At higher rates, I'd expect a bigger room, a coffee shop, pool, more central location.

<Content>Rate confusion One time I paid $89, the other time close to $200. How much are the rooms really worth? Probably closer to the first rate. However, if you're labeled as a cheapo traveler with a low rate, don't be surprised if you get treated accordingly. You may end up in a sub-par room and not get much attention...Location is great if you're doing business in the Financial District. However, if you are visiting for fun, this neighborhood is b-o-r-i-n-g, especially on the weekends.Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for any services within the hotel (food, drinks, room service, etc. - all very very expensive!).

<Content>the best service I stayed at the omni San Francisco June 5-7, booking on their website. Quite a good deal. What sets this hotel and the Omni chain apart from the others is their second to none customer service. They have quite possibly the best frequent stay program in the industry. Upgraded to a suite, no problem, late check-out (5pm I was on the red-eye going out), little details all attended to with efficiency and politeness. The hotel itself is well located in the Financial District, beautiful old buiding. One minor complaint, the decor is a litlle on the stuffy side, mint green uphostery, gold curtains with pom-poms. I don't know anyone that really feels at home in that kind of atmosphere. Toning it down a notch would be nicer. Overall, though an excellent experience, and I'm already recommending this property and the chain to my collegues.

<Content>Overrated ! After reading other reviews I was slightly dissapointed. The rooms are the same as you would expect at any hotel catering for business travellers, certainly nothing special. The location is OK, albeit quiet at weekends.Do not eat or drink at the hotel though as it is rip-off. 2 Jack Daniels at the bar cost $21 !, an orange juice with breakfast costs $5 !., I guess they expect most guests to be on expenses and as such not care too much.All in all OK for the money $150 a night, but nothing special.

<Content>Beautiful hotel with great staff Stayed in a California suite at the Omni San Francisco recently for a weekend. Really enjoyed the stay as the hotel was beautiful in general, and the room in particular. Furnishings were clean, elegant, and comfortable. Bathroom was superb, from the facilities to the toiletries. Lots of space. Health club was very good. Only downside was the staff were somewhat unknowledgeable about where to eat in San Francisco, and relied upon their computer system for information too much.

<Content>The Omni was a great choice! From the time we checked in until the time we left we were treated like royalty. I reveiwed many hotels in San Francisco before making the reservations at Omni and was overwhelmed with the choices. I am very happy that I settled on the Omni. The rooms are large and well apointed. We joined the Omni Select Guest Progam (free) and received coffee, juice and newspaper every morning. The staff, even the bartender in the lounge were very helpful and friendly. They gave us great sight seeing tips. The front desk even got us tickets to the Giants game. The restaurants that they recommended were wonderful - try Rose Pistola or any cafe on Belden Alley.

<Content>What a wonderful place to stay This was our first time in San Francisco and the first time we had stayed at an OMNI. The reviews on tripadvisor were excellent and the price we got on the internet was very good. We stayed from April 12 for 3 nights. From the outset our experience of San Francisco was great but the hotel made it a wondewrful stay. We were taken from the superbly decorated entrance hall to our good sized room by a young man who was informative and keen to share his city with visitors. The room was modern, well eqipped and absolutely pristine. The fittings were brand new and care has been taken to maintain such good order.We took the MUNI pass which gives unlimited travel on the cable cars busse etc and saw all the sites except for Alcatraz - we hadn't booked. In summing up we would recommend this OMNI to anyone. Remember to join the OMNI club before you travel. The OMNI is excellent value for money because of the location, keen polite staff, lovely modern pristine room, and the general attention to detail.
