<Content>Sufficent but boring. Went here with my girlfriend in September 08 for a week.First glance at the room had me thinking it was very small.My girlfriend and I both work in hotels so we decided to ask at reception was there any chance of another room.The receptionist informed us that you get what you pay for and was pretty rude in doing so.Other than this the week was fine,the shower is amazing,the free water in the fridge was welcome too.After 11 there is no atmosphere in the hotel as the bar is shut and there is no form of room service.No iron available either,but very expensive ironing service.Hotel is five mins from Metro which takes ten minutes to barca centre.Overall - clean hotel with very little atmosphere,but close to the metro and the city 800e for the two of us without breakfast for the week.

<Content>Great room, poorer breakfast A modern hotel with a small lobby and a great room. The biggest shower i have seen, and good bed.A very nice location, near Plaza de Espana and Montjuic, with very good transportation near.It was a pitty that the lousy breakfast, without hot dishes, and with little variety spoiled the stay in this, otherwise, good hotel.

<Content>Great hotel We went to Barcelona to combine watching England v Andorra with a long weekend break. We therefore booked this hotel as it was near to the Olympic Stadium (in the Montjuic area). The hotel is about a mile from the stadium and a very pleasant walk. It's also about a mile from Las Ramblas but there is also a metro station very close by and the open top tour buses also stop by the metro station.We did take a taxi to Port Olympic which was about 15 euro and it was about 20 euro from the airport to the hotel.The hotel itself is very modern and the staff are very friendly. They agreed to us paying extra to keep our room until 7pm on the day we left.We didn't book breakfast but paid for it twice. The options were a cold buffet for 10.70 euro or a hot cooked breakfast as well as the cold buffet for 14 euro. This is quite expensive but it was of a good quality and there is a good range.We had a room with 2 single beds which we were able to push together but wasquite welcome as the air conditioning was not that good. The beds were comfortable enough and the rooms were quiet.I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Style over substance The Ayre Hotel Gran Via is a modern, stylish hotel located close to Placa Espanya - just a couple of minutes walk from the metro stop. It has a very boutique hotel look and the bathrooms (shower only though) are fantastic.However, the hotel has one or two problems which some travellers might find annoying.Firstly, the beds are rock hard. I have never (not) slept on such a hard mattress. Secondly, if you want a quiet room looking over the inner atrium then be prepared for very little natural light and to be completely overlooked by the rooms opposite. Thirdly, do not plan to eat in the hotel. The food  service are atrocious.If you are looking for a good quality hotel situated close to the Montjuic district (good for sporting events at the Olympic Stadium  concerts at the Palau Sant Jordi) then I would personally recommend the Fira Palace.If you are visiting Barcelona for sightseeing then I would recommend somewhere closer to the centre of town.

<Content>Modern  As we were staying for 7 nights in Barcelona we wanted to make sure we stayed at a comfortable hotel. The hotel was easy to find and the location not bad. Its generally a tube ride into the very heart of barcelona but its only a couple of stops and is very fast, efficient, cheap, and the stop is only a 2 minute walk from the hotel. We found the hotel to be very modern and were quite surpised what our money got us. The rooms were nice and modern with a large bathroom and great shower. They supply water in your mini-fridge every day which was really nice. I had followed previous reviews and asked for a courtyard facing (interior) room. They didn't have any left but seemed to know why I was asking so instead put us on the 7th floor. We could hear some traffic noise from the very busy road below but it isn't enough to keep you awake. The room had electric blackout blinds so we weren't woken by the sun either. The main negative point I would is say is the air-con. It works but isn't enough to cool the room sufficiently unless left on at full blast for ages. We got an additional room card and left it on while we went out in the evening, it was fine then when we got back. We didn't try the breakfast as it was too expensive and chose to eat out each morning instead. The strange thing for such a big modern hotel is that all service stops at 11pm. You can't get a drink as the bar is shut, nor have anything in your room as room service stops at 11pm too. There are no ironing facilities in the room, you have to send your clothes away to the laundry which at 6 euros for a shirt to be ironed seemed a bit excessive. You won't find any tea or coffee making facilities anywhere either. All in all I would stay here again but would bring a mini kettle or stock up the fridge on my first day!

<Content>Good Gran Via This hotel was perfectly positioned for my short stay in Barcelona. It麓s right beside the Plaza de Espa帽a and Montjuic Park. It麓s also a 12 minute walk from Sants Station. Arriving at the airport, exit the terminal building and turn right. The blue Aeroport bus stops at a stand which is at the front of the building to the right. Travel into Barcelona and get off at the first stop. You then cross the Plaza de Espa帽a in the direction you came and Ayre Hotel Gran Via is at the beginning of the 2nd block. If you want to see the sights, the tourist bus stops at the Plaza de Espa帽a and costs 20 euros. There are 3 routes, and it is the blue route which stops at the Plaza. You can connect to the red and green routes at other stops in the city. There is also a metro stop, which I found easy to use to go to Plaza de Catalunya. I arrived at the weekend and saw the Magic Fountains display, which is round the corner from the hotel.The staff at the hotel are welcoming and helpful. The rooms are modern, clean and a nice size. A bit business-like, however comfortable. The air-conditioning was excellent and there are blackout blinds, so you get a good sleep. My room faced the Gran Via and most of the noise was blocked out. There is enough wardrobe space, extras like shoeshine, sewing kit etc., a safe, a mini-bar with free water and space for your own drinks/food, flat screen tv (limited to Spanish channels and worldwide news). The bathroom has no bath, however has a big shower with shampoo, shower gel etc.No negatives about the hotel. I was able to checkout at a later time, without any problems. They also give you a tourist map of Barcelona when you arrive. Good value for money.

<Content>Quiet, modern hotel We loved several things about the Ayre: (1) it is QUIET. You hear no noise from other rooms or from the hallway. Our room did not face the street. Ask for one that faces the interior. (2) it is clean and very modern in decor. The rooms are large. (3) the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free. (4) the hotel restaurant had a separate area where we could avoid the 15 euro breakfast in the morning and just have a reasonably priced (and delicious) caffe con leche and pastry. There are a couple of downsides: the air conditioning works, but not very well. We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees. The hotel is a five minute walk to the Plaza Espanya metro, but there isn't much in the immediate area in the way of shops, restaurants or tourist attractions. Sometime in the future the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya will be turned into a mall, but for now the only thing you can walk to from the hotel is the hill of Montjuic, which has the art museum, the fountain that is lit up at night, various botanical gardens, various smaller museums, the Spanish Village, and the cable car up to the castle. The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot. The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you don't bring your laptop, using the hotel's computers costs 6 euros an hour. Finally, if you stay here, be very careful when going down into the metro and all of the time you stay on the metro. Even going down the metro escalator steps at a good clip with my husband behind me, someone slipped in between us and opened my backpack. The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros. Plus we saw a thief on a main street walk into a restaurant and calmly start to walk out with someone's camera. We felt more unsafe in Spain than in any other place in Europe. There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where they're trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police don't care that tourists are being preyed upon. Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, don't carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, don't let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door. Be aware of your surroundings at all times, and you won't be a victim.

<Content>Not a 4 star hotel I'm just back from Barcelona where I stayed in the Ayre Hotel Gran Via for 3 nights. The rooms are nice and clean but very basic. I wouldn't rate this hotel 4 stars as it gives you no extras as you would expect in a 4 star setting. There is no mini bar, just a fridge with free water, no ironing board or iron, no satellite TV only Spanish, no coffee or tea facilities. Also there was only one wardrobe which was very small and for one person only. Only the shower gel and body lotion were refilled each day and not toothpaste, shoe sponge, or shower cap.One evening there was no water at all so we couldn't take our daily showers. Barcelona is so humid so you need to take more than one daily.Apart from all this the staff was lovely and the location great but I don鈥檛 think I would stay there again though. I think it would be possible to find other 4 stars hotels that are better value and give you what you are supposed to get for your 4 stars!

<Content>Great price, great location We stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Ayre Gran Via in Barcelona. We were really impressed with how clean, comfortable, and roomy it was. We also got a fantastic rate by booking on venere.com, it was less than $150 in USD per night!! Although it's a good distance from Las Ramblas and other attractions, It's very close to the Metro and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations. We would definitely recommend it and would stay there again!

<Content>More than Happy Booked this trip to Barcelona as a surprise birthday present for my wife. We both were more than happy with Ayre Gran Via. We had an early morning flight which meant we arrived at the hotel very early. Fortunately our room was ready and we immediately checked in. Our room was excellent with double bed (not 2 beds pushed together), flat screen TV, mini bar which contained free water, free safe and an electronic window blind. Our room (106) was located at the front of the hotel. We did hear some traffic noise but not enough to disturb us greatly. The bathroom was large and very modern with a large walk in shower (enough room for 2 people if you know what I mean).The hotel is located a couple of meters off the Placa de Espana which is one of Barcelona's main tourist attractions. As well as the old Bull Ring you also have the famous fountains and the Montjuic museum on the hill. Behind this you have the old Olympic Park which hosted the 1992 Olympic games. The fountains are only switched on certain days of the week but don't forget your camera like I did. There are a few cafe type bars 'dotted' about mainly situated off the roads exiting the square. We sat outside a number of these in the evenings before retiring to the hotel bar for a nightcap. As well as being exciting I think at times we can become anxious when visiting places for the first time. Therefore I have listed a number of tips for future visitors to Barcelona:1. If flying from the UK with Easyjet then sit on the right hand side of the plane. You will witness stunning views of Barcelona before landing (please note that most airlines seem to land on this route).2. On exiting the terminal turn right and the AEROBUS (A1) stop is situated approx 50 yards. The bus to Barcelona cost approx 7.50 euros per couple one way and run every six minutes.3. Bus stops directly on Placa de Espana - walk back 100 yards and you will find this hotel4. Its a fair walk to Placa Catalunya and La Ramba (approx 25 mins I've been told). We caught the bus NO9 from the same stop to Placa Catalunya (where we were dropped off by the airport bus approx 1.30 euro pp).5. Buses 57 or 157 take you directly to Barcelona beach (ask for Barceloneta) and take you to the promenade. The bus stop for this was across the road from the above NO9 stop (this is across the road that takes you to the Montjuic hill). 6. To really see Barcelona I recommend you take the open top tourist bus. This is 20 euros per person but well worth it. This has 3 routes and you can hop on/off at any of the stops, or even take a lunch break like we did and hop back on. You can pay on the bus or at any tourist info cabin which are dotted around the city.We had a fantastic stay in this gorgeous city and hope to be returning the the hotel and city in the near future.

<Content>Great location This hotel was a lovely modern number with a great location - only moments from Montjuic, Bus Turistic, and the Metro - so really easy to get around without being right in the thick of things. The hotel rooms are well appointed - probably not top class, but of a reasonably good standard for what you pay. The bathroom is hhuge and the shower is perfect. Nice touch with the free bottled water which we went through at a rate of knots. The service at front desk was excellent. I had even left a pair of boots in the wardrobe, and the staff arranged for them to be couriered back to me in the UK - so I was really pleased.We didn't have breakfast proper there - perferring to be like the locals with a coffee and a muffin or pastry. But that was good.The only downside was that the fan/air conditioning wasn't really working very well so our room got quite warm. The traffic noise, which someone else complained about, generally happens on weekdays. On the weekends, the room out by the road was actually quite quiet.

<Content>the promise of a good nights sleep We had been traveling around barcelona, staying in basic hotels and even camping, and as this was the last part of our trip we booked this hotel as a bit of a treat due to its promised of a top class service, good location and reasonalble price. On arrival we were impressed by the secure under groud parking, (that was before we were told that it was 16euros a day to use it - but the going rate for a city I suppose) The welcome at reception was professional if a little cold and un friendly. Our room (409) was compact shall we say but adequate for what we needed given we were only staying 2 nights. The hotel proudly advertises that all its rooms are completly sound proof and the hotel istself is very quiet, however our room over looking the main road still got quite a lot of traffic noise from the window, and the heating system was nosiey, even on its lowest setting. But the traffic noise - especially in the mornings did wake us up earlier than intended. The room itself was immacutatly presented though, and the bathroom was big and shower great. Again a minor dissapointment was the fact that the radiator couldnt be turned down or off in the bathroom, making the whole room very warm. When we mentioned the excess road noise and heating fault at reception, there was little appology and no offer of an alternative room, for which we felt quite dissapointed. The bar area was modern and the prices reasonable, although lacked a little atmosphere. The hotel has great transport links with the metro less than 5 minutes walk away and pleanty to look at in the surrounding area, though there wasnt much is the way of bars and cafes to eat out, and the ones that are there were not very good- we found it better to get the metro to the ramblas where there was far better choice.The hotel promises so much quality that maybe we set our expections too high, and as such we felt dissapointed with the poor customer service and the flawed promise of a good nights sleep-which at the end of the day is all you really need out of a good hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel, average location Stayed for 4 nights at the end of April 2008. Hotel was very very stylish, super clean and the staff were really helpful. Only downsides for us were the location - only 4 tube stops outside of town but there isn't anything of interest in the vicinity or any decent bars/restaurants. Also the hotel itself could maybe do with a few more practical touches... - No kettle provided in the rooms so missed my morning cuppa. - They won't provide irons in the rooms for safety reasons so everything has to go through hotel laundry unless you want to look like you've been to bed in your clothes. - lights in the rooms are either full on 'ON' or its pitch black. - no dressing table/mirror that you can see while sat down so had to blow dry my hair stood up (complete girly point I admit but it annoyed me no end).Other things to note/tips if you're thinking of staying here: - specify in advance that you want an interior room. We were orginally in a room overlooking Gran Via which is an awful view and really really noisy. Staff were great though and moved us to another room which faced the courtyard and was nice and quiet. - save yourself cab far by taking the shuttle bus from the airport to Placa Espanya - the hotel is right there and its basically the first stop so takes the same amount of time as a taxi for a fraction of the cost. - don't pay for breakfast in the hotel unless it comes as part of your nightly rate. We were told it would be 鈧?6 per person per day but there's a great little pastry shop about 50 yards down the road where we ate breakfast for the grand total of 鈧? for the two of us each morning.Overall a lovely hotel if you're not bothered about being in the centre of town.

<Content>Ultra modern and friendly hotel in great location My boyfriend booked for us to go to Barcelona for 2 nights at this hotel for my birthday. I initially looked the location of the hotel up on a map of Barcelona and thought it was a long way out of the centre......how wrong was I!! The location is perfect for exploring all of Barcelona's beautiful areas.We were welcomed by a very friendly member of staff on reception who spoke good english and was very helpful. Check-in was smooth and we were given the key card to our room. The interior of the hotel is ultra modern but not uncomfortable looking. Our room was big with a really lovely bathroom. The BEST SHOWER I have ever used in my life!! Air con was easy to use also as we were quite hot.You are a 2 min walk from the main line metro station which takes you to all the major areas, the metro is the best thing in barcelona for getting around, so cheap (10 euro for a 2 day pass) and so quick, there is a train every 5 minutes without fail.My best advice is the following:- Get the Barcelona Bus from Girona airport to the Arc de Triomf metro station and get the metro (2 stops) to Placa Espanya which is 2 mins from the hotel (20 euro return)- DO NOT GET A TAXI as we missed the bus on the way back and had to pay 120 euros!!!- Go to the beach at Barceloneta and eat lunch at one of the cafes- Go to the Picasso Museum and walk around the Gothic Quarter and have lunch near the Cathedral- Walk along Las Ramblas in the day and look at all the human statues and stalls (lots of animals for sale though which isn't very nice)- DO NOT EAT ON LAS RAMBLAS as they over charge, eat on one of the side roads, much nicer and cheaper- Shop and eat tapas on Passeig de Gracia- Walk up the road directly next to the hotel and watch the Magic Fountains at Castle Montjuic (shows 7pm - 9pm). Have a glass of Cava at the top and sit on the cool bobbly chairs (you have to see them)Overall, this hotel is perfect and I would definately stay there again. Can't wait for my nect trip.

<Content>Excellent Hotel This is an excellent hotel, with great transport connections. The Airport Bus drops you about 50 metres from the hotel, and Metro Line 1 is about a 2 minute walk. In addition to this, there is an FGC station about the same distance away with trains to Montserrat, which was one of the main reasons for our visit. I would recommend this and also the Poble Espanyol which is a nice 10 minute or so walk away.The hotel was spotlessly clean and had a modern contemporary feel.The staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was good if a little expensive.If I were to visit Barcelona again, I would not consider staying anywhere else.Lots of reviews and information talk about a problem with pick pockets. We did not experience any problems at all but it鈥檚 the type of event that could really spoil a visit so we were extra vigilant. Enjoy your visit

<Content>Restored my faith in Barcelona Loved the hotel!On the map, and reading other reviews, you think it's a further out than it really is. I've been to Barcelona 3 times now, and this was definately my favorite visit, and the hotel really made it.It's in an ideal location, near the Poble Espana and other tourist sights, and only 5 mins on the underground to the Plaza Cataluna.The hotel itself is only a 2 minute walk to the underground station, and it's on the main line (L1), so you are quickly inot the city and all over the place. It's also the right side of the city for the airport, so the taxi was cheaper than going intot the Ramblas or further into the city itself. (20 Euros, and some how more on the way back?!)We only had breakfast, but it was really nice. A good variety of food from fruit to fried eggs.The reception staff were friendly enough too.The room we had (508) was one was overlooking the corner of the main street and was very quiet, nice and clean. The only small complaint would be that the bed had those horrible plastic matress covers on them! I know they are for hygene reason, but they make you sweat, eek they're awful.I know most people want to be on the Ramblas, but having once had my bag pick pocketed there, I keep away from the place now. This hotel is in a great location and I had a really good long week-end. I'll definately be going back, and would definately use this hotel again.

<Content>You must stay at this hotel! My husband and myself went on a city break to Barcelona. We were only looking for a cheap and cheerful hotel but struck gold when we got this place.Our room was stunning, very modern, clean and spacious and had a great shower.Only 4 stops on the metro from Las Ramblas, this hotel is a gem.The staff were very helpful and polite. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.On a seperate note, watch your purse/wallet on the metro, my husband managed to catch someone tyring to steal his.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel for a great price I was in Barcelona for a company conference and decided to add a couple of extra nights at the beginning and end of the conference to do some sightseeing. Since I was paying my own way for the extra nights, I decided to stay at the Ayre Hotel Gran Via instead of the ridiculously expensive, 5-star hotel that my company had provided for the conference (The Hotel Palace Barcelona). I have to say that the Ayre Hotel Gran Via was phenomenally better than The Hotel Palace in all aspects.The rooms were extremely clean and decorated very nicely with modern furniture and wall-mounted flat-panel LCD TVs. The bathrooms were done with dark-gray slate tiles and were so clean that they looked like works of art! The front desk staff, cleaning staff and restaurant staff were very friendly and there was at least one English-speaking person working the reception desk at all times of the day or night. During my stay, they also provided free wifi internet access and four small bottles of water each day.I have seen some reviews which stated that the rooms at the front of the hotel are noisy because they face the street, but during my first two days at the hotel I had a room at the back and then switched to a room at the front for my last two days, and I didn't notice a difference at all.All in all, this hotel is a hidden gem and you would be wise to book a room there for your trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great hotel Very modern hotel in a good location. Located just 2 minutes from Metro sation and stop for Airport Bus.Very clean, well equiped rooms. Although good soundproofing ask for one overlooking the central courtyard as the hotel is on a main road. Bottled water is available free from the room mini bar. The breakfast is superb - everything you could want. 10 euros for the cold buffet - 14 euros if you have hot food.

<Content>Great Location Great Location, Friendly staff, very young, however very few spoke english. Make sure you put a do not disturb sign on the door, for room cleaning staff will just knock and enter. It happened two days in a row. The rooms are sound proof and bathrooms were very clean! For those of you who need an iron, beware it is not provided, we ended up buying a small one for 9 euros, being that the laundry serve price is ridiculous!! 9 euros to iron a shirt!! Also we asked for an early wake up call and never got it. Luckily I had also set my ipod. The location is great. We're from NY, so the walk to Placa de Catalunya wasn't bad for us, about 20 min. However the Espana metro is a few minutes walk from the hotel. Over all, I would stay there again, it's on a major street, but not as hectic as las ramblas!!

<Content>Great Location This hotel is in an excellent location, the front desk people are at times slow and surly, the mattresses have seen better days, but the breakfast is quite nice. Overall recommended property, though. We stayed two nights at this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel We spent 4 nights in a rainy Barcelona at this hotel and could not really complain about anything. It started quite bad, when we left the airport shuttle bus just next to the hotel, it started to rain, then some idiot (probably a pick-pocket) painted the back of our clothes with some liquid. The hotel was clean, nice design, excellentservice. Free Wifi included that worked fine. The metro stop is next to the hotel, just a few stops to the city center.
