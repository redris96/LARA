<Content>Avoid Amrey Diagonal When I made my reservation, the full amount of my stay was immediately drawn from the bank account associated with my Visa card. I then had to change plans and asked about a cancellation--all about 2 months before arrival. I was told that a full refund would be made but that the Visa machine was broken. I was asked for all my bank account information, which I send, but no refund was ever made. I've written about 6 e-mails, and now I don't even get a reply.What's worse, I ended up being in Barcelona afterall and even went to the hotel. Even though they took my money, no room was reserved in my name and the hotel was full! They sent me to what I was told was a sister property, and I paid in full for my stay there. After my return, I wrote to both hotels, citing reservation and receipt numbers, and asked for someone to help with the refund. Only the sister hotel replied telling me that it is not in fact associated with the Amrey Diagonal! I wonder who ended up with my couple of hundred dollars.

<Content>Excellent choice This hotel is great, rooms are big and comfortable, bathroom is wonderful, everything is nice and clean, breackfast is delicious and you can choose from so many different thing that you can feel full till afternoon!!! The only thing to complaint is that is quite far from the metro station ( at least 10 minutes walking). Near the hotel there's a very big mall where ypu can enjoy restaurants, cinemas, great shops ecc..

<Content>Fantastic stay! Just got back from a 4 day break. Had a fantastic trip at the Amrey Diagonal. On arrival me and my boyfriend were given a map and a tourist guide. Our room was very spacious. Cleaners came in everyday to tidy and issue us with clean towels. Hotel is in a nice area, in the business district. There are some tapas restaurants around but had to go into city centre or near the beach for nicer resturants. Great shopping centre. 'Glories' opposite which had a lot of shops including hm, zara etc. Whilst there we used the metro to get around, a 3 day pass cost 15 euros. You could also use this pass on the bus and tram. Metro stop 'Glories' is about a 5-10 minute walk from hotel but only 4 stops from Catalunya which is the main stop for Las Ramblas. Only negative point we had was the hotel restaurant which didnt have much choice and wasn't exactly cheap. Overall a very pleasant stay and would definately go back.

<Content>An excellent pre cruise stop over. Absolutely faultless. Stayed for one night prior to a cruise. Clean, good size room which appeared to be newly decorated and furnished, polite and helpful staff. Didn't have breakfast as it was a bit expensive at 15 Euro. If travelling from the airport with luggage, DO NOT USE THE METRO. Take the train from the airport to Sants and then get a taxi. The hassle with luggage on the metro journey to Glories is NOT worth the cost savings. Taxi from hotel to port was 13 Euro but hail it on the street, don't book through the hotel. Was able to leave luggage at the hotel after checkout without charge. A supermarket is directly opposite the hotel and in a complex back towards Glories on the opposite side of the road is a Carrefour and many other shops and eateries. I really don't know why this hotel isn't 4 star. Excellent

<Content>Very good value! * Spent 3 nights over weekend in october for 鈧?100/night, which ist rather cheap for Barcelona* Nicely designed, modern place* Highly recommend a room on the upper floors - mine was on 11 with a nice view over Barcelona. The windows reach down to the floor, so in the pretty large room you have quiet a panorama* room itself fantastic - wooden (or pseudo-wooden) floor, lots of space, tastefully modern, large bathroom* Clean* Breakfast was a lot better than expected for 3***, missed nothing* Staff very helpful, English no problem* Location fine if you dont mind public transportation - 10 min walk to Metro (or take tram), 5 stations to middle of downtown (placa catalunya)* By the way: Lots of Restaurants and Tapas places on Ramblas Poblenou right by the hotel

<Content>Good Hotel Good 3* hotel.Room was more 4*. Breakfast fine.Easy enough to get to. Metro few minutes walk, Glories station by the girkin looking building. Bar area not up to much. Have your night cap elsewhere.Walk down the road beside hotel and it takes you through a much smaller ramblas, directly to the beach.Nice pleasant walk. Then turn right and walk the prom up to, Columbus statue, the bottom of the main Ramblas. Pleasant enough walk from hotel to Sagrada Familila Church,a must visit and then you can pick up the tourist bus without queuing much and pay on board. We was on a budget so ate at the fresco buffet.(one by the hotel) and dotted around. One at rambla de mar(sort of modern pier)10 euro all you can eat plus dessert and one drink.We picked up this hotel at a great price from xcapewithus.com. ONE WARNING. THIEVES ARE MANY AND ARE VERY VERY SKILLED. MY BAG WAS LIFTED ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT,THEY WORK IN TWOS AND ONE DISTRACTS YOU, WHILE HIS MATE TOOK MY LUGGAGE.POLICE STATION WAS FULL OF US TOURISTS.MONEY,CARDS AND PASSPORT AT LEAST IN A BODY BELT PLEASE.!!! Other than that Barcelona is lovely and i will go back without a doubt.

<Content>A Good Hotel - Average Location Stayed in the Amery Diagonal for two nights in September and found it to be a good, reasonably priced hotel.The room was clena and modern being a fairly new hotel. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice.On minor gripe was the lifts which seemed to take an age to arrive after being called.I wasnt so keen on the location being in a 'new' area of town, it felt a bit like we were staying on the edge of a shopping centre rather than in the centre of a lively city. - At least it meant we was quite a distance away from the Ramblas which reduced the possiblilty of having my wallet lifted when out for a walk in the evening. Be very careful in Barcelona as from speaking to others during our stay this is still a very big problem, as it has been for a number of years and still the police appear to be doing nothing about it.

<Content>Very Good Hotel! My partner and I have just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Amrey Diagonal and we were very very impressed!The rooms are big and immaculately clean with the added extra of having laminate flooring rather than carpet (I hate hotel rooms with carpet!). We didn't have breakfast included in our deal but you can buy it at the hotel but it costs 15 euro per person which is a rip off, there is loads of places you can grab brekkie either in the shopping centre down the road or when you head into the centre of Barcelona. The situation of the hotel is also great, it's not what you'd call 'central' but it was a 20min walk to the beach and it took us approximately 15mins to get from the hotel into the hub of things using the Metro.It's VERY easy and efficient getting to the hotel by bus and tube. You catch the blue airport bus outside of the airport which costs 4.05 euro per person, you then get off the bus at Plaza Catalunya which is the last stop. You then need to take the Metro (underground) the signs for this are a red diamond with an M in the middle, there are a few dotted around the Plaza. We bought a 10 ticket pass to use while all the time we were there which cost us 7.45 euro (there are other options). You then take the L1 (the red line) to Glories (which is the forth stop along). When you come out of the underground infront of you should be a massive bullet shaped building, walk pass this and carry on walking along the main road (Avinguada Diagonal), the hotel is approx 5 mins walk from the station on the right hand side (directly opposite is a yellow fronted Lidl), easy peasy!! We used this route both coming and going back to the airport and had no problemo!!

<Content>Great location clean hotel! Lovely hotel within 4 stops of the centre on the Metro and in a quiet area with some nice bars etc. Clean and spacious with a nice bathroom but the bath was a little small but we weren't there to soak in the bath... Stayed on the 9th floor and the view was nice and I'm sure this is more than a 3* hotel but I'm not sure why it's not a 4*. Didn't eat there but it looked lovely.

<Content>Loved our stay This is a modern and nice hotel and we loved our stay. If you don't mind staying a little bit away from the madding crowd - this is the place for you. At walking distance you have the Rambla del Poblenou, where you can find lots of tapas bars, a few bakeries and grocery stores. If you continue down the Rambla, you'll reach the beach - so take your swim suit if you are going in the summer time!. You can walk all the waterfront till you reach the old city. We also walked from the hotel to La Sagrada Familia. However, if you are not fond of walking much, you can take the subway at Glories, or even better, the bus - number 7 stops right across the hotel and will take you to Pg. de Gracia, the 5th avenue of Barcelona. Bus 7 also runs a nightly service, we took the bus back to the hotel after dinner at 11pm. And very close, in front of the Glories shopping center, you can take 92 (if memory doesn't fail me) to Park Guell; the drop off is just at the gate of the park, which is far closer than you'll get if you go by subway. The hotel is pretty new, clean, it has working AC, nice bathrooms, and is well sound proofed. We got two twin beds next to each other- not sure if they have full-size beds, but that did not affect our stay at all. We didn't get the breakfast option, so we can't comment on the restaurant, but it looked good from the outside.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - Great Value My friends and I have just returned from Barcelona having watched England play in a World Cup game against Andorra. We choose this hotel having read previous reviews and we were not dissapointed. The hotel was excellent. The rooms were very modern and spacious and the bathroom was spotless. The breakfast was excellent and was included in the price of the rooms we booked. The choice was superb and you could have whatever you wanted. Location wise it was a 10 minute walk fron the nearest tube station - Glories - and there were plenty of eating areas near to the hotel. It was easy to get around the city by tube tram or bus. Barcelona is an excellent safe city with plenty to do. We really enjoyed our weekend having stayed on Saturday and Sunday nights. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to to anybody who want to enjoy the comforts of a modern hotel. If you go to Barcelona you must stay here. you will not be dissapointed. Go on giver yourself a treat you wonlt regret it.

<Content>Loved our stay in Amrey We stayed in Amrey as a pre-cruise to the Mediterranean. We loved the hotel. It was spotless, very modern, and has a great view. Breakfast was excellent with hot foods served. The Glories metro is about ten minute walk. You can also take the tram. It is also only ten to fifteen minute walk to the beach. One thing we learned is that in Barcelona, you should not call for a taxi. It is cheaper to flag one down. We asked the hotel to call for a taxi to take us to the cruise terminal. The taxi took awhile, when he came, there was already $6 euro on the meter. We also found out that there is a surcharge on weekends. A typical $12 euro cab ride end up costing us $25 euro.Overall, loved te Amrey Diagonal and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Great Hotel We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and the experience was simply superb. It is a very modern, comfy and clean business / leisure hotel. The staffs were friendly and helpful, spoke fluent English.Although it is not situated in Las Ramblas area, we found that is not a problem at all. This hotel is just 3 mins walk from Pere IV Tram Station, 10 mins walk from Glories Metro station, in which we can reach the city centre in 15 mins.I would certainly recomend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great stay in Barcelona Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Amrey Diagonal during 4th of july weekend and found it as a great hotel and location, would defenitely recomend it just make sure you got all your directions before you head it over barcelona as a first time and you don't speak spanish or catalan, if you are ridding local transportation you should take bus a-1 from the airpot to catalunya plaza and then the metro @ catalunya to glories station... it will be a 8 min walk before you find the hotel, great location, great staff, great barcelona!!!!!!

<Content>A great option if you dont mind a 10 min train ride! Stayed here for 4 nights in June 2008. Reason why we chose this hotel was because this was the best value option going at the time and it certainly lived up to that! Hotel was spacious, clean and very modern - the sort of place thats designed for business travellers but appeals to everyone. Staff were polite, plenty of amenities, the only drawback for some would be the distance out from the main sights of Barcelona. Its a 10 minute metro ride into the city centre (and a 5-10 min walk to the station) but the metro is fairly cheap and efficient, so wasnt a problem. For nights out, a taxi from La Ramblas to the hotel around 2am not only took around 10 minutes, but was less than 10 Euros! The area around the hotel was fine. There is a large shopping centre almost opposite the hotel, which although generic, does have a few eating places and a large supermarket to stock up on daily needs. More interesting is the avenue beside the hotel, that leads directly to the beach (10-15 min walk) and has plenty of resturants along the way. Overall, I can pretty much guarantee you will not find a better option closer to the centre without paying a lot more money!

<Content>Great Hotel, good location! The Amrey is far above a 3* Hotel! I would guess its' the best 3* value for money in Barcelona! The rooms are very nice and have great views. Breakfast is cheap (8 euros) and good. Staff is very helpfull and the location is excelent! Just on the Diagonal, 3 min from the Metro Station Glorias and 2 minutes from a huge shopping center! Just great :-)

<Content>Great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in June. It was an excellent choice. The hotel is ultra-clean, ultra-modern and very conveniently located. It is not right in the centre of town but is a 10 minute subway ride away. The train station is a 10 minute walk from the hotel, and there is a shopping centre across the street which has many food options.The rooms are immaculate - laminate flooring and large bathrooms. Large bed and good air conditioning. All in all an excellent value for the money.I would recomment this hotel to anyone.

<Content>If this location works for you, I highly recommend this hotel We had been told all the hotels in Barcelona were booked, and were considering postponing going there. After seeing reviews on this site, we booked for a weekend and were very pleased.Many who visit Barcelona would want to stay right in the heart of everything, so this hotel would not be for them. But it isn't far, and the transit system in Barcelona is excellent. We even walked from the hotel to La Sagrada Familia. Very modern rooms. LOVED that it had a second door (between the foyer/bathroom and the rest of the room. Much quieter that way. I wish all hotels had that.We paid about 120 euros.Great food. Great staff. Would return.

<Content>top value and location nice modern hotel, great stroll to the beach too. lots of good places to eat and drink nearby, a bit suburban for young singles maybe but very comfortable and convenient for those with young children.big supermarkets and shopping malls down the main avenue, and the trams and buses are right in front of the hotel, so very convenient for getting into the city.

<Content>Great hotel, but lower floors are noisy Very modern hotel, with a fancy bathroom and spotless clean rooms. The beds are comfy and when needed you get an extra pillow (but not during the evening) We occupied a room on the second floor, right on the Av. Diagonal, This street is one of the main roads through Barcelona. The traffic can be very loud. The walls between the rooms are thin, so when your neighbours are having a good time you can hear it in detail. Breakfast is okay, but a decent cup of coffee has to be paid for, the coffee from the coffee machine is absolutely not drinkable.

<Content>Great hotel for an amazing weekend! I booked this hotel due to the other good comments on this site and i was pleased that I did. The hotel was clean and the room was very spacious (we had a corner room). We had a very late check in which was fine, no problems.True this hotel is not near las ramblas where all the excitement is but the rambla beside the hotel was fabulous, less expensive and more authentic. The metro was not far away and the system is really easy to use. 鈧?0 for 2 day metro pass. From Glories, you are in the centre in less than 10 minutes...They pump mint smells into the bathroom which was really lovely and when i got home, all my (dirty) clothes smelled really fresh and minty! A bit weird but nice effect....My only complaint and the reason I did not give 5 stars is that the bar was never open when we got back from a long day...so we had to go out again... otherwise everything was perfect. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Good value for money Very nice hotel with inexpensive prices. Location was good, the tram stops right front of the hotel and the metro station is within a walking distance. I loved the small shopping centre 5 minutes walk from the hotel!! The room was good and clean, the windows were huge so the room felt very spacious. We stayed at the top floor and the view was nicest. Breakfast buffee had a good selection of fruits, juices, breads, vegetables, sweets, and things to put on breads. There also was a coffee machine and you could get hot chocolate from it, mmm!I definately recommend this hotel!

<Content>Buyer beware - must pay up front or lose your reservation and get tossed out We had a terrible experience with this hotel during a busy week due to the Mobile World Congress. We r(party of three) reserved two rooms and paid for two nights with a reservation for two additional nights to be paid on Monday. They sold our room at a higher price to someone else for the days we did not pay in advance even though we had a reservation and made a commitment to pay on Monday when the banks opened (we had to exchange money). We were forced to look for other accomodations when hotels were sold out. With our complaints they found us one night at exorbitant fees. It was incredibly stressful and affected my business in Barcelona. I will never stay at any Amrey hotel due to their poor customer service.

<Content>Nice hotel This was the third time I'd stayed at the Amrey Diagonal, and each time I've found it a good, comfortable, well-situated hotel. True, it isn't very central and the nearest metro (Glories) is maybe 10-20 minutes' walk away (depending on how fast you walk!), but there's an excellent tram service - the Pere IV tram stop is almost on the doorstep of the hotel - which takes you to Marina or Ciutadella/Vila Olimpica, where you can easily change to the Metro. The hotel itself is clean and well-run, the staff are very helpful and the breakfast is good, although maybe a bit overpriced - if you want to save money, nip across to the Glories shopping centre on the other side of the Diagonal and get breakfast in one of the cafes there. The Torre Agbar (known to locals as El Suppositorio, according to my friend who lives in Barcelona!) is nearby and looks amazing when it's all lit up at night. Highly recommended.

<Content>A Little Far We stayed here for three nights during our stay in Barcelona and found it a little far from all the attractions in the city. Even the closest metro was a little inconvenient鈥攊t was a good 20 minute walk. The hotel itself was great for the price, but would advise trying to find something closer if you are looking for a hotel in Barcelona.

<Content>good hotel - interesting area Clean and well staffed, 70 euros a night for a good room (501)and well stocked spacious bathroom. TV very limited for English speakers though.The best part is its location right on the corner of Las Ramblas Poble Nou, a rambla far removed in tone from the tacky, pricey city centre affair. This one is used by residents and the bars, shops and restaurants reflect this in their better quality provisions.

<Content>Very high standard. Recommended. This hotel is brilliant value for money. The location is not in the centre, but don't let this put you off too much. It is very easy to catch the Metro from up the road. The tram also passed directly in front of the hotel, and I guess that it goes into the centre. The area around the hotel is in the midst of a building frenzy. Consequently there is a degree of noise during the day but this does stop by night. This should not put you off but initially I was a bit concerned. There is a very nice shopping centre very close by which included a Lidl and a Carrefore shopping centre. Our room was excellent and offered a fantastic view as we were on the 11th floor. The staff are very proffessional and helpfull. Overall the hotel is very good value for money and I recommend it.

<Content>Nice hotel to enjoy Barcelona We booked this hotel through Otel.com and paid 258$ (US) total for Friday and Sat. night. We got to the hotel at 11 am and room 711 was ready for us. We noted a clean and large room with a nice bathroom and great shower! The hotel provides the usual tolietries but no conditioner, so bring some with! The directions previously recommended through this website helped us find the hotel perfectly (thanks bcc399)! We took the red line towards Fondo and exited via the Merdidian without any difficulty. The area felt safe and had several business men and women walking around during the noon hour, as well as many families. We walked a ton our first day of sightseeing and many sights are walkable from the hotel if you enjoy exploring by foot! Our legs felt it at the end of the day, but we saw so much of the city and it's different areas. The Sagrada Familia is less than a 20 minute walk from the hotel. From there we walked down the Ramblas and saw Casa Milo. After that we walked to the beach and saw Port Olympic, in additional to fun stuff along the way!My favorite area in Barcelona to have dinner was near Santa Maria del Mar. It is lively and has a lot to offer there, and it's a much safer bet than eating on the Ramblas. My husband and I had drinks at Schilling Cafe (c/Ferran, 23) near Santa Maria del Mar. The cafe was the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine or perhaps a coffee in the afternoon. The red wine was excellent and only 2.40 a glass...I couldn't believe it when I got the bill!

<Content>Just as good as the last time ... This is our 2nd time to the Amrey and it was just like the 1st time. Good service, nice rooms, clean and friendly. We were on the 9th floor last time in one of the corner rooms (901). It was so spacious and huge. We were on the 10th floor this time, but didn't get the corner room 1001, the room was big enough for the 2 of us, extremely clean and a great view of the city. The corner rooms end with 01, if you manage to get one. Our only issue this time is that breakfast wasn't included in the price. It is a buffet breakfast, so eat as much as you like for 13 euros per person, make sure you pile your plate for the price. This hotel is slightly out the way of the hustle and bustle, with Glories Shopping Centre 5 mins away and the train which takes about 15 mins to the centre. As we prefer to walk to take in the sights, there is a number of ways to get to the centre, so have a good map and it should take you about half an hour. I would definately stay again in this hotel.

<Content>Liked, would return. Stayed at room 402 (view for the avenue).Excellent breakfast, very clean, new hotel, large room and also wc.No noise... air conditioned, tv cable.Best of all, a shopping and restaurants 2/3 minutes away, and the subway of GLORIES is 7 min away, and the surface train is at the front.Tips. take the turist bus for the 1st day, you will see the exact location of everything, get a book of discounts for museums and etc, and a excelent barcelona map... the subway is excellent for geting to all places ant it is cheaper.Dont forget the locks on the backpacks and avoid showing around the digital cameras on the subway and ramblas at night... i was adviced to do so and i had no problems.good trip and good stay. any doubts or pictures of the hotel and trip send me a email to ricardo.pocket@hotmail.com

<Content>Agree with all previous positive reviews We had a 5 night stay at the Amrey and we were delighted with the hotel. It lives uo to all the previous reviewers claims as being an excellent modern hotel.We too enjoyed being slightly away from the tourist trap in what could be regarded as the real Barcelona.We enjoyed evening meals at The Ming across the road (under 10 Euros pp incl drink), and also the Fresco Salad bar on the Av. Diagonal (also under 10 Euros pp incl drink).Had a poor meal at La Brogette in Rambla Problenau (bill 45 Euros for 2).We had many warnings about 'Robos' in tourist areas, and on the public transport systems. On 2 occasions we feel we could have had our pockets picked had we not been warned and been alert.Nevertheless, we had a lovely holiday and hope to return to Barcelona in the future.

<Content>hey this is a good place! just returned from a four night stay at the amrey which i booked with help from reviews from trip advisor - positives - the hotel is clean, maid service daily with towels changed and toiletries replenished well appointed with regard to room size, helpful staff at reception, didn't encounter any problems with noise levelsif you are taking the breakfast , which I recommend there is plenty of fresh fruit, crusty bread, croissants, cooked food such as bacon, scrambled egg etc, can't comment on evening meals as we did not partakeon arrival (late) we were given a smoking room which we did not want, but they changed this for us the following morning.regarding transportation links, we used both the metro and tram links but even walked places to the sagrada familiar for instance and down to the beach. I liked the fact that it reflected a better sense of barcelona than i would imagine would be gained by the tourist traps in the centre. Opposite as been said is a lidl and you can pick up bottled water and also use the glories shopping centre (a big carrefour supermarket). All in all we enjoyed and this was my second trip to barcelona, ps buy a T10 transport card, it's very easy just punch in at the metro station and you will have it, the machine usually gives change, read up on it and you will suss it out.

<Content>Great but Not for Everyone My wife and I had a wonderful 8 night stay at the Hotel Amrey Diagonal. This was our second trip to Barcelona, which we feel is a city that has it all! The hotel is located in a rapidly gentrifying area in the shadow on the Torre Agbar, one of Barcelona new premier buildings (which, unfortunatley, one can not tour). While other equivalent hotels near the center of town were charging around $250, we paid $ 140 a night (weekends were higher and weekdays lower. So this is a blended rate). We booked the hotel through the web site, Venere, which does not require a prepayment--so you can see what you get before you have to pay.The Ambrey Diagonal is four metro stops from Placa Cataluyna. It also is serviced by the No. 7 Bus( which takes you to the center of town as well as where one gets the train to the ariport) and the No.4 tram ( which takes you near the very interesting water front. ) None of these rides is longer than 20 minutes.The rooms are rather large by European standards, well appointed, and modern. The hotel was build in 2002. The 01 and 10 banks are slightly larger than the other rooms. If one is above the 8th floor, there is a nice view of the foot hills of Barcelona and the Foster communications tower.One of the very nice aspects of the hotel's location is the the Rambla Poblenou,the street immediately to the left of the hotel as you exist the hotel. You get a interesting sense of a real neighborhood here--unlike the hordes of tourist on the Rambla in town. Here one actually hears Cataluyan spoken rather than English, German or French! There also are several servicable restaurants on this street. We like Xorus where we ate several evenings.Another advantage of the locations is that it is within 15 minutes walk to a wonderful beach at the bottom of the Rambla Poblenou. There is a great walk from the beach toward town--which will take about 3/4 of an hour all along the sea front. The hotel also is very close to the Musical Museum--a new museum housed next to the National Theatre and well worth seeing. Near the Glories metro stop, there also is one of barcelona's largest flea market--which is open several days a week.The staff at the Amrey Diagonal were friendly, reasonably proficient in English, willing to be helpful in giving directions as well as being willing to call restaurants to reserve dinner reservations.The one down side is that if you plan to spend a lot of time around the center of town, going back and forth more than once a day can be a bit trying. However, given all the other benefits of the area and the price, we felt the trade off was worth it.

<Content>well worth it Can't fault this Hotel for value for money. Stayed here for four nights and had a very spacious room on the 11th floor. Room was spotless and facilities very good. No noise heard from other rooms and a great view over Barcelona city. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we prefered to eat at the small cafes either on the Rambla Poblenou or in the Glories shopping centre which were all very cheap. If you are familiar with Barcelona then it is worth staying at this hotel as the transport system near the hotel is excellent and inexpensive and it is nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. We felt very safe in the area and enjoyed a couple of good meals at two of the restaurants on the Rambla Pobleno which has a good atmosphere.

<Content>Amrey Diagonal - less than expected Upscale hostel, Noisy, No services, Good breakfast, Staff not assistive. Instead of turistic map (with turistic objectives) you will get a map with pubs. My wake-up call request was ignored by staff.

<Content>Modern. Pleasant. Agreeable. Having stayed in the centre of town for a couple of days we found ourselves looking for somewhere else to extend our stay in Barcelona. A trip to the extremely busy Tourista Information at Placa Catalunya resulted in the nice woman there booking us a room at the Hotel Amrey Diagonal - she assured us it was 'verr modern'. Well, we got on the metro with fear in our hearts (or at least I did) that we were going to end up in some horrible monstrosity designed to extract money from our wallets with no convenience in return. We/I couldn't have been more wrong (wronger?). The area around the hotel Amrey is, as some other reviewers have fairly put, partly under construction. It's a developing area. That also makes it quite calm compared to the rampant business of Barca old town. The walk from Glories metro station is really not too far and you'd have to have to be mobility impaired or be carrying a serious amount of luggage for it to matter. 10 minutes at a slow pace. There is also a big shopping centre close by so you can buy many necessary items. The hotel itself is in the modern style, 10 floors I believe. The service is pleasant and the staff are helpful (very helpful to me as I left my wallet there and they helped arrange to fly it back to the UK!). Each floor has a single long corridor with 'muzak' playing but the volume is not intrusive and you can't hear it when in the room. The rooms themselves are minimalist, have wooden floors and furniture. The en-suite is perfectly functional without being overly opulent. As to the 'sound-proofing' that the hotel boasts of, we didn't have any problems with noise when we were there but I'm not sure there was anyone else on our floor so it wasn't as if we tested that claim out! All in all a perfectly pleasant hotel (indeed we extended our stay by an extra two days) and one for which I wouldn't hesitate to return.

<Content>Very nice hotel My wife and I just returned from a 7 day vacation in Barcelona, having stayed at the Amrey Diagonal for the duration. We picked the hotel based upon the reviews on this site.The hotel is very nice and clean, rooms are large and with air conditioning and an electronic safe, beds are comfortable, toilet is very nice (with tub and a hairdryer). The staff was very helpful and friendly (and english speaking) -- they helped us out in terms of getting around and picking transportation. The hotel is located very close to metro (Glori茅s station), tram and busses and only 15 minutes walking distance from the beach via Rambla Del Poblenou (on which the hotel is located) and the Glori茅s shopping centre.If I had to nitpick, it would have been nice with a swimming pool on the hotel premises ...All in all, we enjoyed our stay there a great deal and would go there again, if we could find a similar good deal on the price.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised When I first booked the Amrey Diagonal I was skeptical that the low price meant a sub-par hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised when I checked in. It's a nicely furnished business hotel with modern decor and comfortable rooms. Everything was clean and worked. Upon check-in I was first assigned to a smoking room which smelled horrible, but I was quickly transferred to a non-smoking room which was much better. A note about getting to the hotel the first time via public transit: if coming by Metro, get off at the Glories station and leave via the Meridian Av exit. (If you leave by the wrong exit, you might find yourself in a derelict, walled-in public square). Look for the tall torpedo-shaped Torre Agbar, then follow Diagonal Av just to the left of it and walk about 300m (or take Tram #2 if you're too lazy to walk). That stretch of Diagonal is a new business district complete with a shopping mall (e.g. Disney store!) and movie complex. Finally, do not confuse this hotel with the other (more expensive) Diagonal hotel that's right next to the Torre Agbar. PS If you take Tram #2 from the hotel south all the way to the last stop, you'll end up near the relaxing Marina/Beach of Barcelona.

<Content>Too far from the action This hotel is nice and new however it is just too far from the action.Good: Rooms are large, modern and comfortableBad: Location. I had some of the worst food of my life at a tapas bar around the corner from the hotel. The food at the hotel is over priced.This hotel is in a residential area. If you want to be part of the fast-paced atmosphere of Barcelona, stay near Las Ramblas.

<Content>Great hotel!!! My boyfriend and i decided to head to Barcelona for a mid week break and cannot rate the Amrey highly enough. Yes, location may be a problem for some if you are only staying one or two nights but for us it was perfect. Plus the price means that you probably get a higher standard for less money because you aren't right in the centre. The metro really is only a five to ten minute walk away (i even made it with extremely sore feet from the high heels so that will tell you how close it is!!) and it is three stops to Placa de Catalunya. In fact i'm sure that you could walk along the seafront into town and it wouldn't take very long. We didn't as it was very hot and because of that, it was wonderful to be by the sea. The hotel is located about a 15min walk from the beach which takes you through a local area and when we were there, there was even a market. It is an excellent beach. Most city beaches are horrible but this beach is definitely worth a visit. Its well patrolled so kids will be safe, the water is clean (albeit very cold!!) and there are bars so you can have a beer once the sun goes down. The rooms of the hotel are very spacious and are very well equipped. We had our room cleaned everyday and fresh towels everyday too. Piece of advice though, go and buy a huge bottle of water and stick it in the fridge in your room as the hotel sells small bottles for 2euro 40 or thereabouts. We bought a massive bottle for less than that. One final piece of advice - if coming from the airport, don't bother with a cab as the bus is very easy. As you get off the airbus don't cross over but simply, with the fountains behind you, turn left and walk up the road (Passeig de Gracia). Keep going straight on til you come to the single fountain on your right (a massive Zara is there for you girls to pop into!!). Cross over the road - staying on the same side as you were and you'll see the bus stop in front of you - its the No 7. Ask for Torre Agbar - its a huge building - funny shape (trust me you won't miss it!) and get off the bus not at the stop immediately after the Torre Agbar but the one after that. The hotel is on that side of the road on your right. If you want to metro it, its not too bad (i had a strapping bloke to carry my cases up and down the steps) and there are lifts. Get on the red line at Placa de Cataluyna - line 1 towards Fondo and get off at Glories. Buy a T10 ticket. It costs 3euro 90 and allows you 10 journeys on the metro/bus. A single costs 1euro 25 so its well worth it. When you get off the metro you'll see the big shopping centre. Walk down the road with the shopping centre on your left. You'll see the hotel on the right hand side after 10 mins or so. I love this city and this hotel. Already thinking of a New Year trip or another break next year. Enjoy - we certainly did!!

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Amrey Diagonal for 4 nights with friends for my 21st birthday. The hotel is extremely clean, modern and stylish, and despite complaints from other reviews about the distance of the hotel from the city centre, Glories metro station is only 10 minutes walk from the hotel, with the train another 10 into Placa De Catalunya. In any case, taxis are cheap and easy to get hold of. Rooms very good value, and I was mildly surprised that this hotel is only rated 3*. Breakfast was good, staff helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Had a great time!

<Content>Amrey Diagonal-Spot On Hotel My wife and I stayed in the Amrey Diagonal from 01 May to 04 May. The hotel is about 5 minutes from the Glories station on the L1 underground line which is 5 minutes from the Placa Catalunya, so its far enough away from the noise of the city centre. The hotel is bright, modern, and the staff were very good, wishing us the compliments of the day etc. Our room was on the ninth floor with a very comfy large bed, more than enough storage space, and a lovely bathroom, which had all the toiletries replenished each day. As a previous poster said the hotel is in a residential area with the Glories shopping centre across the road, which my wife thought was great, turn left out of the hotel and there is a paseo down to the Poble Nou beach area. It was nice to stroll along with the locals in the evening, and there are quite a few lovely bars and restaurants along the way as well. We would stay in the Amrey Diagonal again without hesitation, and we would recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>A Little too far out of town? We stayed here for 3 nights in early May. As stated by other travellers, the hotel is very modern  exceptionally clean.We had breakfast which was very good I thought, lots of choice, friut,cheese,ham,yoghurt,bread,pastries etc. though if you like 'english' breakfast then the bacon  sausages are not the same! Though my husband tells me the scrambled eggs were very good. This was included in the price @ 拢80 per night for double room. The staff were very professional  helpful but not particularly friendly in my experience. I think for a popular city like Barca this hotel is excellent value for money, a similar standard hotel in town at this time of year, would have cost us 拢160 per night. This is my third trip to Barcelona, (so I like the city!) previously I have stayed more centrally  probably would do so next time. We found it such a trail back to the hotel that we just stayed out in town all day eventually returning by taxi (very reasonable 6 - 8 euros for 4) about 2am.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This is a fantastic hotel to stay at. It was in a very nice and safe area. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. Its located near a main walkway were there are shops, cafes, and bars. Not to far from the beach, about 10 minute walk. The metro is also near by and it will take you to many places, including downtown where lots of attractions are. The hotel staff is also very nice and helpful. They did have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but i would suggest to go to a local place for that if you want to save some money. There are also atms located near the hotel in case you want to get money out. Overall, the hotel is clean, neat, and in the right location. It was also priced at a good rate. email me at anthonyrubio@msn.com if you want more details or have questions in general.

<Content>great place, great area just back from 3 nights at the amrey Diagonal. Perfect Choice: modern, very functional, quiet, very clean, very safe, good breakfasts, teriffic views from top floor (11th), easy access to tram, bus and metro. Everything works! Lidl shop across from the hotel sells you cheap food and booze.Good little restaurants and bars on the Rambla del Poblenou next to the hotel. Stroll down this palm tree lined avenue to the med. sea and sample the family orientated atmosphere - few tourists here! Restaurant Cafe Bar Poblenou impressed with quality, quantity and friendliness! Would stay at the amrey Diagonal anytime again! Superb!!

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Amrey We have just returned from 4 nights stay in the Amrey Diagonal. The hotel certainly lived up to our expectations. We found the reviews of other positive contributors to be accurate. The hotel is modern and minimalistic. If you want chandeliers, armchairs, sofas and libraries, then the amrey is not for you. We enjoyed coming back each evening to a very clean and comfortable room. Our bed linen was changed twice in the 4 nights and we had clean towels provided daily. Our room was on the 10th floor and although overlooking the Avinguda Diagonal, noise was not a problem and we always had an excellent nights sleep. The breakfast was a great foundation for a long days sightseeing!We purchased a two day Bus Turistic pass (23 Euros each). This was an absolute life saver to aching, tired feet! It is a great way to see the city and I would recommend it.We used the train and metro from Barcelona airport to get to the hotel however we would not use this method again as we found it difficult hauling luggage up and down stairs in the metro and also negoiating the train changes.We used the air coach on the return journey to the airport and found it much easier. The following information may be helpful to you if you wish to choose this form of transport:You will find the air coach waiting just outside the airport terminal (cost is 3 euros 90). This will take you directly into the city centre to PL Catalunya. From the city centre you walk up the Passeig de Gracia, crossing two roads. When you see the single fountain you will know you are almost there. Look out for a huge Zara shop on your right on the corner. Walk down the Gran via de les Cortes Catalanes (a short distance). You will have to cross the road to get to the bus stop (the bus will approach you from your left). It is a NO. 7 bus. Your journey will take approx 15/20 mins. A good landmark to look out for as you approach the hotel is the Torre Agbar (a skyscraper circular glass building) on your right hand side. Don't get off the bus at the stop just past this, but wait until the next one which is just 10 yards from the Amrey. The bus fare is 1 euro 25 each.We purchased a T10 ticket at the airport. This is the most economical way to use the buses. These tickets can also be purchased at metro stations.We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Barcelona and would recommend the Amrey Diagonal to anyone. We felt the location of the hotel to be excellent in that you could enjoy a nice walk down Rambla Pou to the Bogatell Beach (for us it was a nice 30 minute stroll) and you were also beside the bus stop to hop on the bus to see the city sites.I hope my ramblings will be of some help to someone!!

<Content>Absolutely wonderful I have just come back from my 7 day holiday in barcelona, and i have nothing bad to say. The hotel was amazing, the rooms were spotless and spacious. We had an initial problem as the hotel had given us a room with twin beds, which we didnt ask for. It was sorted with seconds and we got another room.The area surrounding the hotel is fantastic. Dont be put off by the distance away from the main tourist attractions, because Spain has a very effective transport system, which can take you anywhere. The Bogatell beach is 15 mins away, and the hotel is situated between 2 big shopping centres. The first is the Glories hotel and the other on the route of the tram, just 5 short stops away from the Glories hotel. Also, there is a food shop just opposite the hotel, which is relatively cheap.The breakfast was really nice, with a lot of choices. Such as sausages, eggs and hot bacon. Cereal, fresh fruits, and pastries. The staff are really helpful as well, and can speak English. Something which was really important to us.Conclusion if you havent guessed? The hotel was part and parcel of a beautiful holiday. This review is not an exaggeration. My boyfriend is very hard to be pleased, but he was relatively surprised with the quality of the hotel.

<Content>Loved it We stayed at Amrey Diagonal 4 nights in the end of February and we loved it.Beautiful hotel,nice and clean rooms nice comfortable beds,extremelly clean bathroom,nice place all over.Staff was helpfull with directions easy access to city center by the metro or bus,nice area close to Glories shopping centre and across from Lidl Supermarket.If you want to have a nice fullfilling meal at a very good price go to a restaurant in the first corner on the left serving bufet meals till late and eat as much as you like for 8.30 euros at lunch or 9.90 dinner,excellent food.

<Content>Great and clean hotel Stayed at Amrey for 3 night in a shared twin room for only 拢130(the room). Big enough for both of us. Could see the ocean from our window.Very clean, nice bathrom. Very nice buffet for breakfast.Very good location, 10 mn walk from Glories station(a bit far after a day walking around the city center...lol). Tram just opposite as well as a small shopping center with shop such as Zara, Massimo Dutti,Stadivarius......Front staff not really welcoming ......no greeting whatsoever....no eyes contact........a bit desappointed about it.Catering staff looks bored and behaving like robot except 1 or 2 very friendly one.Just need to give some training to the staff, Nevertheless I had a great stay.

<Content>A Gem compared to La Ramblas quality We stayed for 5 nights over Xmas 2006 and loved every moment! We had a real good deal thru ratestogo.com and booked for 拢42/per room per night, including buffet breakfast. Fantastic buffet breakfast spread with variety and HOT CHOCOLATE. Excellent Reception  Concierge service! The Staff was always friendly, fluent in English, giving good tips for getting around from hotel. Clear communication with billing. No feeling of being scammed at all.There's a Carrefour supermarket at the Glories Shopping 5 min away and the Pub Canas Y Tapas served excellent food. They have an english menu. Atmosphere very friendly as compared to La Ramblas, where they seem to pounce on tourists.Housekeeping replenished very nice quality toiletries. Room and bathroom was spanking new, spacious and clean. We could even see Sagrada Familia from our room, we were given 11th floor room w/o asking! We took the Metro to Glories. Be sure to use the Sabajoz exit, as the other exits are quite disorienting. The hotel is abt 15min away down the Diagonal street on the Right. Everything about the hotel is as 'what u see' on websites! No nasty surprises!As in all the Barcelona hotels, no tea/coffee making facility in-room. So, we brought a hot water flask  they allowed us to fill it b/w 1300-2200. Very nice! Overall we felt very safe and happy. Definitely a 4* experience!

<Content>New, clean, friendly, very good value for money I will keep this review brief, think of it more as an update that confirms the Amrey's good reputation.We went to Barcelona for a 3-day-trip. The hotel room was clean and had an excellent view (10th floor - you could see the Sagrada F. from the room and the Torre Agbar when standing in front of the elevator), nice sanitary equipment and a bathtub. The style is of course not the warm, cozy style of a grand hotel, but more the reduced style of a business hotel; but it is nevertheless suitable for couples who want to spend some romantic nights in Barcelona. Personally I prefer new and clean looking hotels - I've had too many nights in overpriced and shabby old Grand Hotels.Hotel staff was friendly, very helpful and their English is very good - definitely not the rule in Spain. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot say anything about it. Surrounding the hotel, there are lots of opportunities to snack and have a good coffee in the morning, if you want to get up early and get going. Some complain that the hotel is too far away from the city centre - I think 4 stations by metro to the Central Place de Catalunya is absolutely manageable. We would definitely stay there again. After all, prices are very reasonable. We paid 65 Euros for a double bed room (monday-friday price, weekends seem to be more expensive.)

<Content>Really nice, would stay again any time Modern, clean hotel, very helpful staff. Good location if you are a bit more independent and don't mind being away from the main tourist drag. Amazing views - i was on the 11th Floor (top) and wow!!! Local neighbourhood is interesting and absolutely not threatening as other reviewers have implied. It is very safe and within 5 mins walk, there is a huge shopping mall. It is opposite a LIDL grocery store and on the Rambla Poble Nou which is a sweet little street running down to the sea with masses of shops and a real buzz.I've stayed in a lot of Spanish hotels and this is much better than the norm.It is on a tramline and not far from the underground although to be honest I walked everywhere. If you are a tourist who prefers to be on the sea or right next door to the city centre/places to see this is probably not for you. However, if you want a good priced hotel with good service, want to go a bit more native, be in an interesting location and wish to be away from the thronging masses or simply want a nice quality business hotel then stay here!!!

<Content>wicked hotel we have just got back from a 4 night stay at the amrey. flying with easyjet to barca was a breeze from liverpool and a taxi costs 25e with supplements to the hotel, the staff all speak english and are fantastic. i dont know how this hotel can only be 3* when infact it should be a 4 at least as the rooms and hotel are immacualte, there are no tea making facilities in the rooms but take a small kettle and theres shops everywhere. the cafe restaurant are good but if u are like me a vegertarian food in barca is hard unless you hunt out places to eat. rambla poble nau is right outside your hotel which is REAL barca and not touristy whatsoever and this leads to the beach which is gorgoues. 10 mins walk to the glories tube takes you into the city and you wont be dissapointed. overall a top hotel and worthy of anyones visit to this gorgeous city!

<Content>Good Hotel - Interesting Location My third visit to Barcelona and my third different hotel. Decided to stay somewhere near the beach as I was only there to relax having done all the touristy stuff before.Hotel was a short walk from Glories subway (about 10 mins)Very nice room....good air con...very clean, nice bathroom. No frills but absolutely nothing wrong with it.I didn't go for the breakfast as I decided to go local. Exactly opposite is a Lidl store for water and snacks etc. Glories shopping mall is about five minute walk to the left if you fancy a Starbucks or some dept store shopping.Getting to the beach is easy,,,walk for about 20 mins down Poble nou....(on the corner of which, the hotel sits) lovely street, mercifully short on tourists. Plenty of food shops, cafe's etc. Then you find yourself at the beach near to the Olympic village.In the evening, the Ramblas is either 8euros in a taxi, or 5 stops on the subway from Glories.(subway is actually quicker)I really liked this area of the city but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if it is your first visit to Barcelona. It's ideal if you have done the sightseeing and want to see a bit of the real city.The hotel is good if you can get it for a good price (for me it was 80 euro per night), it seemed to be in a totally safe area, very clean, but I used it only as a room, so can't comment on restaurant or bar etc.

<Content>Below average 3 star hotel We stayed 3 nights in September 2006 for around 80 euro per night and we were disapointed with the hotel facilities. There were no coffee or tea making facilities in the room or room service and so you had to go down to the bar and purchase a below average cup of coffee at an inflated price. The breakfast was very poor for 10 euro per person with undrinkable coffee from a dispensing machine. On complaining we were offered coffee from the bar machine which turned out to be only warm and we were charged extra.My wife complained that there was no mirror at the dressing table to do hair etc..The staff were polite and hotel was clean and modern. The hotel was out of the town centre and so the saving grace was the tram that passed by the front door and took you to the metro. You buy a 10 ticket card for 6 euro which you can use on the tram, metro and buses making it an excellent integrated transport system.Down the side of the hotel is a tree lined pedestrian road with pavement cafes and shops taking you down to the sea. Towards the bottom of this road the area becomes a bit undesirable. There are no 'good' restaurants near to the hotel. However, Barcelona has a superb selection of excellent restaurants and tapas bars at realistic prices. Our favourites were the Noodle Bar near the Picasso museum on Carrer Princessa for lunch and Safra 18 on Carrer Ample (French influence) for the evening. The local tapas bar just up from the noodle bar on Calle Princessa was particularly good. For another really good lunch, try the fish bars in La Boqueria (fish, meat, fruit and veg market just off the Ramblas).

<Content>Very clean and great value for money Stayed here in June for 3 nights to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The hotel was very clean and all the staff were really helpful. Although not right in the centre it is a 10 minute walk to the nearest Metro and the tram runs outside the hotel too.The bedroom was large and had everything we needed.All in all excellent value for money and would recommend as a place to stay.

<Content>Excellent value! We stayed two nights in this hotel to sample the delights of Barcelona before driving into France. I was very impressed with the room which was both spotless and spacious. The bed was superb (king size) and the climate control kept my husband happy. The bathroom had a powerful shower over the bath and again was spotlessly clean.The breakfasts were great - there was a choice of fruits, cheeses, cold meats, cereals, various patisserie and breads etc.This hotel is perfect for those like us who were out all day and just needed a really nice room to sleep in. The transport links to central Barcelona are good. We sampled both buses and taxis although we had our hire car available. We left this in the hotel's garage for a small fee (which we had not been told about when we checked in). This would be my only complaint and it is a very minor one at that. The satff were extremely helpful and spoke English well.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent in many respects This hotel is not in the heart of touristy Barcelona, so some people might be put off by the location. That being said, I believe some people develop this romantic ideal about staying in a quaint, 900 year old hotel. They watch too many Hollywood movies. The reality is that quaint hotels that are actually nice and with good service are either scarce or very expensive, and even more so for cities like Barcelona and Paris. I am Mexican, and have been to Spain several times, as well as other countries, and I know what old and quaint means from a local perspective. What I mean by this is that if I am visiting places like Barcelona, after walking all day, I want to have a nice room to go back to at night, that has either a good furnace or AC, whichever is the case, that's clean and quiet, so I can get some rest from all the walking and partying. The Amrey Diagonal fits that bill, and at a wonderful price. Granted, it's outside of the old city center, but it's only five metro stops away from Plaza Catalunya, which you could take as the heart of Barcelona (the metro station is two blocks away from the hotel; the tram stops right in front of it, but I always walked to subway). I think that most poeple could also walk, which takes about 20 to 25 minutes. Everything worked, the room actually had a super climate system, all digital and out of sight that would keep the temperature stable (wichever temperature you set it to), unlike those in-room ones that are loud and get the room super cold so you need to turn it on and off all the time; I couldn't even hear the thing. I know this might seem meaningless when you are outside all day long, but it means a lot when you want to get some rest, specially in a Barcelona summer (By the way, I was going to post pictures, which I specifically took for Tripadvisor, but I haven't downloaded them yet (just got back last night)). The room was super clean and the bathroom was nice. I should also say that the quietness of the room was even more important since we arrived on June 23rd 2006. For any non-Hispanic Catholics, and non-Catholics in general, you must be asking what does that have to do with anything?. June 24th is St. Jonhn the Baptist day. In Hispanic countries, and specially in the Iberian Peninsula, on the night of June 23rd and early morning of the 24th, people celebrate by going into a river, or any body of water, troughout the night; in Barcelona that means the beach. They also throw lots and lots of firecrackers, pretty powerful ones, all night long, so you get the importance of having a quiet room when you need it.The hotel is located at the corner of Avenida (Avinguda in Catalan) Diagonal and Rambla de Poblenou. This is a great location for two reasons. First, Avenida Diagonal is a large boulevard that has a huge middle section where you can walk or jog in the mornigs or at night (like my wife and I like to do). Needless to say, this would be impossible in Old-town Barcelona. On the other hand, Rambla de Poblenou is a mini La Rambla, but for locals. You won't see any tourists along this pedestrian street, but plenty of little local restaurants, some good and some not so good, but you need to try them out; the prices are one third of those in La Rambla, and if you choose the right one, the food is better. If you walk ten minutes tops down Rambla de Poblenou, you end up at the beach. Just step out of the hotel, go left and walk straight and that's it. As a matter of fact, after dining near La Rambla and enjoying all the people in old town Barcelona, my wife and I, along with another couple, ended up going back to Rambla de Poblenou most other nights. That way, we ate a late dinner, had drinks and talked with locals, for a lot less money and within five minutes of our hotel.The only drawback might be, for some people at least, the location. I believe this is relative, and it depends on whether you make the best out of what you have or not. If riding the metro is not your thing, or if there is two or more poeple in your group, a taxi ride to downtown is around five or six euro, so it is reasonable to take one. Personally, I don't mind taking the subway. Like in any city with a subway though (including American ones), excercise common sense and watch your purse or wallet; don't give the pickpockets a chance, and you won't have any bad experiences to regret.In short, this hotel is great to go out all day long, explore Barcelona, and then go back and get a good night's sleep in a clean, simple yet functional room (the hotel as a whole is a minimalist's dream). Also, the buffet breakfast was pretty decent, with plenty of cold cuts (nice ones, like jam贸n ib茅rico), fruit, coffee, eggs, pastries, rolls, etc. for 11 euro. I am somewhat of a foodie, so I like to explore all local food, but if you want to have a full belly before you go out in the morning, it's a pretty safe bet. I believe that if you are willing to put your romantic ideas aside, your will find this hotel more than satisfying. Besides, if you take into account that this is Barcelona, and look at the hotel and the price (I got my room for a little under a hundred dollars), you will agree that this hotel is a steal and a pretty good choice. I would gladly reccomend it to anyone (for that price of course).

<Content>Comfortable, clean, quiet  A fair distance from the main attractions but only a 10 minute walk from the nearest Metro station and a 10 minute ride to the heart of the old town. Barcelona is a big city and a lot of the places of interest, especially the Gaudi buildings are not in the old town anyway so the location is not really a problem. The hotel is very modern and extremely clean. We used the hotel as a base for sightseeing and found the staff on the reception desk very helpful when asked how to get to places of interest. The rooms are comfotable and well appointed. The excellent breakfast buffet caters for most tastes. Recommended.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, okay location My husband and I loved this hotel. The lobby was nice, the staff extremely helpful and accommodating, and our modern and clean room absolutely gigantic. When I checked in there were no rooms with double beds (apparently there aren't many of them in the hotel), but by the time my husband joined me the next day I was switched to a different room. The ONLY downside to this place was the location, which wasn't even terrible. It's probably about a 2-mile walk to the Old City, or else a 10-minute walk to a quick subway ride. The beach is max. a mile away. There are plenty of restaurants that are very close, though none seemed fantastic. There is a large mall across the street with a Carrefours (the big European grocery store). If there were a place in the center of things that was just as nice and not more expensive, I'd definitely want to stay there; otherwise, this is a great option.

<Content>Modern, Clean and Quiet This is the perfect hotel if you like taking taxis or long walks. It is very modern and clean, and the rooms are quiet. However, it is not near most points of interest and the nearest Metro is a little hike for those who are not young or athletic. Unlike some other comments, we found the front desk personnel to be disinterested. If you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown and you like long walks or taking a cab to your destination, this hotel is a very good choice.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Just come back from staying in this hotel and cannot recommend it enough. Modern bright hotel with excellent/ friendly staff and a wonderful breakfast. The breakfast catered for all tastes, but the fresh orange juice and the fruit platters were wonderful. Our room was large wtih all toiletries provided, it faced on to the street but we heard no traffic noise. This hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona and yet it is so easy to get into town, bus stop just across the road and the metro station at the top of the road. The rambla Poblenou is alongside the hotel and takes you straight on to the beach. It has shops and bars/restaurants and is very pleasant to stroll along in the evening, we felt very safe there. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Amery! Barcelona04/2006The hotel was very nice. A short walk (10-15 minutes) to the beach. The meals were good. We had eaten breakfast and dinner there 3 nights. The hotel is located in the business district, there are several cafe's with outdoor seating closer to the beach. The rooms were very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. It was by far the nicest hotel that we had stayed at on our trip through Spain.

<Content>Fantastic modern hotel Stayed here for a long weekend in October. The hotel was very modern, clean and comfortable. The prices at the bar were reasonable for such a nice hotel. The rooftop pool and sunbathing area were very relaxing,and the views were fantastic. The room was very luxurious, although not much TV to watch for English viewers!Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Modern, Clean but lacks soul My wife and I stayed in the Amrey Diagonal for a 4-night city break. The hotel was excellent value with clean, bright rooms and excellent views (9th floor). The hotel is functional and close to excellent public transport (bus stop directly across from Hotel, tram 100m walk and Metro about 500m walk). The hotel does lack soul as it is ultra modern and functional and you hardly see any of the other guests. The restaurant menu is very limited and don't bother wasting hours wandering the local streets as there are very few proper restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel. There is an excellent Italian Chain restaurant (Gino's) in the Glories shopping centre, about a 5 min walk from the hotel (straight up Avenida Diagonal). The Rbla Poblenou street which the entrance to the hotel is located on has a few tapas bars and cafes but no decent restaurants to speak of. Poblenou leads all the way to the sea and takes a good 20-30 mins to walk but it's not really worth it. There are two supermarkets across the street from the hotel (Lidl and a local chain), where you can buy bottled water etc. at reasonable prices. There is a mini bar in the room which can take up to 3 x large bottles of water. Top tip for public transport is to buy a T10 card which allows 10 separate journeys with transfers between bus, metro, tram and funicular within 1 hr and 15 mins for each separate journey. The same card can be used for more than one person by simply punching it through the relevant ticket check for the number of passengers travelling. If you are a couple and only need to use the transport to get to specific areas that you then intend to walk in, this is by far the cheapest and most convenient way to do it. The T10 costs Euro 6.30 whereas a Day Card costs about Euro 8.30 and can only be used for one person. Unless you intend hopping on and off the public tranport all day, you'll find the T10 is better. The Amrey Diagonal is a long walk from the city centre but if you don't mind using public transport and walking a bit in between then it is fine. We are good walkers and walked all the way from the hotel to the Castle at Montjic via the Sagrada Familia church and the Ramblas (at least 5 miles). The city is great to walk in and feels very safe. So, to sum up, the Amrey Diagonal has clean, minimal rooms in a modern location, away from the centre but easily reached by Barcelona's superb integrated public transport system and the Glories shopping centre is only 5 mins away.

<Content>liked the clean fresh style Stayed here last May after reading many reviews on this site. My friend and I liked the hotel, the walk into the centre was relaxing and we thought the rooms were very comfortable. We loved Barcelona and would definately go back again. Although we had booked 2 rooms and I had phoned to confirm this when we arrived there was only a double room booked. I had my confirmation booking with me and the staff quickly sorted it but will double check next time. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to be within easy reach of the centre but quiet enough to sleep well.

<Content>Almost everything perfect, BUT... The hotel is rather new, nice and clean, the staff is gentle anf helpful, we've been upgraded to a bigger rooms and were given free breakfast which was not included when we booked.BUT! We usually work when we travel, so we need to have a reliable internet connection. Before booking, we send an email to the hotel asking if it was possible to use the hotel service provider's smtp to send emails and they answered yes. When we tried, a login and password were always asked so we couldn't work as we wanted.

<Content>Great Value in a Good Location This was my first trip to Barcelona and Spain, so I relied on the reviews here on TripAdvisor ALOT.Barcelona turned out to be very busy and we were not able to stay at a couple of other places we tried to reserve first. As it turned out, we were fortunate to stay here at the Amrey diagonal. As others have stated in their reviews it is not in the center of the city but is convenient to a new light rail line and not far from the metro. Also, there is a nice rambla that leads straight to the beach about 7 or 8 blocks away. Also a large shopping plaza is just across the way with everything you need.The staff was friendly and spoke English. The rooms were large, modern and clean with a minibar that was handy for storing drinks food bought in the area. I was impressed by the size of the bathroom.

<Content>Not worth it Hotel itself was average but staff were incredibly disorganized and totally not helpful. Other boutique hotels in Barcelona rate much better for value.

<Content>eurotrip One great place to stay!Value is definetly important, and the location isnt bad, especially considering that the neighboring area is quite safe and crowded with families late into the night. It's refreshing to see that there can be a hotel here that strives to differ from the archetectual norm and this is it. Not to mention technologically advanced, with clean lobby and elevators and neat hallways and rooms. The view from our hotel was spectacular (on 9th floor)Staff was very helpful and speak english well.Cafes are nearby and subways not too far away.

<Content>Had a fab time!!!! Stayed 3 nights at this hotel and thought it was very good. Hotel clean, rooms a good size, free electronic safe in the wardrobe, air con which was good as weather was hot when we visited. Hotel close to shopping complex which had food places and huge supermarket and clothes shops. about 5min walk from metro which was cheap and efficient. Only 15 euros for 5 day ticket which took us to the airport too. Overall barcelona was a great holiday and i would definatly go back to this hotel!

<Content>Spotless Modern Hotel My wife and I stayed in this hotel for three nights, and we were impressed by how clean and big the rooms are. It was the best hotel we stayed in during our two week trip through Spain with stops at Madrid, Granada, Sevilla and Barcelona. There is nothing left to say, but to praise the hotel and its staff. It is a little off the main tourist spots, but it is very close to the beach and a shopping center. Plus, it is very close to one of the major tourists attractions in Barcelona known by the locals as The Suppository. If you have been in Barcelona, you know what I am talking about. Anyways, if you stay at Amrey Diagonal, you will not be dissappointed.....
