<Content>Great hotel and location Hi,I stayed in this hotel with my wife and my two daughters. It is very good for the price. Staff is friendly, speaks english; they helped us with luggage transfert.Hotel reservation was done thru Intrenet and emails.Rooms are clean, standard size for Tokyo.Location is very quite, very nice and there are two metro station at walking distance. Some good restaurants around as well.Breakfast was 930 Y per person and is a Japanese and western free buffet. We used to take a strong breakfast at the hotel, to prepare for the day.We went back to the same hotel the last day of our stay.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the Asia Center for 4 nights and found it to be a great little hotel. There were 3 of us sharing the triple room. Ok, it was a bit small, but it wasnt that bad, not as small as we were expecting anyway. Besides, we werent in the room that much, only to sleep. The facilities in the hotel were great. The free bottled water and little packs at the desk are a great perk. The staff were friendly and spoke good english and always helped us with whatever we needed. You can also ask them to give you a map of the area, that was really helpful to get, but we didnt get it until the last day, so ask for it when you arrive. There isnt much in the way of restaurants around the hotel, but you can walk up to Roppongi in about 15 minutes, which has a load of sushi bars and restaurants, even a TGI Fridays if your missing the western food!The location was fantastic, just a short walk from the subway, which is on the Ginza line. This is really handy for getting anywhere in Tokyo. Its a really quiet neighbourhood and we felt safe walking back late at night from the station. They also have a good breakfast bufftet, it is 950yen, about 拢5, but there is so much stuff there to eat, from english, to japanese breakfast. I also have to say, that, although the bathrooms were tiny, the shower was lovely. Everything was clean, which is a real plus with us. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting a cheap place to stay. I booked through hotelclub.com and got a good deal.

<Content>Nicest Budget Hotel in Tokyo The double room in the NEW wing was tiny and is only good enough for 1.5 people...however we squeezed in to save a few quid. The rooms however are really nice and clean. The hotel provides free bottled water, toothbrushes etc in reception which is a nice touch.This hotel is not in the best location however it is close to a subway station which can ensure that you get ANYWHERE in Tokyo.We found it very difficult to find a budget room that wasn't in a hostel and this was the cheapest we could find. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is travelling to Tokyo on a budget.

<Content>Great, Cheap Hotel in Downtown Tokyo! This place was great! The service was friendly, everyone spoke English which really helped and it was affordable. Yes, the room was teeny tiny, but what else are you expecting in Tokyo? The room was also very clean and comfortable. From our room we had a nice view of the city, which was beautiful at night with all the lights! It is about a 15 minute walk from Rappongi, 5 minutes from the metro station. Great, quiet location. Free water bottles in the lobby. You can purchase postcards and stamps from the front desk which is so convenient. We were very happy with our stay here!

<Content>Rooms Not That Good Stayed at this hotel in late May/early June. Was not happy about the condition of the rooms. Requested to change rooms on the two occassions I was there. Even when I was put in the so-called 'new section' (which cost more), still not good: dirty/stained carpet; marks all over walls, old furniture. However, staff were very good about it - did not cop any 'attitude' which is to their credit. As other reviewers have said, this hotel is in a quiet area; fairy good neighbourhood; 5-10 mins to subway.

<Content>Nice clean cheap hotel Located in asakusahttp://www.asiacenter.or.jp/eng/we stayed there in may-june 2008 for 5 nights. really nice reception and good value and clean. the area wasn't the most happening place - business oritentated, but you can easily walk to ropongi or catch metro elsewhere. the metro system is easy to use and very good. would definately recommend it to anyone. free water bottles was nice and internet wasn't too expensive in foyer. nice supermarkets nearby.

<Content>ACOJ Fully Meets Expectations Review written while staying at the hotel which fully lives up to to the reviews given. Excellent location - 5 minutes walk from two subway stations- and as others have indicated staff are very helpful and all speak good English. Free bottles of mineral water in reception an added bonus. First trip to Japan and can thoroughly recommend this as a good value place to stay. If you are a UK national then this is Travelodge / Premier Travel Inn quality in terms of accomodation but helpfulness of staff is in diifferent league to the UK.

<Content>Clean, great price, good location Great budget style hotel in the heart of Tokyo. Great location close to two major Metro stops and also in close walking distance to major areas. Staff are friendly, rooms are clean - they are quite small but you don't spend too much time in them! Overall a hotel I would recommend for the price and location.

<Content>Great Little Find My family and I spent 3 days at this hotel in May 2007. The rate we payed was cheap and the hotel was great for the price. The front desk staff spoke very good English and was very helpful. The room and bathroom was a little small but very clean and everything worked including the hi-tech toilet. The hotel had washing machines and dryers which is very handy if you are travelling for a while, vending machines, (some full of beer) and free bottled drinking water in the foyer. There were plenty of cheap restaurants in the area and the subway was nice and close. We found it a little hard to get to the hotel from the airport by bus, but we managed. Overall if you don鈥檛 want to spend too much on your accommodation this is a great hotel, and I would stay here again.

<Content>Good choice in Tokyo Tokyo ist not the cheapest place and this hotel provides really good value for money. Prices are about 100 USD / per night / room.Special points for:++ really good location++ quiet++ free internet in every room ++ staff speaks English!-- some rooms (semi-doubles) are really small, better take a double or twin roomBreakfast (for about 9USD), furniture, bathroom are not any special. But you can expect tidiness.

<Content>Great value, excellent area to stay in I stayed at the Hotel Asia Center of Japan for 3 nights in a twin room. The twin room is a decent size for Japanese hotels. The bathroom however was cramped but had a high tech toilet with bidet function. Free internet is also available in the rooms. The hotel is located 5 mins from the subway and 15 mins from Roppongi which is a tourist hotspot. The rooms and hotel were very clean, staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful with restaurant suggestions. Breakfast is not included but there was free bottled water available in the lobby. There are many nearby restaurants to choose from as well as banks and 24hr convenience stores. The area is very safe and quiet at night. I will definitely stay here when I visit Tokyo again.

<Content>Good value First hotel we stayed at in Tokyo (note: after living in Kanazawa for 6 weeks). The subway station is easily accessible, but doesn't have escalators near the exits close to the hotel- which made dragging all our luggage around a bit of a chore at some points. The hotel is easy to find once you've found it before but when you're heading there for the first time- definitely have the directions handy. It's a walk from the station, but not bad. People in the area are very likely to be helpful if you approach them, or are likely to approach you and ask if you need help if you look lost enough (as was the case with us). As you'll see when you get there, the area is a big business area, although there's a cafe or two and a few convenience stores close to the hotel. The staff speaks english well, and the room, while small, was big enough (we had 3 people, 2 double beds). Internet access was free and worked. We also had a small refrigerator and hot water pot.Overall, the experience lived up the apparent reputation of a decent place for the money- decent location and a pretty good rate.

<Content>Loved the Asia Stayed in the Hotel Asia for 5 nights. Clean, centrally located and a short walk (5mins) from the subway. Local shops  eateries nearby. English speaking  friendly staff. Felt that the Hotel was good value. Free bottles of water in reception, and basic toiletries (toothbrushes / hairbrushes).If you've got big bags - there's no escalator from the subway to street level - not too bad, and the locals gave me a shove!I'd stay there again (and intend too).Sandy

<Content>Excellent for budget travelers I normally stay at more expensive, high quality hotels when I travel for business, but since my last trip was personal, I choose this hotel to save money.I was not that impressed with the hotel. I was, however, extremely impressed with what I got for the money. For the money, it is a great hotel. PROS:1. The price is fantastic. The only thing cheaper would be hostels or a capsule hotel. I paid less than $100 a night, something I didn't think was possible in Tokyo.2. Free wireless internet connection. I have found that many Tokyo hotels only have a wired LAN connection and I much prefer a wi-fi connection. 3. Free bottled water in the lobby. 4. There is an AM-PM about 100 yards from the hotel where you can load up on inexpensive riceballs and snacks. CONS:1. The breakfast at roughly $9 a person was just okay. Because it was a buffet, you could get filled up, but the food was just average. 2. The front desk was reluctant to convert any of my money. Since it was a weekend and was running out of yen, I found their reluctance to be a big problem. 3. The subway line is a short 10 minute walk. I usually pick a hotel with better subway access, but it always costs more to be right on top of a subway line.4. The neighborhood was sterile and didn't have a lot of neighborhood restaurants or stores. I didn't feel very japan-esyMy overall feeling is that this is a good place to stay if you are on a tight budget, but if you can afford to spend another $50 a night, you'd be much happier somewhere else.

<Content>Can't beat it for the price.. My wife and I just returned from Japan. The last time we were there, about 10 years ago, we stayed at The Asia Center and decided to stay there again after a good experience. We spent three nights there this time before heading to the west coast. It has more rooms now and we stayed in the new section. We had a room with a double bed and it was fine. Yes, small by U.S. standards but what I've come to expect in lower cost hotels in Japan.The staff were great and most helpful. The front desk folks were good at speaking English though my wife is Japanese and that certainly helped. The place is clean and the halls only had a slight smell of smoke which didn't bother either of us. We found the breakfast most convient and reasonable considering we were in a pricey area of Tokyo. The area is great and the subway most convenient. One item to note is that many subways do not have escalators or elevators so travelers that tend to pack heavy, like us, will lug big suitcases up a lot of steps if arriving/departing from the hotel by the subway as we do. My suggestion is to resist the urge to pack heavy and take advantage of the washers and dryers at the hotel. Your back will thank you for a lighter suitcase!Not much else to say except this is now our hotel of choice in Tokyo. We aren't budget travellers per se but do recognize a good deal and this is one of them. Since all we do is basically sleep in the hotel the money we save is better spent on excellent sushi/sashimi, sake and shopping.

<Content>Reasonable rates and fantastic location! My sister and I stayed four nights at the Asia Center, and had a great experience. We made reservations a week before our stay, and were fortunate enough to get a double room. On the downside, the double room was located in a corner of the first floor, which also seemed to be storage place for sheets and cleaning materials. That was definitely a minus. The room also faced the small hotel carpark, which meant that we had to keep the windows closed and curtains drawn. However, the staff were happy to switch us to a room on a higher floor. They also loaned to us a portable air-conditioner so the room wouldn't get too stuffy.Now, for the pluses:- The hotel is a 5-minute walk away from the Aoyama-Itchome subway stop, which we found extremely useful. The Ginza line took us to most tourist destinations, while the Uedo line brought us to the Tsukiji fish market. It was so convenient getting around!- We stopped by the 3 coffee places we found between the hotel and subway station, and they all served great coffee and breakfast snacks.- The hotel is located in a neighborhood that gives off a tranquil and safe vibe. Also, if you get hungry late at night, there is a 24-hour convenience store situated close to the hotel.- Finally, the staff at the reception were very helpful and spoke English well. This was a BIG plus, esp. since I only know a limited number of Japanese phrases. They provided helpful instructions on using a hotel shuttle bus to get to Narita airport, and also gave us helpful directions on getting to other places for sightseeing.Overall, the biggest plus is the convenient location of the hotel. The rates are also very reasonable, so I will definitely stay here again during my next trip to Tokyo!

<Content>Fantasic budget hotel, Great location We stayed in Asia Center of Japan in March 2006 for one week.It was a great budget hotel in a really fantastic location. Less than 5 minutes walk from the nearest tube station and in a 'safe' feeling location.The hotel itself has loads of rooms. We stayed in a Double Room in the refurbished part. The room was small (as all Japanese hotel rooms are!!) but comfortable. There was a TV in the room with BBC news 24 and a telephone. The hotel also had washing machines, great for a long term traveller. The hotel also had internet facility in the lobby which were reasonably priced but not cheap. Also the reception gave out free bottles of water!!To sum up you had the amenities of a larger, more expensive hotel but at a budget price. Great for a traveller and the tourist.
