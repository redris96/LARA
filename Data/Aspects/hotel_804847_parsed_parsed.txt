<Content>Took my breath away I just want to start off by saying that if anyone has anything bad to say about this resort, then they have literally gone cuckoo for cocoa puffs!My husband and I went to the Grand Bahia Principe 鈥淎mber鈥?resort from March 31, 2008 to April 7, 2008. We went to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and to top it off we met my parents down there. They were celebrating their 32nd wedding anniversary. They were there from March 29th to April 12, 2008. I realize it鈥檚 been a long time since our vacation but so many things have happened and I couldn鈥檛 find it within myself to write this review until now...We got in at the resort at about 9:45pm on the 31st and there waiting for us was mom  dad鈥rive to resort from airport wasn鈥檛 bad at all鈥ook about 40mins. Held my breath a few times as the roads are quite narrow and traffic was little congested at times.

The bathroom was done in marble and the Jacuzzi was amazing鈥 care package was left on our bed which consisted of a bottle of rum and 2 hotel T-shirt鈥?br/>As we got in late and missed supper we did order room service鈥ait was long but that didn鈥檛 bother us, we were finally on vacation鈥?br/>We ate at 5 of the a-la-carts鈥apaneese, Brazil, French, Gourmet,  Mexican鈥ll were beyond good鈥ave to say my favorite was the Japanese鈥aving the chef cook in front of us was pretty cool鈥?br/>The grounds throughout the resort are immaculate鈥he staff take pride in their jobs and are always trimming, sweeping, and picking up the tiniest of leaves on the grounds鈥veryone is always greeting you with a warm happy smile.The pool at the adults鈥?only is huge鈥 have to say the best part of the pool is the swim up bar鈥t was always nice to go and have a dip in the cool water then head over to the bar for another drink鈥he waiters and waitress were coming around at least once every 45 mins to see if you wanted or better yet needed another drink鈥?br/>Now as for the beach you could walk forever鈥?the sand was white and soft鈥rom the resort to the market which is about a 45 min walk to your right if you were looking at the ocean was really good鈥ons of things going on鈥n our walk we saw a body building competition going on鈥or those of you that are a little reserved, be prepared鈥verything goes on the beach!!As far as the disco, didn鈥檛 get to see it鈥 can honestly say that we were in bed sleeping by 10:30鈥hat鈥檚 what happens when your up at 6:00am and drink all day鈥ol鈥?br/>We did 2 excursions鈥?.

<Content>Beware of the scuba operation at the resort Hello all. I am disappointed to have to write this. Do not book any scuba diving through this resort. My girlfriend and I booked a dive trip to Catalina through the resort's dive shop. She became ill 2 days before we were scheduled to go. We spoke to the dive operator and explained the situation and they agreed to refund her half of the amount. As of today i am still out all of the money. When i attempted to collect the money all they would give me was a peice of paper saying refund. The shop refused to swipe my credit card and said that the paper was a record and they would refund the money later that day manually through their machine. I queried the operator several times as to why he would not swipe my card and he would not budge. I am now dealing directly with my credit card company and it is a real hassel. I did go on the trip and IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. ALL THE CORAL IS DEAD....THERE ARE LITTLE OR NO FISH....THE BOAT WAS OVERLOADED AND CRAMPED...OPEN BAR INCLUDED 1 BOTTLE OF RUM FOR MAYBE 30 PEOPLE...AND THE EQUIPTMENT IS IN HORRIFIC CONDITION. LUNCH ON THE BOAT WAS A COUPLE OF BAGS OF POTATO CHIPS PASSED AROUND. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR MONEY OR BOOK THROUGH SOMEONE ELSE. EITHER WAY THERE IS LITTLE OR NOTHING TO SEE. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO RETRIEVE MY MONEY SEVERAL OTHERS APPROACHED THE SHOP AND THERE WERE SEVERAL HEATED EXCHANGES. VERY VERY POOR BUSINESS PRACTICE. I HAVE DIVED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A POORLY RUN OUTFIT!

<Content>four out of 5 4 out of 5 Fist of all, let me say that our stay at the Grand Bahibe Ambar was very pleasant. We went two couples for the New Year week and had a great time.The site is beautiful, the many ( many ) gardens are immaculately taken care of.The cleanliness of the site is perfect in every way.The beach is paradise like with a lot of huts for those who are shy of the sun.The pool is beautiful with a nice swim up bar.The rooms are quite large with a very comfortable bed.The quality of the food is very varied and very good Now for the reasons of my 4 When in a five star resort I expect a few thing. The in room mini bar was not adequate. Four beers and one two oz scotch is not a mini bar when you consider that the lobby bar closes at 11:30 pm.Speaking of the lobby bar, all premium drinks are not included ( ex: cognac, brandy, whisky, quality scotch, champagne, ect. ). ( Can you say all inclusive?)The rooms are nice but don鈥檛 cut it to be a five star.The HOUSE WHINE, you don鈥檛 want to have to drink that for to long, but the only alternative is to pay for premium. ( Can you say all inclusive?)The waiters have a problem in the buffet restaurant; they are more in to talking with each other than taking your plate away. We waited up to fifteen minutes before getting our plates removes, and then we started removing them ourself.The beach bar closes at 5:30 pm and does not deliver to your seat.The pool bar closes at 6:00 pm.Speaking of delivery, they do deliver at the lobby bar, one problem though; the waitresses do not speak English or French. You will have a hard time ordering your drink in any other language that Spanish. All in all I feel that this should be quotes as a very good four star resort. Thank you for reading me

<Author>DeeEss
<Content>Great vacation, despite a few service issues My wife and I stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar for Christmas week (2008). Despite a few service-related issues, we enjoyed our vacation very much, and would not hesitate to stay at the Ambar again if we return to Punta Cana.We picked the Ambar based on the availability and the reviews we saw here. We were also considering the Bahia Principe Punta Cana, but decided to go with the adults-only Ambar. This was our first trip to Punta Cana, and my first experience with an all-inclusive resort (my wife stayed at Club Med a few times before I met her). We were looking for a vacation where we could just relax on the beach or at the pool, so the availability of activities outside the resort wasn't a big factor. We decided to go on this trip about 3-4 weeks ahead of time, so we didn't do as much research as we've done for other trips, and didn鈥檛 know much about Punta Cana before we arrived. We used Apple Vacations to book the trip, because they had the best price for that week.The Ambar is part of the Bahia Principe complex, which includes the much larger Bahia Principe Punta Cana. The Ambar is more compact than I expected based on other reviews here. Everything at the Ambar is within easy walking distance. Within the overall complex, the Ambar is ideally situated, with easy access to the beach. The entire complex is very attractive, well-maintained, and immaculate. Everything looks fairly new. Ambar guests can use any of the facilities in the complex, but I believe only Ambar guests are supposed to use the Ambar facilities (I don鈥檛 know if that is enforced). Children are not allowed in the Ambar, except on the beach.The Ambar is much quieter than the Punta Cana, as you鈥檇 expect during a week when lots of children travel. There鈥檚 no nightlife at the Ambar, other than a keyboard player in the lobby bar, but there鈥檚 entertainment at the Punta Cana and Pueblo Principe 鈥渧illage,鈥?which is part of the complex. The only information I saw about the shows at the Punta Cana and Pueblo Principe was posted on a bulletin board at the Punta Cana. We didn鈥檛 leave the Ambar at night, so I can鈥檛 comment on the entertainment quality.The Ambar guests were a mix of Europeans, Canadians, and Americans of all ages, so it was a fairly diverse group (and one that made for great people watching :-). Although the Ambar was pretty full, it never seemed crowded anywhere, and you could always find a chaise lounge by the pool or beach.ACCOMMODATIONSThe rooms at the Ambar are grouped into 3-story villas, with I鈥檓 guessing 70-90 rooms each. We were put in Villa 60, which is the building closest to the beach and right next to the pool, so we were very happy with that location. Our room was very nice and was a good size. There鈥檚 not a lot of drawer space for clothes, but there are shelves in the closet and plenty of space to hang things.Note that none of the villas at Ambar are directly on the beach 鈥?the pool and snack bars are between the villas and the beach 鈥?so there won鈥檛 be great ocean views from any of the rooms.The villas are open at each end and have tile floors in the hallways with no rugs, so there鈥檚 nothing to deaden the sound. If there鈥檚 anything going on in the hallway, you鈥檒l hear it in your room. This is likely to be worse on the ground floor (where we were). Fortunately, there wasn鈥檛 a lot going on in the hallway overnight, but if you鈥檙e a late sleeper, you might find it too noisy in the mornings. Inside the rooms, we couldn鈥檛 really hear anything from adjacent rooms, except in the bathroom.One odd thing we noticed in both our bathroom and in the public bathrooms is that the toilet seats are too small for the toilets. The toilets have elongated bowls, but the seats are the standard smaller size. I guess the person who ordered the seats didn鈥檛 talk to the person who ordered the toilets. :-)POOL AND BEACHThe pool is large, with plenty of chaise lounges. Finding a spot was never a problem, even though the resort was full. The pool isn鈥檛 heated, but the water wasn鈥檛 too cold. There are what look like hot tubs integrated into the pool, but they鈥檙e not heated either, just bubbly. The pool bar can be accessed from the water. There鈥檚 a towel exchange station in the pool area, where you can trade your dirty beach towels for new ones until 5:30. They never seemed to run out of new towels. The beach towels are provided in your room. The beach is huge, and stretches for miles in either direction. Children are allowed on the beach. The beach was packed, but we didn鈥檛 have any problems finding chaise lounges there either. Although there are many resorts along the beach, none of them have high-rise buildings, so it doesn鈥檛 feel overly built-up. If you walk the beach to the right (facing the water), there are lots of people as far as you can see, but to the left, the beach becomes pretty deserted after you pass a few neighboring resorts.The beach is not lit at night, and there鈥檚 very little light coming from the nearby buildings, so it鈥檚 a great place for stargazing.FOOD AND DRINKThe food was good overall, but not great. We had the dinner buffet our first night, and were somewhat disappointed, largely because our expectations were high based on the good reviews here. The buffet provided a lot of variety, and the food was nicely presented, but most of things we tried for that meal were just okay.In addition to the buffets, there are a la carte restaurants throughout the complex (3 of them at the Ambar), which don鈥檛 cost extra but require reservations in advance. The hotel made 3 reservations for us before we arrived (we didn鈥檛 request them), two at the 鈥淕ourmet鈥?restaurant and one at the Mediterranean restaurant. We also ate twice at the Mexican restaurant at the Punta Cana (which was located very close to our villa), and once at a BBQ at the Las Olas snack bar. The Gourmet restaurant is entirely a la carte; the BBQ is all buffet, and the other two are a combination of a la carte and buffet (you get food from both). Like the buffet, the restaurant food was good but not great. We liked the Mexican restaurant the best 鈥?even though the food wasn鈥檛 very authentic, there was a lot of variety at the buffet (I鈥檓 not sure why they even bother with the entr茅e).We had breakfast and lunch each day at the Las Brisas snack bar, next to the Ambar pool. They provided a decent selection of items there, and you can eat outside. The waiters there were very friendly and personable. On our last day, we had the buffer lunch at the Punta Cana, and it was better than the dinner buffet we had our first night.The process for making dinner reservations could be improved. You have to make reservations at the Guest Services desk in the Ambar lobby, and there was always a line. Most people spent time looking over menus while they were being helped, so service was slow. You can make reservations between 8:00am and 6:00pm, though reservations for the same day have to be made by 3:00pm. The Guest Services desk is staffed after 6:00pm, but they won鈥檛 make dinner reservations then (I don鈥檛 know why). You can make reservations for any a la carte restaurant in the complex, not just those at the Ambar. You don鈥檛 need reservations for the buffets.Although there鈥檚 a large selection of alcoholic drinks included, many of these are domestic or unfamiliar varieties -- most of the name brands cost extra. However, my wife and I liked the domestic rum, so we never felt compelled to spring for the 鈥済ood stuff.鈥?The drink menus in the Ambar lobby bar show exactly what is and isn鈥檛 included. The house red and white wines are okay, but you can order from a wine list (at extra cost). The only time we ordered from the wine list was during the special Christmas Eve dinner (at the Gourmet restaurant), when we ordered a bottle of cava.SERVICEThe quality of service varied 鈥?in some areas, it was consistently good, in others, consistently mediocre.The check in process went smoothly. The driver who brought us from the airport dropped us off at the Punta Cana lobby rather than the Ambar (I鈥檓 not sure if that was intentional or a mistake), but the hotel staff immediately took us over to the Ambar lobby. Check in was quick, and a bellman walked us to our villa with our bags, so we didn鈥檛 have to wait for them. All the people we dealt with during the check-in process were friendly and professional.The hotel provides what they call Express Service, which you鈥檙e supposed to be able to call for anything you might need. There are two different extensions you can call, and two speed-dial Express Service buttons on the room phone, though the buttons didn鈥檛 work on our phone. We called Express Service twice after we arrived at our room (sometime between 6:00-7:00), once to request extra clothes hangers, and again later to order a pillow from the pillow menu. We didn鈥檛 receive either. The next morning, I called again, and they assured that both the hangers and pillows would be delivered that day. We received the hangers, but no pillows.The hotel also provides what they call butler service. It wasn鈥檛 clear how you request butler service, or how that differs from Express Service. However, on our second day, we happened to meet the butler for our villa, Jorge Abreu, by the pool. (I don鈥檛 know how many villas Jorge handles, but his 鈥渙ffice鈥?seemed to be in our building.) Jorge was fantastic! He asked if he could do anything for us, and we mentioned we were having problems getting pillows 鈥?he had someone deliver them almost immediately. The next day, we were chatting with Jorge by the pool, and he told us he would have a surprise for us in our room the following day, and not to come back to our room before 5:15. That day, we got to our room at 5:30, and were greeted with the aroma of incense. Then we discovered the surprise, in our bathroom 鈥?we had a bubble bath waiting for us, with flower petals spread on the bubbles, and a small bottle of rum, with ice and two glasses, sitting on the side of the tub. What a great surprise! My wife and I weren鈥檛 celebrating a special occasion, so this was totally unexpected. For the rest of the week, Jorge was there for us if we needed anything, so we didn鈥檛 have to deal with Express Service again. That made the stay much more pleasant than it might have been otherwise.By the way, we tried 3 different pillows during our stay: We liked the Emperor the best (down-filled and very supportive), the Dream Apple was pretty good, but the scent on the Chamomile was too strong. The standard pillows were pretty bad, so make sure you try one of the 鈥渦pgrades.鈥?br/>As others have mentioned, the minibar restocking service is hit or miss. When fully stocked, our minibar contained two beers, one 鈥渘ip鈥?each of Bacardi and Dewars, two small bottles of water, two or 3 soft drinks, and a small can of Pringles potato chips. There were also two large bottles of water in the room. It took two days before we got our first refill, and when we did get restocked, we didn鈥檛 always get a new large bottle of water. We only cared about getting water, because there was a sign in the bathroom saying you shouldn鈥檛 drink the tap water (it鈥檚 okay for brushing teeth and washing).The service at all of our meals was very good, and all the wait staff were pleasant, and in some cases, very entertaining.As others have noted in these reviews, some of the staff have a hard time with English, but we managed to make ourselves understood. We were also trying to learn some Spanish while we were there, and the staff members were generally happy to help us learn.Although tipping is not required, we tipped wait staff, bartenders, the maids, and the people who restock the minibar (the maids don鈥檛 do this) every day. From what we saw, most people didn鈥檛 tip, and I can鈥檛 say that tipping made a difference in service, but the staff works hard doesn鈥檛 they don鈥檛 get paid much. We had to make several trips to the cashier in the Ambar lobby to get dollar bills for tips 鈥?they would never give us more than 10, and in some cases, only 5. We also took special care of our butler Jorge at the end of our stay.We had a pretty horrible service experience regarding internet access, which I鈥檒l talk about in a moment.There were also a couple of minor issues that came up during the check out process. The hotel information in the room says you can avoid waiting in line to check out by settling up your bill the night before, so I did that. The only charge to my room was for the bottle of cava I had ordered during the Christmas Eve dinner, which was supposed to cost $27 (that was the price on the wine list), but the charge was for $32. I explained that the charge was incorrect, but I was told I would have to go the restaurant the next morning and have them resolve it. Since I was settling up my bill that night to avoid lines the next morning, I agreed to pay the extra $5 rather than go through the hassle of trying to get it fixed. The fact that the charge was wrong wasn鈥檛 the issue 鈥?people make mistakes. What bothered me is that they didn鈥檛 give me the benefit of the doubt and adjust my bill, which most hotels would do. After all that, when I tried to leave the hotel the next morning without checking out, the bellman told me I needed a check-out ticket in order to remove my luggage from the hotel, so I had to go back and check out anyway (fortunately, the line was short).INTERNET ACCESSThe most aggravating service-related incident that we experienced involved paying for internet access.I had read somewhere that internet access was available (for a fee), so I brought my laptop with me on the trip, just to check e-mail and maybe do some research if we decided to do any excursions. To get internet access, you have 4 options:1. Use one of the two computers in the Ambar lobby, which guests can use for up to 15 minutes at a time, at no charge. There was always a line at these computers, and to get access, you have to ask someone at either Reception or Guest Services to activate your 15 minutes (or you can use any remaining time from the person before you).2. Go to the Internet Center located at the Pueblo Principe village and pay to use the computers there (I don鈥檛 know what the charges were).3. Use the wi-fi network in the Ambar lobby. To access this, you need to buy a user ID from the Internet Center at Pueblo Principe. The cost is $15 per day, and you can buy any number of days. (Note: If you pay with a credit card, they鈥檒l add a 21% surcharge.) 4. Rent a USB modem from the Internet Center that allows you to access the internet from your hotel room. This is also $15 per day, with a two-day minimum. If you want to use this option, you need to bring your laptop with you to the Internet Center, because they鈥檒l install software to allow you to use the modem. (You can also rent a laptop, but I don鈥檛 know how much that costs.)I wanted to use my laptop, so I was interested in one of the last two options. The person who worked at the Internet Center told me the service wasn鈥檛 always good with the USB modem, especially for buildings near the beach, so I decided to try the lobby wi-fi network instead, which he told me was very reliable. I purchased 5 days of access, for a total of $75 (cash).As soon as I got back to the Ambar, I tried getting access to the wi-fi network. The way it鈥檚 supposed to work is this: You connect to the wi-fi network, and when you try to access the internet via a browser, you get prompted to enter the user ID and password you bought. My computer was able to connect to the network (briefly), but I couldn鈥檛 get any internet access at all, apparently because there鈥檚 an issue with the DNS servers for this network. I spent about 30 minutes trying to make this work, during which time I kept losing my connection to the wireless network. I finally gave up and decided to try again the next day.The next day, I spent an hour or so trying to get internet access, still without any luck. At one point, I managed to get the prompt for my purchased user ID in the browser, but when I entered it, I just got a 鈥減age not found鈥?error. I finally gave up and decided to go back to the Internet Center and get my money back. A person working at Guest Services told me getting a refund shouldn鈥檛 be a problem. Note that there were other people who were apparently able to use the network successfully, but I was told by one of them that it 鈥渞equired a lot of patience.鈥?br/>I went back to the Internet Center and talked to the same person who sold me the user ID the day before, and told him it wasn鈥檛 working for me, and that I wanted a refund. He refused to give me a refund, and told me I was doing something wrong, and said he would go to the hotel with me and try to get it to work. I explained that I know how to access wireless networks 鈥?I work with computers and I travel 鈥?and I didn鈥檛 want to waste any more of my time trying to use an unreliable service. He told me he couldn鈥檛 refund my money without getting approval from his supervisor, who he tried to call but couldn鈥檛 reach. He kept trying to talk me into letting him help me get things working, and I was getting more and more aggravated. Then, he tells me he has to go back to the hotel anyway because other people are having the same problem I was having! This went on for an entire hour (in front of other customers), after which he finally refunded my money.This experience almost ruined what was otherwise a very enjoyable vacation. I guess it serves me right for bringing my laptop with me. :-)APPLE VACATIONSI have a few final words about Apple Vacations, who I used to book this trip. This doesn鈥檛 factor into my hotel rating at all, since Apple Vacations is an independent tour company, this is just FYI.I came across Apple Vacations when searching for travel deals for this trip, and once I decided on the Ambar, I used Apple because they had the best package price. The package included airfare from Miami and transfers between the airport and hotel. I booked online using Apple鈥檚 web site, and other than some issues with the web site, the booking process was without incident.When leaving the Punta Cana airport, I found the Apple representative in the area where all the tour operators are located, and he gave me a letter with the name of the Apple representative at the hotel, and hooked me up with the driver for the trip to the airport. The letter said there would be a welcome briefing at the hotel, where I would receive important information about my departure time for the return trip; the Apple representative at the airport pointed that out on the letter. The trip to the hotel was in an uncomfortable minivan, with another couple who were going to the Riu Palace (close to the Ambar). The other couple was dropped off first. When we arrived, the driver dropped us at the lobby of the Bahia Principe Punta Cana 鈥?he knew we were going to the Ambar, so I thought maybe everyone checks in at the Punta Cana. We went to the Reception desk, and when they realized we were going to the Ambar, they got a bellman to drive us to the Ambar lobby with our luggage.The next morning, we intended to go to the welcome briefing, but didn鈥檛 realize it was in the Punta Cana lobby, not the Ambar, until after it had already started. (The letter stated the correct location, I just misread it.) Rather than miss anything important, I decided we鈥檇 contact the Apple representative later to get the departure time. This was easier said than done.The Apple representative had office hours at the tour operator鈥檚 office at the Punta Cana lobby, pretty much all day. On the way back from one of my trips to the Internet Center at Pueblo Principe, I stopped at the Punta Cana tour operator鈥檚 office to speak with the Apple representative, but she wasn鈥檛 there. This was around 11:30am, and other people in the office told me she鈥檇 be back at 5:30pm (so much for regular office hours). The next day, I asked the Guest Services person at the Ambar if he could contact the Apple representative for me, so I could make sure she was there before going to her office. He couldn鈥檛 reach her immediately, be she called him back and he put me on the phone with her. She told me she couldn鈥檛 actually give me my departure time until the day before departure (we were leaving Saturday), and on Friday, she would be in the Ambar tour operator鈥檚 office from 5:00-7:00pm, so I told her I would find her then. She also gave me her extension at the Punta Cana tour operator鈥檚 office so I could call her. (Apparently, the welcome briefing that I missed is about the various tours and excursions you can buy from Apple.)On Friday, I went to the Ambar tour operator鈥檚 office at around 5:30, but the Apple representative wasn鈥檛 there. There was a note saying she was at the Punta Cana lobby office. When I got back to my room, I tried calling the extension she gave me, but no one answered. I also had a number for the local Apple office (not the hotel location), but when I called that number, I got a recording in Spanish and then was disconnected. (That turned out to be my fault 鈥?I was dialing a 1 before the area code when calling from my cell phone, and apparently you have to omit the 1.) I tried the hotel extensions again several times, and the Apple representative finally answered at around 7:30. She told me the local Apple office was closed, so she couldn鈥檛 get me a pick-up time, but I could call them after 8:30 the next morning. She told me pick up is usually around 3.5 hours before flight time, and that I would be picked up at the Punta Cana lobby . The next morning, I called the office several times and either got voicemail or no answer, but I finally got through to someone, who told me my pick up time was 1:30 (3 hours before my flight), and that I would be picked up at the Ambar lobby. I questioned the pick up location, and she checked with someone and found out it would be at the Punta Cana lobby as I was first told.The driver arrived at the Punta Cana lobby at exactly 1:30, this time in a bus, so the ride back to the airport was much more comfortable (and uneventful). There were two stops along the way, but we got to the airport in plenty of time for the flight.CONCLUSIONAs I said at the beginning of this review, our overall experience at the Ambar was a good one, despite the issues, and we would not hesitate to stay there again. You鈥檒l enjoy your stay too, as long as you know what to expect, and what to avoid while you鈥檙e there.If you see Jorge, send him regards from the 鈥渂ubble bath couple鈥?in Villa 60. :-)

<Content>Wonderful Holiday My wife and I just returned from the Ambar on Jan.4/09 and had a wonderful holiday. The check into the hotel went very smoothly with no problems. The room was everything that I expected and upon arrival was decorated in balloons as it was my birthday the following day. The beach area was what we felt the nicest along that stretch , as it was very deep with lots of lounge chairs available even though you had to go and put something on them early in the morning. The pool area was very large but we spent most of our time at the beach even though making numerous trips to the pool bar for refreshments. It was enjoyable being at an all Adult resort in particular that time of year when families are travelling with young children. We had no problems with reservations in any of the a la carte restaurants. I spoke to some people who had problems getting the reservations and when they showed up without were not allowed in even though the restaurant was not filled at all near capacity.I clarified this with guest services who advised me there are times when people reserve and do not show up so they have to book around the numbers showing. If everyone showed up whenever it would be disastrous and reservations would not work. I would suggest taking the shuttle around the full property on your first day as it is very large when leaving the Ambar property itself. This way you know where everything is located early on your holiday. As for the workers not speaking a lot of English they were very encouraging to try to assist us in speaking Spanish and took extra time in doing so.( we should attempt to adapt). All in all in was an excellent trip with great service. I only had one meal not satisfactory during the week and it was only because of what I ordered. I enjoyed the quietness, relaxing evenings with my wife and friends in the lobby bar. If you look on the liquor menu in the lobby it will tell you which of the drinks are on the all inclusive, that way I was able to order Bacardi Gold. Make sure you take insulated containers for drinks, they are great. I have the Bubba containers and could have set up a stand and sold them.

<Content>Beautiful Grounds/beach The grounds at the Ambar were beautiful as much time was taken to maintain the property--The beach was also breathtaking, and seemed better then the Riu next door 2 things that dissappointed---The food was average, as many have stated here--The buffet was the same every night--I STRONGLY recommend as soon as you arrive to get reservations for the japanese, the BBQ and the Garden Grill--(the steakhouse is good too) Some of these are located on the Punta cana or Bavaro resort of the pricipe--They offer a change of food but overall the food was very average as i expected better(mexico seemed better in this dept.)Second, the employees are trained to do their basic job with no flexiblility--Couple of issues happennd as the lights going on at 4am as they tried to put someone into our room--I felt bad for the couple who then had to go back to the front desk--Our room wasnt ready either at 3pm checkin time and we asked for a one hour extension of our checkout time to take advantage of the pool/late flight and were given the runaround(and no later checkout)--So the service isnt the best(english communication is tough)Overall, if beach, pool and drinks with an awesome grounds is what you want, then you will have a great time--If you are looking to have really great food and need some special favors from the hotel, which you get at others, dont expect much

<Content>gorgeous and a very good value Now I can be critical of a place if it really falls short (my scathing review of Sofitel Marara Bora Bora), but the Pricipe Ambar did very well to suit of needs this year.The first thing we loved was the adults-only designation. It was very nice to be free of the incessant noise of children for a whole week.The grounds, rooms and building were A-1 5 star classy all the way. There were some minor problems with the plumbing, but not enough to have me calling maintenance. The Ambar rooms are very large and clean. The Air conditioning worked. Great.The beach was also excellent, though the water is a little rough when the wind blows. The Ambar pool did not have many palapas, and we like shade so we stayed under a beach palapa every day. BTW - We took a trip to the South and visited the Principe Romana, which has a spectacular beach on calm water - very much like Bora Bora!The Food: this is what really makes Ambar the better choice compared to so many Spanish-run hotels. In general these companies are very poor at providing acceptable food. You are railroaded to the buffets and the food is stale, bland and not to American or European tastes. This problem affects the Ambar also, but not entirely. The Ambar offers a lot more selection of food and condiments, better beer (Presidente instead of Copa), and wine options at lunch. There is more food, and the plethora of condiments to help you spice it up enough to be delicious (eg the spiced oils and salsas). It achieves an acceptable 10% rule - 90% is crap, and 10% is pretty good, so experiment and you can assemble a decent meal. In contrast, the rest of the hotel complex outside the Ambar is absolutely lousy - eat in the Ambar only!The A la Carte restaurants are pretty bad - except we lucked out at the Gourmet restaurant: I had an excellent lobster with a decent Spanish Rioja wine.The included alcohol is pretty bad. It is an ordeal to order top shelf liquor. I knew this in advance and brought my own better liquor from home.I would have been upset if I paid more for the trip ($2200 CDN a piece at Xmas for everything). This trip was a great value and there were pretty much no problems. We returned rejuvenated and happy after a stressful year in business.I might return to the DR, but try the Principe Romana instead.

<Content>Best vacation ever! We just came back from our annual Christmas vacation which we spent this year at the Bahia Principe Ambar. This was the third time at this multi-section hotel - first time in the Ambar - and this was the best vacation ever! We loved the beach - much wider than the other part of the hotel and with more beach chairs, etc.. The rooms are spacious and very clean and we particularly liked that there was a separate shower and tub. The maid service was excellent - every night our bed was turned down and we got clean towels. The food was varied and for the most part pretty good. We had an excellent waiter in the buffet restaurant who always made sure a table was ready for us (we were a party of 8). We would recommend this hotel to our friends. We will be returning to the Bahia Principe Ambar for our Christmas vacation in 2009.

<Content>Loved the Ambar! The Ambar was an amazing getaway for my boyfriend and I. We are in our 40s. Food - was excellent, and we got 6 a la carte reservations for a 7 day stay! The buffet was amazing - very wide selection of food from healthy to sinful.Overall hotel - The Ambar is about a year old. Immaculately clean. Lovely lobby area.Rooms - Immaculately clean. Great bathroom, especially the showerheads! Very comfortable bed (King size). Our Junior Suite was a little bigger than the average, I suspect. It had a little L shaped area at the end, with a desk and reading area, in addition to a day lounger and a dining room type table with chairs.Staff - Very helpful and friendly. Gym - It kept us working out!Beach - 5 Star! Lovely sand, lots of room, nice beach chairs, lots of hut things to hide underPool - Nice enough. Drinks - Well, perhaps if you drink 10 in a row you'd get a buzz, but we found we would have a few, and feel mostly normal. Which was fine for us. The good drinks (liquor) could be had at the main lobby bar.Bugs - None. None flying around anywhere, and none anywhere else.Sickness - I escaped. Boyfriend had a little issue near the end, but it was manageable. Don't drink the tapwater. Ice cubes are fine.Shows - Fun. What can you say? It's not Vegas!Other hotels within the Bahia Principe - This resort is actually 4 or 5 hotels in one large complex. Also included are the Bavaro and Punta Cana and others. We went to the Bavaro a few times, and we found it incredibly annoying, based on the sheer number of people there. We would happily escape back to the tranquil Ambar.This is a great hotel. I have nothing but great things to say and would recommend this to anyone.

<Content>Pretty darn good Great resort for adults. We went over xmas week. We've been to quite a few resorts in Mexico, Jamacia, Cuba and this is our second time in Punta Cana DR and we would definately go back to this resort. No problems checking in and room was perfect. Nice big room with king bed, good view of pool and beach. The best rooms are in building 64, 67 or 68 - corner rooms are bigger and make sure your room faces the courtyard/pool/beach, all are 3 storey walkups. Did mention that the food was excellent - yup, no complaints on the food. Main buffet was a total pigout and the a la carts (already prebooked for you) weren't bad either. Their red and white wine was very good. You can use the restaurants and facilities next door to the Ambar (3 other resorts) but unless you like a ton of kids and teenagers then I wouldn't recommend it. We lasted half an hour and then went back to Ambar. Overall just a nice, quite, clean, comfortable resort for adults.

<Content>The only thing worse than the service was the food. I booked with Apple Vacations a 7 night stay at Gran Bahia Principe Ambar for December 27- January 3. I am writing this review On December 30 from my home in Cincinnati, Ohio as this trip was a total disaster and we left early. The following are facts I personally observed during my 2 1/2 day stay: 1. The Ambar is a small portion of the larger Gran Bahia hotel. It is supposed to be adults only but children frequent the pool and beach area without interference from the hotel staff. Thus, this is not an adults only resort, as you will encounter children on a regular basis, in your pool and sitting with you at the beach. 2. You will have to eat at the buffet most of the nights of your stay. We checked in on December 27 at 4:30 and could not get a reservation in one of the restaurants until December 30 at 9:30 in the Portofino. No other restuarants or times were available. 3. The food at the buffet is not edible. The food was the same every lunch and dinner and included the following: (a) cross-contaminated meat products (the chef would use the same utensils to cook as he would to remove the raw meat from the counter window), (b) canned fruit and (c) flies roaming around all dishes. 4. The mini bar in your room is 2 bottles of water, 2 beers and 3 off-brand bottles of soda. 5. The pool is too cold to get into and the hot tub is a sectioned off portion of the pool with the same temperature water and jets. 6. The pool bar closes at 6pm 7. The hotel bar closes at 11pm, thus, if you want a drink after 11pm, you have to take the shuttle to the main hotel (where there are children), where they have one bar that is open and extremely crowded since that is the only bar open past 11pm. 8. You have to pay for your drinks in the casino which is always crowded and we had to wait an hour and half before we could sit down at a card table. I could go on and on, but that is not going to make things any better. I STRONGLY suggest if you have booked a trip to the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar and you are a couple looking for an adults only resort, you contact your travel agent and make alternate arrangements.Best of luck!Disgruntled in Cincinnati

<Content>Beautiful property Our trip was a Christmas vacation - my husband and me and our adult daughter. We had two rooms located across the hall from each other in a perfect location close to pool and beach. The beach has the whitest, cleanest, most powdery sand I have ever seen. The little thatched roof umbrellas on the beach and pool are great - good protection ffrom the sun if you want or need it. Drinks were great - most anything you would want is included. The service staff were all very pleasant and helpful. Gourmet meals - very good. Only one complaint - which we had read on TripAdvisor before we went - the a la carte restaurant reservations. We were given reservations for three dinners upon arrival. (We had called the resort to try to make reservations two days before departure - were told we had to do it by email. My daughter got the email address and sent our requests for the 4 nights of our stay.) We were given three reservations upon arrival - one was for the previous night, one was for a night during our stay and the other was for a night after our departure. We had to go to the customer service desk to make any changes. There was only one customer service rep on duty - Johanney. After waiting for him to finish with other guests it took at least 30 minutes to arrange reservations. He denied ever receiving my daughter's email even after she showed him the email on her Blackberry. He initially gave us reservations for an incorrect number of people and, again, for nights when we were no longer there. We did get a reservation in the gourmet restaurant for Cristmas Eve. The reservation for our first night there was for 9:30 PM - We asked for something earlier because we had had a long day of travel but were told not possible. We ended up going to the buffet that night which was good, but not our preference. Buffet breakfast were very good with very large selections. Another day we discovered that our reservation appeared to be the pool bar which had no seating. I went to customer service - again waited to speak to Johanney -about changing the reservation - was told reservations closed at 3 PM (it was about 4 PM) - not possible. Also learned that the reservation was in the Club Premier - poolside in another part of the resort. We talked our way into one of the resaurants at Ambar and had a very nice dinner - thanks to Hector, a waiter who was near the hostess's desk when we arrived and who took care of us for dinner. The hostess was insisting we could not enter without a reservation. (None of the al a carte restaurants were ever full) This is beginning to sound like a lot of complaining, but really, this is a wonderful resort. We had a great time and the reservation issue is the only complaint with the resort. Our tour was an Apple tour with a charter flight from Philadelphia. No complaints about Apple except for the representative at the resort. We met with her the first morning of our stay as instructed. She was very pleasant but it was obvious her main function was to sell side trips. She gave us information about departure, transfer to airport, etc. and told us to check the day before for flight confirmation and pick-up times but there was no group orientation meeting as had been implied. It was a mostly a waste of time. The information about our departure was not posted at Ambar as she had told us and we had to go to the Punta Cana lobby to find it. She was not there at the appointed time and we contacted her by phone a little later and told her we had seen the board with the pick-up time. She still insisted that we had to come to her office. (We had stayed at Punta Cana and had a drink in the lobby, so we went back) I asked if we needed anything else from her - answer was no. She could have accompished this over the phone.

<Content>A great vacation First I like to say that my wife and I are in our mid forty鈥檚. I have been to Costa Rica x 2, Cuba x 4 and Jamaica. We are those type of travelers鈥?that like to leave the resort with out an escort .We went off the resort which wasn鈥檛 a good idea most of the security outside the resort have sawed off shot guns and there was this guy with a machete acting like he was in the movie Indiana Jones. The funny thing is we had are bracelet showing that we belonged to the resort but the security guard still wouldn鈥檛 let us in and said he didn鈥檛 speak English. HE GUARDED THE SERVICE GATE NOT THE FRONT GATE. We took his advice and it led us to a dead end. Why would he do that? When we turned around the Amigos that led us to the dead end were right behind us. These people are not Cubans or Costa Ricans if you get lost in Cuba they will help you find your way not in Punta Cana they just want your money that led us to a dead end. We finally got back to the service gate that鈥檚 when we started raising our voices and then the guard suddenly could speak English. A great thing about our adventure was that if those guys with the shot guns are hired to protect the resort I guarantee no ones going to get by them. Something that the locals told us. 鈥?Not to wear jewelry or watches that鈥檚 how they judge you on how much money that you might have鈥? I think the Ambar was the best for 脌 la carte restaurants and entertainment. The main buffet is the same as all the rest of the places I have been to the resort itself was great the people inside the resort where great to us even though English is not there second language there second is French. 脌 la carte restaurants: Something I learned later you can go to anyone of these restaurants. I think there is about ten and you can go to them as many times you like. We liked them all. Entertainment: You will not get bored here Casino, Karaoke Bar, Lobby bars, and Band area has a bar even where you go see the dancers and take the kids at night has a bar none of these entertainment areas are at the Ambar. They are out in front of the Gran Bahia Principe main resort they have a shuttle that will take you there but its only a ten min walk. We were not afraid to walk the resort at night there are eyes everywhere. You will have nothing to fear inside.The Beach: Fantastic but maybe it was the time of the year the water was rough. Good for boarding. Sand was great but I liked the Cuban Beaches better. Only because of the body of water that surrounds Cuba.Room: Fantastic great view we were in the 200's.The stocked bar didn鈥檛 come with rum I didn鈥檛 get that but outside of that nice room. Room service is also included. Tipping: I only tipped once and that was at the end of the week. Service was great even without tipping all week.Buying stuff: Rum and cloths cheaper at the airport. They wanted to charge us for suntan lotion 30.00 can. at the hotel.It was a great vacation there is nothing like an Adult Resort we will go back maybe even next year no kids.

<Content>Enjoyed the Ambar Just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We enjoyed the Ambar, certainly had some benefits over the Bavario and Punta Cana side. We basically stayed on the Amber side with a couple trips up to the other lobbies and to the market where you could buy souvenirs. This is also where you can sign up for wireless internet for your laptop if you like. ($15usd / 24 hours) The Casino is by the market as well.The Good.1)Resort was kept in great condition inside and out.2)Staff was very friendly and courteous3)Room was spacious, mini-bar was restocked daily4)a la carte restaurants were great. we tried the French 3x Mexican 2x Italian 1x5)Lobby bar was great. Try the chocolate banana. (wow)6)Beach was beautiful, lots of lounge chairs and shade (why do people reserve the best chairs and then don鈥檛 come down to enjoy them.)7)Ambar Beach Bar. We liked the bartender, his name is Bienvenito8)Beach vendors were courteous, would not bother you unless you flagged them down.The Bad1)The resort is so large. We enjoy walking so the physical size is not what I鈥檓 talking about. Besides, this resort has a mini bus system to take you around if you like. Around the resort it didn鈥檛 seem like it was crowded, no line ups for drinks or food. The real problem is the number of people that are on the beach. Even on the Ambar (Adult) beach there were too many people for my liking. The main beach was just crazy, wall to wall lounge chairs. 2)My wife got ill on the second last day, don鈥檛 know what happened, the food? Flu? It could be a number of things, I did not have any problems.3)Punta Cana airport had very limited selection of well priced souvenirs.  The Ugly1)Whatever that smell is between the Main Lobby and the Ambar lobbyOverall a nice trip and a great resort. We would have given it a better rating if my wife hadn't been ill for the last day. The resort is too large for our liking.

<Content>gran bahia is no sandals but it will do! Ok first off I rated this hotel average NOT because it wasn't absolutely spectacular looking. It is an amazing looking hotel but... This hotel is actually 5 hotels on 1 property. Some people might like this, however we found this property to be far too large. Personally I found that everywhere you went it felt packed. Also taking a trolley ride to get everywhere becomes very cumbersome. The Ambar is just another section on the resort that is set aside for adults. The entertainment and most other things to do on the resort is in the public sections. I did not get wow'd by the food at any of the restaurants, and when we found one we did like the japanese style we could only book it once there was just too many guests. The beach is nice but have fun getting shade on it unless your a very early riser. I'm not totally dis appointed with the trip, it's just that I thought it was a seperate property when they said adults only. What can I say the price was right because of the economic times.

<Content>Mostly Positive Agree with all the positive reviews, very pleasant Adult resort. One reveiwer mentioned the entertainment...what entertainment? Each night we had a quiet drink in the piano bar'.The only negative thing I have to say relates to snorkelling from the beach.Although there seems to be a reef app. 150 yards from the shore, snorkelling is restricted to a roped off area which only extends about 20 yards from the beach. This was a disappointment.

<Content>Very satisfied Arrived on Nov 29/08 at night. 67209. Enjoyed the welcome. Very clean. The concierge staff were very friendly. House staff were friendly as well..all though we did find an awful language barrier. On this resort the staff know very little english and sometimes it is difficult to order what you like over the phone for room service. Ambar does have 24 hour room service but it takes 45 mins to an hour to get at least. Maid service was hit and miss. Definitely bring scented candles or oils to burn in the room as it has a stale smell to it from the high humidity. Bar fridge was sometimes not filled however, the room was always cleaned and we had alot of bottled water. The prices of souveniers here are very expensive. The a la cartes were good. The gourmet is spectacular... definitely recommended. The mediterranian and bbq are also good ones. The japanese one was not so good, when it came to the rice it wasn't cooked throughly so it was chewy. Buffets were good too. The walkways in the hotel are very very emmaculate. The bus service to go from ambar to the sister resorts are great too! We enjoyed the disco, the piano bar, kareoke and the house bands in the main entertainment area. The theatre had fantastic plays and entertainment. Recommend the Legends musical and Micheal Jackson. The Circus play was good too. The beach was amazing. Pictures do not to this beach justice. The sand is like spongy talcolm powder. There are no rocks and the waters are very clear. We took part in scuba diving, which was worthwhile. However the reef they took us to was not really really clear and bright as there was a strong current. Parasailing was good but expensive for the time amount you get in the air. There were representatives from another resort who were walking around the beach asking tourists if they were interested in seeing the new resort being built down from the Ambar. Do not go, they are trying to sell time shares. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay at the Ambar. We are planning on returning the end of Feb or beginning of March. We recommend staying at Ambar rather than Bavaro or Princess (Bahia sister resorts) as you get a VIP wristband by staying at the Ambar. What I mean by this is you have the luxury or staying at the quiet Ambar when you want to enjoy a more tranquil atmosphere--when you want to party you can go to the other 2 resorts and eat and drink whatever you want..and you also get unlimited a la cartes. Happy trails!!!

<Content>Worth the money I've been at many different resorts, mostly in the Mayan Riviera, and this is definitively the best resort I have sojourned so far. The Ambar section of the Gran Bahia was very good. The rooms were similar to most resorts I have been previously. Despite tipping every day at the beginning, the maid in our section could certainly use some supervision in cleaning the room properly-the balcony was never swept once during our stay. The mini bar was refilled sporadically, but we did not mind. The beach was the best I have ever been to. Big area and fine white sand.The pool was nice, but why spend any time at the pool when the beach and the sea are so beautiful.The buffet and the a la carte restaurants were good, but I have had better food at several other resorts in the Mayan Riviera. If you like a glass of brandy after dinner, without having to buy an expensive cognac, bring your own because the local stuff, or what they called international (assuming I was ever served it), is not drinkable.I usually try to avoid the islands mostly because I find the staff not as friendly as the ones in the Mayan Riviera, but this place was different. The staff was very professional and friendly.Another major difference between the Dominican and the Mayan, at least during my stay, are the balmy warm evenings and no bugs of any kind, which cannot be said for the Mayan.I don't like to go back to the same place twice but I would make an exception for the Ambar

<Content>Nice but not the experience we were looking for My wife  I have travelled a fair amount in both the Carribean, Europe and have stayed in many lovely resorts. The Ambar section is beautiful with marble accents and the well kept grounds are surprisingly lush with plants,flowers and palm trees everwhere. The rooms are quite large and comfortable and if you're fortunate to get a corner room your balcony (and room) is that much larger again with more views offered from the balcony.Having said that our experience here was not without its problems. Arriving at the resort there was terrible confusion in off loading baggage in the dark outside the main entrance. Although 7 meals had been pre-booked via email; only 3 in fact had been arranged and unfortunatley my wife's birthday dinner on the night of our arrival was not one of them. An attempt to correct that problem with staff was made and I was assured that they woud fix it (?) it but no followup came through nor an apology offered. Our birthday meal was spent in the buffet lineups instead.The beach is white sand and beautiful as well ,constantly wind swept and wavy and extremely busy with people everywhere. Snorkling here in my opinion is not an option.In closing it is this writers opinion that the Ambar resort is a beautiful well appointed 5 star property. If you are used to staying at large resorts in Punta Cana then this property is a definate must! If however you are seeking a more intimate service oriented experience ( like we were) this is not the place to go. Consider instead the Excellance Punta Cana. That resort is a little older, not as flashy but is romance at its finest.There is a definate difference felt between an Adults only resort and the feelings experienced in a resort geared towards Couples.Tramper

<Content>A wonderful getaway! Weather was unbeatable, grounds beautiful and well groomed, service staff wonderful. Avoid the beach restaurant. Breakfast best at the Palmyra buffet, dinners best at the a la carte restaurants. Some dinners good, some great (Mediterraneo had fabulous mushroom soup and their pork ribs were crispy, tender and delicious). Glad my husband knew a little Spanish because you'll be hard-pressed to find fluent English-speakers, even behind the front desk. Bring some U.S. dollar bills for tipping, because you'll only get pesos from the ATMs. Internet cafe charges $12/hour! Some people bring thermos mugs for drinks at the pool because they do melt fast.

<Content>We Will Be Back ASAP My husband and I stayed at this resort from November 23-30. We booked a last minute charter from Toronto. It was our first time staying at an Adult Only Section. It was amazing. Very organized when we arrived. We were given our room key and information on the transfer to the hotel. The resort consists of three section: Bavaro, Punta Cana and Ambar. Ambar being the Adult Only and probably the top end of the three. I cannot say enough good things. We have traveled to many places but this has to be the best beach any where. Crystal clear water, powder white sand and miles and miles to walk with so many palm trees. Service was wonderful in the Ambar. We did not eat at the Italian restaurant but ate twice at the Gourmet (loved the lobster). We ate at the Dominican in the Bavaro section but did not like.The drinks at the main lobby bar were delicious. Top shelf liquor was included. Service was great. The landscaping was breath taking. Our room was one of the largest we have ever had. So comfortable. Had a real KING size bed...not two beds pushed together. Make sure you take advantage of the pillow menu. I loved the aromatherapy one. The buffet was wonderful. Never did we get bored. Guest services was always friendly and ready to help. The shows at night were better than what we have experienced at other resorts. There you will actually realize how large the complex is.I actually enjoyed riding around on the little shuttle that takes you here and there. How could you not....the grounds were amazing. There is a section (sort of like a little village) it has shops and vendors. Also has a house band at night which is very enjoyable.Only one complaint.....the pool water was cool. However, when the sun was not at its peak...the water felt fine. If you like bright indoor lighting I would bring some old fashioned light bulbs with you. They use those energy savers which send off a different glow. I bought a couple of designer handbags in the hotel gift shop....still hoping they are real.I am very particular and I must say this place is as close to Heaven as you can get.

<Content>Amazing Ambar I've been to 11 different resorts in Mexico, Cuba , and Punta Canaand this is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review. The Ambar section of the Gran Bahia was perfect. The rooms were big, clean and most important everything worked. The mini bar was refilled to the brim everyday, and soaps, towels and t.p. were a plenty.The beach was huge and very well kept, never a line-up at the beach bar either. Do get your towel on your favorite lounger early though.I'm not a pool guy when you have such a great beach to lounge on but the Ambar pool was up to par with any others I have seen.The buffet was great and the al a cartes were excellent.Ambar guests enjoyed premium drinks as well as all of the other facilities of the two other resorts.The best thing about this resort had to be the staff. Other 5 star resorts I've been to were never as friendly or professional. All of the staff ,managers to gardeners, never waited for you to say hi, before they greeted you. Ramon in the buffet was great, not only was his service supurb but he also hand delivered a bottle of wine to our room on our last night there. Also gave us some coffee to take home, little gestures that make a big impact.The fact that we had perfect weather for the whole week didn't hurt either.I don't like to go back to the same place twice but I would make an exception for the Ambar

<Content>A few words for the tennis fans Hi everybody, my wife and I have just returned from Bahia Principe last night, after spending one splendid week at The Ambar Resort. Prior to our departure, I have read the most recent reviews and must say they reflect the truth quite accurately, however I remember looking for some info on the tennis courts at the time and being unable to find any; therefore I'm back here now for that precise reason.Well, the tennis courts for this resort are located at its border furthest from the beach (so if you reside at The Ambar, it's a 20 minutes walk). The courts are not lit and their quality is rather poor (cracked and repaired and then cracked some more). By the way, there are a basketball court and a grass mini-soccer field neighbouring the tennis courts as well). Since I did not have a tennis partner, I tried finding one through the hotel reception - that was a waste of time. I ended up playing the club pro several times. I am a level 3.5 - 4 myself, but never before have I beaten a pro, these guys are usually ex-pro tennis players or coaches... well, not the case with Pascal. He is OK and will send you the ball back a couple of times, but that's about it.Last but not least, for those interested, there are no court charges and they even provide racquets and balls free of charge, although of poor quality. Myself, I brought my own and I'd do it again, but hey, it saves some space in your suitcase if you're not picky. You do have to book the courts in advance though, otherwise you may walk all the way there and not find a court available.So if I had to summarize the tennis part of my vacation, I would say: It was all right, but nothing to write home about.Have fun!

<Content>Nothing but a great experience Stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar in Punta Cana the week of Nov22/08 which was booked through Air Canada Vacations. Here are some of our observations.1. Checking in was great because it was done on the bus before arrival.2. Resort was very clean and well maintained3. Staff was very friendly4. Beach was beautiful5. Pool was nice6. Rooms were very big and well kept.7. Food was good and had lots of choices8. Sun was hot and drinks were great9. The no kid thing was better than we thought it would be. We love our kids but...The only downside was that we only stayed a week. Next time it will be 2 weeks.

<Content>Wonderful!! We just got back on Nov 29 from our 2 week honeymoon from this resort. Really very nice. If you're going to choose the Gran Bahia Principe in Punta Cana, pick the Ambar as opposed to the other 2 offered on the same resort. It's adults only, much quieter, the rooms are larger and the resort itself is prettier.Almost everyone speaks English if you don't speak Spanish, even the servers and French is widely spoken. Dominicans are extremely polite and friendly.The food was excellent, we only encountered 2 脿 la carte restaurants we didn't enjoy. (El Olivo  El Pescador - over on the Bavaro side) every other 脿 la carte was wonderful. The cuts of meat were great. They always had 3 diff types of meat and 2-3 types of fish to choose for at lunch and dinner for the buffet.The mini-bar is crappy. It was hit or miss. Some days we had 2 beers in there, others 3 or 1. They only offer their local beer which isn't very good at all. The liquor is always the same, rum and vodka and they are tiny little shot bottles. Lots of pop and that's about it. Sometimes we'd get a bag of chips sometimes no snacks at all.The beds are all king size, my husband found them super comfortable if you like firm beds but it did something awful to my back. I hate firm beds. The buttler service is pretty good. You can order food to your room it takes 45 mins to arrive but it's always yummy. Use the pillow service! You have a menu with different types of pillows and you can call everyday to request a diff type of pillow (green apple scented, camomile, memory foam, duck duvet, etc) We had our jacuzzi bath made for us every night after our dinner.Gran Bahia def had the nicest beach. We walked towards both ends and were disgusted at how badly kept some of the beach areas were and how erroded they had their beaches. If you're looking to party, don't stay at the Ambar side, it's really quiet except for the piano bar in the evening until 11pm when everything shuts off. For the party you must go to the main resort Bavaro for the nightly entertainment (go on Monday night for the Michael Jackson show - EXCELLENT!). After 11pm you can go to Pueblo Principe which is still within the complex it's like a mini downtown with a flea market, stores, a stage with a house band, drinks are still included and a nightclub that is pretty happening with salsa and merengue music (we went once but found it a bit of a meat market).Buy some larimar! the prescious stone only found in the DR it's gorgeous! barter your prices with the flea market employees!2 weeks was totally worth it!!

<Content>Not good for vegetarians I'll start with the positives, the landscaping is beautiful.The buffet was okay for my companion (my mom) but often lacking in any protein for me (vegetarian). We originally booked the royal golden and were upgraded to Ambar so we had 4 reservations. 1st - the mediteranian is disgusting, don't go. there was nothing i could eat besides the salads at the buffet and my companions steak was undercooked so she sent it back and they butchered the steak before retuning it to her over cooked.2nd - the italian it was okay but italian is hard to mess up3rd - mexican by now I was feeling ill so I wasn't completely appreciative of the environment. The guacamole was good, con queso very mild, nachos okay. They offered a vegetarian quesadilla for me (which wasn't on the menu) it had carrots and onions. It wasn't really my taste but at least they offered.4 - japanese was fun. the cook put on a bit of a show for us and the staff were great, they brought us veggie sushi and veggie tempura, they were very accommodating. Probably the nicest service at the a la carte restaurants.Room service was okay. We did leave a tip each day but often the mini bar was only 1/2 filled or we only had some towels and not others (ie. no hand towels one day and no face cloths others).We had a leak in the roof which dripped right over the toilet so we ended up having to put a towel over our heads to use the facilities. We called several times on sunday and monday (we arrived late saturday) but no one showed up to fix it until thursday. even then nothing seemed to be done as it was still dripping. i found this absolutely disgusting.the beach was gorgeous, pool was lovely. we booked through air transat who was ridiculous about everything so I will not be using their services again.Also I would suggest you speak some spanish as very few of the employees speak any english.all in all very pretty but not really worth the hassle

<Content>Fantastic holiday !!!!!! We just returned from the Ambar resort, we were there from Nov 15-22/2008, and it was fantastic. Check in was smooth and easy and our room was great. I had e-mailed down our room requests and we recieved everything that we had asked for. The resort is very very clean and beautiful, from the rooms to the grounds, pools, beach etc. We had read the reviews before going and did have some concerns, but once we arrived there it was hard to believe what people complain about. The beach is beautiful, clean, wavey, lots of lounge chairs and sun huts for shade, very windy but it was nice as it was very hot. The pool is a good size, swim up bar good, seats were rough so we just swam around with our drinks. Lots of loungers there too both in the sun and shade. Restaurants: We pre-booked all of our ala cart dinners over the internet before arriving and would suggest this to everyone, this way you get what you want. Maria was fabulous for doing this and she arranged a special dinner for my husband's birthday with champange, balloons in our room etc. We enjoyed Portifino's and The Garden Grill the best. The beach BBQ was not very good, very windy and smokey as they grill your food for you and the selection was not that great. The Don Pablo Gourmet restaurant was disapointing as well, although the food was good the portions were very small. The buffet in the main lobby was really good, the men do need to wear t-shirts in her for breakfast and lunch, ladies you can wear whatever you want.The shows were good not fantastic but we enjoyed the few we saw. The resort is large as you can use the other bahia properties but there are lots of shuttles to take you where ever you want to go. The white wine at the hotel is horrible, we added sprite to it and made spritzers, much better after that, it is as dark as the beer. The Japanesse restaurant was fantastic they cook infront of you and you get to try all of it.The Dominican people do not speak english well so it was difficult trying to figure somethings out, the coffee is also very strong but if you add bailey's to it it is much better.The rooms are very nice, showers had lots of pressure and hot water. We were in building 67 closest to the beach and the pool, we had a oceanview from our balcony. I would suggest building 67,64, we were on the 3rd floor, there are no elevators but they deliver and pick up your bags for you so it was not bad at all. We had no problems with any bugs in the rooms or anywhere on the property, no flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches etc.The main lobby is very popular at night as it is a great place to enjoy drinks, music. The resort is very quite during the day a little too quiet for us , if you want music, games etc you have to go over to the bahia punta cana or bavaro. The casino is small, disco didn't open until midnight. The market they have is great for shopping as you can barter with the people or you can walk down the beach to the market. We did both the beach market is great and probably about a 30-40 minute walk depending on how fast you walk. The spa's are nice but you can only use then if you book a treatment and some of them are pricey, we didn't use the spa's but we did go in them for tours to check them out. The pillow menu is great, you have to try the green apple and camomille pillows. Phone from your room and remind them as it took us a couple of days to get the first ones, then they arrived quicker after that. Tipping goes a long way down there and really does get you better service. We tipped the maids, bartenders and they really do look after you after that, it's amazing what a few dollars can do a couple times a week. Feel free to e-mail me if you need any more info or e-mail addresses for Maria in guest services, she does a great job!! Enjoy your holiday I now we certainly did !!!!!!!

<Content>Superb! From the moment we entered the lobby of the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar, we knew our vacation was going to be great. This is a beautiful hotel, elegant and inviting. Our room was a junior suite facing the ocean and pool, with a king canopy style bed tastefully decorated with Caribbean flavour. On our large size balcony, we spent many late nights listening to the ocean waves beat along the shore, while palm trees swayed in the warm tropical night air. It truly was paradise. This hotel is part of the Gran Bahia Principe complex. Other hotels in this complex are the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro, the Punta Cana and the Premier Club. Your wristband allows you to use all the facilities at each hotel. A golf -cart style bus runs throughout this complex and will take you to the lobbies of each hotel. This runs until 3.00am. Each hotel is beautiful. The Ambar is adult only so it is quiet and although the Dominican Republic spirit exists, it is low key as you will notice with the staff. f you want the full blown Domincian dance, party experience, you will find this at the Gran Bahia Bavaro, where you will find animators poolside dancing the Bahia Principe theme dance and guests learning the steps. Lots of fun. Poolside at the Ambar you will not hear loud salsa music nor at the beach, it is quiet and the guests are quiet in nature. There is one bar on the beach, few vendors and lots of chaise longues for suntanning as well has huts to sit under. You will find plenty of topless sunbathers. The buffets at all the hotels are excellent, however we found the buffet at the Ambar to be the most outstanding. Also, as part of the vacation package, you are automatically booked into 3 restaurants, choice of Japanese, French Gourmet, Mexican, Steak house which you have the option to change at guest services. The nightly entertainment is held at the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro theatre and is very well choreographed and fun. There is an outdoor salsa, merengue band after the show where you can brush up on your dance steps and there are also shows which involve audience participation, such as the search for Mr. Bahia Principe. There is also a disco which plays popular dance music and is great for all ages.Overall, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The hotel and grounds are impeccable, the beach is beautiful, white sand and turquoise ocean water. There are water sport activities available such as parasailing, kayaks, hobie catamarans, banana boat rides. The staff and service are excellent as well as the food and entertainment. If there is anything extra that you need, a tip is always appreciated. This hotel is definitely 5 star and we highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.

<Content>Loved the Resort My friend and I went in October and it was amazing. The service was excellent, our rooms were very clean. The pool and the beach were excellent too. I cannot say enough about this resort. I went for relaxation and enjoyed every minute of my stay. Meet some amazing people there that were from Canada too. The food was good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to go for a relaxing time. If you wanted entertainment you just had to go next door to the other resorts and there was plenty there. Never had to wait too long for a shuttle.

<Content>Gran Bahia Principe Ambar is AMAZING! We just came back from a week long vacation at the Ambar! Wow, we are very impressed. The food, service and drinks were great. The resort is really very good... Except that they could have done a better job of letting us know what attractions there are on the resort. We didn't know until our third night that we had missed the first shows at 9:45 pm. We were oblivious of all the activities and attractions.Once we found out all the resort had to offer, we were doing much better. The entertainment was phenomenal!Book the Ambar - you won't regret it.

<Content>WOW!!! This is a must-read! My wife and I just returned last night from a one week stay at the Ambar. Definately a 5-star resort!!! The rooms were great...huge marble bathroom with jetted tub, king-size bed, dining area, couch and a very well functioning air conditioner. There was also a ceiling fan that really helped to circulate the cold air from the a/c. Foodwise, the buffet was pretty standard stuff, we strongly suggest doing dinners at the a la carte restaurants at the Ambar and on the Bavaro side. Make reservations early as they book quickly (the one saving grace is that even if they are full and no more reservations left, go anyways and you'll almost always get in as many people with reservations just don't show up. NOTE TO ALL MEN--- No sleeveless shirts at the buffet for breakfast or dinner. I DID find it a little unfair as women were able to go in nothing more than a bikini and a wrap, and I had to put on s sleeved t-shirt. As for dinner, long pants must be worn at dinner....doesn't matter what kind of pants, as long as they're to the ankle.If you do not speak Spanish, PLEASE take the time to at least learn a few pleasantries: Buenas dias/tardes/noches, Hola, Por Favor, Gracias. A little effort goes a long way. There are more than enough self righteous tourists there and the dominicans are phenominal people and don't deserve it. Other than hanging out on the beach or by the pool, there really isn't much going on at the Ambar (in terms of animation) as it is a resort that sells itself on it's tranquility. If you're looking for games, and such, head over to the Bavaro side which is a very short (2 minutes) trolley ride. The trolleys come every 5 minutes so you have access to all the ammenities.This resort is an upgrade from the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro and the Punta Cana so you will get extras here like premium liquors, 24-hour butler service, free mini-bar that gets re-filled daily and a pillow menu. As it is the upgrade, all Ambar residents have access to both the Bavaro and Punta Cana resorts but not vice-versa.There are excurions available from the Tour Operator room beside reception. The 2 that we went on were Outback Safari and Tropical Storm Happy Hour. The safari was fantastic....a full day learning about the country and its people. Touring a rural village, home and coffee/cocoa farm. You will pass by a school and a very good idea would be to bring some pencils/notebooks, etc. to donate to the schoolhouse. The Happy Hour is sold as a snorkeling adventure, bu tis more a party boat with about 45 minutes of snorkeling thrown in for good measure. Good snorkeling for beginners but anybody that has done it before may find it a bit boring.On the Bavaro side, all the action is at the Pueblo Principe. A plaza that houses the casino, outdoor thatre, nightclub and, of course, the infamous vendors. You can't walk 5 feet without a vendor getting in your face telling you what an incredible deal he has for you today. They are very persistent to say the least. They will go as far as pretending that you've already met and pull you in that way. If you're not interested in even looking, put on the sunglasses, look straight ahead and don't stop. I know it sounds rude, but you HAVE to ignore these guys or you'll be there ALL DAY. DO NOT buy their jewellery or cigars. They ARE fake and made from the scraps left over from the real things. If you DO wish to purchase anything from them, do not pay more than 40-50% of the original asking price.There is a jewellery/cigar/rum store in town. It's owned by a Canadian who moved there. I do not know the name of the store, but the Air Canada representative in the Tour Operator room knows who to call. This store will send a driver to come pick you up AND drop you off......NO OBLIGATION! While at the store, check out the Columbian restaurant right nextdoor......excellent food (the best guacamole I've ever tasted)We were very happy with the resort and the people who work there and will be back for sure.

<Content>Had a Great Holiday Overall My husband and I just returned from a one week holiday at Bahia Principe Ambar and overall it was great! There were a few hiccups in the beginning of the week, but they were more than made up for. First, when we arrived, my husband's luggage was mistakenly left at the first hotel the bus stopped at....except once the tour operator found this out he quickly drove my husband back and found the luggage for him and was very helpful....thank God! This was our own fault b/c we shoud have at least looked out the bus window to make sure our luggage wasn't taken out yet.Once we arrived at the Ambar all the staff were more than willing to help, from checking in, taking our luggage, showing us our room and its features....it was a beautiful hotel!! The rooms were BIG, and the bathroom was nice...separate shower and bath tub which was nice...beautiful canopy bed, flat screen tv,......and everything was SUPER CLEAN....I am VERY picky when it comes to cleanliness, but let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised at how clean they kept the rooms and resort itself! Even down to the cutlery and glasses...everything was spotless! The maids were great...we had several extra towels and pillows...they even have a Pillow menu to choose from!!The food was pretty good, especially the a la carte restaurants. The Buffet could have had more variety as it felt like I was eating the same thing some nights, but again, overall it was pretty good.We also had an issue with our door lock, it wasn't working properly. It took some convincing of the front desk staff to send someone to fix it, but they finally did and it was replaced. They felt badly after and sent us up a bottle of rum and T-shirts, which was very nice!. After that, they continued to call our room to see if everything was ok, and we had fruit baskets sent to us a few days after, which was a nice touch!The pool and beach area were breathtaking! It was pretty quiet the week we were there, so you could always find a beach/pool chair and it was very relaxing...no kids and no line-ups for anything! Sometimes it was too quiet at night, but you can just hop on a shuttle bus which takes you over to the other hotels in the complex where they have a theatre, casino etc., which was nice.The staff was VERY friendly and helpful....certain staff members at the front desk seemed a little spacey, but other than that they were fine. The Guest Services staff were also great, and would go out of their way to help you find out info, make reservations etc.Overall, this was the best all-inclusive resort I have stayed at and we would definitely return!

<Content>This is no way a 5 star resort My husband a I booked a 10 day stay at The Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana. This resort was rated as a 5 star Golden Apple Resort. The cost of the airfare and hotel, and transfers totalled 3700.00 for 2 adults.At the time of booking our trip it was never disclosed to us that the front lobby was under construction and that there was a major construction site for additional resort housing going on surrounding this resort. The construction was an on going 24 hours a day -7 days a week . The lobby area at night offering a quite piano bar but instead all we heard was loud air hammering noise . I have attached pictures as documentation to validate the review in hopes this review will help other travelers. We also experienced problems with roaches inside and outside of many of their restraurants. When this was addressed it was stated there are a huge number of other hotels around them and it is hard to control and fumigate the hotel every time. The food certainly did not deserve a 5 star rating - the specialty restraurants were very good. But the common restraurants were not more than a 3 star. If you miss breakfast after 9:30 you will need to wait till 11:30 when the next one opens, no snacks are offered when the restraurants are closed. The rooms were very clean but don't expect anything extra even with a tip- It took 3 days to get washcloths in the room. The refrig. in the rooms can not be turned up and does not keep the beverages cold enough not to need ice. And the air conditioning never gets cold enough that you need to turn it down.The majority of the staff make you feel as though you are more of a bother than a guest. We received a reply from The Gran Bahia regarding the problems we experienced while there and their statement is:regarding the noise issues they do not believe that this would have proved bothersome to these guests due to the discreation of the enterprise . And it is important to point out that the construction does not belong to the Gran Bahia it is a independent management that borders their complex. The Gran Bahia offered us a three day stay as a customer satisfaction offering - now why on earth would I return to this resort for a vacation?The vacation supplier does not accept any responsibility for the actions or ommission of their indepentant suppliers. I hope that you research your vacation resort carefully - this certainly was no vacation.Thank you for taking the time to read this review.

<Content>Warning...take conditioner with you!! Our stay at the Ambar was great, my only suggestion is for anyone going to this hotel to make sure that you take lots of conditioner for your hair with you - it is not supplied. Face clothes were not supplied either. Take a cover up to walk down the beach and also SPF 45 lip balm, the sun is super hot and I was burnt badly on my shoulders and lips within the first 2 days of our trip.

<Content>Better-than-average all-inclusive, but ... Spent ten days in September in the DR and can compare the Bahia Principe Ambar with the Grand Palladium Royal Suites as well as several upmarket Riviera Mayan all-inclusives.The pros: Long and particularly wide stretch of beach with lots of palapas and palm trees for shade that never felt crowded. Beautiful landscaping.Top-notch service in decent restaurants that were really a cut above other all-inclusives where a canteen-atmosphere is often prevalent.Large suites, bathrooms and comfy beds.The cons:Reception staff unfriendly, unhelpful and at times downright rude.Cleaning staff started their day's work yelling and slamming doors at 8.30.Unpleasant sewer smell in one of our bathrooms.Hallways were never properly swept or cleaned and were filthy, with dustballs, squashed insects and rainwater accumulating.Compared to similar all-inclusives, the Ambar has a lot going for it, but housekeeping issues need to be addressed.

<Content>Great hotel!! My booking started off being at the Bahia Principe Bavaro. I wasn't impressed by the food, service and my room. So, after two days, i decided to upgrade to the Ambar. I have to say the Ambar was much better! My rooms was better - the layout is pretty much the same, but they have canapy beds, free alcohol in the mini bar (which is filled every day), and they have someone come ~ 8pm to prepare the bed for bedtime (even put chocolates on your pillow every night! i thought that was a cute touch)The lobby is extremely clean, they have people mopping/sweeping the floors every minute! There is a private pool and beach area (you can also go to the other parts of the Bahia hotel, it's your choice). The Ambar is for adults only, so for me, it was more relaxing. If your prefer to party and be in a loud environement, i would suggest to go to the other parts (Bavaro or Punta Cana sections of the Bahia).I was a little disappointed in the food at the buffet, not many different tastes, a lot of the food was bland. i due suggest you try out the 脿 la carte restaurants. the French and Japanese were my favorites.The beach was great! The water, at the Ambar, is even better then at the Bavaro section! Unfortunetaly for me, it rained most of the week, so i didn't really get to sit on the beach very much - Once you're down there, there's not much you can do about the weather... If you like excursions (again cause of the weather i couldn't do very many), there's one called Tropical storm, it was created by Canadians, so the guide speaks English, French  Spanish. I found it easier to understand, everywhere else, they speak mainly Spanish. It's a boat tour that includes snorkeling, lunch and lots of FUN! I really enjoyed it.To finish, besides the weather the hotel was great :)

<Content>WOW !!! Absolutely Amazing Myself and my husband have just returned from a two weeks stay in Bahia Principe Ambar. We had initially booked with Thompsons and were given the Punta Cana section of the hotel but when we got there yes it was beautiful but we decided that as this may be our last trip to the Dom Rep for a few years we would like a little luxury - not that there was anything wrong with Punta Cana.We had the most spectacular time and we could not fault this resort one bit. We had no complaints whatsoever, the staff could not do enough to help, you everyone was freindly and plesant. We do speak very little Spanish and we were always understood but that staff do appreciate when you try, after all we are in thier country.I would recommed an upgrade to the Ambar - but do wish to add that we did not see much of the Bavaro and Punta Cana sides of the resorts so I am slightly biased - if we were to ever get the chance to travel back to this resort we would upgrade as we just felt it was such a luxury. Ambar guests have an exclusive pool which is so relaxing as it is adults only - but you can also use any of the other pools at the resort if you wanted to join in the games, exclusive restaurants - which do need to be pre-booked at the resort some are exclusive to Ambar and some are used by all of the resort there was a perhaps more rushed atmosphere in the shared restaurants as they of course had more people to seat but the quality of food was not compromised in either, room service included, a fantastic room, a greater choice of all inclusive drinks in the Ambar Lobby, the buffet to be used by the Ambar guest is more like a restaurant and the food in all the restaurants was the best I have ever had on an all inclusive package - in fact it is probably the best food I have ever had!!!I could go on forever detailing the luxury of this resort but all I can say is just go there and experience it for yourself - I did read many negative reviews after having booked and was concerned, but all I can say is that some people go with the intention of not liking the place before they get there and are determined that they are going to find something to complain about, all I can say is that they must lead a very sad life as this place was fantastic - treat people how you expect to be treat yourself and go with the intention of having a wonderful time and you will.If you have any questions please feel free to e-mail me as I appreciate that my review is not as detailed as most I am happy to answer any questions or queriesenjoy:-) ;-)

<Content>Horrible experience My husband and I got back from our honeymoon on Sunday, and boy were we glad to get out of there! Our trip was awful! We stayed at the Bahia Principe Ambar in Punta Cana, which is supposedly a 5-star resort. *snort* yea right.I'll start at the beginning.We arrived Sunday at the Bahia Principe Bavaro lobby and we're told to get out. Those of us at the Ambar resort are told to get off here. So, get off, and I go to stand in line. After waiting through the line, I'm told that we're at the wrong place, we need to go to the Ambar lobby, but the buses can't go there, so take the trolly. Yea, thanks for telling us *rolls eyes* Fine. Whatever. We go to the lobby. But, our rooms aren't ready, so we're told to go eat lunch and come back. We do, room still not ready. By this point, we'd have been up for 30 hours travelling and we really want our room! Finally, we get our room. We explore, it's all good.While unpacking on Monday, we realize the safe isn't working, so when we go back to the main building for orientation we tell reception. They say call Express Service and someone will come help. Fine. Back to the room. Phone doesn't work. I go back to the lobby and say the phone isn't working. They call someone. By the time I get back to the room someone has fixed the safe, and they say they'll fix the phone while we are out for the day. Off to the beach (which is beautiful, BTW). That night, we want to order room service, but guess what: the phone isn't working! I go back to the desk *again* and explain the situation and ask when it will be fixed. They call someone, but no one comes. Go back in the morning, phone finally fixed Tuesday.When we checked in, I showed our marriage certificate and asked for the honeymoon package. I was told to worry about that later, and that I should tell Guest Services. We do. Monday during orientation, I tell the Air Canada rep and she says she'll handle it. We book a tour for snorkeling and lobster dinner on Wednesday, and we are good to go!Wednesday rolls around and Ike is on the doorstep. So the weather is crappy and the tour is cancelled. Fine, whatever, weather happens. We rebook for Friday, since that's when the english tours are, and we do our own thing.Friday rolls around and we wait to be picked up for the tour. And wait. And wait some more. Finally we go ask at the desk, and they say talk to Guest Services and send us on a goose chase around the resort. Very frustrated, we return to our room and call the AC rep. Turns out, our reservation was lost. Even though we spoke with the tour people directly to rebook, they lost our reservation. *** ***ity ***.We go to the pool bar and get drunk, since we're in pretty foul moods. Then back to the room. My husband decides to go ask about our honeymoon package. He talks to a lady at Guest Services:D: What is happening with our honeymoon package??GS: oh, you have to book 24 hours in advance, so we can come prepare your jacuzzi, etc.D: umm, we booked on Sunday, it's Friday. When will it happen?GS: oh, we could do it tonight, if you like?D: sure. We're going out for supper, it'll be ready after that?GS: yup, for sureD: sweetAfter supper, nothing. My husband storms off to the lobby and asks WTF? Asks to speak to a manager. Explains the situation to the manager. The manager says GS told him 24 hours. Hubby says no, she's lying, she told me today. Then he realizes GS is standing beside him, so he apologizes for loosing his temper, but says he rather frustrated and wants answers. GS tells him *** you.*blink*in front of the manager.who does nothing.*blink*blink*In addition to all this, the resort buildings are falling apart, there are cracks everywhere, including 1 to 2 inch cracks in the ceiling. So many rooms (not ours, at least) flooded. The finishing work is crap, it's like they don't care. Which I doubt, they just want the buildings done so they can start making money.Also, the staff all over the resort was very rude. We smiled, were polite and tipped, but it got us no where. We couldn't speak spanish, and because of that, we were treated like ***. At the lobby bar, we couldn't get served by the waitress. She came by once, we ordered drinks, hubby gave her a big tip, and she NEVER CAME BACK! She avoided our table all night.We never want to go back to the Dominican again. We were so glad to be home. I just wish it hadn't been our honeymoon that was ruined.

<Content>Beautiful resort, but experience was lacking My husband was a groomsman at his friend's wedding at the Grand Bahia Principe Bavaro on Saturday, Aug. 23. We arrived in Punta Cana on 8/22, and checked into the Bavaro section. After speaking with some of the other wedding guests, we decided to pay the extra $30/night to upgrade to the Ambar section. It seemed to take the desk clerk forever to figure out how to make this happen. He was very pleasant, but it really took quite awhile. At first, he undercharged us by $10 and wanted to run my credit card again. Instead, I just paid the $10 in cash, and this transaction took another length of time. Transferring our belongings from our room in the Bavaro section to the Ambar section, checking in at Ambar (they have their own lobby and reception desk), and getting to our new room took almost another hour.The resort is HUGE- it is actually 3 resorts in one. There are shuttle busses that take you from point to point, but they are rather infrequent, and it is hard to determine which bus is the correct one. Likewise, the lobby in the Bavaro section and in the Punta Cana section look almost identical, which only added to the confusion.The room in Ambar was lovely, and the bed was very comfortable. Housekeeping was good as well. 2 beach towels were provided daily, as were robes and slippers. The mini-refrigerator came stocked with bottled water, soft drinks, and 2 beers.Aside from front desk staff and a few of the wait staff, most of the employees did not speak English. Many of the staff also expected to be tipped, which I have never experienced at an all-inclusive resort. The pools were very nice, but we were very disappointed that there was no music at the Ambar pool and that it closed at 6pm. Likewise, the bar at the Ambar section closed at 11pm. We didn't quite understand the point of having an adult-only section where everything closed so early. We brought our iPod and speakers to the pool one day and were asked to turn it off. The disco/nightclub was a disappointment. Besides only being open from 12a-2a, the dj played mostly local music (salsa, merengue), that wasn't very conducive to dancing, unless you were partner-dancing. Eventually, the dj played more dance music. We only ate at the snack bar once, and the buffet for breakfast and one dinner meal. The Italian restaurant had a pre-arranged meal for the wedding party on Saturday night. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a large variety of items, made to order eggs and smoothies. The dinner buffet was disappointing, though. Moreover, we all (wedding party and guests) have been suffering with GI issues since our return. I guess something we ate at the resort didn't agree with us.Overall, we probably would not return to the hotel. It was ok, but not lively enough for us.

<Content>Horrible Keep your eyes on your things at all times!!!!My Ipod, cell phone, camera, video camera, and cash were stolen within the first hour at the hotel. I left my bag on the golf cart that drove us to our room for no more than 2 minutes by the time i ran out the room to look for the guy he was gone and my bag was gone. Not only my electronics but my passport was there as well. My bag was returned within the hour with my passport but everything else was gone. The hotel took no responsibility and said they would investigate but its been 3 weeks and nothing. Now i come to find the person who stole it used it to call people in punta cana. I dont know if anyone has had a similar experience and could help me out. Is the hotel liable to some degree for my stolen items?

<Content>Hit or miss, mostly miss This is what I liked; Nice grounds, nicely appointed lobby, peaceful. Room for improvement;Transport - The resort is an add on to the other two Grand Bahia so is quite spread out, necessitating the transport trolley to move you about to areas like the entrance of Grand Bahia. The trolleys are infrequent and often don't have enough seats for the people waiting. I walked to the stop before Ambar so that I could guarantee a ride, but still waited an average of 10 minutes. When we were checking in and were delivered to the wrong area, it took 30 minutes (total) of waiting and transport time to get us to the correct lobby. Rooms - They have some nice materials but the finish is a bit slap-dash with poor quality. It would drive me mad to have such quality in my own home but really not an issue for a short vacation.Food - I only ate at the buffet. We did try to eat at the a-la-carte restaurants one night but since we didn't have a reservation, they wouldn't seat us, even though the restaurants were only a quarter full. You have to make reservations in advance, but (frustratingly) they won't let you make a reservation for two hours later, even if they have the space - Most annoying and really speaks to the resort being more concerned with their own procedures than customer convenience.At the buffet the food was as you would expect - everything overcooked and unexciting. You also have to wear long pants. I feel that at the buffet they could make this an exception.Bar - The only bar is in the lobby and we were going to have a drink there, but the atmosphere was poor - the entertainer was a guy with an electronic type piano that had drums etc. - a corny orchestra in a box. We ended up going to one of the other Grand Bahia lobby bars that actually had some atmosphere.The Butler service is just room service - You call, they bring you something. Not a bad place but since it is marketed as its premier resort, you expect more.

<Content>Would spend my money elsewhere Although the trip was not terrible, I would not recommend this resort or island. There are many other beautiful places in the world to visit. The resort is large - seperated in 3 sections: 1) punta cana, 2) bavaro, 3) ambar (adults only). We booked the bavaro but were placed in the ambar section. Apaprently according to the mangement, it is just the luck of the draw of how you are placed in the resort - so there is no point in paying the extra for Ambar as the 4 other couple we traveled with were all also placed in Ambar. We had a corner jr. suit which was very spacious but had a mustly basement smell. The Ambar section bracelet allows you go go to all sections of the resort but they try to limit you to only the ambar section - I called to make dinner reserveations at a resutrant in the bavaro section and I was told I cannot. But then I went to the Bavaro lobby and placed the reservation in person with out a problem. Besides for these logistics which are common for an all inclusive resort, the aspect of the vacation that drives this review was the staff. The employees rarely smiled, rarely spoke with you or said hello. And if they did it seemed forced. It was a little ackward. I would not recommend even tipping the employees because that did not guarantee any better service (except for the maid - she was great and friendly). Also if planning to travel, ensure to bring all denominations of USD or pay with credit card. The hotel and its shops never have change. Also bring extra sun block as they charge $25-$30 per bottle at the resort shops. The beach and pools were nice.

<Content>Beautiful Resort We returned yesterday from the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar. We had a great time and we thought we would share our feedback. We were in Villa 67 which overlooked the Ambar pool. It was right beside the pool, steps from the beach and beside 3 restaurants which made it very convenient. We rarely had to go anywhere else. It was very handy in the morning since you needed to be at the pool by 8 am (it opens at 8) in order to get a spot by the pool under a Palapa. People were there reserving their chairs with their towels. If you needed shade around the pool, it was necessary. If you arrived by 8:15, it was too late. The only chairs left available were in direct sun. If that is your thing then not to worry. Lots of those to be had all day, but we are fair skinned and need the shade our we would have been burnt terribly. The service was good most of the time. We had a problem with our safe and had to wait a while for that to be rectified since only one person has access to the keys. Overall the food was good, especially for a resort in the Carribean. The buffets have lots of choice. The Garden Grill was the best a la carte restaurant by far. Grilled meats (rib-eye, ribs, chicken, pork etc). The Don Pablo Gourmet was good as well. We had the Lobster tails and the lobster cannaloni. The Filet Mignon was big and good, but under cooked. We normally eat steak medium-rare, but we ordered it medium just in case. It came rare. The next time we ordered steak we ordered it medium-well and it came medium-rare which was perfect for us. Very tasty. The seafood restaurant (El Pescador) wasn`t very good. We ended up leaving it after tasting our main dish and went to the buffet. The buffet has roasted meat (prime rib, pork etc ) every night. They even had grilled lobster one night, but they don`t know how to cook it properely. It was raw inside. We took it back to have them ccok it more, but it was still not cooked in the middle so we gave up on that. Just ask them to leave it on the grill for a long time.Overall we ate very well. Lots of selection so you won`t go hungry, but remember you are in the third world and not in Canada or the US. The standards just aren`t the same. We generally had good service in the restos. Someone was always refilling our glasses and they were very nice. The beds were comfortable and the the room was clean and well-maintained. The Ambar is the adults only part of the resort so it is less crowded and quieter. My husband found it very relaxing. I did as well, but I missed the action you would normally get around the pool. No music blaring poolside, no activites. You needed to go to the other part of the resort and the other pool for that. The Ambar lobby was nice, but everything shut down at 11pm. No bar, no food, no entertainment. You needed to go to the other part of the resort for the action. The disco was fun and quite large for a resort. The village (Puelbo) had some shopping and there were 2 theatres. The mini-bus that went around the resort was useful, but you could also walk. It was about a 10 min walk between the Ambar and the main resort area. Everywhere was very hot (except the rooms) The restaurants were hot, if there was air-condtionning in them you couldn`t feel it. We were sweating at meal-time but it was August so I guess that is to be expected. It would have bee nice to sit down for a meal and out of the heat. The free room-service was a nice option.The food was OK, not great but the convenience was nice. They will absolutely NOT let men into any of the restaurants at night without long pants. My husband went the first night to the buffet in very nice long kaki shorts, belt and golf shirt, but was turned away. He hated having to wear pants everynight at dinner since it was so hot, but those are the rules! However, ripped jeans, ratty shirts and very, very short skirts were OK. I couldn`t quite figure that out but whatever. The drinks were good, the resort was immaculate and we had a lovely time overall. We were nervous about the weather since it is hurricane season, but the sun was shing everyday. It was very hot and humid all the time so we stayed in the water most of the day. We found it too hot to do much else, but we went there to relax and we did. I would definately return to this resort and I would recommend it! We are somewhat experienced travellers (we are 34 years old) and are comparing this experience to Mexico - Cancun (Blue Bay), Cuba (Brisas del Caribe), Jamaica, St, Lucia (Coconut Bay) and Punta Cana (Grand Palladium). I hope this info will help you! Happy travelling!

<Content>Still confused but chilled out The surroundings are stunning. The beach is amazing. The weather was so hot. We had a marvellous time all in all. However, I can relate to some of the negative reviews here. Some staff were rather rude and unhelpful, but we made the effort to be cheerful with them and the next day the same staff could be smiling and very attentive. It was quite random. Sometimes you got water and drinks immediately. Sometimes you didn't get any. They seemed to make up the rules as they went along. Because we were upgraded from Punta Cana to Ambar when we arrived, I had to travel to Punta Cana to sort some things out (like the safe), and Ambar for other things. It was confusing. We were able to use any of the buffet restaurants and snack bars, but sometimes they took our room number, sometimes not. There didn't seem to be a policy, sometimes they let you in, sometimes not. When I asked at Ambar reception the man told me that we could use Ambar buffet and snack bars, but all the others we had to make a reservation. This was bizarre, and not at all what had happened, but I decided not to argue with him. One night we went to Bavaro lobby and there was a huge crowd pushing and struggling to get in to the buffet restaurant. It was pretty stressful. We turned around and went somewhere else, glad that as Ambar guests we had that option. Not sure what happened there. My boyfriend and brother-in-law had a really odd experience when they tried to book on a banana boat. They were fobbed off and left standing around for over an hour while other people got on the boats. When they gave up, I decided to go and enquire about it myself. Immediately they were booked on the next boat. Really, really confusing! We couldn't lock our ground floor balcony door - it was broken. Out of sheer apathy we didn't report it. It turned out to be just as well, because they deactivated our key cards early on our last day and it was handy to be able to break in so we could finish packing. We booked on the speed boat trip. It was terrifying. We didn't realise till we got back that our speedboat was broken. That explains why it was so erratic. The man didn't seem to care when we told him. I'm just glad we didn't hit any swimmers. Having said that the snorkelling was wonderful. The sea so warm and the fish so pretty. The mini golf was a great little course. I could have stayed on that all day. The bars all closed very early (11pm the latest). That actually didn't bother us because we were there for a chilled out holiday and in bed by midnight every night, but I think it would have bothered us normally. We all got violently ill with the worst diahorrea I have ever had - super super painful stomach pain. As I write this I am waiting for the results of the tests my doctor ordered. I just read this back and I realise that I've made it sound dreadful. The truth is that the surroundings were that beautiful, the beach that glorious, the pool that lively and fun, the food that tasty that none of the above mattered. We came back completely chilled out, totally relaxed, gloriously tanned and that's exactly what we went for. I'm still completely confused by the Dominican Republic behaviour, but decided not to worry about it.

<Content>Diarrhia Alert!!! If you enjoy being in a tropical setting with diarrhia,stomach cramps,nausea and vomitting this place is for you. Although the resort is beautiful and the breach is very nice it's a poor tradeoff for the abdominal torture you will experience. Beware of the food you eat!!! It's day three of my return and still have the runs!!! I have travelled to many Carribean islands and never experienced anything like this. I was very careful with what I ate and still got sick!! Definitely not a five star hotel would give this resort a 3 star rating! In closing this resort is not as clean as it looks. If you have health problems stay away and if you are healthy stay away as well as you will have health problems.Woodbridge,Ontario

<Content>It's all a matter of opinion... We were booked to stay 7 nights at Ambar, but requested to be moved after two nights. This resort is not at all what we expected and we were overall disappointed. The experiences we had while there definately didn'tt fit in with the image that is given of the resort in their website or brochures.This is an add on resort to two others, Gran Bahia Punta Cana and Gran Bahia Bavaro, both of which are very family friendly. When you are at either of these two locations, you will be around alot of kids - sort of a theme park atmosphere - it is loud, busy and hectic. With there only being three a la cart restaurants and no nightly entertainment at Ambar - you will go to these other resorts. Be prepared.One huge disappointment for me was the service. The pool area, for example, gets littered with the used 8 oz disposable plastic cups that the drinks and beer are served in, I didn't see anyone picking up the area. Another example, we returned to our room after a day at the beach/pool - about 5:30 pm and our room was only partially cleaned, bed part way made, pillow cases not on the pillows, no ashtrays or trashes emptied - when I tracked down a maid - she followed me up only to put pillow cases on the pillows and left without another word. The Butler - really this is a joke. On our initial arrival to the room, I called him, he came up - we requested a bottle of rum, ice and he brought some back, we gave him a large tip - and he said he would take care of us during our stay -- we never saw him again -and I looked.We only ate at two a la cartes, the Mediteranean and the Gourmet - both service was really slow --- (there probably weren't 10 tables of people at either place during our meal), the food was not good. The buffets were ok, and if we hadn't left the resort, that is where we would have probably had the rest of our meals.The only real bar at Ambar is the lobby bar. The service was good here and they served drinks in real glasses, not the 8 oz Dixie cups they use at the pool. The swim up bar has seating only in the water. The beach bar, has no seating - just a walk up serving counter.The rooms are fine - they all have a small balcony or porch with plastic furniture. The beach has nice sand and an easy rolling surf - it is very busy. The beach that is closet to the water is public --- not adult only - keep that in mind.If you have been to other resorts like Couples, Sandals, Excellence, etc and enjoyed your experience there and are now considering going to Ambar - I'd definately rethink your decision.You may think I am being overly critical - I used to think that when I was reading all of the reviews when I was preparing form my trip - but I'm not. There is more --- and if you want more details you can send a message.

<Content>READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE THE REST! I just returned from Gran Bahia Principe in Punta Cana (literally yesturday). Before I went on this trip with my boyfriend I, like i'm sure many of you read the reviews posted (especially the bad ones) and to be honest after reading them I did not want to go. HOWEVER I AM SO GLAD I DID. We booked the trip for Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana. Upon arriving we were automatically upgraded to Gran Bahia Principe Ambar (which is within the Punta Cana resort) but it is the highest level of luxury. We were allowed to eat at all the restaurants and buffets and everything was included. Our room was literally just feet from the pool and beach. It was absolutely amazing! Contrary to the others that have reviewed there were only a handful of things that were negative (but nothing serious!) Almost all the members of the staff there were extremely friendly and eager to help. Over our 6 day stay there were only 3 staff members that were rude ( a waitress, a hostess, and a cashier at the lobby giftshop) Other than that the staff acted as if they wanted to become your best friend. The only other thing that were negative was El Olivio (the Mediterranean Rest.- only about 5 things offered on the menu and none of them tasty). The grounds, pool, beach, and rooms of the resort are absolutely gorgeous (and believe me I am VERY picky) and contrary to what others say it would be a mistake to go to Punta Cana and stay anywhere else. I cannot wait to go back.P.S. I highly recommend the Buffets, all of them had a huge selection for both breakfast and dinner and it was all tasty.

<Content>Gorgeous Beach! My husband and I booked this vacation last minute. Definitely something I would do again. We were looking for somewhere quiet and relaxing and were not dissapointed in our choice. We were there the week of July 11 - 18. Weather was beautiful, hot and sunny everyday with a nice breeze off the ocean. I will break down as much as I can. I used this website when booking our vacation so I hope this will help someone else with booking theirs. Check- inCheck-in went relatively smoothly. They bring your bags right to your room so there is no lugging your bags around the resort. If you are staying at the Ambar side (no children) then you will be shuttled to the resort. Not a big deal at all. RoomRoom was very good. Clean and quite large. Loved the washroom nice big shower and big soaker tub with jets. The staff did a great job at keeping it clean. I would always keep everything valuable in your safe. Nothing was ever stolen but staff is coming in and out of your room while you aren't there. Everyday we got some pringles which we liked for a snack at the pool. If you are picky about your hair drier bring your own. The bathroom will require an adapter but the plugs in the rest of the room won't. So its not necessary. FoodFood was okay. My hubby and I are relatively picky healty eaters and there was lots for us to chose from. Roasted chicken, salads, fruits, egg white omlettes, fish, steak, and veggies. We are not exotic eaters and like to stick with what we know. Same goes with drinks. We are not big drinkers and maybe had a glass of wine with our A la Carte dinners. The A la Carte meals were pre-booked for you and you get the times and dates at check in. If you want to change it do it soon cause they book fast! Pool/beachBoth were great! Pool was very clean and nice and warm. Seemed like a lot of people just liked to chill and relax in the pool. My hubby enjoyed doing laps all day but that's just him. There are huts for shade around the pool, but you had to get up early to get them. We lucked out one day, but missed out the rest of the stay. You can usually always get a lounge chair though. I didn't mind, there was a nice breeze off the ocean and if I got hot I would just jump in the pool. The beach was gorgeous! Clean blue water and white powder sand. You could always find shade around on the beach just not right up close to the water. Waves weren't high or strong just perfect enough for swimming. ServiceService was okay. Everyone was nice and polite. But they seemed under staffed at times. You would have to wait a while at the bar or for water at your table. It would have been nice for them to have a self serve water and pop machine at the buffet.ActivitiesIf you are staying at the AMbar there is not that much to do. Very quiet (which is what we liked) but you have complete access to the other side (Bavaro and Punta Cana) where you will find shows and markets, and discos. We visited the market and saw some shows. The shows were okay, something to do. Be careful of the market they are out to scam you. Buyer beware!We took one excursion snorkeling (Marquairiam I think it was called) not great or worth the money. Spoke to some girls that did the dune buggies and horse back riding and sounded like it was better. Take a look at whats out there. Over all it was great. Our shower wasn't working and they had someone to fix it instantly. They tried to please you the best they could. Nice little extras like 24 hour room service and pillow service. We used the gym everyday. The gym is low end stuff but gets the job done. Some treadmills, bikes, ellipticals and weight machines with free weights. Like I said it got the job done and you can make the best of what they had. There were constant shuttles taking you from Ambar to the other sides and back. Men you have to wear long pants to dinner in all the restaurants! They are very picky on this. Check out went smoothly. Be sure to pack a book or something for the airport. We had to wait almost 3 hours to board our plane. Well I think that's it. Have fun! Hope this review helped and if you have any question please feel free to email me. Take care,

<Content>Never Again I have to say that this was not what we expected.Dont go for the food, for the service or if you think its adults only.You have to wear wristbands to identify you because this resort is connected to 2 other resorts (the Gran Bahia Bavaro  Punta Cana). We expected adults only, well kids just walk over from the other resort and take a dip. You can hear children screaming from 25 feet away. Not at all what we wanted. Not romantic. All the events and entertainment are in the Bavaro Section so everyone is invited. Thats right. kids. Dinner reservations are required to eat at a restaurant, otherwise its the buffet. Our dinner reservation for the first night was already made for us. The food was terrible. We ate at the French Don Pablo i think the first night. The service was horrible. When we made the reservation for the second night the only available slot was in the Italian at 8:30. I ordered lasagna and it was so bad, the pasta was half an inch thick, no tomato sauce, and tasted worse than it looked. My husband had the Filet, medium, and it came back burnt with crust cheese. We sent back the plates. Went to the buffet. The service at these restaurants really is not good at all. They have some sort of scheduling system. Like 3 couples at 8:00, They poor water and ask you red or white wine (the wine is cheap $3 bottle, burn a whole in you stomach) then 8:15 waiter shows up takes the orders for all 3 couples one after the other, then food shows up one table right after the other. It felt very mechanical not 5 or 4 or 3 star even. The couple beside us left in the middle of their meal because the food was so bad. We didnt even wait for our dessert. The casino was terrible and the drinks in the casino are not included. There is only one bar in the square and one bartender. There must have been 15 people trying to get his attention.When we decided to leave for an evening to another Casino the cab driver took us another resort in their chain to that casino, The Tower.There were two good parts, the massage by the pool, but you need to go there the day before you want the massage and sign up on the sheet. She gives a great deep tissue.And Pedro at the pool bar. There was only one bartender at a time maybe two if you are lucky. He did what he could.I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to do something romantic and adults only and 5 star service.

<Content>Nice Hotel... great service My husband and I stayed at the Ambar from July 7th to the 10th. Short stay, but it was a fun getaway with three other friends.We arrived and did not get a towel or welcome drink, but the front desk staff was friendly. We went straight to the lobby bar while our other friend checked in. I ordered a Bahama Mama drink... I kept telling my husband that I thought the bartender forgot the alcohol. I was wrong... a few minutes later, finishing the drink, I was sweating more and had a nice buzz going. The mojitos are great. No flavored rum, so I was a bit sad.. but I stuck with mojitos that got the job done. We ate at the buffet in the lobby bar area pretty much every meal. It was decent. Nothing luxurious, but a good variety. We tried to book for the a la carte... they said they couldn't take all five of us at once, so we opted out. Speaking with other couples, they said they ate at the gourmet a la carte (which is supposed to be the best) and it was only 25% full... so a bit peeved about that.I took a tip on another review... I left a note in the fridge (in the room) with a $5 bill and asked for some rum. The maid took my note, my $5 and never left any rum, or any other bonus. O'well, we tried. The pool was nice... got up early and got us all seats. I would really like to see some music by the pool, it was a little too quiet. Very warm water too.We took an ATV tour (Crazy Wheels). It was very boring at the start... everyone going super slow... but we picked it up... I took the spot right behind the guide and had a lot more fun. If you stay at the Ambar, find Johany, the bellboy. He's awesome... he knows where to go outside the resort...Check out Captain Cook's restaurant. I thought it was going to be a lot more dressy... no need for heels. It was outside, on the beach, super fresh food. I had to pick my live lobster I wanted to eat. Get the shrimp cocktail too... awesome!The casino at the resort brought some luck too... sat down for a little black jack and walked away with a hundred bucks... word of caution though... no yelling or being loud. They get mad (you're definitely not in Vegas).The all night hamburger place near the casino has bad food. I guess if you're drunk enough, its okay... but didn't care for it at all.Got a spa treatment too... the bamboo relaxing massage. It was decent. I've had better. All in all, I thought the resort was nice. Would I go back? Probably not... too many places to visit in the world. But it was nice.

<Content>Some staff Lacking in customer service. I am a travel agency owner, who likes to take my staff and venture to various resorts to match specific clientele needs. I stayed one night at the Riu Palace, very typical of all Palace Resorts (I've stayed at several) Best customer service amongst the hotel chains I've come across. Then we stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar for three nights. I had a disagreement immediately about rates with the front desk who presented (after my demanding) a manager, her name was Marta. It was very difficult for me to believe anything she was saying after looking at the tongue piercing jumping in and out of her mouth, extremely unprofessional. A wonderful bellman helped us to our room keep in mind our room was in a Villa very close to the pool (Number 6100) not very close to the main house. It was on the second floor. They do NOT have elevators. So if you have difficulty climbing stairs or pulling luggage up and down stairs, make sure to enquire about a ground floor room.The rooms are beautiful, very accommodating. There are NO OCEAN view rooms at this resort. Four poster bed frames with sheers for privacy. The furniture is very nice, a comfy sofa and nice table and chairs. Bathrooms come with a seperate shower area, a seperate toilet area (both have closing glass doors) and a whirlpool bathtub. Nice sink area and stocked amenities. The refrigerator comes with four bottles of soda, two El Presidente Beers in a can, three water including soda water, drinking and one tonic. They say it will be restocked daily, it was not. The rooms come with coffee maker and all the necessities (including a large bottle of water) to make coffee or tea anytime. In the closet are the pool towels, robes and slippers for all guests. You have a safe with keypad entry. Patio small table and two chairs, they put a candle for you to light. There is also a light inside the sliding glass doors for the patio. The patio does not have open rails, they are enclosed. Just a note, air conditioner requires a room key (bellman inserts one for you) in the controller by the door for the air conditioner, also, it will not kick on if you don't have the patio door tightly closed with the handle downward.The restaurants and food were all very good minimal selection at the Italian and Mediterranean but delicious tasting. Buffet is truly the best option for all meals.Pool area is virtually for couples and honeymooners. They staff the pool bar with one bartender only.You can enjoy a massage near the pool on your way to the beach. Beware of over pricing. I did hear guests complain they only received the basic massage but were charged double for a deep tissue. Make sure you read the bill before you sign it. Beach is wonderful, tons of palm trees to relax under, and plenty of beach loungers (though not as nice as the loungers by the pool, the beach at least has some shade and is much cooler.)Venders walk up and down all day, and are not pushy at all. In fact they usually end up giving you merchandise as a gift! They are really grateful to the tourists coming to their country.There is no beach service for drinks. You can opt to walk back up to the pool bar or go to the beach bar located near the water sports hut. Neither bar is very convenient to beach goers.The service at the Lobby bar is terrible. I sat and watched guest after guest wait twenty minutes in an uncrowded area unnoticed by staff. I witnessed a waitress walk up and ask a client what they would like to drink in Spanish; the guest answered in German and motioned said she didn't speak Spanish. The waitress walked away and cleaned up another table instead of helping them. This is not unusual for this resort. They lack big time in the communication department. Riu staff members speak English no matter what country they are from. They also take classes in German, French, Portuguese, English and others. The beach vendors spoke better English than the staff at this hotel. I don't mean that in a derogatory way, but rather as an observation.Nothing is close to the Ambar. You have to ride the small train to the Bavaro for the nightly shows, the casino, the shopping in the courtyard etc. In fact when you arrive, the cab will drop you off at the Bavaro and you have to take the train (by train I mean a mini truck cab with attached open air cars) to the Ambar to check in.There is no Apple Vacations Rep. at the Ambar. You have to go all the way over to the Punta Cana for that one. And the gentleman behind the desk the day we went was VERY rude which truly surprised me, I've never encountered a rude Apple rep before.The Ambar is adult only, but on the beach are tons of kids from the other Bahias. No one stops them from coming over to the newest, adult only section. So families with three or four kids will be surrounding naked women. Not offensive for some but should be made aware for others.The Good-the food, room layout and maid service were outstanding. The beach was wonderful and well taken care of.The Bad- the staff at Piano Bar (mostly the gentleman in the suit.) Some of the people at the front desk Eusermo and Marta the manager (and her tongue piercing)The Ugly-Tons of small spider/ant like creatures in our room all over the counter, it was very unnerving to see them all over luggage that had to be packed. Water in shower goes down VERY slow so you are standing in a puddle the entire time.Everything shuts down at 11:00pm unless you want to take the 鈥榯rain鈥?to the sister property. Room service is pretty prompt, not a lot of choice but really good.

<Content>Great Vacation Destination! My husband and I arrived in Punta Cana on 07/05/2008. Much to our surprise when entering the Punta Cana Airport we were required to pay a $10 charge per person to enter the country (not a large fee, but something you should know). We did not book transfers to the hotel on this trip, but we easily found a taxi to transport us to the hotel (approx. 30 minutes) for between $35-$40. Upon arriving at the hotel we had no problems checking in and were upgraded to the Ambar section of the hotel. We were originally scheduled to staty in the Punta Cana section, but were upgraded for free. This resort is very large (100 Acres or so) and has four different sections within. The sections are Punta Cana, Bavaro, Ambar, and the Golden Principe Club. The Punta Cana and Bavaro sections are pretty much exactly the same. They have all the normal ammenities (pool, buffet, a la carte restaurants, etc). The Ambar is very similar, but is the adults only section. So the entire Ambar section does not have any children (pool, resaurants, lounges, rooms, etc). The Golden Club I believe is there special top of the line section. I am not 100% sure what that entails. Our overall review of this hotel would be that the rooms are very nice (clean, large, and well equipped), the buffets were very large with a big variety (usually enough variety to satisfy everyone) and the food was decent, the beach was beautiful with white sands, clear blue waters and enough chairs and shade for everyone. The pools were large (very warm) and all had easy access to snack bars and drink bars. We went to three of the a la carte restaurants (Medditerranean, Italian, and Gourmet). Thought we though all were good, the Italian was our least favorite. Final thoughts, there is plenty to do at the resort (though we thoroughly relaxed the whole time). Men will need long pants for all dinners (including the buffets) and shoes or nice sandals. There is a decent language barrier, but can be overcome with persistance ( if you are easily frustrated by this type of thing make sure you have a few key phrases ready to go).

<Content>Beautiful, but not quite a 5 star We visited the Bahia Ambar from June 22-29, 2008. This was our 12th visit to Punta Cana and our first stay at the Bahia chain. Most of the resorts we have stayed at in Punta Cana have been five stars, so we had certain expectations going in as far as service, food, etc. We enjoyed a lovely vacation and had a good time, but we will not be returning to the Bahia Ambar. It seems they've bitten off a little more than they can chew and have some work to do before I would truly classify this as a five-star resort.  That said, let the review begin! Arrival  Flight: Our flight with Air Transat arrived on time and we got through customs and the baggage claim quickly. Everyone on our bus was going to the Bahia Principe so we didn't have to make any stops along the way. The people staying at the Bahia Principe were able to check in on the bus; Ambar guests had to wait until we got to the resort. Once we arrived, we were dropped off at the Bavaro lobby and took a quick shuttle trip over to the Ambar. Check in took a matter of minutes as there were only a handful of people arriving with us. A bellboy accompanied us to our room with our luggage and showed us the safe, a/c, etc.  Rooms: Our room was on the third floor corner of villa 64, #64317. We were pleasantly surprised to find a gift bag contining two Bahia Principe t-shirts and a bottle of rum awaiting us. A maid also showed up within a few minutes of us getting to the room and brought us slippers and bathrobes to use during our stay. The room offered plenty of seating between the couch, small table with two chairs, desk with chair, and another chair with ottoman in the corner. Our king sized bed was quite comfortable and we were happy with the pillows provided so we never made use of the pillow menu offered by the butler service. The plasma tv worked well and had a good selection of English channels to watch. The room was typically cleaned by 2 p.m. each day and the mini-fridge was refilled with a few Presidentes, soft drinks and Pringles (a nice touch!) I think the room could have benefitted from another chest of drawers, but otherwise it was perfect. The bathroom was enormous! We had good water pressure in the shower and the jacuzzi tub filled up quite quickly. There was also a hairdryer (I think 1200 watt) available that did a decent job of drying my hair. Grounds: Quite mature for such a new resort. Lots of trees, greenery, flowers, etc. Everything was kept very clean. Nothing was more than a five-minute walk from anything else. The Ambar section is very easy to navigate but the main resort next door is absolutely huge. Definitely keep your resort map handy if you venture over there! You can catch a tram to the Bavaro section outside of the Ambar lobby. It's not a very far walk if you miss the tram - maybe 7 minutes or so. I believe the tram service runs until 3 a.m.  Restaurants/Food: One of the major disappointments at this resort. In general, we were quite unimpressed with the Palmyra buffet. Service was brutal and the food was nothing special. We only attempted breakfast twice...getting a cup of coffee was like pulling teeth! They had the usual breakfast offerings of pancakes, fruit, made to order eggs, etc, but the service was so bad that we eventually decided it wasn't worth getting up early for. Dinners weren't much better. Nothing on the buffet was hot - I ate lukewarm veggies, rice, and pasta with my meals when we dined here. The chef's charving station was good and I had some delicious beef there one night, but in general we did not look forward to our dinners here. The gala night on Saturday was probably our best experience in the buffet. There seemed to be a wider selection of foods available and service was as it should be in a five star resort. We were seated by a waiter and our drinks were waiting for us by the time we got back from the buffet. When they asked us to fill out surveys about the resort at the end of our meal, we realized the reason for the sudden change in service.  The pool restaurant, Las Brisas, was our favourite spot for lunch. They didn't have a ton of food to pick from but what they had was good. Hotdogs, burgers, usually a cut of beef or pork, delicious roasted chicken, a nice salad bar, and good pastas with at least two choices of sauce. Service was typically better here, but it could also get very busy and seating was hard to find by mid-afternoon. Ladies, keep in mind that if you eat here you do have to be covered up. A sarong or shorts  a t-shirt is sufficient. I'm not really sure why they are so adament about women being covered up when men are allowed to dine shirtless. Perhaps it's their way of making it up to the men who have to wear long pants and shirts with sleeves to dinner at night? When we arrived at the Ambar we had three a la carte reservations pre-arranged for us. We ended up rescheduling two of them in order to try the a la cartes next door, and we were unable to make the third one as I was feeling ill that day. The a la cartes that we tried at the Bavaro section were the steakhouse (Garden Grill) and the Barbecue, which is right on the beach. The steakhouse was excellent and was probably the best meal we had all week. I had fork-tender beef tenderloin with the most delicious, buttery mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the rib eye which was tasty but very thin. Their appetizer buffet seemed a little odd with its large selection of roadhouse type foods (nachos with cheese  chili, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, potato skins) but everything we tried was tasty. They also had a soup and salad bar available. The Barbecue restaurant was another winner. The side dishes and salads are served buffet style but you can get pretty much any meat you can think of grilled up at the barbecue stand. They had sausage, ribs, chicken, pork, etc along with a tasty paella. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was very nice being right on the beach. Service in both a la cartes was friendly and fast.  The quality of the room service was fine but the menu left a lot to be desired for an adults only resort. Choices were limited to hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken nuggets, sandwiches (ham  cheese or BLT), roasted chicken, or a fruit plate. Everything came with a heaping pile of french fries (except the fruit plate, I assume). Drinks were not available through room service. When you call to order, they tell you it will take at least 45 minutes for your food to arrive. We ordered room service twice and both times our food was in our room in less than a half hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. Bars: The bars that we frequented most were the pool bar and lobby bar. The consistency of drinks like pina coladas and bahama mamas were much better at the lobby bar, where they had blenders, but still tasty at the pool bar. The resort needs to have more waitresses working the lobby bar in the evenings. The outdoor seating area was always full (partly because of the lovely breeze out there, partly because smokers could not smoke in the interior bar), yet they only had two waitresses to serve everyone. As such, wait times to order and actually get a drink were long and many people resorted to just going to the bar to get their own drinks. The lobby bar had a pianist playing in the evenings who provided some nice background music. Other reviewers were not kidding when they said this place shuts down at 11 p.m. Literally, the lights start shutting off, the waitresses take your seat cushion, and they empty your drink into a plastic cup. Closing up shop at 11 resulted in a mad dash to the bar around 10:50 each night. After 11 p.m. you can go to the Pueblo Principe square at the front of the resort for drinks, entertainment, and snacks. While we were well aware prior to our visit that everything shuts down at 11 p.m., it was disappointing that patrons of the adults only resort weren't able to sit and enjoy a bit of a later evening at their own resort. Definitely bring some bug spray if you are prone to mosquito bites at home. The noseeums went to town on my lower legs the first night we sat out at the lobby bar. After that I wised up and used the OFF spray that I'd brought from home (thank you to the makers of OFF for coming out with less offensive smelling products!) and our subsequent bar visits were much more comfortable for me.  On our first night we ventured over to the Bavaro section to sit at their outdoor bar. Their patio was very large and there was plenty of seating available. Service was fast and efficient, but be aware that they will ask you to sign your room number when they realize you're from the Ambar. You won't be charged for anything - they just want to track who is going where. Beach  Pool: The beach was breathtaking and very clean. There were always lots of chairs and palapas available at any time of day. The swimming area was flat-bottomed and a good size. There is a fence of sorts that separates the adults only area from the section that's available for everyone to use. The water was yellow flagged every day that we went down there. The pool was very nice, but getting a chair after noon was challenging. Some people did head out early in the morning to reserve palapas but chairs were usually readily available until late in the morning. Pickings were slim after that. The pool itself was very clean and never very crowded. The resort did a good job of keeping the area clean; there was always someone walking around picking up empty cups. The washrooms at the pool were also kept impeccably clean. The pool was very quiet - there was no animation team (yay!) but also no music. Sometimes the bartenders had a radio going so you could hear some quiet tunes when you were right at the pool bar, but otherwise it was completely quiet. It was definitely a relaxing environment. Activities  Entertainment: There were no poolside activities at the Ambar, which was fine by me. We often heard a ruckus coming from one of the pools next door so there was no doubt where to go if you wanted some daytime amusement. We never made it to any of the shows at the Bavaro, either. I believe the shows started at 9 p.m. and included something for the kids before they got to the main show of the evening. One night we did venture over to the Pueblo Principe and the disco. The square was quite busy, as everything at the Bahia closes up at 11 so people from all three sections end up there. I can only imagine how hot and busy it must get over there during peak season. The disco was very busy and very loud. They had a few staff members available to teach us some bachata and meringue dancing, which was fun. Unfortunately they had the strobe lights going a mile a minute and I'm very sensitive to them, so we didn't stay for long.  Tours/Things to Do: Since we've been to Punta Cana so many times, we never bother with any of the organized excursions. The only trip we make each time is to Don Lucas cigars, where we pick up our coffee, rum, and cigars for my husband. They also sell jewellery, artwork, t-shirts, and such. If you decide to visit, look for Kelmin or Rafael - they're great guys who really know their stuff. Round trip transporation is free of charge. You can arrange a visit through guest services, or call Don Lucas directly at [--]. On the topic of cigars, I should mention that the cigar shop at the Ambar is operated by Don Lucas Cigars, so if you choose to purchase cigars there you don't have to worry about their authenticity. Prices at the resort shop are a good 20% higher than at the factory though, so if you plan to purchase more than one or two, I would definitely recommend visiting the factory. The Bahia resort has a few things on-site to keep you occupied. They have tennis courts, a mini-golf course, and I think you can rent bicycles as well. Unfortunately our one attempt at playing mini-golf didn't work out so well. The kid at the sports equipment hut spent a good five minutes playing on his cell phone before he acknowledged our presence. When we told him we needed clubs and balls for mini-golf, he said we'd have to wait because the four clubs that the resort owned were already in use. Seriously? Four clubs for a resort of this magnitude? Ridiculous! By the time we got to play a round with our friends, it was getting quite hot so we cut our game short. A round of mini-golf isn't going to make or break our vacation, but the lack of equipment and the blase attitude of the attendant didn't make a very good impression on us. Departure  Checkout: Checkout is at 12 noon and Air Transat wasn't picking us up until 2 p.m., so we left our suitcases with the bellhops and just kept our carryon bags with the essentials (passports, tickets, etc). We hung out at the lobby bar until it was time to go. I never did find out if there were courtesy rooms available so I'm not sure what we would have done if we'd chosen to hang out at the beach until our pickup time. The bus picked us up at the Bavaro lobby on time and we headed back to the airport to endure the 3+ hour wait until our flight left. Conclusion: The Ambar is a beautiful property, but they have some work to do in their service department before I would truly consider it a five star resort. Service often came without a smile and it didn't seem like most of the staff was very happy to be working there. My husband and I usually tip very generously on our vacations but this was the first time that we came home with almost as big a stack of $1 bills as we had when we left. All things told, we did get what we wanted out of the trip, which was a relaxing week away from home. Unfortunately that week didn't come with first class food and service, but hey, you can't win them all. Hopefully our next trip, lucky #13, will be a winner!If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them - just email me at ginnyfyris@yahoo.ca

<Content>Beautiful Resort! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar from June 22nd-29th and we both agree that this is a fabulous resort. We booked the vacation after receiving a recommendation from our travel agent, as well as many reviews from Trip Advisor. Hopefully this review can help some of you make the decision to stay here as well, because I know you will love it as much as we did.This was our second time visiting Punta Cana. We vacationed there last year as well, and were excited to return again 鈥?it is beautiful! This is also our second time staying at a Gran Bahia Principe resort: we have also vacationed at the Bahia Principe Coba in Mexico. Since we somewhat knew what to expect, we were not very overwhelmed with the size of the resort 鈥?yes the entire complex is very large. Ambar is adults only, so this was a bonus for us.We booked with Transat and arrived in Punta Cana around 4:30 pm. The trip from the airport to the resort was pleasant and not very long. Some people were able to check in on the bus: we did not. I was under the impression if you were part of the Diamond Club, you were able to do the bus check-in but I could be wrong. It was not a big deal for us to wait until we got to the lobby of our resort. We were dropped off at the Bavaro lobby and immediately took a trolley to the Ambar side with our bags. We were greeted with a welcome drink, completed check-in quickly thanks to the friendly and helpful staff. We were given an envelope that included our room keys, map of the resort, 3 dinner reservations (they reserved them for us, but you can try to change them if you do not like what they chose for you), as well as other various resort information. We found the way to our villa quickly and easily. The location was probably the best you can get: Villa 64, which is right near the pool, but still very close to the lobby/restaurant areas. Rooms: The rooms are beautiful! The bed was king size and very romantic + comfortable, and there was a very large sitting with several chairs/seats. The room also included a safe (no extra cost to us), flat screen TV, alarm clock, robe, slippers, just to name a few things. The room was very well air conditioned, but also had a fan on the ceiling. Like some other reviewers have said, there is a slot in the wall when you walk in where you have to put a room key card to power everything. This wasn鈥檛 a huge deal to us, we just left the card in there: simple. The mini bar was always filled with water, pop, beer, little bottles of alcohol and Pringles. We were on the 3rd floor so we had a balcony which offered a beautiful view of the pool and ocean. The bathroom was probably my favourite part of the room. It included a very relaxing Jacuzzi tub with separate shower (greatest shower ever) and was all marble. The maid did a great job of cleaning every day, and we always liked to leave a tip to show our appreciation.Landscape: The grounds were lovely and very well taken care of. There are palm trees/plants/flowers/decorations everywhere. There are shaded areas to sit along some of the pathways as well. Pillow Service: You can order pillows to your room as well: emperor pillow, memory foam, foam neck pillow, chamomile dream pillow (scented) and green apple dream pillow (scented). My favourites were the 2 scented ones. The pillows were always delivered quickly and were all collected right before we left the resort. We ordered several, so as you can imagine we ended up with a lot of extra pillows!Food: We were able to have 3 A La Carte dinners during our stay. Like I said earlier, our reservations were pre-made. Some people may not like this, but you can change them if you wish. We liked the restaurants that were chosen, so we stuck with them. There are 3 restaurants on the Ambar side, but you can choose any of the A La Cartes from the other side as well. We stuck with the 3 on the Ambar side which were: Portofino (Italian), El Olivo (Mediterranean) and Don Pablo (Gourmet). All 3 restaurants served good food, but our favourite was probably Gourmet where we ate lobster and the ambiance was romantic. The service was great at all 3, our drinks were constantly filled up and the staff was always friendly. There is 1 buffet restaurant (Palmyra) which served breakfast, lunch and dinner. There was always a large variety to choose from so no matter what your taste, you should have no problems finding something you like. At breakfast you can get an omelets cooked for you, however you like it. There is a smoothie station as well. For lunch and dinner you can find foods such as pasta, pizza, breads, fruits, veggies, as well as Dominican foods. I tried to stick with what I was used to! If you love nachos as much as me, definitely check out the lunch buffet. There they serve nachos with salsa, guacamole and cheese. The service here varied. Most times it was great, however at times it was poor. There were a few times in the beginning of our stay where it seemed to take forever for us to even get a waiters attention for water. This didn鈥檛 last long, however. Also, men beware that for dinner you MUST wear pants. If you are wearing shorts you will be turned away. There is also a snack bar near the pool which serves hot dogs, hamburgers, fruits, veggies, pasta, deserts and more. Service and food were both good.Bars: The service at the swim up bar and lobby bar were both good. As I discovered during my last trip, Banana Mamas are delicious so this was my drink of choice again, but I would also recommend the strawberry or banana daiquiri. Room Service: Room service was included in our package, but we only took advantage of this once. You can order hamburgers, nachos with cheese, ham and cheese sandwiches, chicken nuggets, fruit plates, just to name a few. The food was good, but the service was not so great. We waited much longer than the 45 minutes, plus had to call again. It was frustrating, but not enough to ruin a vacation;)Pool: The pool is where we spent most of our time and is right beside the beach. It is very quiet and relaxing: there is no loud music. If music and activities is what you want, one of the Bavaro pools is very close by. We spent most of our time at the Ambar one. We went away to relax, and relax is what we did! There were never any problems finding a spot, even when we arrived half-way through the afternoon. The temperature of the pool was nice and refreshing. There is also an area where you can get your hair braided or get a massage, as well 2 photographers walk around offering to take your picture with 2 parrots.Beach: The beach is absolutely beautiful! Even if you prefer the pool, but you must at least take a walk along the beach. The sand is soft, beautiful palm trees are everywhere, the water is absolutely gorgeous. If you are looking for something more active, there are water sports as well.Entertainment: We didn鈥檛 attend too many of the shows. What we saw was not THAT great, but you can tell they were trying hard to entertain everyone. So I give credit for the effort. To see the shows you will have to go to the Bavaro side, but there is a trolley that will take you there. Also, on the Bavaro/Punta Cana side you can visit Pueblo Principe (Principe Village). There is entertainment there as well, several shops (you can bargain with the kiosks in the middle of all the hotel stores), a casino and sports bar. There is music in the Ambar lobby bar in the evening, and everything closes at 11 pm. If the party scene is what you are after, once again you will have to go to the Bavaro side. Not a big deal because it is a small trolley ride away.Activities  Spa: Other things on the resort that might be of interest to you is the Spa, Gym, Tennis courts and mini golf. We did not play mini golf or do any of the treatments at the spa so I cannot comment on that. We played tennis..there were several courts and we were always able to get a court whenever we wanted to play. The gym has an area with treadmills, elliptical machine and spinners. There is a second area that has the weights. It鈥檚 not huge, but it has everything that you need if you want to work out, complete with motivational music. The gym and spa are on the Ambar side, but you must take a trolley to the tennis and mini golf.Communication: Communication was a small issue because my boyfriend and I only know basic Spanish words. This was not a huge deal at all because even though we didn鈥檛 know much Spanish, we were always able to our questions/comments across. It might have taken more time and effort, but be patient.Excursions: We spent most of our time on the resort, however took once excursion 鈥?Bavaro Runners. It was a good experience, but I felt a little motion sick on the bus. We saw plantations, went horseback riding, saw a traditional Dominican home and school, tested chocolate, coffee, Mamajuana , and cocoa beans. We ended the day at Macao beach. Our guide, Alex, was awesome!Weather: We were lucky to have great weather for most of the trip. It rained a couple of nights, but we were inside so it didn鈥檛 matter and it never lasted long. It also rained the day we left, but we were already at the airport so that also didn鈥檛 matter. We saw hardly any bugs, however I did end up with only one bite (I usually get eaten alive!).In conclusion, this resort was lovely, relaxing and very enjoyable. I really hope those of you considering this resort were able to make it through my long review. Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt: some people will always find something to complain about, and a vacation is what you make of it. Ambar was absolutely gorgeous and all around fabulous. This was one of the best resorts I have had the pleasure of visiting, and I am certain you would enjoy yourself as much as I did. If anyone wants to know anything more, please contact me!

<Content>Terrific! The Bahia Principe Ambar is a wonderful, luxurious all inclusive resort if you like a nice, quiet, relaxing vacation with an excellent beach and great food. My boyfriend and I stayed here during the week of May 24th to 31st, 2008.The beach at this resort is beautiful with white powdery sand and clear turquiose waters. Like many resorts, you do have to get up early to reserve a good spot at either the beach or pool, but it is defintely worth it!The food is fantastic. The buffet was our favourite and we ended up eating there almost every night since there was so much more selection than in the restaurants. Even very picky eaters will find something they like every night. We did eat at the gourmet restaurant one night and I had the best lobster I've ever had.The atmosphere at the resort is very relaxing and laid back. There is no annoying entertainment or animation going on all the time and you don't have to hear the same music everyday. This was a blessing for us. If you do like to party late into the night you can just head on over next door and get all the action you'd like.The rooms are clean and comfortable. The beds are large and the nicest ones I've slept on in the Carribean. Air conditioning works great and really helps get the humidity out of the room, so it is a nice retreat at the end of a long day in the heat. The only bad thing I really have to say about his place is the poor workmanship in the rooms (tiles, etc.) But remember you are a long way from home in a poorer country.I defintely recommend this resort to anyone thinking about going to Punta Cana!

<Content>Nothing short of spectacular! I'll start by saying that the people who complain about this resort were obviously looking for things to complain about (we actually met a few of these people when we were there...and avoided them). This was a fantastic resort. My boyfriend and I (in our late 30's) just returned from a weeks vacation and found it nothing short of spectacular. We have been to several resorts in the past and feel that we can comment on lots of qualities. The beach, the room, the grounds, the food, the staff were all wonderful. It is a large resort but we found it quite easy to get around, either by foot or by trolley, and there was always a quiet place to be found. You never felt as though you were in a huge resort with alot of other people. We enjoyed 3 of the a la carte restaurants - Italian, Fine Dining, and Japanese (which was our favourite), but the buffets offered such a fantastic variety of foods that you could never get bored with the selection. The water sports were wonderful and we took advantage of the hobie cat sailing nearly every day as we explored the waters around the shipwreck that sits just offshore. There were always palapas/shade to be found on the beach at any time of day...perhaps not prime location, but lots were available. The beach was clean, as it is well raked every morning which made for fantastic swimming. The entertainment was great as we attended several of the shows. The Michael Jackson show is not to be missed! It is hard to put into words just how beautiful the resort actually is. Pictures just don't do it justice however the staff make a huge effort to keep it clean and the gardens are beautiful. Funny story...we met a guy who was testing the cleaning staff by leaving trash around in different places and seeing how long it took to disappear...never more than an hour! According to several of the other reviews of this resort and complaints about the language barrier....yes, many of the staff speak very little english. Big deal....we are visiting a different country...they do make an effort and certainly appreciate your effort to speak some spanish. There is ALWAYS someone to answer any questions.One suggestion....when you change your dollars to american, get lots of small bills. It's not easy to change your $50's or $20's for $1's which are great for tips. Off resort tours...we only did one - the Tropical Storm sunset cruise that included snorkelling(take a banana with you to see more fish) and swimming with a floating bar. Staff was great....thanks Paddy from Scotland :) We didn't go, but the safari tour was apparently wonderful.If you are questioning whether or not to go to this resort based on tripadvisor comments....ignore the complaints. It's awesome!

<Content>We will be back! We stayed at the Ambar from May25-June 1. We picked this hotel because it was new, adults only, and a 5 star. Well, we were extremely impressed. It is by far the best all inclusive we have been to. And we would go back in a heart beat.Food- The buffet was amazing. My husband is an incredibly picky eater and he was very happy. We both were. There are so many choices, I find it hard to believe anyone could be unhappy about the food. Food is very important to us, and we like to indulge on vacation, so the Ambar was perfect for us. We did a few a la cartes, and they were okay; we much prefered the buffet.Service- great service all the time. If you tip at the pool bar they are almost surprised, which I thought was fun. Beach- Absolutely amazing; breath-taking. Another reason we would return.Pool- pool was very nice. We took our own floaty, and I would recommend that if you like being in the pool you take a cheap one with you and then leave it there for someone else. There is nothing like floaties that you can buy there.Drinks-Also very good. We did miss having frozen drinks in the buffet though. They only serve juice, beer, wine or pop in the buffet. Room- Nicest room we have ever stayed in. And for once, a bed that didnt feel like stone! I have back problems, but I didnt have problems sleeping on those beds at night.Weather-this is the only thing we didnt like. The sun was shining when we got there, but after flying for 24 hours we went right to bed. We didnt see the sun again until the day we left. Very cloudy every day. The good thing is we didnt get burnt, and didnt need to constantly reapply sunscreen. The bad thing is we hardly even got a tan, and I brought way too much sunscreen. Having said that, the sunscreen at the hotel is extremely expensive, so better to bring more than not enough.Men must wear collared shirts and pants after 7pm, even to the buffet. They can wear shorts during the day, but their shirt must have sleves on it. It was nice that the Bahia has a little market place on the resort, so you dont have to walk all the way down the beach to do a little shopping. I didnt see any bugs while we were there, but I had a few bites to prove that they existed.We had a great time, and enjoyed the serenity of adults only. Although, sometimes the adults in the pool were much louder than any kids would have been! But that is a trade off of an adults only. We went for relaxation, peace and quiet. And that is exactly what we got. I cant wait to go back!

<Content>Great (much needed) Vacation! My wife and I stayed at the Ambar from June 01-08.First off I just want to state that this was an awesome vacation at a fantastic, clean, well serviced and beautiful resort.The more I hear people complain the more I wonder why people travel. Stay home, have pizza and relax. This is not North America and that should be the attraction. The people are great!Travel:Booked through Belair travel in Toronto. Briana you were great! Flew Air TransAT. We were late leaving due to a medical emergency on the flight coming in. No issues. Good flight.We arrived in Punta Cana with no issues and hit the bus to the resort. Ambar guests were checked in on the bus. Room keys, dinner reservations (which I booked in advance through the great staff at Bahia), resort map, wrist bands the whole 9 yards. We arrived to a cold drink and cold towel. Nice touch really. Luggage was taken to your room within 30 mins. One thing is that we never saw or heard from a Transat holiday rep the whole time we were there. It would have been nice to get call asking how things are going. It would also be good if included in your arrival package was the time and place the bus leaves to take you back to the airport after your vacation. Just my thoughts.Staff: 9/10. We only found issues with the front desk. No problems they just seem to be indifferent. Everyone else was fantastic!Room: Perfect! Clean, new and everything in working order. My wife and I joked that the tiny little scuff mark on the wall by our bed would become a major issue for someone and we would read the review complaining on the how the rooms are falling apart.Grounds: Immaculate! They work hard to keep up the grounds. They are really beautiful at the Ambar and in fact after walking the other resorts on the family side; I can honestly say that they are beautiful as well.Pool: We are beach people however the pool is beautiful and we hung around it now and then. The water temp could be a little cooler.Beach: Beautiful! Great sand, plenty of shade and beautiful colours in the water. No chair issues. We walked down the beach about 10 mins where the waves were much bigger and fun to jump!Who goes to the DR for the pools???Food: Okay, the food was good not great but good. Unless you are the fortunate few who can afford g to pay a lot of money for international chefs at some resorts you cannot expect food to be what you would expect when going out to dinner at home for 100-200 per couple (do the math). There is a good selection and the quality is good. We did not get sick once. That is a miracle for me. Service is good. Too good sometimes as they keep taking your side (bread) plate away. What I missed about the food at this resort is: No Beach BBQ with fresh fish and the like. That would have been a nice touch. Missed cream for coffee as well.Summary: I don't know what else to say. If you want a relaxing vacation with good service, beautiful rooms and villas along with a fantastic beach and immaculate grounds then the AMBAR is for you. My wife and I work long hours like most people and our vacation is very important to us. This was as close to perfect as we could expect. If you want to find the party crowd you could. What was better? They could not find you!After reading some of the negative reviews I now believe in two things: 1. People will always find something wrong and vacations are what you make out of them.2. You should be at a place where you don't have to worry about making the best of your vacation (it just happens) and that is the AMBAR.Reviews are just opinions. If you read an ad for an apartment for rent and it says Clean and Modern then you know it is probably not. If you read reviews from people that say they are not picky or 鈥淚 am normally very laid back鈥?well, you decide.We had a great time at this resort. Bottom line is...there is no risk going there, the food is safe, the place is immaculate, beautiful and the people are very nice. You can find better I guess but with so much out there this is like investing in a blue chip stock!BM 鈥?Toronto, Canada

<Content>one of the best resorts We booked the punta cana resort, but happily got upgraded to the ambar section(adults only). The rooms were beautiful- marble bathrooms with robes and slippers. We were on the 1st floor in section 65, right in the middle of everything. The pool was so relaxing and nice and cool. The food was good. We choose the Japanese restaurant which was delicious. The hotel choose the the other two which you have the option to change, but we didn't. The gormet restaurant was outstanding. We both got the filet mignion and the have a dessert which comes around. The third restaurant was the Italian. This was my least favorite although the food was still good. I ordered the pizza for an appetizer which was huge!! It was too much food, i hate to let food go to waste. The drinks in the whole resort were top shelf. Half rum with a little coke :)

<Content>Nice Resort, So-So Food, But Beach Excels We stayed at the Ambar during the week of 6/8. We had great weather untl the end of the week. The beach was probably the nicest we've been to, having been to places like Paradise Island, Cancun, Riviera Maya, Jamaica. The topography was stunning. The resort itself was impeccably clean. Rooms were nice but musty smelling. The language barrier (we speak English) was troublesome at times. We had a few minor problems but the staff did eventually accommodate us. As for the food, it was mediocre at best. We enjoyed the Ambar gourmet restaurant (great lobster) and the Bavaro Italian restaurant. It was a huge problem to not get into the restaurant of your choice, and if you were lucky enough to do so, you were eating at 9:30 at night. The alcohol was another disappointment. For one, the mix they use for the frozen drinks had a very weird aftertaste. And, the wine selection was horrible. Basically you were drinking boxed wine, UNLESS YOU PAID for a bottle....The trams were a nice touch and came in very handy at times. The place is so large that you do a lot of walking.Our one major problem was that our transportation (BP USA - Sol tour) forgot to pick us up on the morning of our departure. After complaining to about 5 different employees (guest services finally helped in the end), they provided a van for us - but we were now 45 minutes late leaving for the airport. Very stressful, especially in a different country.All in all, I would recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for a nice relaxing vacation. You simply cannot find a prettier beach.

<Content>Nice place but would not go again We stayed at the Ambar for 1 week starting June 8th.We were checked into a ground level room and were not able to move to a higher level. The Ambar's main restuarant was a buffett and the food was reasonably good. We had 2 reservations at the a la carte resturants prebooked through Air Canada vacations. We could not make any more reservations.The Gourmet restuarant had very good food, but small portions.The Italian restuarant was awful. The waiter was confused and brought lasagnia when my wife ordered fish. The food was not very good either.Weatherwise, we had a great week until the last day and the beach was very good. It started to rain at 12noon and did not stop until the next morning. The hotel provides umbrellas, but we did not have one in our room.The room had 2 problems. The glass shower door was crooked and would not close. I had the door adjusted, because I did not want it falling off during our stay. One day later the door was crooked again. The next problem was a huge cockroach in our bathroom, hiding in the hand towel. I was more concern about the bugs I did not see. When I complain to the ACV rep, I was offered another room which was smaller. I decided to stay in the room we had.The resort was all adult, but was connected to three other resorts and some families were moved to the Ambar section.We tried Parasailing which is offered at the hotel (but not operated by the hotel) for $85US. For another $20US, they take pictures of you and put it on a CD rom with salsa music. If you buy the disk, MAKE SURE THE PICTURES ARE YOUR PICTURES. When we looked at the pictures, my wife noticed right away. The wrist bracelets were the wrong colour and the guy in the picture was wearing a hat and I was not.I stayed at the Excellence in Punta Cana 4 years ago and will go there again. The Ambar was nice, but I would not go there again.

<Content>Quiet vacations in a very relaxing resort My wife and I went to this resort in the 8th of June week. This is our second trip and the second for the same operator, bahia principe. We went to the bahia principe Akumal (Riviera Maya) 2 years ago and loooove it (I will let you know of the differences at the end of this quick review).Going back to the Ambar now. We read all the reviews of this site before booking our trip and I was concerned about a few things that I can now clarify for your own good. We have booked our trip with Air Transat, as we were very satisfied of the service we got on our previous trip. 1) The Weather: Know that it is actually the rain season in Dominican Republic and there are good chances that you get rain at this time of the year. The week before ours, it rained mostly all the week. Hopefully we got very lucky and the weather was exceptional to the exception of the thursday where it rained like I never seen before. Let me tell you that when it happens, it is a very long day as there is nothing to do but playing cards in the lobby or watch TV in your room... The rest of the week was sunny and hot (30 deg C).2) The 鈥渁-la-carte鈥?restaurants. Do you a favor and reserve them BEFORE your arrival. They automatically arranged 2 reservations for us in restaurants that we heard being so-so. The next day in the morning, we went to reserve for the other days and almost all the restaurants did not have available places left. We were lucky to have the Japanese one which happened to be very good, different than the one at Akumal though. In fact, the difference is that it is not really 鈥渁-la-carte鈥? When you arrive, they take you by group of 10 people and bring you and a semi-closed dinner room where you are seated along the others in face of the chef who cook the meal in front of you. It was funny to see people faces wondering why they were in a group like this. Not the intimate dinner that you expect if that is what you want. Apart from that, it is a very nice experience and the food is very good. Btw, they don鈥檛 offer you Sake, but if you ask for it, they will serve it for free. We also went to the Italian restaurant which has not very good reviews on this site. We were unfortunately stuck with that choice since it was one of the few available restaurants we had. It is a nice looking restaurant and what we ordered was very good. Now, the worst part of our experience for the dinner was at the Las oslas snack bar (BBQ-style). Again, we did not have other options left. We were very deceived our arrival that the dinner room was in fact outdoor with white patio tables. Then we were told to serve ourselves to the.... buffet! Yes, there was no menu to choose from, no carte. Just a buffet that was horrible. The Ambar central buffet is way better than this. After our first plate we were so pissed, that we left and finished the dinner at the Ambar buffet. Do you a favour and do not reserve at this restaurant!3) The mosquitos and risks of Dengue sickness: Forget about that as there is almost not a single mosquito on this site the week we were there. I might have seen 2 or 3 in the whole week. Don鈥檛 bother bringing your deet-based oil for that. Some people worried us about the risk of getting the Dengue in this area but really, there is nothing to worry about on this resort.4) The beach: very beautiful. We were not in the high season and the beach was not very occupied. Nonetheless, it was very difficult to get a good spot with a palapa, same thing at the pool. You have to be there between 8 AM and 8:30AM to have a chance to get one. What pissed us the most is the lack of respect of some people who were used to 鈥渞eserve鈥?their spot by putting their stuff on the chairs, leave for hours and come back once in a while at any time of the day. We also observed people with 2 sets of towels reserving palapa at the pool AND the beach, so they could switch between both when they wanted. Other than that, we really enjoyed the beach. 5) The nights: This is an area that might not satisfy everyone. We personally didn鈥檛 care because we are not very of the 鈥減arty type鈥? Everything closes early. You cannot even use the pool at night if you want to. The lobby bar closes at 11 PM, Other than that you can go at the theatre on the 鈥淏avaro/Punta cana鈥?side where they present a different show every night at 09:30. After that, there is not much thing to do if you like to go out late.6) The staff: Very nice and polite. Really, I don鈥檛 understand all the fuss about this in other reviews.7) The rooms: Very clean and comfortable. We were in the Villa #68 which is just next to the pool. Since they are all brand new, I can only say that they were above my expectations if I compare with what we got at the Akumal. One of the differences between both was the smell and air. Akumal鈥檚 rooms were extremely humid compared to the Ambar.8) The food: The food was good and quite diversed if you consider that we only had access to the Ambar buffet (and not the Punta-cana and Bavaro buffets). They had different food every night but it is true that everything become very similar after a few visits... But heh, nothing is perfect. The snacks were average. They always had the same stuff again and again. Hamburgers, hot dogs... What my wife dislike the most was that there was not light snacks anywhere to eat between the meals (nachos, chips, etc...).9) Akumal vs. Ambar, who win? Beach: Ambar, Food (buffet and a-la-carte): Akumal, Room: Ambar, Villas: Ambar, Pool: It depends... If you like complex setup with corridors, multiple bars and animations, you will be deceived with Ambar as there is only a single pool which is just ok. There is no animation at all at the Ambar鈥檚 pool. Since there is no animation and no kids (adult-only resort), this is the perfect place to relax. Surroundings activities: Akumal, Night life: Akumal10) Bottom line, we recommend this hotel if you want quiet and relaxing vacations with #1 service, good food, exceptional beaches, etc.

<Content>dont go!!!!!!!! If you are looking for a relaxing vacation, DO NOT STAY HERE. The service was the worst I have ever seen, esp for a four star resort. Upon checking in they were very rude and unaccomodating and do not speak ENGLISH well. The food was awful, but even worse were the drinks. How hard is it to make a Pina Colada? Wine, out of a box, and you could only buy a bottle of good wine at one or two of the restaurants but naturally THOSE restaurants were booked or CLOSED every night. I am an easy going New Yorker and can deal with headaches, but not on my vacation. Waiting on line for an hour to make dinner reservations is not my idea of relaxation. Not to mention, when you finally sit with the Guest Services person, everything is booked EXCEPT the (nasty) buffet.One tip for you if you do go to this terrible resort, dont lose or forget your reservation receipt at dinner, they wont let you eat without it.

<Content>Wow wa we wow Ahhhh the Ambar, after being home for only a couple of days i already miss the place lol. My better half and i travelled there from the 31st of May to the 7th of June. By far the best trip i have been on, i mean a couple of minor complaints but really, nothing major. I have been to both Cuba and Mexico and this place blew both of those out of the water. The few reviews that are not in favour of this resort, well i can only think that there are just some people out there that can never be pleased lol.To start, we arrived on a late flight getting into Punta Cana around 8pm, very welcoming, bags were easy to get, and there were people waiting outside to assist you with your luggage if you wanted to the bus or you could just say no gracias and they would not persist. Asked what bus we needed to get on and they showed you right away. On the bus ride to the resort we stopped at a little road side store and felt very safe with people all around us and only one tour guide. Ordered up 2 Presidente's which came in the really big beer bottles and were ICE ICE cold, tasted absolutely amazing after a day of flying. Proceeded to the Bavaro side of the Bahia Principe collection where our luggage was off loaded and taken to the Ambar side, check in went very well with no hick-ups, was shown where are room was and were told that our bags would be up in approx 10min. Sure enough, 7min later and our bags arrived. With getting to the hotel late all the restaurants and buffets were closed, so we oredered up room service, was there reasonably quick and was not to bad, it was food in our bellies and thats what we were concerned about lol.Alot of what other reviews stated are the same, about tiping, getting to the beach of the pool at a decent time so you could reserve one of the palapays. We were there to relax and catch up on some much needed sleep so we were never down to the pool or beach much earlier than 9 or 10 after breakfast but there were still lots of chairs around the pool, not much for shade and lots down on the beach, more with shade just a few rows back from the ocean. One other person wrote on it and i will comment on it aswell, these people who reserve the shaded sitting areas by the pool or the ocean and use them here and there is NOT cool, and was not impressed by how ignorant people can be, but i didn't let it ruin my vacation. P.S. The pool bar is stellar, one of the bartenders, Pedro is the best, don't get me wrong they were all very nice, but Pedro kicked butt. So friendly, chatty, was great. About how quiet it is, tis true and so very relaxing. The odd time the pool bar may have gotten a little crazy but its usually the group that is there and how much fun you were having. We didn't venture out to the Disco or suprising any of the shows, had people we met do both, and they said it was totally worth checking out. Wanted to go see the Michael Jackson on one night, but too many Mai Tai's and mama juana that day lol.We did 2 different excursions. One was the half day snorkelling with nurse sharks and sting rays, very cool. They had a few snacks on the boat and booze too....of course lol, but no booze until after snorkelling. DONT forget you underwater camera, they say they have em on the boat for a nice price of $35US lol. Some of the most beautiful coral and fishies ever, and swimming with the nurse sharks and sting rays was unbelievable. Or other trip was a full day to Saiona island, an unhabited virgin island that was breathtaking. Sailed on a huge cateraman(make sure you have lots of sunscreen, the wind off the ocean is deceaving needless to say my better half burnt) so yes sailed for approx 1.5hrs and then hung out on the island, had a real BBQ lunch, more booze and hanging in the sun and beautiful beach then took speed boats back. Stopped at a natual pool that was about 1-2km from shore out in the ocean but the deapest part being only 4ft deep maybe, where we could try and find starfish, found a couple and that was neat for sure. Try and pack some dry clothes, long bus ride home and its wet and damp, and not fun with wet shorts.The one minor thing and this is just personal like im sure everyone has there opinion, after a week the food was getting a little tiresome. And like i said this is just personal, like someone else had said, they prepare the food different and your body may take a day or so to get used to it, if ya know what i mean lol. All in all this trip kicked butt, got lots of sun, relaxed a tonne, met some amazing people and just throuroughly had a great time. I highly recommend this trip to anyone looking to get away from kids and the regular party atmosphere that some resorts may have once and awhile. Any questions please feel free to email me, take care and happy vacationing.

<Content>Great Resort My sister and I (both in our mid 30's) stayed at the Ambar from May 24-June 1. The following is a breakdown of our experience:Check-in: Our group arriving from the airport was fairly small, so we weren't checked in on the bus like other groups i've heard of. The bus dropped us off at the Bavaro lobby. Most of us then proceeded to line up at the lobby desk, only to be told that we had to wait out front with our luggage for a tram to the Ambar side (where we would check in). This was the only confusing part of the process. Check-in was smooth once we arrived at the Ambar side, and the staff were friendly (unlike the front desk staff at the Bavaro).Room: Very spacious and clean. The beds were the most comfortable of any I've slept in in four trips down south. If I had to be picky, Id say that the lighting in the bathroom was somewhat inadequate, and that the room had a somewhat musty smell. The smell is due to the climate, not to any problem with cleanliness. If people are sensitive to this sort of thing, it may be a good idea to bring an air freshener with you for the room (I'd seen this suggested in other reviews, but didn't bother to bring one). The maids did a great job everyday tidying the room. They will not change the towels unless you place them in the bathtub (to indicate they're dirty) and I don't think they change the sheets unless you request it. This is similar to extended stays at hotels in Canada. The bar fridge was restocked daily with water, soda, Pringles, two cans of beer, and two 1ounce bottles of Absolute vodka and some sort of premium rum. Make sure you leave one room card in the wall 'plug' to make sure the minibar stays cold, it that's important to you. Same goes for the air conditioning. Not very good for the environment though...Villas: We stayed in number 60, which is closest to the pool and beach. Their really aren't any 'bad' villas, as you are only a two minute walk to the pool or the lobby, depending on which end you are at. I believe villas #60, 64 and 67 are the ones closest to the beach, but check a resort map to make sure! There are 12 villas in total, set in 4 rows of three moving from the beach to the lobby.Grounds: Beautiful! We saw many gardeners and maintenance workers during our stay working on the resort's grounds.Food: Good to very good, in my opinion. We ate at the Gourmet and El Olive on the Ambar side, and enjoyed both. For lunch we usually ate at the snack bar close to the pool. The main buffet was good. Remember that a filet mignon in the Dominican is not going to taste the same as one in Canada. If you go with this sort of attitude with respect to the food than you'll do fine. Tip: a 'well done' steak is comparable to a 'medium' steak here in Canada (i.e. a little bit of pink inside).Pool/Beach: We always got up around 8am to get a palapa by the pool. They were usually all gone by 8:30 or so. The pool was great. THe service at the pool bar was great, especially Wilkins the bartender. The only problem I had was with the loud, rowdy behaviour of a group of people who acted like they were a group of college co-eds on Springbreak in Cancun! This went on for a few days, and then thankfully stopped. Not the hotel's fault, although I felt that they may wish to discourage this behaviour if they are looking to promote the hotel as a true 5 star. But I guess in all fairness that the work 'vacation' means different things to different people! In general however, the pool was quiet and relaxing. It closes at 6pm, however their were always a few people in the pool until at least 6:30ish, so I don't think they're too strict about it. Thermal mug 'filling' was inconsistent, depending on who was working the bar. I'd ask for two drinks and then pour them into my mug. You almost never had to wait beyond a minute to get served at the pool bar. Security was always present by the pool to prevent non-Ambar guests from using it.Beach: Water is definitely cooler than the pool, which is nice on hot days. We didn't use the beach a whole lot, as we're 'pool people'.Service: This is where the Ambar truly shines in my opinion. The staff were always pleasant, and you would barely have sat down in the lobby or at a restaurant before someone came to take your order. We tipped, but it honestly didn't make any difference in the level of service we received. Although tipping is appreciated by the staff. Lobby Bar: Excellent drinks and service. Closes at 11pm nightly.Trams: Easy to use. We've stayed at other resorts (including two other BP's) and found these the easiest to use by far.Shows: Cheesy, but you can tell they try hard.Day trips: the only thing we did was the free shuttle to the 'mall' in town. This runs daily, but wasn't really worth the trip (overpriced, etc.). In hindsight we wished we'd booked a day trip off the resort to break up the week, but nothing appealed to us initially. All in all we had a nice vacation. The Ambar is not for those who are looking to party, as it is a very quite resort. We definitely made the right decision in choosing it, when comparing it to the Bavaro and Punta Cana side of the resort (noisy, crowded, and a poorer level of service). A few tips in closing;-bring lots of US $1 bills for tipping-don't forget to tip the gardeners (they work so hard and don't get the recognition that many give their maids, waitresses, etc.)We would definitely return to the AMbar!

<Content>Excellence at it's Best Booked my package to the Ambar 8 days before my departure, and got a great deal. Next day I read some of the negative reviews on here and got a bit nervous and bewildered as the Ambar is rated 5 plus stars, which from my experience in the Caribean usually means that you can eat off the floor. The one and only hitch for the 7 night stay was the air conditioning wasn't working in my suite upon my arrival, so while I enjoyed a couple CubaLibre's in the Lobby Bar, 2 maintenace workers replaced some parts in the thermostat, and I was good to go for the rest of the stay. All the staff is friendly and can't do enough to make your stay the best possible. A dollar or 2 now and again goes a long way with your Butler, or Bartender. A couple of bucks in the mini bar with a note replaced the little vodka bottles with a whole bottle of rum which never went empty. All areas were immaculate and many of us tourists marvelled at the amount of marble everywhere. The Ambar is a quiet resort, which is what I needed, but lots of action and partying was just a short walk or trolley ride to the other side of the resort. Restaurants were all great, with staff constantly walking the buffet to ensure all the trays never go empty. All in all a fantastic time and I couldn't find a single person who had a bad thing to say about the Ambar and I would highly recommend the Ambar to everyone, of course Adults Only. I will be back. Good Job Bahia Principe!

<Author>CaribbeanQueen-Ham.
<Content>Loved the Ambar We stayed at the Ambar from May 16-30. We received nothing but courteous service the full two weeks we were at the resort. We enjoyed the 8+ a la carte restaurants thoughrout the Grand Bahia Principe property. That being said, we've travelled to Punta Cana 7+ times and it's one of our favorite vacation spots in the Caribbean but the food in DR is not the same as we have here at home in Canada. This is not a problem for us as we know that and enjoy the diversity of cultures. The food was good and the best a la carte was the Don Pablo Gourmet restaurant. Getting food when arriving late is also not an issue as the Ambar provides 24 hr room service at no extra charge. They also have a hamburger joint at the main square where all the shops are. It opens at 10pm till 2 or 3 am. We had breakfast on our balcony most mornings. It was delivered within 15 minutes of our requested delivery time. The Ambar tries very hard to please it's guests and they did an excellent job. We are at a loss to understand some of the complaints we have read. The Ambar section is adults only and very quiet. There is plenty of action, noise and children at the Bavaro and Punta Cana sections which Ambar guests are welcome to enjoy. There are nightly shows, a casino, a disco (opens at 12am), a karaoke bar and a shopping square. We found the Ambar to be very well maintained , the grounds are beautiful and the staff friendly. It's ok to say hello or Ola first. I've never not had a smile and a reply. The rooms are nice and big. The four poster king beds are great. We had pillows delivered from the pillow menu which were great (no charge). There are robes and slippers in the rooms. The bathroom was spacious also and had a glass shower as well as a jacuzzi tub. Our room was cleaned by noon daily and our bed was turned down nightly about 9pm with little chocolates left on our pillows. Beach towels are in your room. They can be exchanged daily by the pool. The beach is fabulous and second to none as far as we're concerned. The Ambar pool is very nice and has a couple of jacuzzis. We had no issues with chairs at the pool or the beach. One thing I would like to point out is that it's not appropriate for people to reserve chairs under palapa's and not use them for upwards of 4 hours. I don't understand the greediness of this practice. Internet service in the lobby is free at the Ambar for 15 minutes at a time. We typically only used it once a day but we were not restricted to that on few times that we went twice in one day. The gym is also very nice and quite adequate for most needs. They keep it nice and cool. They provide towels too so no need to bring the ones from your room. There are ATM machines at the Bavaro Lobby and the Punta Cana Lobby. Keep in mind that the bank machines dispence Dominican Pesos. We recommend that you purchase a phone card from the store to call home($20 USD). This eliminates a surprise phone bill. You can use this card from your room for no extra charge. There is also a free shuttle daily to the new mall from the Bavaro lobby. There are several nice shops, a Hard Rock Cafe, a Tony Romas, a pizza place and a sushi bar. On a final note, the premium liquor is only served at the lobby bar at the Ambar. The rest have the regular stuff. They do leave Barcadi Gold rum and Absolut vodka in your room fridge along with Presidente beer , pop and water. We recommend this resort and will definitely go back.

<Content>Ambar lives up to our expectations! Stayed at the Bahia Amber May 18th 鈥?25th. We stayed previously in the Club Golden section and decided to try the Ambar as we were not travelling with children. Would rate the resort as a 5 if the problem of booking a la cartes is corrected.Everything is quite nearby, and trams are not necessary unless you want to go to the Bavaro/Punta Cana restaurants. We were placed in Bldg. 67 (closest to beach) and if was only a 5 min. walk to the main buffet, lobby bar, etc. Also, if it was hot or raining, you can walk through the other buildings. The design of the bathroom has been improved with a separate shower stall, and water doesn鈥檛 go all over the floor as it does at Bavaro section.Dress Code 鈥?Not too strict for women, but these are the rules for men:Main Buffet 鈥?Breakfast and Lunch 鈥?men can wear shorts, but must have a shirt with sleeves (i.e. no tank tops).Dinner Buffet and a la cartes 鈥?men must wear long pants, and a shirt with sleeves and collar (i.e. golf shirt).Warning 鈥?as you know, you must close the balcony door tight in order for the air-conditioning to work. We found out the hard way that you can close the door in the locked position! We were also on the north side, facing the empty lot next door, and it was some time before anyone walked by that we could shout to. There seems to be a problem with booking a la cartes. I e-mailed the resort 2 weeks prior to our trip and had them arranged, only to find out that the Seafood and Garden Grill had been cancelled. I had a copy of the e-mail with me, and after talking with them at Guest Services, they honored the reservation.PROSVery quiet and relaxing with a beautiful clean pool, and lovely beach. We walked over to the main pool for lunch one day, and realized just how nice the Ambar is, being adult only. Liked the idea that everything was nearby making it feel like a small resort, unlike the Bavaro/Punta Cana where you need to ride the tram. It was convenient to return to our room after dinner to change into shorts before going to the lobby bar. Enjoyed the Gourmet and and Mediterranean restaurants. We also ate at the Garden Grill, Japanese and Seafood which were also very good.Plenty of palapas at the beach 鈥?I went down about 8:15 a.m. each day before breakfast. The first two rows were always taken, but many were available in the third row, and you still get the nice breeze from the ocean.Tip: We take cheap yellow T-shirts and place them on the chairs rather than the blue towels. Easy to identify your chairs and no one can argue that you 鈥渢ook their chairs鈥? CONSThey do not have enough palapas at the pool. I counted 24 of them, and when you consider that they have 500+ rooms, you can see why you must be up at the crack of dawn to get one. We are beach people, so that wasn鈥檛 a concern. We go to the pool at the end of the day and shaded areas are available then.Several guests were only given 3 a la cartes, at the Ambar, and had to eat at the buffet the other nights. This should not happen, especially when they advertise 鈥渁ll a la cartes鈥? May is the slow season, so they should be able to accommodate the diners. Can鈥檛 imagine what it would be like in the busy season.We prefer the a la cartes for dinner, and it they make it a practice to only honor 3 a la cartes, I would probably choose another resort.

<Content>The best place on Earth I think this place was amazing. I booked our honeymoon through expedia, and was a little nervous having not ever been to DR. We were met at the airport by Expedia and were taken to resort. Expedia has a person at the resort to speak with if you have problems.The room was bautiful, and large. The fridge stayed stocked, and would get more and more full with a tip to the maid, who was excellent. She done an excellent job, and was eager to please us in any way, including bringing washclothes to our room at 10pm. She was very very great.We were in villa 1 at the golden club. It was right on the beach and next to the pool. It was perfect. peaceful all day and night. The bed took a couple of days to adjust to, a little stiff for my liking. The pools were great, clean and very large. My only complaint with the pool is that they close way too early. It would be nice to be able to swim at night in the cooler air.The beaches were very nice and clean. The sand was soft and the water perfect. There was a constant wind so not ever too hot. Do get to the beach before 7 am to get a hut, but never a shortage of beach lounges.The food was awesome. As you have read, just do not drink water. I drank table water on the last day and got very upset stomach. The buffets were good. I loved the food. You just have to remember, your not at home. They prepare food with their own style. Dont expect everything to tast like it does at home. Expect to expierence thier approach to cooking. I esspecially loved the green lasagna.All staff were friendly and more than happy to please. I never had one complaint concerning any staff. I would recommend them to any and all people. It made for a perfect honeymoon.tips - - - , bring your own glass, because all drinks are in little 8 oz cups. A big drinking mug would be appropriate.also, make sure you haggle with the venders if you shop. They would ask for $95 us for almost everything, but you could get almost all items for around 5 dollars. Dont forget to tip. It isnt required, but sure goes a very long way for making an excellent vacation. I would leave about 5 dollars a day to the maid, and it made for a great time with supprises like chocolates on the pillows at night to many many many extra drinks in the fridge.I will post pictures when i can

<Content>Very Relaxing Resort Stayed May 18-25/08. Check in was quick as they had envelopes ready with keys etc. for each guest. We arrived @ 7:30PM and of course were hungry - we were given directions to the snack bar only to find that it was not serving any food - this even though they say it is open until 10PM. So if you arrive after 5 PM be sure to have some long pants ready so you can get into the buffet restaurant.This resort is very quiet - other reviews were not exagerrating - just what we wanted. Palapas around the pool were an easy score the Monday  Tuesday but we had to go down around 7:30 the following days to ensure we got one. Didn't have any problem with guard standing watch over the chairs until 8 as mentioned in some reviews. The pool pretty much starts to clear out around 4 PM.Poolside entertainment at the other resort in the complex starts around 3:30/4 every day and is loud - we were jolted out of an afternoon nap in our room the first day by the noise (we were in building 61).A la cartes were good - best was the gourmet. There seems to be different levels of guests as we noticed there seemed to be two sets of menus - not sure what that was about. Wine at dinner average - about what you would expect but you can order from a list if you prefer better stuff (there is a charge though). Buffet was run of the mill - decent but predictible.Drinks all very light on the alcohol. Waitresses seemed rather aloof - even when you tipped them. Mini bar in room stocked with two mini bottles of vodka and one of rum, two Presidente's, Pepsi, etc. Since the electricity only runs with the room key in the slot the fridge doesn't get very cold. They will only give you more once you finish with the standard. Pass on the Mamawana - tastes like watered down port.Rooms were lovely and very spacious. All common areas were very nicely kept and clean - washrooms were immaculate. Ground were lovely and well cared for as well.Overall - Ambar is a great place to stay if you are looking for a quiet, relaxing holiday in the sun.

<Content>Another tough day at the beach !!!:o)) Spend a great week at the Ambar, May 17 to 24th..The food was very good. We especially loved the Portofino. We enjoyed having breakfast and lunch overlooking the ocean from the beach buffet resto. Remember guys, bring long dress pants.. Personally a ridiculous policy, as it's okay for women to parade half naked, but men have to wear long pants when it's 34 degrees out..The service included in our package was exceptional. Don't ask for anything beyond that as you won't get it, and will get pushed off. My suitcase broke as we were leaving for the airport, and no one, but I mean no one had any supplies to help fix it. A complex of magnitude size and no one has rope, tape, anything to keep our personals from flying away.. Give me a break.. I finally had to go to another resort and the bellhop gave me a roll of shrink wrap... Word of caution, if you go parasailing with the Water Sport section of the Ambar, a great adventure may I add, however, do not buy their photo's. It is a scam, and I am surprised the resort is part of it. Despite the photographer making you wave your arms, smile, etc while pretending to take pictures, the CD is a generic one and only made up of aerial shots of the complex before the Ambar was built.. So save your $20 and do not entertain their scam. Water sports were fun, however they only allowed half hour for the pedal boats, and when I questioned the time, I was rudely told half hour.. The folks working the water sports definitely needed a lesson in PR, contrary to that, the folks working within the complex were the most gracious and friendly workers I have seen in a while . Nothing but smiles and courtesy all way around..The room was very nice, we had to ask for bath robes and face towels, but the response was immedeate. The grounds were exceptionally clean, at times exaggerated.. The resort is peaceful,and yes it does close down at 11 pm, but a 2 minute trolley ride and bingo, mucho action.. Casino, shops, theatre, (although not the best shows), etc.. The lobby was very peaceful compared to the other two Bavaro and Punta Cana.. Definitely enjoyed our stay, enjoyed the folks we met, Peter, Solange , Jocelyn, Johanne ,Ghyslaine and the good Doctor and his wife from South Africa.... Newfoundland ..

<Content>BEWARE: "The Foxes Are In Charge of the Henhouse After having experienced the Ambar personally, I feel the one thing that was consistent at this Hotel was the inconsistency of just about everything. Having said that, when we checked into our room, there was NO flat/plasma tv that everybody else raves about. Ours was a very small screen (perhaps 19) and much older than other guests have reported. As a matter of fact, every day when I walked past other rooms at the Hotel, (main floor, bldg. #61) it seemed to be a hit or miss depending on what room you were in. Some had flat/plasma tv's, but most didn't. No big deal, however, Ambar advertises flat/plasma tv so we were disappointed that there wasn't one in our room.Speaking of the room, I have to agree with the majority of the people who said it was beautiful  well-appointed. That was at first glance... However, I also have to agree with a previous reviewer who said the workmanship was shoddy. M. Holmes would have a thing or two to say - especially about the way the tiles in the bathroom were affixed to the walls and the fact that there is no ventillation or window in there. Talk about humidity - I cannot imagine how much mildew is under the false ceiling - yikes!!! Oh yeah, our bathtub worked, however, big crack in it so I guess that's what caused the leakage.Libations were also inconsistent; even when the same drink was ordered whether it was the lobby or pool bar. On several occasions we ordered the same drink which you got as a 'frozen' or sometimes came with two ice cubes. When I ordered pina coladas at the pool bar, I had to ask for the rum to be added. In other words, they're serving 'virgin' coladas unless the customer requests the rum be put in. Must be why they were going down so 'smooth'....While we're on the subject of the bars, I've got to mention the fact that I have a more extensive bar at my own home than they do at this 5 star Hotel!!! They have huge areas to hold lots of bottles, however, the shelves are practically empty!!! What was really odd to me too was when you ordered a drink, the bartender would disappear behind a door then reappear minutes later with your drink. Why does he go in the back room to make my drink, why not make it there at the bar? Also, perhaps the Hotel should check into the demographics of their clients. I witnessed many Canadians, some who have even gotten on this website and mentioned a love for Canadian Club as one of their favourite drinks. Not all of us live on beer , wine  the frozen drinks.. Why not 'loosen the purse strings' and buy a few bottles of a decent rye and other spirits!As for the food, the Ambar has a far way to go to achieve the 5-star status. First of all, I don't recommend salting any meats before the cooking process. I don't know what that's all about, however, it's just not healthy! Every time I watched the chefs at the buffet restaurants at the Amber cook meat, they salted it. Let me be the judge of how much salt I want on my meat.One other thing the restaurants should invest in are some decent grills for the meat. The buffets all had a flat stainless steel surfaces which the chef would place the meat on; only after they had poured a good amount of oil. I can feel my arteries clogging as I write this!I also agree with a lot of the previous reviewers: the best meals were at the buffets and not the a-la-cartes. We were also disappointed that the Japanese Restaurant was booked all week; even before we had checked in!!! Go figure!I must say that the one thing that was consistent at the buffets and restaurants were the smiles of the staff; especially a woman by the name of Rosa who greeted us at the door. What a sweetheart she was! Every day we looked forward to her smiles and kind words.I feel I must mention the beauty of the Hotel and the grounds, including the beach. Absolutely lovely!In closing, I would also like to mention that we had some money taken from our locked safe/room the night before we left the D. R. We reported it to customer service who apparently followed Hotel procedures. They took us back to our room, checked our room and our luggage then said they would write a report. We were then dismissed. I've read other reviewers who reported things missing from their rooms too. As a matter of fact, since our return from the D. R. I've researched this subject and have found numerous articles about the same topic. My boss tells me she found herself in the exact same circumstance when she visited the D. R. four years ago! Like I say, BEWARE!!

<Content>Paradise at the Ambar! May 11 鈥?18, 2008. We just got back from a weeks vacation at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar. We were a group of two couples going away for the first time kiddless! Going to an Adults Only resort was a prerequisite for us. After reading ALL of the reviews, we were a little nervous about the lack of fun and nightlife offered. Well, let me tell you, there were not many nights we were home before 3am. Everything at the Ambar closes at 11:00pm but you can take the trolley over to the Bavaro side (2 minutes) and there they have a Karaoke bar that is open until 1:00am, a Casino that I never saw close, and a disco that opens at 12:00am to 2:30am. After that you can go to the all-night burger place across the square and sit and eat and drink beer until the wee hours of the morning鈥?This was our first time to DR 鈥?I am a big Jamaica girl and have been to Cuba (will not go again) but I think that this resort has opened my eyes to the beauty and friendliness of this country. I would go back in a heartbeat 鈥?specifically to this resort.CHECK IN:They did it on the bus! We didn鈥檛 even have to go to the desk. They gave us an envelope with all of the info we needed and room keys. They put on our bands. They took our luggage to the room and we were off. Vacation begun鈥?br/>POOL:If you want to meet people this is the place. The pool is beautiful and WARM! It is like bath water. Absolutely amazing and that is coming from a beach girl. We met a fabulous group of people 鈥?thanks to the first afternoon spent in the pool bar drinking too many Gran Bahia鈥檚 and Bahama Mama鈥檚. Everyone there was very social and fun. The pool bar staff is amazing (despite some of the reviews). Pedro and Wilkins were our favorite. Just ask Pedro for a Sex in the Pool drink 鈥?he鈥檒l know who sent you 飦?We tipped our bartender everyday at least $5.00 鈥?sometimes more depending on how long we were there. It goes a long way! We never wanted or waited for anything and the drinks were never lacking alcohol!!!! Sometimes I had to ask for more juice! If we went to a bar at home we would be tipping at least $1 per drink so really this is not a lot!BEACH:What can I say but BEAUTIFUL! This is the best beach on the strip. My husband and I walked up and down both sides comparing the beaches and amenities and the Ambar beach is by far the best. There are a ton of Palapa鈥檚 (or as my husband calls them Falafels). He usually got up a bit early (7:00am) and went down to save one to ensure the closest one to the water but there are plenty available. We never actually sat in the Ambar section because it is at the back of the beach and it was a bit far from the water for me. But it seems that although available to all of Gran Bahia, the Ambar side was the only one that used this whole section of beach. We never saw kids on this side. The beach is spotless. There is a gentleman that goes around all day picking up garbage and your empty glasses (which my girlfriend tipped him too, LOL!). There are flower pots situated all over the beach for cigarette butts and everyone seemed to use them.ROOMS:The rooms are amazing. We were a bit upset when we found out that we were in block 70 and on two different floors. Looking at the map it seemed far from the beach (which I requested close to the beach and pool 鈥?side by side rooms). The clerk at front desk asked me to go and see the room first and if I was unhappy than to come back and he would see what he could do to accommodate us. Well it worked out perfectly because we were close to the main lobby (and restaurants) and nothing is really far from the beach or pool. Needless to say, I didn鈥檛 go back to complain. The maids are wonderful. We left $2 - $3 on the bedside table and $2 in the bar fridge. This ensured a fully stocked fridge with Pringles every day. Although I am sure I would have got them regardless of tipping. She appreciated it none the less. Be aware that the maids do not speak a word of English so be patient, they try their best to understand what you are trying to act out in charades, LOL!FOOD:I was a little worried about the food but OMG it was amazing! There was so much of a selection it was crazy! Breakfast was wonderful 鈥?omelet station, smoothie station, bread, sweets, fruit, everything you could ever want for breakfast! We ate at both the main buffet (in the lobby) and at the beach. The main buffet had more of a selection but the beach buffet was beautiful because you could eat outside in the open air. It didn鈥檛 have an omelet station but lots of other options. Lunch we only ever ate at the beach buffet. Lots of options from chicken, pasta, nachos, burgers, hotdogs, fries, salads, fruit. All good.Dinner was amazing 鈥?the buffet offered EVERYTHING! You could pick your meat and they would grill it right in front of you. Pasta station, pizza station, the list is endless鈥? We went to The Japanese restaurant which was good 鈥?not amazing but I liked it. Great experience and fun. Note that you have to bring your slip with you or it causes a big kafuffle! And also there are TWO Japanese restaurants, one at Bavaro and one at Punta Cana 鈥?we did not know this and were very frustrated when they couldn鈥檛 find our reservation. Italian was good 鈥?don鈥檛 order the risotto 鈥?it is not risotto just rice with mushroom sauce and it was about 戮 of a cup. The mushroom pasta was great. Lamb apparently ok. They have a salad bar that was really good. Mediterranean was yummy! They have a rib eye that was as big as my plate. The beef filet was great. They don鈥檛 have a veggie option so we ordered something from the Italian menu and they were very accommodating, they also have a huge salad bar. Gourmet (at the Ambar) was the best. The camembert appetizer was to die for. We had the beef tenderloin, salmon and Caribbean lobster and all were amazing. Service at all restaurants were great but the Gourmet (Don Pablo) definitely won the prize. Some people complained about the wine on Trip Advisor but we didn鈥檛 mind it at all (and we drink a lot of wine!). It鈥檚 not Wolfe Blass but it鈥檚 comparable to a Two Oceans. No one there complained about it.TOURS:We only did one tour 鈥?The Marinarium - it was the one where you snorkel with the nurse sharks and sting rays. It is 3 hours on a party boat which includes an hour of snorkeling where they provide all equipment (split fins!), drinks (which you can have AFTER the snorkeling), sandwiches, an hour of swimming in a shallow untouched area of ocean/beach. They play Bob Marley and have a floating bar. Throw around a small football and just have fun! When back on the boat they make you REAL Coco Loco鈥檚 with REAL coconut and dance to all the fun music. The staff is so fun and genuinely having a good time with you. Absolutely GREAT time. I would recommend it to anyone!!! Bring Suntan Lotion and a hat. Not a lot of shade available!SCUBA: Two of us dove. Not the best diving experience. They took us to the ship wreck that you can see from the beach. I personally don鈥檛 like wreck dives. There was NOTHING to see except a rusty boat and one puffer fish. That鈥檚 all I will say about that. I didn鈥檛 dive again.To summarize, we had a great time. The resort was breathtaking 鈥?the grounds, the pool, the beach and the buildings. Food great, service great, people fabulous! I didn鈥檛 know any Spanish and I now know a few key words and phrases. They love when you try and are more than willing to teach you. The concierge at the front (to book you鈥檙e a la carte鈥檚) is not the friendliest but you only have to talk to her briefly. There are only two computers in the lobby and you get 15 minutes at a time. There are a lot of mosquitoes at the computer desk 鈥?just a warning. My legs are covered in bites from that desk. The other sides of the resorts (Bavaro and Punta Cana) were beautiful too but VERY full of kids. It was nice to have the kiddless option and have full amenities of the other resorts if we chose. They were also VERY big!Also 鈥?there is a table they set up in the lobby around dinner time where there is a girl named Ruth that serves a lime punch and a real fruit punch (with whatever alcohol you want) along with champagne. She is wonderful. Just love her.  A vacation is what you make of it. If you want a relaxing vacation or a party vacation you can have it. If you want to complain about every little thing and nit pick than you will probably not like it 鈥?or anywhere for that matter. I really don鈥檛 understand how you couldn鈥檛 like this resort. We had people complain to us about petty little things so we just avoided them next time we saw them. Of the many resorts I have been to, this was top notch! Hola!

<Content>Beautiful Resort - Fabulous time! We were at the Ambar 4/30-5/7 and had an outstanding time. I, too, was a little nervous after reading multiple reviews; particularly about the bar service at the pool, but they were all outstanding! Our observation was that if people would just use a little kindness and common sense, they would have better vacations! Many of the guests were quite rude - bossy and demanding - I felt like being rude to them too! Pedro, Carlos, Wilkins were all fabulous. If you want a stronger drink - just ask for it! There is a bit of a communication gap, but try to speak a little Spanish and they appreciate your efforts - you are in their country! Rooms, grounds, maid service all great. Yes, a little inconsistent, but if we were missing something that was critical they were happy to come back and bring it to us. This is definatley not the place to go if you are there for the night life - as many have said, they literally do roll up the sidewalks at 11 PM, so don't be surprised or complain - you know it going in! If you want night life, the other resort right next door can offer it to you for a short walk. We ate at ala cartes 5 of the 7 nights and literally loved all of them - the Japanese Restraunt was by far our favorite. If you e-mail Laura 2 weeks in advance she will be happy to get you all set - don't wait until you get there or it will be too late! I personally loved breakfast at Portafinos - beautiful view, mimosa's and bloody Mary's flowing freely - very relaxing! If you are a pool person, and need to have a shady thingy....you'll need to be poolside at about 7:30 in order to get one - the race starts at 8 am when security says go! Quite comical. We did witness one pretty good fight between two couples fighting over one - good god, people....get a life!Nothing really new to report that you haven't already seen here - we just wanted to calm some fears; be nice and all will be nice to you! Enjoy - it is an incredibly beautiful island!

<Content>Great!!!!!! What More Could You Say Well let me start by saying that we were booked for The Bahia Principe Gold Club.Because this was our second time there,they upgraded us to the Amber sideAIRPORT We were in our van within 30 minutes and on our way.It was great because we had our own van right to the resort with no stopsCheck-INWent to the Gold Club check in ,that is were we found out that we were upgraded to the Amber to our supprise.Went like a breezeROOMSThe rooms are very big with King size beds and a large sitting area and a flat screen tv.Bathroom had a stad up shower,jacuzzie tub,private stall toilet and a big vanityMAIDSDid a great job on keeping the room clean at all times and keep the mini bar filled to.Would always say hi when we saw herBEACHWell what can you say but wonderful.It is the best beach that i have ever been to.Water was blue as can be and the sand was so pure.and fine.The beach is also well kept.Every day there were a few guys walking around and picking up trash and racking the sea weed from the beach.There are a few haglers on the beach selling stuff with no preasure to buy.The chair game is played here but not that bad.If you were down on the beach between 7:00A.M and 8:00A.M you would have no problem finding a shade hut and yes there are topless women on the beachPoolDid not spend a lot of time in the pool,but it was warm and clean when we did.The chair is also played here but you could not reserve a hut before 8:00A.M or thge guard would take your stuff off the chair and take it to the towel hut.There were people sitting under the huts with there stuff till 8:00A.M came around every A.MFOODWe ate at 3 ala cartes the Japanese,the Garden Grill and The Mexican all were good.If you stay on the Amber side you could only use the Amber buffet except for lunch then you could go to any of the buffets down by the beach.The breakfest buffet was good they made any kind of eggs you wanted.Had all kinds of meats almost any thing you wanted.Lunch was lunch you know hambergers .hotdogs pizza pasta and a few other things.Dinner was the bomb.you could pick just about any kind of meat out of the case[steak,fish,shrimp].the quality at the Amber buffet was the best i have seen in the DRDrinksWe hung out mostly at the Punta Cana side lobby bar were the drinks were the best made by German and Ramon.the lobby bar at the Amber side was also good.Pool bar on the Amber side was inconsistent with how they made a drinkSERVICEI thought the service was good.You were never in need of anything.Every where we went there was someone asking us if everything was ok and could they help us.Everyone was real pleasent.Also if they could not understand you they would get someone who could.After all you are in there countryOVERALLThis was a great trip and I would not blink at going back.These people work very hard for there money.Every time we would tip they would answer thank you with a smile.i would get mad every time I saw a person ask or demand for a speical drink and not tip.That was down right lowP.S.WHAT A GREAT TIME

<Content>Mixed Feelings Will try and keep this short and simple. Grounds-most beautiful I have seen. Rooms-again, beautiful and clean. Food -good selection in buffet but average quality. A la carte- Le Gormet (Don Pablo) was the best (above average). Pool and beach fantastic. Bar service- inconsistent at all bars, everyone seems to make the same drink differently. Premium liquor only at Lobby Bar and then very short list (what they advertise they have and what they actully have is different). Definite language barrier but can get by for the most part. Food service- again average and inconsistent. In general a very quiet resort. Place literally shuts down an 11:00 PM. Pet peeve, I was very annoyed at the fact that the lobby staff actually took the seat cushions right out from underneath you while sitting in the lobby or patio area when the bell struck 11:00. Despite these issues my wife and I had one of the best vacations ever simply because of the great people we met and hung out with. I would not go back to the Amber again for several reasons but primarily because I have received far better service in Mexico, Cuba, Bahamas, Aruba etc. and would rather go back to these countries. Have been to D.R. twice, both 5 star and both with similar levels of service.

<Content>Wonderful resort ,exceptional staff. We will be back! We were bumped from the Majestic April 26th to the resort for 2 nights. We loved this resort. It was so nice. The beach is beautiful (A bit more crowded feeling than the Majestic鈥檚 beach) but still very nice. The room was wonderful. It has a large shower and a whirlpool tub for two that really helped after a long flight! The room also had a flat screen T.V. (which isn鈥檛 a big thing 鈥?we never watched it, but it was a nice touch)The mini bar was stocked well, we never needed for anything. They supplied plenty of water and beer and soda.We had a ground floor unit very close to the beach and were fairly close to the buffet restaurants and a few of the other restaurants. We were only allowed to eat off the buffet for the two nights we were there due to being bumped from another resort, but that was fine. The buffet restaurant inside the Amber (or the one that is very close 鈥?I鈥檓 not sure if it was inside or not the properties sort of run in together) was outstanding. My husband found some ham that was sliced very thin (he told me what kind it was but I don鈥檛 remember) that was so good he had to have it at every meal. They have a wonderful selection of cheeses too and Mangos all the time. We did not get sick once while in Punta Cana, and we both even messed up a few mornings and brushed our teeth with tap water.The best thing I think about this resort is the quality of people that they hire. Every single person was full of smiles and everyone spoke to you. We did tip of course, but I don鈥檛 think it made a difference. One thing I really liked was that everything on the buffet was labeled and they had drink menu鈥檚 at the bar (If you have a sweet tooth try the Coco Russo)I鈥檓 sure they have an animation team at this resort (They all have one) but we didn鈥檛 see them, and for us it was a blessing. We were on our honeymoon so we were sort of dreading all the social games and things 鈥?and we never had to worry about it at the Amber. The feel of the resort is very laid back and it was exactly what we needed for those first two days.The only bad things we experienced were from some of the other guests. There seemed to be a lot of snobbery going around and ordering around of the staff. I witnessed a few men scolding the poor waitresses and making complete spectacles of themselves. Also, we never found a beach bar that served alcoholic beverages. We found one that served juice. Maybe we just over looked it.Another thing that we really didn鈥檛 like was how confusing and large the whole complex was. They do offer little transportation shuttle type things that will get you from place to place but we like to walk so we really didn鈥檛 take advantage of them that much. But it can get confusing on where you are or where you should go (I鈥檓 sure the rum helped with that).The Amber was so awesome that if we ever get to take another vacation without our children we will stay a full week at the Amber.Don鈥檛 get me wrong the Majestic is nice too and if we had the kids it would be a great place for our whole family 鈥?but if it鈥檚 just the two of us again鈥︹€e are going to the Amber!

<Content>seven times in the dominican and this is the best yet best holiday yet . skipper and maryann ,april10 to 24 we were booked to to go to the bahia punta cana gold , and we were upgraded to the ambar due to overbooking. this turned out to be a lucky break for us,the ambar was the nicest place we have been to in the dominican. we stayed at bahia punta cana gold last year and this was much better. the rooms and the service were excellent our maid cristina was the best,very friendly and great service, we stayed in building 69. t he food was very good in the buffet with one exception they had a big problem keeping the food warm, they have ceramic serving trays and they take a while to heat up, they need to pre-heat the trays the food and service in the al acart restaurants was excellent especialy the don pablo gormet . the pool and beach were fantastic,the pool was not crowded and they have good drink service,the pool is sparkeling clean and the beach is to die for ,not to crowded. the people that work there are super,even the gardeners, all of them are friendly . i must learn more spanish for next time after all it is their country. for sure we will go back to the ambar next year. we hope that the ambar does not get as big as the grand bahia which is steadly expanding and is out growing itself , i am greatfull to all the people at the bahia for making our holiday a wonderful experience.

<Content>Loved our Vacation at Ambar My husband and I stayed at Ambar April 26 - May 2. We were traveling with another couple. Everything was wonderful. We arrived early (11:00 a.m.). Check-in was a breeze and we were able to get into our rooms immediately and were by the pool by noon! The beach was beautiful, food delish, service top notch. From our experience, all I can say is take negative reviews with a grain of salt. I was a little nervous about our vacation after reading some of the reviews. There are obviously people out there you can never please.

<Content>WARNING - Paid for 7, stayed for 6, cost us 8 days We checked in at 10p due to our on-time flight arrival. Our flight out was at 9p the following week. I asked Airtransat Holidays about check out for late departure - no problem. The hotel will allow a late check out at no charge. I asked itravel2000.com the same question - same answer. I asked the front desk 3 times at the hotel, including when we checked in, no problem - we can check out later that 12 noon at no charge.What happened? We were forced to check out at 12 noon which meant we had to sit in the heat for 6 hours, plus the 3 hours getting to the airport plus the flight home - 15 hours in total.The next day I slept the day away to recover - not a very nice vacation ending.So here's how it works - DO NOT BOOK FLIGHTS THAT DEPART LATE IN THE DAY - you will lose a day sitting in the heat with your bags and you will lose another day recovering.Forget what the agents and hotels tell you - you will be checking out at 12 noon or you can pay $300 USD to stay an extra 5 hours.I will never go back to the Dominican without the proper arrival time and departure time.Vacation was good. Food was good. Service was good. A very bad ending to a good vacation.

<Content>Relaxing week at the Ambar Just back from a wonderful week at the GBP Ambar. To sum it up in one word鈥?Heaven!We traveled with Transat. The airplane seats are small, but we survived. It鈥檚 a 25-30 minute drive from the airport to the resort, fortunately we traveled in a comfortable, air conditioned bus. The Transat representatives at the resort were great. We met with Nicole for an information session, and learned quite a bit. In my opinion, it鈥檚 worth your while to talk to them if you can. We also booked our excursion through their office. Our room was fantastic. Very spacious, with a sitting / dining area. The bed was very comfortable with great pillows. The bathrooms have massage tubs and shower stalls, which were awesome. No problems with bugs. Huge closets, although I would pack a few wire hangers in your suitcase if you want to hang everything. The safes are in the closets, and are digital.The maid did a super job every morning, and was very grateful for her tips. There were a couple of days that our mini bar did not get restocked with alcohol and Pringles, but that was not a big deal. As long as it was clean with fresh towels, that was perfect for us. I did write a note asking for specific thingsin the mini bar, but was not accommodated. I鈥檓 not sure if the same maid restocks the mini bar. Maybe someone can advise??The pool looked great, although we didn鈥檛 spend any time in it at all. It鈥檚 difficult to find appropriate words to describe the beach and ocean. To say that it was awesome, does not do it justice. White sand, turquoise water and rolling waves鈥?that memory will be my happy place until I return. We were late getting to the beach on the first morning, so needless to say, all of the palapas were taken. However, we did find a very short palm tree which provided the perfect amount of shade, with an unobstructed view of the water. It was such a great spot that Todd went every morning at 6:45 to reserve our chairs under the palm tree, and it was there that we spent our entire vacation. Aerobics or yoga on the beach every morning. The coordinator does his best to invite everyone to join, but not so aggressive that he/she is in your face.Cocktails: We had drinks at the beach bar, snack bar and main lobby. From what I鈥檝e seen, there is only top shelf liquor at the main lobby. I thought the drinks were a little weak at the beach and snack bar, so I asked for doubles. That worked for me.Lobby bar closes at 11pm, so after that it鈥檚 up to the other sections (PuntaCana/Bavaro) if you want cocktails.The a la cartes at the Ambar were OK. In my opinion, the buffet at the lobby is a better choice. Lots to choose from with different themes each night. Snack bar was good too, but to be honest, you can't go wrong eating at the buffet in the lobby for all of your meals. It was fantastic. Todd used room service every night. Took about 25 mins, which wasn鈥檛 bad at all.The a la cartes at the other sections were booked so I cannot comment on those. If you鈥檙e interested in going to them, I suggest contacting Laura at Guest Services before you arrive. I corresponded with her, and made certain requests about a week before, but by that time it was already too late. Checked throughout the week for openings, but nothing came up. .Overall, it was very relaxing week; everything we hoped it would be and more!

<Content>The best place we have ever stayed in all our years of travelling My husband and I plus one other couple stayed at this resort Apr 13 to Apr 27. This resort was by far the best we have ever been. The food was delicious, the drinks great variety, exquisite beach, beautiful, lush well attended gardens. The service friendly and if there was something you needed, the staff would go out of their way to get it for you. It definitely was a 5 star hotel according to Canadian standards and one we will definitely go back to.

<Content>Just Back...4.5 out of 5 Stayed at Ambar from April 26 - May 3. Overall enjoyed my stay, ending up getting sick for the whole week with the flu.The resort/grounds are beautiful. The work really hard to keep this place in excellent condition. Arrived early, didn't check in on bus like some others have mentioned, got dropped off at Amber around 12pm and our room was ready which was fantastic.I found the staff to be very attentative, sometimes, almost too attentative. I know that they were trying to make sure everyone was happy and had no needs, but during meals, my husband and I felt like we were being 'watched'. They hovered and grabbed your plate too quickly. But that's better then not paying any attention!The beach is beautiful. Very clean! This was my first time to DR (only been to Cuba) and I found the water very rough. I'm usually a beach person but found myself spending more time at the pool at this resort.The pool is a perfect size with a very nice layout. Right next to the beach which I loved, some great views. The only thing I would change is the lack of any music, etc. I went on this vacation for total relackzation and have no deisre to be talked into pool activities, etc. but some music would have been nice.Room was very nice. Stayed in 60217. The maid had it cleaned by ealry afternoon everyday and yes we did receive turndow service everynight except for the evening we were in early and had our Do Not Distub sign out. Did get a welcome bag with rum and two t-shirts. Never used the bath tub, very nice, but looks like it was stained with grout that had run down it's sides. Even though the room is nice, you can still see shoty craftmenship. We left the maid $10 up front and about $2-$4 bucks each days. Also left a couple of bucks for the person doing the turn down service.The food was really good. Like I said I ended up with a bad flu so we stuck mostly to the buffet which had a hugh variety. The beach grill is also ok for lunch, hot dogs and hamburgers, a perfect daytime snack! At at the Italian, and from previoud reviews knew what to except - and everyone was right! Don't waste your time going there! Ate at the Don Pablo twice, the first was our anniversairy and they even baked us a cake and sang to us when they delivered it. A very thoughtfule touch. Overall, I didn't find the food that great at the Don Pablo - it was just average. Also I found the staff smiled less at this restaurant. They were much friendlier at the buffet. Tiped at most meals, but felt no presure on this end, which was nice.There's a lot of water traffic! Much more that what I seen in Cuba. I did parasailing and would highly recommend it. But it goes by really fast and don't buy the pictures. We were supposed to get 10 pics of us for $20 USD on a CD, got home and there is only 1 of us very far away and the rest is of 'set' photos of Punta Cana.Wasn't really impressed with the weather. It rained a few times for long periods and days that it didn't rain, only had clear skies for a few hours and it clouded over in early afternoon. I actually felt cold sometimes! Didn't really go for the vendors. Found what they had to offer also looked very cheapy-cheapy, as they say. Also, I really don't like being harassed by them. Like when I walk away, don't start pulling me back in. Found PC outside the resort very dirty. Apart from the beach, I fould Cuba better.Overall, I enjoyed the vacation. Would return to this resort and would return to PC. But probably will try somewhere else just for variety.Any questions, I would be happy to answer. Enjoy you vacations whereever they may be!

<Content>Great upgrade Hello, My partner and I stayed at The Ambar from 16th - 23rd April by default. We landed in Punta Cana after a long flight from London UK, expecting to stay in Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana for 2 weeks after getting on the coach for our transfer we were told (approx 11 groups) that the hotel was overbooked and we were being 'bumped' into the hotel next door, The Majestic Colonial. (see review under hotel name) We were given $400 cash plus VIP bracelets which unabled us to access all of the resort bars, restaurants etc in both Majestic Colonial and Gran Bahia Hotels. We were transfered to Gran Bahia Punta Cana on the 16th and at reception were told that we had been upgraded to The Ambar. We were taken by the concierge to our suite near the sea which was amazing, we were given first class treatment by the reception, cleaning and concierge staff. We made reservations for the Mediterranean, Italian and Le Gourmet restaurants without problems. The food in all three restaurants was good, but very limited choice and very small a la carte menu! Also apart from the extensive wine list (Extra 拢拢拢拢) we were not offered any other drink choices. The Italian restaurant also served breakfast which was excellent, quiet and service very good, lots of hot coffee refills. We also ate in the buffet restaurant on 3 occasions for dinner, food good with lots of choice, themed each evening. The one downfall of this resort is the food and drinks service in the restaurants and bars it is very very slow, most evenings at dinner we didn't get our drink glasses refilled without asking, often the waiters looked liked they were very busy and over stretched (not a staff issue, but management issue -need to put more staff on each shift) The snack bar by the pool had excellent lunch time choices and staff friendly and efficient. The swim up pool bar, good fast service, but not sure what we were drinking most of the time. The same cocktail never tasted the same twice.! The lobby bar served the best cocktails and service quick if a little abrupt. We ventured out most evenings to the Entertainment Sq, Theatre and Bavaro and Punta Cana lobby bars. The casino and disco good fun. These areas are much busier and lively but again not enough staff, could wait 10 minutes to be served only to be pushed out of the way by people from countries where they obviously don't queue!!!! Also service with a smile would go along way in us giving tips. The tram system around the resort - great idea after a few cocktails. The pool area very nice but not enough shaded areas, this led to people sitting by the pool at 7 am waiting for the security guard to give the go ahead at 8 am to put towels on chairs, in 3 minutes there was not a chair left each morning, quite funny and amusing to watch!!! Also on occasions the pool area was incredibly noisy with people shouting at each other non stop, thinking that everyone else wanted to listen to thier conversations. How can anyone have a ten minute converstion on how thier steak and shrimp(prawns)were cooked?Also what is with people taking thermal mugs everywhere with them????This resort is dominated by North American/Canadian clientle, and personally would like more of an international balance. I was with a party of people who first language is Russian, I speak both English and Russian and on a couple of occasions when we were speaking in Russian around the pool (some people probably do'nt realise that some people can speak more than one language) Some very dorogatory remarks about russian people were made!!!!!!!! Not good for international relations!!!Also guests were getting really angry when the staff could'nt understand thier demands, what happened to 'Please may I have.........and Thank you' Learning a few word of spanish would go a long way, as you are in a spanish speaking country.All in all we were lucky in being upgraded to The Ambar as we would of gone insane if we had to of spent 2 weeks on the Punta Cana side, for the Brits who may read this just think Benidorm or Blackpool at high season. We are glad that we were bumped into The Majestic Colonial Hotel next door for the first week because it gave us a comparison, we enjoyed our stay at the Ambar, the rooms and food were great, but the friendliness and excellent service from all the staff and the friendliness of other guests at the Majestic Colonial was second to none. We will return to The Republica Dominica but probably not to Gran Bahia Principe as it is far to big and appears not to cope with the amount of guests it has at any one time. Kind regardsFay  Georgi London England

<Content>2ND Time There, Going For Three Next Year Stayed at the Ambar from Apr. 21st til Apr.28th. There were 2 couples including us. We all had a great time  not one complaint about anything. If you can't have a good time at the Ambar you should not go away. We were upgraded to the Ambar from the Gold at no extra charge which was OK with us.The pool area is perfect, not overly crowded  easy to get food ordrink. Went out on the sunset tour which is put on by Scuba Quatic. If you go make sure you book thru Basil Lux. He comes on the trip  he is a riot. Very enjoyable trip  well worth the $35.00 US per person. It is a 2 hour trip. We can't wait to get back there next year.

<Content>disappointed in ambar Just returned from the Ambar. Spent 2 weeks there. Beautiful resort. Excellent pool. Food at the buffet was excellent, can't say the same for the a la cartes. Biggest issue was the poor quality alcohol. For a 5 * hotel the drinks were disgusting. If you wanted premiun liquor you had to purchase it extra or go to the Bavara next door although the liquors are listed on their drink list(Baileys, Port). When you ask for it, they say its unavailable till tomorrow but for the 2 weeks, tomorrow didn't arrive!!! Interesting that you could get it at the hotel next door and not at the 5*. The people were quite friendly and if you know a little spanish its helpful.wouldn't return to this resort .

<Content>A wondeful stay at a gorgeous 5 star resort!! My husband and I stayed at the Ambar during March 3-10. This was our fourth time to the Dominican Republic but our first time to Punta Cana. We had some reservations about this resort after reading some of the negative reviews but in the first few hours of arrival, I knew I was not going to be disappointed. This resort complex is huge and the Ambar is gorgeous鈥he nicest of the resorts I have been to (including the resort where I was married in Puerto Plata).For those who have not visited this part of DR-Punta Cana is beautiful! comparing with Puerto Plata it is cleaner and more industrialized with new building/condo/housing. The airport is quite modern with duty free shopping etc. (i.e. Lacoste and even Wendy鈥檚 restaurant!).Customs was a breeze!! very efficient both entering/leaving the country (again in comparison with Puerto Plata) and a bus destined for the Ambar Adults Only section of Bahia Principe was waiting to take us to our resort. Once on the bus, we were given an information package, which included room keys. We did not have to check-in, went straight to our rooms, and awaited the arrival of our luggage, which took no time at all!Our room was on the 3rd floor in building #60 (beachfront) with a pool view鈥mazing! (we requested this upon booking). We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and so a fruit basket, a bottle of rum, and 2 t-shirts were in our room (very nice touch). The room was gorgeous with a very comfortable bed and a beautiful marble bathroom. The food was out of this world!!...we mostly dined at the a la carte restaurants including the Mexican, Don Pablo Gourmet, Garden Grill (we heard the Italian was not very good). We had several servers鈥ery professional鈥?the main buffet was also very nice with choices to satisfy everyone. If you have IBS or stomach/digestive problems take Pepto-Bismol and other drugs with you (these cost a fortune on the resort!).The Ambar section of the complex is quiet and basically shut down at 11:00 pm. We took the tram to the other resorts (Bahia Principe Punta Cana and Bahia Principe Bravaro) on the complex for a more lively time. The Pueblo Village is also great for entertainment, shopping, casino etc. This part of the island is somewhat windy which was great to water/wind sports鈥he parasailing was great fun...the beach was clean and amazing鈥?there wasn鈥檛 any organized activities on the Ambar side but if you went to the other sections of the beach and resort-seek and you shall find!..oh and a word of caution...for some reason I think this part of the island is hotter or the sun is more powerful...my husband had sun stroke...wear sunblock!! (take sun block and sun burn creams with you-very expensive on the resort).The pool was a little too quiet and maybe in the future the staff will act on the many recommendations and play some music鈥?reserving a chair pool side is difficult. We managed to get chairs early in the morning or late in the afternoon.We believe in tipping鈥emember you are in a third world country and it鈥檚 a nice gesture. We tipped the house cleaner 5 dollars a day, left a separate tip in the mini bar, and tipped our servers at the a la carte restaurants. We did not want for much as everything was always well stocked. I also brought along school supplies, toiletries and as it was close to Easter, some chocolate bunnies for the children. This is a beautiful resort! I have no regrets or disappointments and look forward to visiting Punta Cana again next winter!

<Content>great resort but..... Just returned from one week at the Ambar. We were two couples who have travelled quite a bit throughout the Caribean. This resort is truly one of the lovliest I've seen The grounds are spectacular as are the rooms and the decor. The beach is great although you have to get up pretty early to get a palapa for a little shade when needed.The ADULT only concept here is a bit deceiving. It is more a seniors resort. They literally turn out the lights at 11 and take away your seat cushion and put your drink in a plastic cup and close the lobby bar. This was shocking to all of us. You can get a tram to the Bravaro side of the resort but this should not be necessary in my opinion. There is no music by the beach or pool and no activities to entertain all day long, Quite disappointing.Having visited other Adult only resorts this was in that respect truly disappointing.

<Content>Amazing Trip!!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bahia Principe from April 12 - April 19 and fell absolutely in love with this resort!!! Check - in:We arrived at the Bahia Principe Bavaro at around 10:30 pm. We were served by Domingo who was able to really help us out with finding a very good room. Originally we were booked for a suite in Villa 37 which was facing the construction, on the ground floor, and very far from the beach. Three things that we really did not want. When we asked if there were any other rooms closer to the beach, he quickly located a new room in the Ambar section (adults only). We were very happy to be placed here as we originally wanted to book the Ambar but were not successful. He placed us in Villa 67 Room 301. Room:When we got to our room we quickly realized that Domingo had been VERY nice to us ( I think he thought we were on our honeymoon). We had a corner suite with an ocean and pool view. It was the most amazing room. The corner suites are double the size of the regular suites in the Ambar section. We had a King four poster bed, a dining area, a couch, a desk area, and another sitting area, plus a huge balcony with a table and chairs! As well the room was equipped with bathrobes and slippers, a stocked mini fridge, and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was huge with a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower with a rain shower head as well as a regular movable shower head. Our TV didn't work very well and when we called the concierge they sent someone up right away and within 10 minutes the TV was working again. We also had a minor issue with the bathroom, and again, within 10 minutes it was fixed. Every night there was turn down service with chocolates and inspirational quotes and they always managed to tidy our room again even after they had cleaned the room during the day. Pool:The pool was perfect. It was never too full and we never had an issue finding seats. We usually ended up at the pool around 2pm and always found chairs (although they were hardly ever in the shade). The water was always at a perfect temperature and it also had two sections with seats and jets which was very relaxing. The pool was never really full of people and it was definitely quieter than the main pool. We walked over to the main pool once to check it out and hated it. It was very busy with tons of kids, very loud because of all the people and music that the entertainment staff never seemed to stop playing. Not a very condusive environment for relaxing. If you wanted to lounge on a chair you were practically on top of the people next to you. Beach:The beach was absolutely stunning. Always very clean, but difficult to find a chair in the shade unless you got there at 5:30am. We generally ended up at the beach around 9:30am. If you enjoy being close to the water and are a sun baby, there was no issue finding a chair. Again, this was the beach right in front of the Ambar side. If you walked down a little to the main beach area, you'd be lucky to find an empty chair, and it was extremely busy. There were rows and rows of chairs full of people. You literally ended up lying down right next to a complete stranger. And it was very noisy there too. Food and Beverages:We loved, loved the food in the Palmyra Buffet as well as the breakfast buffet in Portofino. These were our favourite spots to eat in the morning and the evening. For lunch we ate at Las Brisas buffet a couple of times, but you had to wait a while to get a table. We found that going to the main snack bar Las Olas was better because it was much bigger. We tried 2 of the a la carte restaurants, Portofino (Italian) and El Olivo (Mediterranean). Our reservations were for later in the evening because we waited until the last minute to book the restaurants. I would recommend booking these as soon you arrive at the resort as they fill up fast (4500 guests!!). We had a 9:30 dinner reservations at Portofino which we weren't particularly happy with. Once we were seated we went to the buffet for our appetizers. After waiting for 15 minutes with no one coming to take our main course order I got up and went looking for a waiter. We spoke to the couple next to us that had been waiting for 45 minutes! I'm not sure why the long wait because at that time there were hardly any patrons at the restaurant. The food was good, but we were unhappy with the long wait. The next evening we went to El Olivo which had very similar food to Portofino. At El Olivo the service was much better. The food was great at both restaurants but we were dissapointed with the service at Portofino.We preferred to go to the buffet as there was more choice and the service was exceptional.As for the drinks, we loved the Banana Mamas. We did try the Mamajuana after reading about it on Trip Advisor, but a word of caution...it is the strongest drink that I have ever tasted. I couldn't finish it. It's a mixture of a whole bunch of hard liquors. I don't know why anybody would want to drink it.The service was great at the Ambar bar. We especially liked Manuel. He was very friendly and we always got great service from him. Entertainment:We went to the night club a few nights and only stayed late once. They mainly play latin music but if you wait long enough, they play English dance music. We enjoyed hanging out in the Pueblo Principe. It felt like we were in a town square with all the shops and tables. We went to the casino a few nights.We didn't really take in any of the shows, so I can't really comment on them. They have a house band that plays the same music every night in the main square, so I guess I'd recommend going to the Tropicana theatre to watch the shows as they are different every night. Resort:We loved everything about this resort. The grounds are perfectly maintained and everything is always very clean. Every time we looked up there was somebody mopping the floors in the lobbies. The maid service was great. They always left the rooms very clean and there was never anything missing. We never used the room safe, but chose to lock our valuables in our luggages instead. The resort is very big so we made use of the trams that run on a regular basis. There was also plenty of security throughout the whole resort. They even had security practically standing in the bushes. Overall we would definitely go back to this resort, but only if it was the Ambar section. If you're not travelling with kids it's worth the extra money to upgrade to this section.We were a little concerned by all the bad reviews before we left, but other than waiting at one of the restaurants we don't have any complaints. I guess if you were staying in the Bavaro or Punta Cana side you may have complaints about the pool and beach being busy, but other than that we don't see why so many people have such bad things to say about the resort. I'm not sure if they're very picky or don't know how to deal with the staff. It's common sense to be friendly with the staff and you have to have patience with the staff if their English is not perfect. You're in a foreign country, embrace the culture and learn some Spanish!We loved the resort and can't describe how happy we were with the staff, service, and the resort in general!!!

<Content>Beautiful resort but disapointed with the staff My husband and I where at the Ambar the week of April 11 and we where at the Gran Bahia Principe - Diamond in March with our children 16 and 20, both resort are very nice, clean and very friendly cleaning staff now for the bar staff that鈥檚 another thing especially the beach bar and the pool bar at the Ambar very very unfriendly people, they don鈥檛 smile, they hardly look at you they look very sad, they really don鈥檛 like their job. I find that very frustrating because when you go on a holiday you want to see smiling and friendly faces. I would go back to the Gran Bahia Principe again, the staff is very different from the Ambar staff except the evening barmaid in the main lobby wow talk about a unfriendly face she is the winner I dont know her name but if you go to the bar lobby you will recognize her right away. Now for the food it鈥檚 very good if you don鈥檛 have a reservation for a la carte restaurant don鈥檛 worry the buffet is very good. If you are looking for a very quiet (I thought it was very boring for my taste) you will like the Ambar. If you are looking for a more lively and friendly people go to the Gran Bahia Principe you will not regret it especially if you have young children, teens they will have a ball. Lots of Ientertainment for them. Its a 5 star for us but 0 for the bar staff.

<Content>Our best vacation so far My wife and I stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar, Adults Only section from March 22 - March 29, 2008. Overall we had relaxing time, we met a lot of great people, had our fair share of beverages and absorbed a ton of sun :)CHECK INAfter a 30 minute drive, we arrived at the Punta Cana section and were quickly shuttled to the Ambar section. Key cards, bracelets and restaurant reservations were provided to us and we were off to our room within 5 minutes. The bell person took our luggage willingly and walked us to our villa. We were in 61117, two villas from the beach and next door to the outdoor pools. It was a short 2 minute walk to the beach and bar.THE GROUNDSThe atmosphere was breathtaking. It was very clean, organized and filled with flowers, bananas, and palm trees. THE SPAMy wife enjoyed an aromatheraphy 50 minute massage in the adults only section for about 2700p = $89 US. The staff was friendly and welcomed you into the spa. Their services were displayed in a book in 4 different languages. We found the spa prices to be more expensive than the Grand Palladium Bavaro Spa. She also had 1/2 hair braided for $30 US on the beach. BEACH AND BARThe beach was clean and fantasic. The staff work very hard to keep the beach and walking areas clean everyday. As the sun came over the horizon, there were staff with rakes and garbage bags, picking up the seaweed that washed up overnight. We did play the palapas (huts) game in the morning. It was quite amusing to see the weary eyed husbands wander out bright and early to place their towels on the beach chairs. On my way back to our room, we would stop and chat with the folks staking their claim at the pool palapas. They had to wait until security let them unload the chairs and place their towels. Usually around 8:00am, then the mad rush for breakfast.RESTAURANTSThe a la carte restaurants were quite good. We tried the Grill (BBQ), Portofino, El Olivo and Don Pablo. We thought the Don Pablo was our best meal and the presentation/service were excellent. The aroma of sweet bananas and cinnamon filled the entrance. We didn't really like the BBQ restaurant, it was very plain, a little undercooked and the meats were not the best cuts. Overall the food was excellent, the buffets had plenty of choice and we were always satisfied. We did have some problems with getting our morning coffee and our evening wine. All we had to do was ask, and we received.PICTURESIf you wanted your picture taken by your camera, all you had to do was ask one of the servers and they were more than happy to do so. EXCURSION - TROPICAL STORM SUNSET CRUISE WITH LOBSTER DINNERWednesday afternoon we decided to experience the Tropical Storm Sunset Cruise. It was the best excursion! The staff were courteous and had a great sense of humor. The drinks were flowing, the music was loud and the people we met were amazing. Lucky for us, our group was made of mainly Canadians. One thing to remember, watch out for that special drink they offer, mamajuana...definitely strong, it looked like swamp water mixed with wood pieces but it was 90 proof and tasted like Disaronno.ROOMThe room was breathtaking, king size poster bed, well cleaned and the turn down service was appreciated. We left pre-packaged gifts on the pillow each morning with our room number and signature. The fridge was stocked daily.OVERALL EXPERIENCEOverall, we had a great time and would return to this resort. The grounds were well kept and the people always friendly.If you like to drink, ask for the Pedro Special at the swim up bar. Tip the staff generously as they work very hard to make this place like paradise!

<Content>One of the Best! A great choice for those individuals who now travel without their children. Although you have to get to the beach and pool early to reserve a shaded area, the beautiful beach more than makes up for the inconvenience. The 'A la carte' restaurants we sampled, other than the Barbecue, were excellent. The food was delicious and hot, the menu varied, and the service outstanding. We had a person at out table celebrating a birthday, and the staff, with no prior notice, produced a birthday cake, bottle of champagne and a Happy Birthday sing a long encompassing most of the staff. Terrific!The only negative comments, and this is strictly constructive criticism, are1. the lunch (buffet style) served at the beach side snack bars lacked imagination and variety.2. the 'buffets' per se morning, noon and night; the food was not the hottest.However, the courteous and helpfulness of the staff, the great 'check in' offered, the great check-out for those leaving end of the day, (they provide the gym for showers etc. prior to departure are great. You are allowed 15 minutes+ of internet use per day.The transport offered throughout the Gran Bahia site is dependable and regular.I would highly recommend this hotel.Donna from Montreal

<Content>Best vacation ever We stayed at the Bahia Principe Ambar April 3-10 2008. What a fabulous place. We were suppose to stay at the Bavaro side, but when we got our package in the bus, we were upgraded to the Ambar side. This section was so much quieter than the Punta Cana and Bavaro side. The Ambar lobby is also smoke free which was very nice. We stayed in villa 60. We had a beautiful view of the pool and beach from our balcony. The rooms were very clean and we had clean towels and facecloths brought to are room everyday. The buffet was excellent. There is plenty of food for every taste. We had tried 3 a la carte. Our favorite was the Japonese. We also went to the gourmet and the Italien on the Ambar side. It was ok, but I prefer the food in the buffet. The beach was so beautiful. We usually went to the beach to get chairs under a Palapas at around 7:30 am, before we went to breakfast. They are hard to find after 09:00 am. We will definitly return to this resort.

<Content>Amba: Beautiful and Immaculate! My husband and I and our friends and spend a lovely week at the Ambar. We flew west jet and the flight was smooth, great staff, very friendly, everything was on time.Our transfer was very efficient, 7 of us to Bahia Principe and then a quick transfer to the Ambar for check in. We were not checked in on the bus but it was quick and efficient when we arrived, the place was full and all week there were offers to go to other resorts owned by BP; later in the week it switched to offers to go to the Majestic. We had requested a corner room in a front building in advance and knowing that there are no guarantees, we got a ground level room in the back. The door was broken so we did not feel safe leaving our belongings, they tried to fix the door, poor guys did not have the proper tools, my husband was holding a pocket flashlight for them. Anyway the room was a bit musty so the next day we requested a move and were moved to building 64 second floor, we loved this room and location, mere minutes to the pool and beach! The room was so clean and lovely, requested more water and diet Pepsi and no problem! We got a welcome gift, rum and t shirts. We left tips (American money) and small gifts every day on the pillow, one day I hope by mistake, they took Canadian money my husband had left with his things on the dresser, plus the gifts I had left for them. So be careful what you leave lying around. Saw the butler the first day, he did not introduce himself, only later did I figure out that is who it must have been, never saw him again even when I went looking.The resort is beautiful, and the cleanest I have ever stayed at, the food was medium, it was good but not great. Always something or usually too much to eat. I was disappointed in the drinks, the mixes were very sweet and not the variety we experienced other years. On the Punta Cana side and Bavaro side the drinks were much better, the drink of the day was better and more variety, not sure why? The drink I liked the best A Dirty Monkey, they would not make at the Ambar, I asked several times. I found the staff very reserved, this could be because many did not speak English well, we did try out our terrible Spanish, and they appreciated the effort and found it humorous. The beach was beautiful, lots of people but did not seem crowded, we walked for miles. The water was so pretty, nice surf, sand so soft. The pool was the cleanest I have ever experienced, lovely.We tried several of the a la carte鈥檚, our favorite was Caf茅 de Paris, nice atmosphere and good service. Next was Don Pablo, again nice atmosphere. We liked the Mexican because of the atmosphere, the food was not great. We had fun and really liked the food at the Japanese, it was a bit confusing they have two Japanese restaurants, with very similar names, we checked at the lobby to make sure we were in the right place and they told us we were, of course we were not and had to hustle to find the right place, several other couples made the same mistake. We also tried Garden grill, and Portofino, the worst by far, had to go the buffet to eat after that one, it seemed to be the consensus of the guests here this week that the Portofino was having problems with food and service at dinner, breakfast was great here, and it was closed for lunch. They tell you there are no reservations but the restaurants were never more that half full usually less that that. They are very fussy about the dress code for men at this resort, we go to 5 stars all inclusive every year and this one was by far the fussiest, you could not go to the buffet in the evening without long pants and closed shoes, and not for lunch or breakfast without sleeves on the shirt. On the other hand women could go with a see through beach cover up with boobs showing and it was not a problem, the standards were inconsistent. One couple arrived and their luggage was lost and the gentleman had no long pants, no exceptions, they would not let him dine at the buffet. They were too rigid in my opinion.The towel game has not changed, but since my husband did not mind getting up early it was not a problem for us.Entertainment, the night we arrived we made it to the disco because we wanted a drink and everything was closed. Not our style but people seemed to enjoy it. We went to the karaoke bar later in the week but it was too smoky to stay. The outside area in the square was nice but we were up early so only made it there once. Went to two shows, Michael Jackson and Lion King, I enjoyed them but my husband was not so keen.Used the internet to keep in contact with home, no problems, a bit of a wait, usually never longer than 20 minutes, depending on the time of day. Other comments: would be nice to have more no smoking sections, there was a lot of smoking and you could not get away from it, the pool and all the bar areas, the lobby did have a designated non smoking area but open air so still exposed to it. Safe: not so safe all you had to do was push reset and anyone could get in to it.Never shopped or did any excursions, we were happy to relax on the beach or by the pool. We found the guests to be friendly and happy, only saw one incident where a guest was being horrible yelling at the staff because he was not happy that there was no pizza ready, give me a break!The resort is huge and a bit confusing, I was addicted to trip advisor so no surprises for me but I think that color coding the different sections would be helpful, easy to get turned around.We liked the Ambar side because it was quiet, people were more sedated, we saw a number of party animals on the Bavaro side.Met lots of wonderful people! Pictures don鈥檛 do this place justice! We like to try different resorts but would consider going back some time in the future, have been to Sandals and the service here is not on the same level but then again either is the price.

<Content>poor service, everything else good We were 4 couples in our 30's staying Mar 31st-April 7th. Overall we had a pretty good experience. We had a short heavy shower everyday and one day it rained all day. It was very windy the first 4 days resulting in the beach being red flagged. I didn't see any mosquitoes outside in the evening but there were a couple in our room over the week.Lobby/grounds: Very nice marble lobby on par with the other 5 star resorts we've been to and the grounds were very lush and nicely maintained. You would never know it was a new resort as the trees and bushes all seemed to be old growth.Room: No complaints. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was big, had a jacuzzi tub and a marble rain drop stand up shower. It seemed to take a good 3 or 4 minutes for the water to come up to temperature which I didn't realize until day 2, day 1 was a cold shower. They were usually pretty good about filling the mini-bar, just one day we didn't get beer. We had turn down service every night, I forgot my wallet on the bed one evening when we went out to dinner, it was still there when we got back and the money was all still there.Beach/pool: Not much to say, the beach is almost perfect and the pool is very nice. I believe the pool is deeper than most all inclusive pools too. We never had problems getting chairs at the beach but the palapas did go fairly early. Pool chairs were usually in short supply but we saw people bringing beach chairs up with no problem.Food: We're not picky eaters and usually stick with the simple stuff like pizza, fries, burgers etc. It does get a bit repetitive but nobody went hungry. Definitely check out the Garden Grill if for nothing else but the appetizers, the chile and the beef stew were probably the tastiest things I ate all week. Don't ask me what the main course was like as I was too full from the appetizers, the dessert was good though :-)Maiko was very good too. The chef really puts on a good show and the whole staff got together at the end and sang us a song for our anniversary which was nice.Service: This is an area they need to work on. The drink service was especially slow at the pool bar and at the lobby. We found the service to be much better at the Bavaro side so hopefully Ambar will improve over time (it is still new after all).Final thoughts: If you're looking for a nice quiet vacation for rest and relaxation then Ambar is for you. If you like to have more than 2 drinks and are traveling with a group I would go elsewhere. If you're the latter and have already booked, hang out at the Bavaro side as much as possible.

<Content>Not overwhelmed with the Ambar We just returned from a two week stay at the Ambar. The hotel is beautiful and the grounds are impressive, but I would hesitate to go as far as saying this is a 5 star resort.There were some positives:RestaurantsThere are 12 a-la-carte restaurants to select from. We visited a few of them and the food/service was excellent at most of them. We only ever used the buffet at the Ambar and it was wonderful with lots of selection. Staff is very accomodating and friendly.RoomsWe had requested and did recieve a room close to the pool and the ocean. Rooms are large and spacious and the bathrooms have a jacuzzi tub and separate shower. They provide slippers and robes for your use which may also be purchased. Every night fresh bath towels and chocolates are brought to your room. Very nice touch. A-la-carte pillows are wonderful. The bar fridge is filled daily and once they know your preferences they do accomodate.The negatives:HousekeepingWe were out of our rooms each day before 9:00, yet our room was never cleaned till late afternoon, usually after 4:00. One minute they'd be in the room directly across from us - then they'd be gone. The only day our room was cleaned early was the day before checkout - to make sure we got the letter reminding us to pay any expenses before leaving.If you want your room cleaned at a specific time, it can be requested. We were having guests visit, so I'd asked the day before for it to be done before 11:00 am. By 12:30 I called because it still hadn't been done - they showed up after 1:00. Why offer this service if they can't do it?During our stay there were many days when the tub wasn't cleaned (if it was they merely rinsed it but left the soap ring); bathroom counter was not cleaned (sticky residue left); our patio was rarely cleaned (a drink spilled on the patio table was sticky for days); face clothes were hit  miss. We tipped for the first 8 or 9 days then quit all together. PoolThe black book in our room says the pool is open from8:00 - 8:00; yet it was closed by 6:00 every night. The book also says pool/beach towels will be exchanged every evening - only one new bath towel was delivered nightly. Guest services told us we had to exchange pool towels at the towel station. Bar service is very slow - only 2 staff for the entire poolside area. This is the only resort we've every been to (including 3 star) that didn't have staff serving the poolside. Beach:For a 5 star resort the beach was not well groomed. At other resorts we've visited, the beaches are raked and cleaned either nightly or first thing in the morning. We saw a few shards of broken glass, cigarette butts, and talked to another couple who saw a used condom.Express Services:Phoned twice for face clothes that never arrived.Asked for two wake up calls; didn't receive either one. Thankfully the one day our tour guide waited for us (45 min. late!) and we didn't lose the $300 deposit we'd put down for our fishing trip!When I complained to the front desk I was told that our clock was wrong - he said the power goes off when the key card isn't in the door. The lights/tv do shut off, but the clock keeps operating. Even if our clock was wrong - we were still in the room at the time the calls should have come in!Bar Service:Sat in the lobby for extensive periods of time without anyone serving us; even when it wasn't busy.Computers:Only 2 computers (in the lobby) for the entire Ambar. Were initially told 20 minutes per session - changed to 15 min. because wait lines were so long. Any other resorts we've visited had separate computer rooms with multiple computers available. Computer area was also very dirty.Guest Services:Asked about a taxi to the shops about a mile down the beach and was told that we couldn't get there by car. She brushed us off and told us about the shops in the plaza of the Bavaro and that the beach vendors have carts set up there as well. My husband ended up walkng the beach to the vendors only to find a huge parking lot filled with cars! Is it her job to discourage tourists from shopping elsewhere?Resort Map:Needs to be updated - only one Italian restaurant shown but when we arrived were told we were at the wrong one. Our reservation was apparently at the one not shown on the map!Restaurant names aren't consistent - map/signage/reservation slips can be confusing.Day Passes:Two visitors sat outside the gates for almost 3 hrs. being told we weren't registered guests (he speaks spanish). We were going to arrange for a day pass ($75 from 9:00 - 6:00 per person!!) but didn't use it that day because of the time/confusion (they provided us a trolly to the front gates to meet our visitors).We were told by the front desk that we would still be charged $75 for the inconvenience. A few days afterwards we'd mentioned this on a survey we'd been given, and were rudely confronted and told we hadn't been charged (which ended up being true, but we didn't know that at the time!!!).A few days later we'd made arrangements for a day/night pass ($300 total for 2 visitors!). They were being dropped off at the front gates and we were to meet them there. Instead of being offered a trolly as previously, we were told we had to walk to the gates (a very long walk and I am physically disabled). During our lunch at the buffet we were approached and told our visitors couldn't eat. After some heated discussion another staff member came over and told us it was okay. Apparently not all staff understand pass braclets!Overall we had a wonderful holiday, but the lack of housekeeping and service (outside of the restaurants) was not what we expected from a 5 star resort. We've travelled extensively and stayed at a few 3-4 star resorts that impressed us much more than the Ambar. When you pay for a 5 star it's the service and the details that make the experience worth the price. We didn't even see a single towel arrangement (swans, etc) - not a huge deal, but again, a detail that is part of the entire experience. Eight years ago we stayed at a 31/2 star in Puerto Plata and had special arrangements every day - something we appreciated.We met people staying at the Bavaro who received much better service in all areas than we did - at a lesser price!Will we return to Punta Cana - probably. Would we stay at the Ambar - unlikely.

<Content>Next to perfect stay at the Ambar!! My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Ambar from March 21-28 (yes i know its a little late putting up a review but got a little busy with normal city life...YUCK).Overall we absolutely loved this area of the Dominican and the resort!! We felt like royalty staying here....so heres our review broken down!!First and foremost our flight and arrival....we flew with air transat (canadian) and had a great flight and super easy arrival. They check your passport and take an entrance form you were given on the plane to fill out and off you go to a little booth where your tour operator tells you what bus to go on. Onto the bus and we chekced in on the bus ride (i.e. we were given our hotel info and bracelets since we wouldn't be getting our room till later that day). Hotel and room:3 words A - MAZ - ING!!!!! the grounds at the hotel are nothing short of immaculate and neither are the rooms. Given that this is a new hotel i would hope that everything would have to be this good.There is a so much space in the room...everyone gets a balcony and i would suggest calling or e-mailing ahead you ensure you get a 2 or 3rd floor room (better to see the pool and beach with) We were directly in front of the pool villa 64....if you can get that its the best...especially when fighting for pool lounges. Wake up at 8 run down and put your towels on some chairs and your set...go back up stairs and go back to sleep or go eat breakfast and no worries about your chairs...they will be there when you get back.One note...your room key runs the electricity in your room so if you want the air conditioning on or you need to charge something....make sure you leave your key in there to do so if you have to leave the room.Pool and beach - Once again they are Amazing....if i ever hear someone complain about these things at this hotel i would consider them crazy!!! Yes there might be a bit of a battle to get some chairs but eventually everyone always finds somewhere to sit. Seriously you are on vacation...are you really going to worry about something like that?! Pool was huge and never that busy in the water and the beautiful white sandy beach was stunning!!Service-The staff at this hotel will stop at nothing to please you....all you have to do is ask....well and tip a bit. Seriously these people make 30 dollars a week you can tip them a little bit for what they do for you. The maids clean you room by mid day and fill your bar fridge (note - leave a dollar in the fridge too if you want a little extra each day). The buttler is there when ever you need him...we personally didn't need him for anything at all but we still got our bed turned down every night at 7 or 8 ready for us when we got back from dinner and such.Food and Bars -We liked the HUGE selection of food here...like any all inclusive theres lots to choose from so if you don't like something just pick something else. We kept the a la cartes they reserved for us to try something new every night...Hey once again if you don't like it just move on to the buffet later on in the night...u will always be full.Great service and lots of food!!!The bars here are good...we didn't like the in pool bar because the service was really slow even if you tipped them but we used the walk up pool bar...great service and good drinks. Otherwise we went to the lobby bar for drinks at night...got the best service in the outside part though!! There is also the disco and piano bars within the other parts of the hotel...we chose not to go there because we heard it was not good....plus we were exausted by 11 every night...and the disco didn't even open till 12....oh well!!Entertainment-We went and watched parts of a few shows that play in the middle of the 3 Bahia resorts they were all pretty good. Hey its somethng to do at night....so why not go check them out!!Other little things:- DONT bother going to the beach market unless you really like to bargain....its a pretty long (but beautiful) walk and you can get the same stuff at the hotel market!!- There are 2 computers in the lobby for free use for e-mailing and such. You might have to wait 15 min or so to use them but its cheaper then making a international phone call.- We went on the ATV day trip as well as the tropical storm day trip and LOVED them both....highly recommend them to anyone who wants to have fun!!- our only real complaints were that the people staying at the hotel weren't very friendly...everyone just kept to themselves and enjoyed their vacation. And that there wasn't an outdoor bar open late on our actual hotel grounds.Hopefully i covered everything!! If you have any questions please message me!!!Hey its a vacation in an amazing tropical location....sit back....relax and forget about the real world for a while. And forget about all those little things that people in north america like to pick on!!!!

<Content>It is very difficult to recommend this hotel UNLESS......................... you enjoy an excellent assortment of food, well appointed rooms, beautiful beaches, clean and attractive grounds, a well maintained pool area, and finally, friendly and helpful staff (everyone from the front desk to the cleaning ladies to the servers). Yes, there were a couple of minor glitches e.g. the phone didn't work in the room (it was fixed) and one day the maid forgot to place towels in the room. Having said that, I have stayed at a number of 45 star hotels (depending on who rates them) and rest assured there are always glitches.As far as the pool area goes, I will reiterate what others have said be prepared to get up early if you want to reserve a spot with shade. The unfortunate part of this is that a number of ignorant people will get up reserve these spots and only use them for an hour or less during the day. The security staff try to do their best but it is amazing how ignorant some people can be.If you have a problem going to another country and expecting everyone to speak perfect English and you are unwilling to use a little patience to try and communicate... DON'T GO as you will only be dissappointed. I saw a couple of people ranting and raving over very minor issues e.g. one man was asked to put a t-shirt on to go into a restaurant for breakfast and he became very belligerent, I don't believe this was an unreasonable request especially since there are notices everywhere about proper dress codes. The other was a person who expected to be able to use the facilities after checking out. It is not the hotels fault that the person and/or the travel agency did not make arrangements for a late checkout. Pretty much any hotel you stay at will not let you use their facility once you check out which is between 11:00am  noon at most hotels.All of the Ambar rooms are within a 5 minute walk to either the main lobby or pool/beach areas. It is roughly 10-15 minutes to the rest of the Bahia property. There are trams operating on a regular basis throughout the entire Bahia property.I will not individually rate the restaurants as everyones tastes are different you will just have to try them. I can be a picky eater and enjoyed all of my meals.  Overall a great vacation spot and would highly recommend it to others.

<Content>room safe!! Just returned from bahia principe Ambar. they offer you a digital safe..you make up your 4 diget code hit reset and enter it again to activate it..simple right!!! well My brother had an idea and tried it out...after you set your code...there is nothing to stop anyone if they really want whats in your safe whole your out..and you won't know it till you try to return t o open it....ANYONE can after you code is set..come in that has a key and hit reset..enter any 4 diget code ...enter it again and it opens..so when you return ..you code will not work because they overrode your code...and by that time it's to late to try to pin down who it might have been...I tried this several times on our safe and as he said it worked...I moved our things out and locked them up elsewhere...I thought wow not as safe as a safe should be...even though they say they no responcible for anything that is not locked up in your safe..I thought...but how safe can you safe really be now..well just a heads up..this I imagine could be done with any type of safe of that type in any resort

<Content>very nice some growing pains 4stars This is a very nice hotel everyone's very helpful .Some language problems ,good idea to learn some basic spanish. Beach is beautiful.Rooms very nice, if your in to tv forget it's very limited. Ambar main buffet restaurant excellent,all Ambar restaurants top notch!i Found that a lot of the patrons had no social graces poor manners ,just short of white trash .It's not a bad idea to learn how to hold a knife and fork before you go and know how to properly dress for dinner even on a vacation a little class is OK!After talking with other vacationers at the resort there were minor problems,but if you ask questions and are friendly they are resolved quickly!Just keep in mind sugar is better then vinager !Being adult only it is very quiet and very secure,if you don't have the right wrist band, your out of there ! The pool closing at 6:00 is to make sure no retards drown! and it's dark anyway! I'm sure next year when I return for two weeks it will be even better!As you will notice all photo are the same all very nice shots of the area! Ambar is just short of a five rating as there is always room for improvment!

<Content>Do NOT go to Gran Bahia! This was TERRIBLE! The service was SLOW and the staff were arrogant!They had a colored wristband system that was confusing and obnoxious in that the hotel staff would prevent you from going to resort areas and kick you out as well if you did not have the right colored wristband! Poor signage and the staff did not speak english. You never know where you are! The hotel staff will also LIE to you about what's included with the color wristband you have!DO NOT GO TO THIS RESORT UNLESS YOU'RE SENDING SOMEONE YOU HATE TO IT AS A JOKE!

<Content>Yes, beware Gran Bahia overbooks!! I have to totally agree with another reviewer that this resort overbooks and then makes no attempt to rectify the situation. Imagine getting a confirmed reservation, paid in full, landing in another country, taking a private car transport to the resort, heading the the front desk and being told....no place here for you...yes we have your money...stay somewhere else if you can find it, pay through the nose...and fight for a refund when you get home...poor, poor, non-existent customer service. I've never experienced something so vile in all my travels. Forewarned.....but I pity those who do not read this forum.

<Content>The Best Vacation Ever Traveled for 2 weeks on 22 Mar - 05 Apr 2008. Everything at the Ambar was fantastic. Beautiful rooms, great food, service excellent, and the people were great except for the people who were vacationing and wanted their A$$ wiped. The only problem was some of the abnoxious guest who treated the staff like second class citizens, how embarassing for adult people to act like spoiled children.If you want a hut at the pool area, yes you have to get up around 7 am and wait till 8 am when they set up the chairs, but I met great friends doing this. We were not much of beach people so I'm not sure about that area. The 1st week the weather was beautiful and hot, lots of pool chairs anytime of the day. The 2nd week weather got very windy so more people were up at the pool area, so they dragged chairs from the beach up, no problem.Food excellent, if anyone went hungry, it is them who have a problem, not the hotel, and I'm a fussy eater. The only thing I noticed was the main buffet a bit chilly with the air condition, but it could of just been me.The only thing that I would suggest is that the show start a bit eariler, or have 2 shows per night, one early one and one late one. Laying in the sun all day is exhusting, so I got pretty tired around 10:30 pm. Pool bar servers were excellent, the only problem were the rude guest screaming or complaining that their drinks were not coming fast enough. Well the solution to that was to get to know them by name and ask politely and hand them a $1 tip if you wanted to and I was always served promptly, even when I didn't want a drink, it was there. Pedro, Yina and Yesenia were all great bar tenders. They work hard and do not need to put up with abnoxious people screaming at them all day.Maids for the rooms were excellent, mini bar always stocked full of whatever you asked for, sister only drank pepsi and they changed the diet, 7up and orange for pepsi. No problems, for more beer or vodka if you asked politely.My motto on this trip is if you ask politely you shall received, don't just sit back complaining about poor service if you are to lazy to ask, they are not mind reader, the staff all work hard and they put up with alot of *%@, but always have a smile on their faces.

<Content>Nice but definitely not 5 star My wife and I stayed at the Ambar 3/26-3/30. This is a beautiful resort on a fabulous beach. The grounds are well-maintained. We came expecting five star treatment but it definitely fell short. We are definitely not picky people and by no means let the shortcomings ruin our vacation, but just some things to note about our stay.Transfers......a breeze through BP USA. We had a private van take us both ways and we have never had quicker transfers.Check in was fine - we arrived about 1PM and they didn't have our room ready yet. So, we hung out and had some drinks!The room was our most laughable experience. They are of course new, modern accomodations. We had 3rd floor in building 67 overlooking the palms trees/ocean. Very pretty. The attention to detail was lacking. Our shower head seemed to be about ready to fall off the wall. My wife was lying in the tub and could see through some missing grout in the tile out through a grate into the hallway! Best of all, we couldn't figure out why out mattress didn't seem to be the cushy pillowtop which was advertised. I pulled back the sheets on the last morning and realized that it was UPSIDE DOWN. How can this possibly get by staff????Food....only good eats we had were the Mexican restaurant (best service by far was at non Ambar restaurants) and the Don Pablo. The service was poor at Portofino and the house wine is really quite bad. The other thing we found funny was a guy was constantly mopping around the tables while we were dining at Don Pablo. We kept looking at the couples around us and we all found it kind of amusing that this guy literally mopped the floor around us 4 times during dinner.Drinks/bars. Lobby bar seemed to be most consistent. Have a caipirina........they're fabulous. Pool bar was REALLY slow and the bartender's didn't seemed too thrilled to be there.Staff in general was friendly. All other AI's we've been to in the past, the staff you pass walking through the resort would greet you and smile. Didn't seem to happen much at this resort. And the butler...........what butler. Never saw a butler our entire stay. We ordered newspapers and pillows but never saw our personal butler drop by to attend to our requests.I did send a note upon our return to let the manager know about the issues in the room, etc. I got back a response that basically said that since we didn't bring them up during our stay they didn't seem to be valid. I was a bit disappointed in the response.Overall, this place is new which I think explains some of the shortcomings. It has a long way to go to become 5 star so if you are looking for a flawless luxurious vaction spot, this is definitely not it. That being said, again, don't let the little things ruin your trip. Punta Cana is a beautiful place to spend a few days in the sun.

<Content>Nice but won't return Just returned from a week at the Ambar which we booked through our travel agent and Apple. There were many positives about this resort but also in comparison to some other places we have stayed just didn't measure up. Positives: Adults only and very quiet. The beach is the most beautiful beach we have been to (comparing to Cancun, Jamaica and Puerto Vallarta). The workers were fantastic at the resort. The waitresses, maids, groundskeepers, bartenders, etc. were all very hard working, friendly and made our stay fun. I enjoyed the aerobics on the beach and wish it hadn't been so windy a few of the days so I could have participated every day. The room was one of the best with a nice size jaccuzi tub, great shower and everything in tip top condition. The bed was the most comfortable as well. We left the maid small tips every day and she was great. When we had specific requests we tried hard to write them in spanish and she always accommodated us. On our first full day she didn't get to our room until about 5:00 and apologized up and down, we told her not to worry about it no problemo and it was always cleaned by early afternoon after that.Food was ok. As usual, the breakfast was the best. We ate at Don Pablo, El Olivo, Portofino, El Charro, El Pescador and Maiko. The best was the Japanese Maiko. The other resorts were ok while my boyfriend enjoyed the steaks, etc. much more than I enjoyed the seafood. No complaints, but can't really rave about the a la cartes. Positive?Negative? Watching the daily fight for palapas and chairs was hillarious. We realize that this was probably the busiest week of the year, so we kind of expected to not get the choice chairs or at times much needed shade from the hot sun,but in order to get the prime spots or even a pool chair, there were people out at the pools at 6:15 in the morning and security would not let them touch the chairs until 8:00 a.m. This was really bad when a few days of very high winds made it hard to be on the beach without being sand blasted. Overall though, we always found a nice place to sit whether we wanted to be by the pool or on the beach, we just had to be patient. Drinks at the Punta Cana lobby bar were MUCH better than at the Ambar. Negatives: Our room overlooked a smelly garbage bin making it impossible to use our balcony for anything at all or to ever open our sliding doors on our balcony. Needless to say, there was NO view. Requests to change rooms were met with, You paid for a room -- you got a room. We were very friendly and nice, etc. attempted to speak Spanish as much as possible, but before even talking to us to see what we wanted, the manager stated very arrogantly, So, what is wrong with your room? Front desk management was very rude, unfriendly, sarcastic and willinginly took tips (bribes) but chuckled at not providing services he promised. We were quite amazed at the lack of knowledge at the front desk as well. They refused to even give directions to places in their own resort. We have in the past never been treated this rudely. We are quite easy to get along with and are unsure whether or not they were cranky because it was peak season, but they shouldn't take it out on the customers. While we had requested a change in room if possible, not necessarily today, etc. the management was rude to us before even knowing what we wanted. This was what really tainted our opinion of the Ambar. We were on a search for a place to return to with our families to get married and were able to cross this one off of our list due to the management at the front desk. Despite the negative, we had a fantastic time walking the beach, enjoying the water and sun, etc. which really is the point. We will return to the Punta Cana area, just not here.

<Content>Nice, but would not come back We have just came back from Bahia Ambar on Sunday. We actually booked Bahia Punta Cana, but were bumped to Ambar b/c Bahia Punta Cana is overbooked. If you are deciding on whether to pay more for Ambar side of the hotel, the answer is NO. If you are deciding whether to book it all together, book somewhere else. I can not say that out stay was horrible, but there were definitely a few things that spoiled the mood. We were lucky to get bumped to Ambar as Bahia Punta Cana is a disaster ( in my opinion). It is SO CROWDED, overbooked, there is no space on the beach, can not comment on the food, since we did not eat on Bahia Punta Cana's side. As far as Ambar- did not have a problem with finding a spot on the beach, however people were arriving and it seemed to get very busy. The major complaint is the FOOD. It did not live up to any reasonable expectations. Poor choice, mostly pizza, pasta  hamburgers. Restaurants were great-especially Japanese and Gourmet. A lot of confusion with reservations. Overall, it was an OK hotel, but we are not coming back.

<Content>Nice Resort We stayed at this resort for one week from February 27th-March5th and booked with our local travel agency thru Apple Vacations. Arrival: SmoothAfter the long, direct flight from Milwaukee, we were delighted to see the open-air airport in Punta Cana. We love the very tropical-feel it offered. Everyting moved quickly---from getting our luggage to our private 30 min. transfer to the Bahia. Check-in was a breeze.We originally booked this trip for the Punta Cana side of the Bahia. However, when we arrived at the resort we were told we were upgraded to the Ambar section. I later found out from our Apple Vacations rep. that they were overbooked in the Punta Cana/Bavaro side so they bumped us to the Ambar. It was a wonderful surprise. I guess this is another reason to book with a travel agent!!Rooms: Overall ImpressedWhen we first arrived to our room, our electricity did not turn on so we had to call the front desk. It took two phone calls but someone did arrive to tell us that our room key was not working correctly as it operates the elecricity. We had to hoof it to the Punta Cana Lobby to get new keys, no big deal, we always have these little thing go haywire on our first day no matter where we go.We were amazed how nice the room was now that we had some light to see. The bathroom was large with a seperate shower, jacuzzi tub and toilet area. We had a four-post king bed with netting which was a nice touch. At first I didn't think the robes and slippers would be necessary but we used them everyday. The safe was included as well. I'm not sure if this was common or not, but there was a note welcoming us-letting us know they already made 4 reservations at the resturants for us. This was a nice touch, however, we didn't want to eat at those particular sites, so we rescheduled without problems the next day.Although we left money for the maid, we felt she didn't do anthing outstanding for us, maybe we didn't leave enough $$. On occasion, we did have to hunt someone down for more water. I heard others' had Pringles left in their room and little bottles of rum, but that wasn't the case for us. We weren't too bothered by this, were not big drinkers and we ate enough at mealtime. The room was clean when she was done.Food: Very SatisfiedGoing into the vacation and reading reviews of the DR, I wasn't expecting much. However, I was extremely impressed by the variety of food on the buffets and the taste was better than I thought. The breakfasts always seemed to be the best at AI's so we usually fill-up there and skip lunch. The resturants we chose were Don Pablo (french), Portofino (Italian), the Mediterranean and Mexican. Of all we enjoyed the French and Meditteranean. The Mexican rest. was ok and Italian was terrible, especially the service. We wish we would have ate at the buffet more often for dinner.Beach and Pools: Awesome!We enjoyed most of our time on the beach only becuase the water was so beautiful to look at. We took long walks in both directions and were surprised by how clean the beaches were, and the soft white sand felt great on the feet. We did have a hard time finding chairs with palapas, however plenty of chairs in direct sun. It was even harder to find chairs by the pool. Unless you were there asap in the am--good luck. We did use the pool one day because it was really windy on the beach.Gym/Spa: AverageI thought the gym on the Ambar side could have been nicer. Don't get me wrong, it was nice, they had a few TMs, ellipticals, bikes and free weights. The nicest part was that it was airconditioned but had a strong mildew smell to it--welcome to the tropics. Since I workout everyday at home it was nice to get in a decent workout on vacation--especially eating like we did. The Spa was quite small on the Ambar side but it was nice, no dipping pools like the other side. I enjoyed a chocolate wrap which was nice, and I thought the prices were adequate.Service: Below averageWe really enjoyed our stay but the service was horrible!! We are not high-maintenance or needy people. We heard from others that the service isn't like Mexico or other Carribbean islands but we thought we'd check for ourselves--they were right!!! We did wait quite long for drinks at the Lobby bar, no big deal we got up and ordered from the bar. Waiting for coffee in the am in the buffets was another story. The service was mostly hit or miss---mostly miss.We also didn't think that staff members were overly friendly. We never used the trams to get around the resort, we always walked on the service road. Whenever we passed workers, they would rarely smile or say hola first, except for the landcaping crew. We've only been the Riviera Maya area of Mexico and thought they are such friendly outgoing people, this was not the case in the DR.Excursions: Golfing-great!My husband is the only person that left the resort to golf 2 times. He chose to golf the Teeth of the Dog couse near LaRomana and Punta Blanca. He enjoyed both. He booked thru gogolfreservation.com, or something like that, he was happy he did, everything went as planned. Like I said earlier, I thought this was a beautiful resort and would recommend it to others. I didn't think it was so great we'd want to go back, there are too many other places to visit in the Carribbean.

<Content>Our first all inclusive and trip to DR We booked our trip through Apple Vacations and stayed at the Ambar from 03/26 - 03/30/2008. This was our first Apple, all inclusive and DR vacation.We arrived via Ryan International and breezed through Customs, by just giving them the Customs form and $10US. Our picture was taken with two lovely women dressed in DR fashion. The picture was colorful and professional, about a 5x7 and cost $8 which we purchased on our way out of the country. The pictures are posted on a board.There are plenty of guys who will assist you with your luggage, however we wanted to keep ours with us at all times. Once we got our luggage and followed crowd we were asked where we were going and told which bus to get on. The 30-40 minute ride was wild! OMG! The air conditioning did not work very well either. My husband said it was a good thing I couldn't see how the driver was passing vehicles with on coming dump trucks coming right at us. There are new blacktop roads in construction and lots of heavy equipment moving around.We arrived at the Bravaro lobby and luckily one of the bell boys told us we had to wait for the Ambar tram. Another couple did not hear this and went and stood in the Bravaro lines. From other reviews, I was expecting this although it isn't clear when you arrive.I sent an email to the resort about 2 weeks prior requesting a king room, close to the beach/pool and on an upper floor. I got a quick, friendly response inidicating that although they couldn't guarantee it, they would note the reservation. Hmmmm, I also asked this of the Apple rep, but it didn't appear Ambar reservations had that request.We were on the third (top) floor of building 60. Right by the pool and closest to the ocean. As everyone else mentions, it is a beautiful room/bathroom. Our bathroom door wouldn't close and the glass door for the toilet room didn't close either. I attributed this to new construction issues and decided not to get upset about it. I finally figured out if I closed the bathroom door with all my weight, it would close;)We had a plate of fresh fruit in our room. Not t-shirts and a bottle of rum like some other guests seem to get. The bell boy told us about the card in the slot to keep the air on. (The card was put there by the staff.) He also told us about the open patio door affecting the air. We went out on the balcony once. We were concerned about getting locked out there, so we left it open a couple of inches. Well that screwed up the air conditioning for the whole night. I could not lock the patio door to get the air to turn back on. We just used the ceiling fan that night. First thing in the morning I called Express Service (2 such bottons on the phone) and she asked me about the patio door. I told her I couldn't even lock it. She said she would send a tech. We went to breakfast and by the time we returned, it was functioning. Needless to say, we didn't go out on the balcony again. We didn't see anyone else on their balconies either.Flat screen tv in room, no remote. We didn't feel like dealing with obtaining one and kept the tv off for the 5 days we were there. That's a novelty for us - especially my husband;)The free safe was a great feature. We put anything we would not want stolen inside, the same as we do in the U.S. The only problem was trying to figure out how it worked. The informational binder in the room indicates the instructions are in the closet. Not ours. I called and the operator told me what to do.The informational binder also indicates the pool stays open until 8:00 - it does not, which is a shame at an adults only resort.,The Ambar lobby bar closes at 11:00 :( Also, I like to drink coconut rum and they did not have this. I was having trouble trying to think of something to drink, when another kind guest brought me the drink menu from her table and told me she thought it may help.After reading all about the palapa issues, we decided we weren't going to get crazed and get up early to try to find one. Life is hectic enough. We always found a chair, and tried to find a spot under a palm, etc. What worked the best for us was taking our Bubba Kegs out to the swim up bar, get them filled happily by Pedro (always smiling) and staying in the shade around the bar or under the palm trees by the little island in the pool. (Ask Pedro to make you a Pedro's Special!)I'm not going to comment about the quality of the food. With so many people from all over the world there, what I might think is great, someone else may not. However my husband has Celiac disease and cannot eat any gluten and I gave our waiters in the 2 ala cartes we went to, a Spanish version of the gluten free dining card and they understood and were more accomondating than the restaurants in the US. Service was slow at El Olivio and at the tables in the Ambar lobby at night. We used bottled water for everything. We didn't drink the water served at our meals and we did not get sick.We didn't go on any excursions. Partly because we got lost trying to find the informational meeting room and missed 95% of the Apple rep's presentation, the surf was very rough and we were only there a few days.We went to the casino. It's one room with about 25 slots and table games on the other side. I won $200 on a one cent machine! We were surprised anyone wins here. So all in all, we left up $100!We went to the Lion King show. Too bad it's a taped sound track. It's also at about the same level as a high school or middle school production, but it kept all the children's interest which was fun to see. I'm not sure, but I think I got sand flea bites from the rattan chair with cushion I sat on at that show. We tipped the maid and the bar stocker (who I think was our maid). We left $2 first day, $3 second day, $4 third day  gifts with a note of what we wanted in the mini bar (we left this in the fridge) and we left the same amounts and some gifts on the pillow each day and we left one tip on our final day. In the Apple materials, it indicates the servers tips are included but not the maids and luggage handlers. We left servers tips for drinks as we do in the U.S. and tips for servers if they went above and beyond.The Apple rep road with us back to the airport. The ride was much more subdued and the air conditioning was a lot better. Hmmm.Since we do not have anything to compare this trip to, we must say the employees, even if they are off shift, still smile and say hola. They are all neatly dressed in uniforms and I've got a new attitude towards the service we get in the U.S. since our return. People ask if we would return and our answer is yes.

<Content>Overbooks on purpose! - STAY AWAY! Look out! Gran Bahia Principe purposely overbooks their resorts to make sure they are booked to capacity. I booked the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar through Expedia. When I emailed the resort to make dinner reservations, I was informed that they couldn't find our reservation. After pursuing this with Expedia (6 hours of telephone calls), I found out that the resort took the money, but never accepted the reservation. Had we shown up at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar, they would have told us to call Expedia and we would have been without a room.Check out the forum on this website. You'll see that this is a common issue with the Punta Cana locations of the Gran Bahia Principe. Again, DO NOT BOOK THIS RESORT![--]

<Content>Ambar a Good Choice We were originally scheduled to stay at the Punta Cana, but changed to the Ambar at check in. This turned out to be a great move.We were seeking a quiet relaxing vacation and the Ambar is an adults only option. So the hotel, pool area, and beach were just what we were looking for.Our room was nice and the location (6300 building) was quite convenient for the Ambar lobby, buffet restaurant, outdoor patio, and workout area. The grounds were immaculate and very colorful.We enjoyed the Machado (Japanese) and Pechado (Seafood) ala carte restaurants the best. I also was pleased with the quality and selection of the buffet restaurants. The Ambar also provided an exclusive breakfast/lunch option and also a nice outdoor restaurant at lunchtime (with a great view of the ocean.)The beach was beautiful but quite crowded. From the people we visited with, it sounds like the long cruel winter drove everyone to look for sunshine. Punta Cana is no longer a secret and this was evident by the hundreds of people on the beach.We took an excursion to Saona Island. The highlight was the flying fish that accompanied the catamaran on the way to the island. Saona was very picturesque, but I could have done without the music that was blaring throughout our time there.We also took a trip to explore La Cana Golf Course, just beyond the airport. This course is a beauty by the sea.The waiters and bartenders at the Ambar really hustle. They are very polite, pleasant, and have good senses of humor. The Ambar was at peak capacity, so try to keep that in mind when service is a little slow. I brought $100 worth of $1 bills and left a small tip every time we ate and had a drink. The servers and bartenders were very appreciative. My wife and I speak just a little Spanish, but this came in handy. The Gran Bahia is very much an international destination. We heard French, Italian, and German in addition to English spoken there. The only thing that kept this trip from being perfect, was the volume of people and the occasional guest who needed to let everyone know that the 24 ounce mug they brough from home needed a refill. Otherwise the Ambar and Punta Cana is a beautiful destination.

<Content>Can't Wait to Get Back Here Again! We were at Ambar from March 22 to the 29, 2008. We booked trhough Trip Central.ca and flew Skyservice. I chose this place primarily because of the great reviews and traveller photos posted on this site. Boy, the pictures just don't do this place any justice. I found it very hard to capture the look and feel of Ambar through the lens of my camera. It is just so much better than any photo I took so I will just let the other traveller photos speak for me. Everything I saw on the posted photos was better in real life.We arrived earlier than the 3 pm check in time but after joking a bit with the front desk clerk, were immediately whisked up to our ggorgeous and spacious room in building 67 - the best building in my opinion. Right next to the the pool and excellent beach views. We asked for a top floor but got the 2nd. No problem. Room was huge, clean and the fridge was stocked with Pringles, Presidente beer, water, Pepsi, little bottles of Bacardi and scotch etc. YAHOOO! Our bathroom was simply A1- A huge marble walk in shower with glass door and large rainshower fawcet plus an extra massage tool. HELLO paradise. You also get a his and hers robe and slippers - nice touch. Our safe was also included in the cost of the package, nice touch and needed. The closet was huge and well appointed with hangers and lots of storage and shelving.I left our maid a tip right on the first day - 10$ US and she deserved every penny of it. Furniture was top of the line, flat screen TV was a bonus. Our patio furniture on the Amar sife was a solide marble table with wraugt iron chairs- beautiful and comfy.The pool is amazing with blue tiles, 2 separate bubbly areas to relax in and plenty of room. You do have to get your chair early if you want a good spot. This was the only Job I had to do all week, but it forced me to get up early and get the most out of the day. It is so nice to sit by the pool at 8 am with barely anyone around, the ocean breezes blowing and QUIET!Our food choices were superb. The Potofino - RIGHT NEXT TO THE BEACH - offered a great morning buffet in elegant surroundings, marble floor, spotless  well stocked buffet and gerat service. They also have a self serve Mimosa and Bloody Mary station every morning. Fresh OJ and champagne plus the Cold Vodka bottel with fresh Tomato juice. I pigged out on the smoked salmon every morning. I'm sure I ate hundreds of dollars of it by the time we left.We also ate at the other larger breakfast buffet at Ambar - just off the main lobby bar. It was just as good as the Portofino - just a bigger selection. We ate here for lunch and dinner a few times and was so impressed with the selection and freshness of everything. Great bread, pasta, fish - freshly grilled to your specifcation and meats. I truly enjoyed the organic flavour of the chicken and beef. It was not like the north american meats. The beef was a bit tougher because most of the beef is free range in the DR. The Chicken was juicy and tasty.The Japanese restaurant was great for the entertainment, but the food was bit overcooked. No problem, dessert made up for it and the excellent appetizers they gave us.Don Pablo was excellent as well. The PAris one wasn't so great but it may have been because we had a 9:30 sitting. It wasn't very French at all but tasty. The Brazillian restaurant was a bit weird. Very informal - it is a beach snack bar buffet during the day - Buffet style but then they bring cooked meat over to you on a big sword. It was usually overcooked and tough. But the chicken was the best of the bunch. Beef and Bacon ? Sounded good but was overcooked. I liked the concept and it was fun to see what they would bring out next on the sword!THE BEACH - WOW,. I can't say much more about it. Soft white sand, blue water, windy but not too hot. Great for walking. I walked the beach a couple of times and swam in other areas apart from the Principe resort - farther down there are about 2 more other hotels- their swimming areas were a bit bigger. The Ambar and Bavaro beach is great but the swimming area is roped off so that boats and water taxi's can boot around. I found it a bit annoying with the the parasailers all over the place and the Banana boat stuff - stinking up the air with motor gassy smells. BUT WHATEVER. I just moved to a different area. I tried to snorkel but was a bit paranoid about getting run over by a boat. Besides, there wasn't much to see underwater anyway.The shows at the Tro^picana were interesting. The one on Saturday night was the best - dancing from around the world. The facility is excellent and I liked sitting on the comfy rattan chairs, with the wind blowing through. THE STAFF WERE GREAT. Always smiling and cleaning everything. It was spotless and very well maintained. We commented on how the kitchens at Ambar resembled a hospital operating room, people were cleaning and mopping and inspecting all the time. Remember, the hotel has its own water purification system and uses that water to cook and wash in. I never felt sick or had any problems even when I returned. The drinks are generous. They actually cut my husband off after they served him 3 martinis - which is about 6 shots +. He was feeling a bit woozy. We booked a couples massage the last night we were there at the main SPA - not the Ambar Spa ( smaller than the main one). We booked it early on which was smart because it is very busy and worth every penny. It was my first ever massage, but will not be my last. The spa was clean, staff was friendly and spoke enough English to get by - Thank god I can speak decent French as well, it got me by a few times.I 'm sure I am forgetting a bunch of stuff but I hope I covered the basics. My only minor complaint was the crappy departure time of 11:10 am, which meant we had to leave the hotel at 7:25 am and wait at the airport for hours - what a waste of perfectly good sun. I hope they keep up the quality at Bahia Principe Ambar and the other 2 - Bavaro and Punta Cana, because I am coming back.

<Content>Ambar is Wonderful Wow what a great week at Ambar. We arrived on Good Friday and after a quick transfer from the Airport we were checked in and made our way to the beach. At 2.30pm we received our room keys 鈥揃uilding 62 corner room which has a little bit of extra floor space. Room was fantastic similar to theBahia Principe but with a separate shower stall and nice big balcony. This was our first Adults Only resort and we really enjoyed that everyone was very relaxed without the kids. We ate at all three alacartes and they were great also went to the Japanese and it was good. Made all our dinner reservations in a matter of minutes with no waiting at the concierge in the Ambar lobby the pools were good and the beach was fantastic. You do have to get down early to get the prime spots but I鈥檓 an early riser so we always had a palapa front and centre.The staff was nice and polite a little more laid back than GBP Punta Cana or Bavaro. Also had the pleasure of meeting Laura of the Guest Relations/sales dept and she was sweetheart鈥his was our fourth trip to a Bahia Principe and we defiantly look forward to many more鈥?/p>

<Content>Not a 5 star hotel We just got back from the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar.What we liked:鈥?Beach is beautiful and well maintained鈥?Great landscape 鈥?Rooms are well furnished and the housekeeping staff does a great job鈥?I like that we were already pre-registered. We received our room keys, bracelet, and reservations to various restaurants on the bus on the way to the resort. Once we got to the resort, we then needed to get on the shuttle to get to the Ambar section. No cars/taxis/buses allowed in the Ambar section鈥?No complaints about the food. We did go to the Japanese restaurant (in the Bavaro complex) and it was great. We enjoyed the buffet. Food was good and they offered a variety of itWhat we did not like:鈥?We thought that we were going to an adult resort. Yes, the Ambar section is for adults only; however, if you want entertainment and or want to drink past 11:00 pm, then you need to go to the Bavaro complex. The lobby bar closes at 11:00 pm. The pool closes at 6:00 pm. My husband was swimming when the security guard kicked him out of the pool. The book that they provide you in the room does state that pool is open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm but apparently the book is wrong and the pool closes at 6:00 pm. We were at an adult resort but we were treated like children鈥?Before 8:00 am, you will not be able to get a chair near the pool. Since the pool opens at 8:00 am, they will not allow you to get a chair or put your towel on the chair. If you put your towel on the chair, the Security guard will remove it. We didn鈥檛 really mind as we stayed on the beach. 鈥?When we were looking in the brochure for this resort, it stated that they have a reading room, where you can read, play cards or game boards. However this room is always closed and they do not allow any guests in the room.鈥?Mini Bar: It was rarely stocked and if it was stocked, you were only allowed 2 beers and 2 bottle of water鈥?Front desk staff at the Ambar: Rude, rude and rude鈥︹€?鈥?Service is slowOverall, the resort was beautiful. We were fortunate to have great weather. Tip: Bring a bubba keg with you so you don鈥檛 need to keep waiting at the bar for drinks.

<Content>Great Resort We Stayed at the Ambar from March 15-22 2008. Overall our experience was a great one. When arriving at the airport, we had to walk along the tarmac to get in and as soon as you enter the airport a few of the workers take a picture with you which is posted on a wall when you leave. You can buy it for $8 USDThe food as the buffet was great. There was a large selection. At breakfast the mimosas and the churros are the best. You can also go to the Italian for breakfast. We went to a couple of alacartes. Mikado was by far the best one, the food was great and so was the service. It was nice seeing them cook the food right in fromt of you. El Olivo was good as well but the Mexican was a let down, the service was okay and the food was not very good. Although they tell you, you can use any of the facilities on the other resorts - you cant use the buffets there. The room was really nice with a king size pillow top mattress. Our fridge was always restocked and our towels were always there as well. Its easy enough to get around the resort with the trams always going through the resort. The shows in the eveninge were okay. There is one at the tropical at 9.30 and another at the pueblo principe (main square) at 11. At the tropical the ones worth watching were the michael jackson and the circus one. To call home, the cheapest way is to dial directly from your room. Just dial 9 then 1+ area code + number. You can use the internet in the lobby (you are allowed 20 min per day per room)A note about the vendors in pueblo principe - they are quiet aggressive and also expensive. We found that the stores in the complex had better prices without any haggling. The pool was nice but we found it quiete cold but that could be because at the time we were there, there were high tides and heavy winds. We would say it is definately worth a try.

<Content>Perfecto My husband and I just returned from our first vacation at the Gran Bahia Principe resort. We had emailed before arriving to request an upper floor room as close to the beach as possible as provided through our Golden Club reservation. We can tell you that the food, beach, ocean, pool and accomodations were just perfect. We have been to Punta Cana many many times but this was our first stay at the Gran Bahia. The staff accomodated us in every way possible. From the receptionist at the Golden Club, believe her name was Milagro, to Juana our room attendant, it was so very wonderful -- from our arrival to departure. The complex is very large and can be a maze of confusion, but by making all of our a la carte reservations for us at check-in, updrading us to the Ambar all adult section and providing easy help and transportation back and forth we felt comfortable and secure. The food was some of the best we've had and we have been to some of the finest hotel complexes in Punta Cana. The beach was large and perfectly maintained and the Rum and Presidente served without wait at the Ambar pool, beach and lobby bars wasn't bad either. Thanks to all the staff for accomodating our requests and for the additional courtesies extended throughout. We will return.

<Author>BeachBumIeeeee
<Content>Glad we picked the Amber.....This review more about tips ! Instead of telling everyone what an awesome holiday we had, I thought I would help you make yours even better, if that is possible. 1) Book ALL your a la Cartes before you leave! Email addresses are posted in the forums. They will automaticaly book you 4, but we had no plans to use the Buffet , so we requested all of them. Our choices were based on reviews. If you want the best service you can ever have, request the early seatings (6:30/7) depending on the location. I am reading reviews that some of the service was not good, that it is hard to imagine since we ate a la Carte every night  not one was disappointing. Early seatings may have helped. I wished we booked one or two later as it would have been nice to have more time in the lobby to have that second Martini. However, gives you time to shop or catch a show afterwards. Food was good, some awesome. it really depended on what you ordered. For example, I ordered Rib Eye (cut thinner)@ the Garden Grill  should have ordered the Strip Loin( thick). When I saw the other cuts come out, I kicked myself. The food courses you expect @ high end in GTA. 2 Starters, soup, entree, desert etc. Some have Salad Bar, but just way too much food. You could almost make a dinner in itself. One example of the service. My wife was just leaving the table to go to the washroom when the food arrived. Instead of putting it on the table, they insisted on bringing it back to a hot plate in the kitchen for a few minutes so it would not get cold. 2) Email in advance your building request. There are 3 buildings right on the beach. I asked for one building 3rd floor, but got one of the others. Funny, but it turned out to be a better spot.3) As others said, eat breakfast @ Portifino restaurant. Quiet  beautiful  right on the beach. It opens @ 8 as the Main buffett opens @ 7. 4) We are beach people, so never had a problem with a chair in the sun, but if you want a Palpas get there 7-7:30. Pool chairs seemed to fill up by 7:30, but the couple days before we left, much quieter. We did go High Season.5) If you don't like the crowds, go to the beach on the North side. There is no Hotel for a stretch that way  very peaceful. They had the water stuff (sailboats etc) that way  Yoga/Pilates in the morning  aerobics @ Noon. Had some music playing during the day, but only loud for the work-out. It is close to the Beach Bar, nicer lunch buffet, they serve you drinks  food much nicer then snack bar. There is still lots of walkers if you like to people watch, but not piled over top of you like the bigger Bahia side.6) The beach @ the Amber is one of the best on this stretch mainly because of the depth  much quieter. We walked 45-1hour each way. It is also level  if you read any of the comments re: storm surge, we had little or no affects. Some of the other resorts beaches are a mess. Boats are not so bad on the north part either. They do come close, but only due to the reef. Swimming areas are roped off. I had a chance to see the beach @ the Excellence  it was georgous too. Water a little rougher, but rolling surf. Not much to be seen on either side of this resort so beaches much quieter...definitley less people. 7) I agree with one of the negative reviewers about excursions. Careful from the beach venders. We booked ATV for half a day. It was Okay, people running it were not very friendly. Found it to be more of a tourist trap stopping at gift shops that sold the same crap everywhere else..maybe a family member running the shop. it seemed that way. The guys with the dune buggies wanted to fly around  found it boring. Careful what you book  with whom.8) The shows were Okay. Michael Jackson on Monday was fun, but could not dance as well as some of the others on stage. I guess he fit the build. The lion King was a bore, but fun for the kids. The whole show was on tape  the guys just played it out. I did not see anyone actually sing, but again did not go to all the shows. it was entertaining for a couple of nights. 9) Buying from vendors..... Go to the shops first. There prices are fixed so you can get an idea what a good deal is. We received good deals down the beach, but they were shut down for several days due to the storm surge  needed some sales. 10) Some of the bar tenders are great, some are just crumpy. Surprising, since I tipped the ones that were friendly  happy to see me and refused to hand over money to the grumps, even though they were the exception. 11) Always keep the do not disturb sign on the door when in the room. They tend to enter as they knock.......of course it only happened to my wife while she was changing....:) 12) The weather was horrible........we actually saw a few clouds in the sky one day  it actually did not get any higher than 85 degrees on two of the other days.I am sure there is lots more to say, but I think I am getting long winded. I think you will love this spot......

<Content>fantastic vacation Myself, husband and 7 year old son just returned from the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana. Can't say enough good things about this resort.The first thing is that if you go here, spend the extra money and upgrade to one of the several premier rooms. We stayed in the Royal Golden Club. There is also a Club Diamond, Club Hacienda, and Club Premier upgrades within the resort.With the upgrade, you get an extra night at one of the ala carte resturants, are closer to the beach, and have your own concerige, which is needed for dinner reservations. Also you check-in and check-out in the the Golden Principe Reception Club, and advoid the lines at regular check-in. Our concerige Clairibelle, was great, not only did she accomadate us with our dinner reservations, she gave us 5 nights instead of the 4 we were to get.The resort is very large, so there are tram cars that take you from one end to the other. You can also walk when the mood stikes. Also within the resort there are 2 hotels, the Gran Bahia Principe and the Gran Bavaro. They are mirror images of each other in terms of resturants. The pools are shared by both.The food was the only thing that was not up to par. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed all of our meals, but I think you don't get the best food at all inclusive resorts.We had our best meal in the Mediterranreo resturant, which is located in the Club Premier section of the Bavaro. Not impressed with the Japanese resturant at all. We also ate at El Pescador, Garden Grill, and Le Gourmet.The buffet was also very good. Alot of variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are also 2 snack bars by the pool at the beach. Piscis is closer, but very crowded , the 2nd one, Las Olas, is smaller, with alot less people. We enjoyed bothThis was our first time to Punta Cana, and would definitely go back. Bring lots of sun screen and have a great time.

<Content>Absolutely a gorgeous property!! We have just returned from a one week stay in paradise. My husband and myself as well as three other couples travelled to the Ambar for the week of March 15-22/08. We all had rooms in building 68 facing the jungle view as I call it. The rooms are beautiful. We had 2 double beds, a seating area, beautiful marble bathroom with separate shower area, huge closet with lots of shelves as well has hanging space...makes you wish you could have all the same amenities at home...lol. The bed was so comfortable that I wanted to bring it home with me. Didn't suffer from my usual sore back all week!!The transfer from the airport and check in was a breeze. As soon as we arrived we were shuttled to the Ambar lobby for check in. The staff were very friendly and could speak quite good english. We all had to wait for our rooms to be ready as we arrived approx 11 a.m. We were able to change and went for a walk to see what our new home would be like. The grounds are immaculate and all employees are very friendly. All 4 couple were in our rooms by 2:30 that afternoon. In no time we were greeted by our butler Vincente who showed us how to use the safe and answered any questions for us. He made sure our phone was connected so we could call home. We actually made quite a few calls during the week and it cost us only $16 when we paid the bill. I was impressed...I was sure it would be much more expensive than that.We had 4 a la cartes prebooked for us and we attended them all. The first was the Maiko Japanese..it was delicious. A bit intimidating for anyone that doesn't like sushi but the cooked part of the meal was very delicious and the cooks were quite entertaining. The next night we went to the Portofino....This was my favorite, the service was excellant, the food and wine were delicious. The Portofino also serves breakfast and is right next to the beach. It is smaller than the main buffet for breakfast so getting your eggs or omelette didn't take quite so long as there were less people. The next night we ate at the Olivio (our least favorite). The food was very good but the service was terrible. There was not the happy atmosphere we had experienced at the others...maybe it was just an off day for the employees. The last a la carte was the Don Pablo Gourmet. The bacon wrapped filet was deelicious and the service was excellant. If you love dessert and chocolate, don't pass up any of the desserts...the presentation is awesome and of course they are melt in your mouth delicious!!!!I can't say enough about the beach!! It is excellant and the sand is soft and beautiful ,as well as kept very clean. We had a major wind storm (apparently the side effects of a storm off the coast of Costa Rica) and they had to close the bach for 2 days...no swimming and the securuty would not let you near the water. During the night the water actually came in as far as the beach bar and there was a lot of seaweed washed in but was cleaned in no time. We were still allowed in the chair area but not close to the water....the sun was still just as hot an beautiful though.I do agree with some previous reviews that the pool bar service is very slow and the staff there not overly friendly. The service in the lobby bar was very good and you could get any drink you asked for. The only thing is that it is lights out at 11 p.m. I think 12 p.m. would be more appropriate at and 18+ resort area, especially if you had a late sitting for supper meal and just want to relax with a drink to let it digest. They always had an evening easy listening band playing in the lobby which was very nice, but one hour more would be great.All in all we had an excellant vacation and I would return at the drop of a hat. We did not venture to the other areas of the huge complex but stayed mostly in the Ambar section so we did not encounter any of the service refusals that some other guests seemed to encounter. If you are looking for rest and relaxation, you certainly will get it at the Ambar.Enjoy your travels. If you have any questions please feel free to email me through this site. Also, I always have an issue with sand fleas attacking my legs no matter where I travel. If anyone has a tried and true remedy for me, please share it!!!

<Content>Super Mega Fabulous!! We just got back from a 1 week stay at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar. We actually were booked to stay on the Punta Cana side but got upgraded on arrival b/c we don't have kids and the Punta Cana side was overbooked (I think).This caused a little confusion since we had to do most of our paperwork at the Punta Cana (Club Golden) lobby but that was no problems for us.The room was absolutely fabulous - very comfortable and a to die for bathroom. Housekeeping was fairly good and they were always quick to bring us more water etc. Always had enough towels and facecloths etc.The pool is very nice though it can be somewhat difficult to get a spot...people are cut-throat when it comes to lounge chairs. But it didn't bother us b/c we were always moving for different atmospheres!!Food: We booked out A-La-Carts the morning after we arrived. We were flexible on times so that helped get what we wanted. We had the Japanese - which was very good and entertaining. We had the Mexican which was alright. We had the Italian which was also very good. And finally we had the Gourmet which was amazing.The buffet at the Ambar side is very good. Always lots to choose from. Service was excellent - didn't have to wait to long for coffee or wine or water re-fills!! The pool snack buffet is very good for a quick bite. Though I would say the fact that some guests think that shoes are optional for the buffet area and the bathroom area is unacceptable and I wished they inforced this!!!The bar at the Ambar lobby was fantastic. My new favorite drink is the Caipirina - v. delicious. The service was pretty good and a friendly Hola always seems to get their attention. The bartender was super good and if you hung out there long enough he always made sure you had a fresh drink just before closing. We did one excursion to the Marinarium which was really fun - highly recommend. Mr. Sharky was hilarious.The resort is huge but thats good b/c of all the eating and drinking. We never took the tram b/c it is only a 10 minute walk to most places. We didn't have to much trouble with language. I don't expect them to speak much English its their country. If you attempt a little Spanish and listen to what they are saying and take it in context you should have no problems. Just smile and laugh - you are on vacation!!! Who Cares!!!The only complaint is the uncertainty of where you can go / eat. It was told to me when we checked in that we could eat / drink and everywhere except the premier side / diamond pool. But in the end even though we didn't really leave the Ambar venues for eating / drinking it seems that those were the only places we could go?? not sure what the deal is!!Hope this helps!! Enjoy your trip!!

<Content>Ambar Exceeds Expectations We just returned from DR on the 19th March. This was our second time at the Grand Bahia Principe. The first was two years ago and we were at the Golden Club, this time we stayed at the Ambar. The resort is made up of the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana, Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro, and the newest section the Ambar (which is Adults only). This resort is huge with over 2000 suites. Although big, getting around was not difficult when using the transportation system provided by the resort. Upon arriving we were dropped off on the Bavaro side and immediately taken to reception at the Ambar. After reading some negative reviews prior to going we were a little apprehensive. But from the time we got there until the time we left we were very pleased with just about everything. The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. There was a good variety of food at the buffet and we enjoyed the a la carte dining, particularly the Don Pablo, the Mikado and the Olivo. I am not a real fan of seafood so I really enjoyed the steak at the Don Pablo. The grounds are spectacular and well maintained. The beach is to die for with the powdered white sand which they are constantly cleaning so there is never any trash. The room was very clean and well appointed with a sitting area, a four poster king size bed, a marble bathroom with a large hydro massage tub and a separate marble walk-in shower. Although I usually enjoy taking baths we hardly used the tub as we especially enjoyed the shower facilities.We went for the beach so we didn鈥檛 spend any time at the pool but if you want to exchange your blue beach towel you can do so anytime at the pool hut while going to or from the beach. We are early risers so we went to the beach early in the morning to select our lounge chairs and reserve our place by placing our beach towels on them. Generally if you go early (before 9 AM) you will not have any problem finding a spot.The only thing we didn鈥檛 like was having to return the Ambar bracelet at the Ambar reception desk prior to leaving the resort. We had a late departure and had to go to the Punta Cana lobby to await the bus to take us to the airport. Once the bracelet is returned you can no longer obtain food or beverage so while waiting at the Punta Cana lobby we were unable to get a drink from the bar which could be problem if the bus is delayed which was what happened to us. Other guests such as the Golden Club, etc all left with their bracelets still on so they were able to enjoy all the facilities right up to actually getting on the bus.Other than the issue with the bracelet we thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our trip and would highly recommend this resort to anyone who wants good value for their money. We would definitely consider returning to the Ambar for another week or even two in the future.

<Content>Ambar has issues! We, 10 adults, have just returned from a week stay at the Ambar, March 9th - 16th. They definitely have some issues! Not all bad, but some really bad! The resort has very nice accommodations; the rooms are very spacious and pretty. The service from the sales staff, housekeeping staff, and the guest relations staff were excellent.The issues came with the service in some restaurants and most of all, with the pool bar. First, how do you close a pool bar at 5:30 at an adults only resort? How do you not have music or a blender at the pool bar? How do you only serve premium liquor at the lobby bar, not to mention CHARGE for top shelf liquor at an all inclusive! How do you say you can use all the amenities of the entire complex, but on the last day change that policy? We went to the beach bar by the volleyball court and the bar tender said they could not serve us if we were from the Ambar; the policy just had gone into effect that day.The pool bartender, Carlos, was very friendly and helpful, as helpful as he could be. But the girl working there, WOW! She was not friendly, fun, or accommodating AT ALL! One day she was getting ready to make a drink and signaled to hold on. She proceeded to grab a hand full of peanuts for herself and just stand there talking to one of the other bar tenders. He finally told her to go take my friends order. My friend had stood there for five minutes while she was doing nothing, not restocking the bar, not getting ice, just eating peanuts and talking. I realize they just opened in January, but these are such little things that can make a huge difference and should be easy to correct. I am just not sure if they will correct them or want to.Be sure to eat at Portofino's for breakfast, there are less people. Don Pablo restaurant is good and the Maiko, the Japanese restaurant, is awesome.Also, word of warning, do not book any tours through the people on the beach. We did a Sunset Cruise that was nothing more than a 20 minute boat ride.I would be happy to discuss this trip, if anyone has any questions. You can contact me at julie@5startravelandcruises.com.

<Content>what a week in paradise the weather in punta cana was great, we had lot's of sun and fun while staying at the ambar. now for those that say they don't need to read the trip advisor before they go on vacation should really spend a few moment's and try and learn some tips for your holiday.travel: we travelled on skyservice from regina to punta cana march 12th, the plane was pretty full. service was very good and although we had a late departure the pilots made up for lost time and we arrived earlier then expected.airport: punta cana airport was very busy and some confusion about the tourist cards for entering and exiting the country. both our cards were taken from us when we arrived, at the airport in regina we were given a small tourist card and we should have kepted that card until our departure a week later.but on leaving a week later we just filled out another long verson of the tourist form.you get your picture taken apon arrival at the airport and then they try to sell it to you for $8 us when you are leaving.watch the weight of your luggage when you are leaving, they really hold you to the 44 lbs per bag and 11 lbs per carry on.ambar resort: this is a new resort and it is very clean, we always see staff cleaning rooms, floors etc. most of the staff are very polite and don't expect a tip from you but try to make their day by saying hi to them or passing out chocalates or leave a $1 or so on your pillow for the maid. also try to learn a little spanish, it goes a long ways.we didn't have an issue with hotel mangement until we learned that after being there for a few days they changed the policy on us using the other 2 resorts services like the buffets and drinks. this was part of our package to begin with and that's why we booked at the ambar. 2 days later they change it back again and the only thing we couldn't use was the buffets. we were disappointed and are advising our transat rep.food: there was always something to eat, the snack bar was my favorite. if you are a fish eater you will like the menu, if not be prepared to eat chicken, pork, fruits and salads.the coffee is a little strong but very good.pool and beach: the beach is very nice, soft white sand and clear blue water. lot's of beach chairs to choose from, please don't hog them if you are leaving for a tour let someone else have them while you are gone.if you get up early in the am and try to hold some chairs around the pool before 8:00am, security will make you sit there until such time.pool bar is open 10:00am till 5:30pm sharp. no exceptions!beer is cold and their list of drinks are long, try the banana mama.ambar lounge: yes it is true that the bar at the ambar main lobby does shut down at 11:00pm. they have a piano band untill 11 and then you have to supply your own entertainment.:-) lol.this is a very quite resort and yes the men have to wear long pants to all the restaurants after 6:00pm.if you are looking for loud music and activities try the bavaro or the punta cana.overall we were pleased with our holiday, take some pencils, coloring books for the school kids.have a safe and happy holiday.

<Content>Great time at the Ambar Just returned from a wonderful vacation at the Gran Bahia Principe Amabar. My husband and I stayed at this resort along with another married couple from March 8th through March 15th, 2008 (both couples in late twenties). My husband and I have stayed at the Gran Bahia in the Riviera Maya twice prior to this, so we had an idea of what to expect with the Ambar.First impressions- well kept grounds, beautiful palm trees, and unusual banana trees. My husband and I prefer villas as opposed to large regular hotel style buildings, so we were pleased with the set up of the Ambar. Check in went very smoothly and our room was ready shortly after 3 PM (check in time). We were very lucky to have a villa very close to the beach and with a great partial ocean view.The rooms themselves were large and adequate. The bathroom in the room was fabulous as it was very large and we loved the seperate walk-in shower.The beach was amazing- fine white sand and clear turquoise water. Many people on the entire Bavaro Beach, however. We never had trouble finding chairs on the beach, we just moved our chairs and put under palm trees for shade. We did see the two stray dogs that other reviews mentioned. They were deathly thin, not aggressive, and did not bother anybody - very heart breaking to see. We did make a point of feeding the dogs and giving them fresh water each day (and we did see other guests do the same - but we did see a few cruel guests kick sand at these poor dogs for no reason).We found the food to be overall pretty good. We preferred the Ambar buffet over the regular Punta Cana buffet. One of the people in our group did end up getting sick from the salmon that was not cooked long enough from the Ambar buffet, but it was otherwise very good. We only went to three a la carte dinners :1) the Dominican a la carte - over all pretty good and interesting  to try since we were in the Dominican.2) Le Gourmet - very good3) The Garden Grill - very good.The snack bars were OK and the breakfasts were good - we just needed to make sure that our eggs were cooked long enough. The drinks were very good- if you want more alcohol in your drinks, just ask. We did find the staff at the resort to be very friendly, hard working, and helpful. If you need something, all you have to do is ask. In conclusion, we had a great week at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar. We would definitely consider retuning here in the future.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Pro's:- Relationship between Ambar and Air Canada - Free shuttle service provided via Air Canada- Great food w/ Ala Carte- White sand beached- Weather (30degree celcius all week)- Friendly hotel staff- Availability of beverages- shuttle service around hotel- Ability to make booking for theme'd restaurants (book few days in advance to ensure you get in)- Snorkeling with the nurse sharks (booked with Air Canada rep who was on site and available for our entire trip)- 25miles of beach- Clear unspoiled waters- Free use of safe in room- Fresh towels- Clean roomsCons:- waiting for a cup of coffee- poorly stocked bar fridges- very unconfortable beds (they were not pillowtop at advert.)- Cleaning staff entering room seconds after a single knock- Using Credit Card service to call home (roughly $7.45 per minute) Avoid use of hotel phones altogether and have family call you...much cheaper at .35 cents per minute from Alberta)- Tons of mosquito's in the rooms. We killed 6 or so in room first night and continued to slaughter 2-3 each night thereafter. I suspected it was from cleaning staff keeping room door open during day when cleaning room.- Bad TV reception (it did rain for few hr's on 2 days we were there) - Vendors sitting by carts over by Casino (not very nice and very pushy to get you to buy)- Access to lawnchairs by the pool. Get one in early morning, place a towel on it, fold it over. There were no chair available later in the day.Overall I found the dining service at Ambar to be a bit substandard in the Ala Carte areas. The waitering staff seem to slip into 'clear table/reset table' mode which causes them to overlook an empty cofee cup or finshed plate of food. All other areas were fine. Speaking of food, I found the food delicious with much variety. Other AC's we had stayed at severely lacked in this area. Advance bookings we made at Olivino and Mexican Restaurant were excellent. I have a sensitive stomach which was not bothered at all during our entire stay. The rooms were not as described. No Pillowtop mattress and TV was poor for selection. The grounds were kept very clean and staff clearly seem to take pride in job. Access to the beach was great. I would ask for a room closer to the main pool...its nice to hear the waves at night. We left $2 per day for the cleaning staff and tipped waiters $1-2 only if service was above average. Once they related your face to the US greenback your coffee cup was full and dirty plates take away.I would return to this hotel as I feel it has great potential to be in top 5 premier resorts within the area. Oh ya, do not wait to buy Rum or Cigars at airport when leaving...they are hugely expensive. One other minor item....Canadian Customs was not concerned we had brough back 4 bottle of rum (only allowed 1 each) between the two of us. Mr Brugal makes a fine rum ;-)Enjoy your stay

<Content>Fantastico! Hi everyone!I really felt the reviews posted here to be very useful so I wanted to make sure to post one of my own and help you out! Booking a vacation - especially at the Ambar (a little pricier) is a big commitment and one you want to think about and read reviews about. I felt most of the previous reviews to be quite accurate - even some of the negative ones I could see their point. However, overall I (and my sister - my traveling partner) were quite pleased and we would go back again in a heartbeat (especially after seeing all the snow here...yuck!). First of all, we stayed at the busiest time of year - March break (we just came back and we were the last flight out to Punta Cana before the BIG snow storm...phew...). Now, we all know that If you go at a busy time of year then just go with the attitude that things will be crazy busy and make the most of it! With that said...trust me...if you book with Ambar you will enjoy your stay! I have travelled A LOT and I have stayed at many all inclusive resorts and this one was by far one of my best! The Beach!Let's start with the reason why you want to go to Punta Cana - Bavaro beach! It is simply breathtaking and the best I've been to - including Cuba! The water is clear blue, we always had a lawn chair - no problems there. Washrooms, drinks, and snacks are close by (we stayed near the warning flag which was close to the Grill on the beach and the pool). The vendors don't bother you really unless you are searching for some shopping. The workout gals really push for 'customers' though...in fact when I was in the water I saw them motion to a guy to come workout his large belly - not very complimentary. I decided to stay in the water until they were fully involved in the workout in case she commented on me too :) Get ready to see the topless women - power to you! At times, we saw these large flies (they look like dragon flies) but they don't land on you or bug you and they go away after a short while - really NOT a problem. We also saw two stray dogs who again don't bother you at all - they are looking for shade and any food (they are deathly skinny - poor things). We spent most of the vacation on the beach and in the water. The flag was yellow all week and the waves were quite vicious a bit at times - especially the first two days where it was very windy too. The last two days were GORGEOUS - calmer and less windy. The motor boats I wish would be further off because they can be loud and cause some tree kick back - no seaweed - just some twigs and things from the palm trees? But the beach is very clean - there are always people cleaning it! We had to tear ourselves away the last day :(The poolMy sister and I are with the attitude that a nice pool you can find anywhere but a beautiful (exotic) beach you cannot find here which is why we prefer to go to the beach then the pool. However, we couldn't pass up two days at the pool. The first day we woke up at 5 a.m. and thought we had reserved the best chairs under a hut. We went back to bed for a bit - went to breakfast and came back after 9a.m. only to find that our towels (and magazines) were removed by security. Apparently you cannot reserve anything before 8a.m. We were lucky and found two chairs - but in full sun. Needless to say we were in the water and at the swim up bar A LOT ( the sun is VERY hot and we both LOVE heat). The next day we managed to get the last hut! But the huts get a fair bit of sun too. The beach was nicer with a breeze and waves which made the sun more bareable.CAUTION! Bring lots of protection, hats, sarong to cover you, etc. - my sister and I never burn and we did on this trip! Also we got a rash (resembling mosquito bites) - we think it is from the sun because there weren't any bugs? So bring aloe cream too. SERVICE:Service was fast and friendly considering it was the busiest time of year. They even called to check that we got the towels we requested. We never felt the maid really went above and beyond but we tipped her a few times and she gave us extra water, booze, and pringles which was nice. Everyone says hola but be careful if you are two women going without the boyfriends. We got 'bugged' a lot especially by the Dominican men there - lots of those 'shifty' looks and a few of them a little too pushy (if you know what I mean). My sister and I kept saying they want to skip out and come to Canada (if you know what I mean! the ladies will understand!). Language is DEFINITELY a barrier. Many of the workers do not understand you and you have to do a lot of sign language or using your hands and symbols. It got a little comical at times. If they have a lot of trouble understanding they will get someone who speaks better English to come help you.FOOD/DRINKS:I have no real complaints about the food. Very good breakfast and lunch buffets. We did the a la carte restaurants and we were most impressed with the Mikado Japanese Restaurant. The drinks were great - we LOVED the Banana Mama's! Yum...yum! Bring your own reusable cup that is insulated too (put it in the fridge overnight). Careful about the Ambar bar lobby at 11:00 p.m. It closes precisely then and even if you are at the bar they will not serve you! ROOMS:Rooms are beautiful and clean and still new. We loved the rain shower! We didn't use the tub - who has time for that? We didn't have an ocean or water view which was a shame but we were in building 64 and VERY close to the pool and beach and some of the restaurants. We were able to walk everyone on the AMBAR side and we took the shuttle very easily to go to the Bahia Punta Cana to see the shows, restaurants, shopping, or other night life. ENTERTAINMENT:The entire grounds is/are so HUGE that we didn't get to see everything - that's why its a good idea o go back next year :)The sun tired us out a lot and many nights we didn't last past midnight. We saw most of the shows at the theatre and they were quite good. They had an excellent Micheal Jackson tribute and Cirque du Soleil tribute. The other shows were pretty good too. Unfortunately people caught on to the best seats and starting reserving which kind of sucked because the worst seats were always left and you were taking chances with no large person sitting in front of you (we weren't so lucky some nights). It is very safe to walk at night but we traveled by shuttle a lot. Bring a sweater because nights are a little cool especially if you've had some sun. The lobby at the Punta Cana side is very busy and hopping at all times. Ambar lobby is hopping too at times but dead after 11:00 p.m. It is quite quiet at the Ambar side which is a nice 'getaway. SHOPPING: We love to shop and the market place was pretty good - the vendor boys are just all over you so be prepared! We bought from a cool guy - Manuel - Manny. He wasn't as pushy and we had a great time 'talking him down'. Trust me - they try to swindle you!We also took the free shuttle from the Punta Cana side to the Palapa Real (I think that was the name). They told us it was about 15 minutes away but it was actually about 30 to 40 minutes away because they stop at other resorts. It was a good way to see the other resorts though (ours being the BEST of course). The market was not what we thought. It is like a mall but you can 'barter' at the jewelery store. We got some great deals on Larimar (THE stone of the Dominican and hard to find anywhere else). So we would recommend you go if you enjoy shopping. We bought many souvenirs from this place too. Much more cheaper then the resort and more variety. We didn't do any other excursions - but the people we talked said all of their excursions were great - especially the 'jungle' trip. The shuttle trip home wasn't the greatest - we had to stand for a little bit until the first drop off. NOTE: Watch your luggage when you are checking out! Because you are staying at the AMBAR you will be shuttled to the Bahia Punta Cana where all the luggage is put together out front. If you get there early and want to explore around the Punta Cana side you will run the risk of one of the workers misunderstanding and loading you luggage on another bus. This almost happened to me. We stayed out front to watch our luggage and we just played cards and read and one at a time went to explore. Thankfully we did this because my luggage was about to be boarded on the Montreal bus. I had to drag it back. Then we talked to a fellow we met at one of the dinners and he said that this happened to him and his luggage was now lost! This would have been a nightmare! He had a good attitude about it but I would've been devastated. So be careful. Maybe lock up your luggage elsewhere because I'm sure this wasn't the first time!Have a great trip! Enjoy! Relax! You will LOVE it at the Ambar. I would go again in a heartbeat!Adios! Va con dios!

<Content>Fantastic vacation! We were originally booked at the GBP Punta Cana but we were upgraded to the Ambar after we requested Golden or Diamond upgrades but both were full. We stayed at the Ambar from March 1 to March 8.I will not be reviewing Check-in or aspects of our vacation that were handled through GBP Punta Cana.ROOM:We were very impressed by our room, very large and well furnished. Large washroom with a jacuzzi tub. All marble surfaces, very roomy. The king size 4 post bed was also very nice and very comfortable.BEACH:Very nice white sand and turquoise water. Right in front of the Astron wreck. Lots of boat traffic but there is a buoyed off swimming area. No pesky vendors. The watersports vendors from the resort do come by a few times (never more than once a day) and they are very polite and respectful, not pushy and they do leave at the first 'no thanks'.FOOD:General - Buffet was very good, omelets were sometimes undercooked at breakfast so we would take 1 egg instead of 2 and have them cook them a bit longer. Room service was also great, hot and fast. The hamburger stand in Pueblo Principe was also very good and fast for a late night snack.A la carte - Italian (PC/Bavaro, by the diamond pool): Fantastic food and service! Our favorite by far!Brazilian/BBQ: We did not enjoy at all. We found the buffet lacking. They would not serve us meat if we had a plate from the buffet with potatoes. The meat was overcooked.Mexican: Delicious, the food was good and quick. Very nice selection.French Gourmet (Don Pablo): The food was okay, we didn't find it great.Italian (Ambar): Again food was okay but we didn't find it as good as the other Italian. Menu was limited and service was slow.SERVICE:The service was fantastic everywhere, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful! However, maid service in the room was not great. They are terrible at replacing towels and on one occasion I had to leave a note requesting face cloths they had taken the first day and never replaced for 4 days. The room was generally clean but they did miss spots and they went are also a bit negligent in restocking alcohol in the mini bar. We did try increasing our morning tip from $5 to $8 for 2 days and service seemed to decline so they definitely weren't working for bigger tips.POOL:Pool was very nice, loungers were somewhat limited but we always ended up finding one after walking around a bit. Very quiet pool, very big for the amount of people in it so you never feel cramped. Service at the swim up bar was very quick. There is always a security guard by the pool to watch and ask non-Ambar guests to leave.We highly recommend this resort to anyone (except families with children since this is adults only).

<Content>Needs some fixes Our stay: Febr. 25 to Mar. 3. We really enjoyed our stay, the people at the Ambar and all the services we received. Concerning what other reviewers have reported, we can confirm that all the positives are true and not exagerated.There are, however, some important fixes required. The shower in our suite had bad odours coming up from the drain (this was also stated by some reviewers). Also, the number of chairs available is insufficient because some guests reserve chairs without using them for a long while and guests from some other Bahia Principe resorts are allowed to use the Ambar.Finally, note that Buildings 60 to 65 of the Ambar used to be part of the Bavaro. They are now part of the Ambar because Buildings 66 to 69 and the Ambar reception area are now fully operational.

<Content>Great Vacation My husband and I stayed at the Grand Bahia Ambar from Feb 11-15 and it was a wonderful stay. I originally booked through travelocity at the Bahia Punta Cana and that's where the taxi dropped us off. Our room was not prepared and we had to wait a little over an hour, which we were not pleased about and we let them know...well that turned out in our favor. We were quickly upgraded to a room on the Ambar side. You have to keep in mind that the mega resort is huge property, which consists of the Grand Bahia Punta Cana, Grand Bahia Bavaro and Grand Bahia Ambar, which just opened in November 2007. Each section has it's own open air lobby.The rooms in the Ambar were exceptional...brand new and far beyond my expectations. I will definitely return and asked to be housed in Ambar. Keep in mind that Ambar is an adults only section, therefore, you cannot stay on this side of the property if you're traveling with children.The pool and ocean were beautiful. We would wake up early and have breakfast at the buffet and then head toward the pool. Yes, it's true, you can have a hard time getting a seat, but we always seemed to grab a good one.The staff are friendly and they deserve a tip..so don't forget.Have a wonderful trip.

<Content>Fantastic This would be my 11th all-inclusive resort. I have stayed at good and bad all 4*+. I have to say that this is the nicest resort I have stayed at. I found the buffet food to be very good. The variety was always surprising. We actually skipped all but one of our a'la'carte nights and chose to go to the buffet instead. I love and appreciate good food as I do cook. I have nothing bad to say about the food. I do have to say that the wine could be better quality. I also heard complaints about the beer quality as well. I found the staff to be very eager to help. I have stayed at the Bahia Principe in the Mayan and enjoyed it. I would say that this is nicer. After a trip to Peurto Plata 9 years ago I swore I would never return to the Dom. Rep. I am glad that I was given the opportunity to go with a group as I had a fantastic time. Punta Cana is better.The only thing that I would have to complain about are the rain gutters at the main lobby. The gutters are really deep and cannot be seen in the dark. One fellow in our group fell and ended up in a cast and wheel chair for the week. I fell and scraped my hands and knees. Another woman fell and broke both of her wrists and was still in the hospital when we left. Watch out for the rain gutters!I will go back!

<Content>Relax We have just return from our first adult only vacation from February 11th to the 18th 2007. Needless to say that we travelled with a great couple of friend and got along well.The Ambar was a great resort, we were into the building 70,  further from the beach (2 min walk) , but closer to lobby. We requested to be moved in building 60 ( pool side) but they were unable to accomodate our request due to high volume . This was not really a big deal to us. Very clean , great buffet, great restaurants, they really emphasis on the presentation. The beach was amazing, clean , clear water. The pool area was also beautiful. Make sure you get up early (6:00 am) to put yout towel on chair under the shade, same for the beach. We found it safe to do this and then go for breakfast. As for the activities, pool game, beach volley ball etc, you must go to the Bavaro side. Ambar is really a couple resort were not much is happening activity wise. People were very friendly, the resort was always impecable, although fairly new place with staff that have limited second language. We strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a quiet quality time as a couple.

<Content>We would totally recommend! Well, I am excited to report that we had an absolutely wonderful vacation on February 16 - 23, 2008. So we had the Royal Golden at the GRAND BAHIA PRINCIPE, but were upgraded to the AMBAR section (adults only) - I think it was because it was overbooked. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!!! It was brand new, gorgeous, great staff that all spoke english very well, beautiful comfortable rooms, very comfortable king size bed, beautiful marble bathroom with separate jacuzzi bath and separate shower with rain shower head, yummy food (major selection), yummy drinks (all premium alcohol too) amazing buffets, very fancy  classy lobby, beautiful beach, adults only section on beach, wonderful pool, brand new beach chairs, free internet access and most of all, beautiful weather! What else can I say.... we were very grateful that we were in this section, although, the other would have been fine, this was just better!! It was a very big resort, but being in that section you didn't see any kids. Everyone we spoke to were from Canada, only a few from the US. There was the issue about reserving the beach chairs around the pool, there were always some around the beach, that you could eventually find. The main part of the resort took a while to get used to and figuring out where to go. They had the bus that went back and forth every 3 minutes, but we walked most of the time, it wasn't far, the map helped a lot. We went to the Michael Jackson show which was excellent and to two of the restaurants there, but otherwise, we just stayed in our Ambar Section. The only issue that we had was the Italian restaurant in the Ambar Section called Portofino - it had no Italian food at all (I think the other Italian restaurants in the main section were real Italian food) anyways, my husband had the salmon and it smelt awful and he took a taste and couldn't eat it and then got sick right after. He was fine, but we wouldn't recommend this restaurant. The other al la cartes were nice, but the buffets were amazing! The Garden Grill was the best, with real steak and potato meals just like home!The beach was packed with people walking the beach constantly on the beautiful sugary beach sand. There was always a beautiful breeze that made it more bareable and we never saw any mosquitoes or bugs. The grounds were immaculate and beautiful. The staff work so hard and long hours and were very friendly. We didn't do any excursions, just hung out and relaxed and met some wonderful friends! The Westjet flights were great and on time, even 1/2 hour early on the way home and the bus to and from the resort to the airport were perfect. So we were fortunate to have a great experience!!Enjoy!!

<Content>Total relaxation! Just returned from the Bahia Principe with my sister. We had booked on the Bavaro/Punta Cana side and we were upgraded to the Ambur-adults only side. The rooms were new and spacious with a nice flat screen TV. The maid always did a great job keeping our rooms clean and towels replenished. The food was good with lots of variety. Diamond club: we had taken this upgrade and felt it was well worth it. We used the Diamond Club internet bar way more than the 20 minutes a day with no difficulties(morning and evening). We had the extra a la carte meal and really took advantage of the a la carte lunch at the Italian restaurant on the Bavaro side. The Diamond Club Pool had more shade and chairs available than the Ambur pool. The closer proximity of your room to the beach is also a big plus.I suggest getting the safe. My sister's headphones did dissapear. We were more careful after that.The beach was wonderful with a nice breeze all day. The Banana Mamas were our drink of choice(a cross between a Pina Colada and a Strawberry Daquiri -maybe)As two women alone we felt safe although we did draw a bit more attention than if our husbands were present but it was all quite innocent.We had different check-in times since we were arriving from two different locations and we had no problems. We thought this may have caused some confusion.The people are very friendly but sometimes shy. They will always say Ola if you smile and aknowledge them. I found the staff to be very polite and professional with a polished image.The resort itself has immaculate grounds. It was huge as every one else says and I don't think you really appreciate the enormity of it until there. Bring good walking shoes or take the tram.There really wasn't anything missing in our room - alarm clock, umbrella, iron and board(didn't get used!), hair dryer, beach towels. I do beleive that these extras may be for the Ambur resort.I enjoyed the adults only part- I love kids but when you're away for a break it was nice to have some quiet time. There was an adult only pool and beach section.Our intention was to relax and we certainly accomplished this. I can't comment on the party scene since we hardly ever made it past 11 since we were tired from the sun.We did the Monster Truck Safari Tour and truly enjoyed this-if you feel like bringing some items for the children I would suggest books and Hats! These don't have to be new. The school kids were asking for the hats off our heads! Also we had a very good tour guide by the name of Marsilito - they may all suggest it but he felt half the items should be given to the school children(midway through the tour) and at the very end were the poorest children live(Haiitians). They do not want to promote begging instead of going to school which I found proactive. They sell hats for 15$ with half the proceeds returning to the school kids. Bring some cash for souvenirs that were sometimes a little cheaper. Don't worry about drinks- there is a continuous supply of water,soft drinks, rum and beer. Lots of Drinke, drinke!!! Bring sunscreen! A great day!No doubt you will have a great vacation here! Relax, stay in the moment and enjoy!

<Content>Vacation of many new experiences Booked our hotel with GoGo Vacations for the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana, but were upgraded to the Ambar. I'm assuming it was due to overbooking as other reviews would have it suggest, but not really quite sure why. We were booked quickly and effeciently and there didn't seem to be a problem. After a long trip I was sad not to have a cocktail at reservations waiting as we have at past all-inclusive resorts, but that was my main check-in complaint. Afterwards we went to reserve 3 Ala Carte restaurant reservations. This took a longer time than it should have. Approximately 25 minutes to book 3 restaurants, Italian, Brazilian BBQ (due to word-of-mouth we never ate at the Brazilian, bad reviews), Le Gourmet. Finally, after a long day of traveling we arrived at our room. It was above our expectations. Lovely corner room in Villa 62, Adults Only section. Very clean, spacious king size bed, corner living area, flat screen tv and large bathroom with separate jacuzzi tub and shower. We stayed mostly at the Adults Section Pool, but managed to travel to the Bavaro Pool. What a difference. Kids were everywhere at the Bavaro pool and it felt a tad clautrophobic. Thank goodness we were upgraded because I think our trip would've been different at the main pool with the sheer amount of families. However, if you want music and more excitement that's your place. The adult pool tends to be a little stuffy. My main complaints about the pool: reserving chairs was tricky. Some of the older guests reserved thiers with towels at midnight. This left people fighting at the crack of dawn to reserve decent chairs with shade. It seemed the older guests were able to keep up with the earlier hours. Only 1 day were we able to secure 4 good chairs with shade and my boyfriend woke at 2:00 am to do it. I think in general reserving to that degree needs to be abstained for overall fairness. It was not uncommon to see people fighting over chairs and arguing because someone reserved thiers but did not use them until 5 hours later. It was sadly humorous. The beach was the best I have ever seen in my tropical travels. We made it a point to walk every day around 4:00. So nice, well kept, lots of people and energy as they are public beaches. You will see a good amount of topless women. Some days a lot more than others. I'd say in general the ratio of patronage was 25% American, 30% Canadian and 40% European. Many french. Most of the staff are tri-lingual in Spanish, French and English. However, do make a point to attempt to speak Spanish, it goes a long way and garners some respect. It's sad to see how many people don't try, but EXPECT everyone to be fluent in English. About the food...mostly wonderful. Large vareity, some gourmet items found daily, caviar, gazpaucho, grilled lobster tails, lovely and surprising appetizer combinations. Lots of fun to try everything. Every palate should be well accomodated. The Don Pablo Gourmet Ala Carte restaurant was presented very well. The food was not disappointing at any restaurant. We each found something we really liked at each night and something that we didn't care for, but overall we enjoyed going to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. Any issues? Sure, much is not perfect, so I would only have three main issues. 1) Bring your own water to breakfast, only juice, mimosa, bloody mary's or coffee seem to be available at breakfast. Any other meal you can find it, but 2 times I requested it I never got it so I just started to bring my own bottle from my room. 2) I think the food could be a bit warmer. The warmer plates or lights are not as high as I would like. 3) Slow service at the bars for drinksOverall, this was a fabulous vacation for us. We met some very cool people that added to the experience. One night we went to the casino and one night we went to the disco. Don't expect a New York night club or Vegas casino to any degree and just enjoy the atmosphere and vibe and you can have a great time. We went with reasonable expectations and ended up with a great experience and vacation. We did several activities and each were well executed. We would definitely go back to Punta Cana and I would recommend the Ambar for older guests or anyone that wants non-party atmosphere. My boyfriend and I are in our 30's and were very happy to have met some couples in the same age range to hang out with, go the disco with, etc.Advice: Bring lots of your sunscreen and wear it! If you buy there prepare for a 200% increase. The sun is deceiving in DR. There is a wonderful breeze all day and you don't feel how hot your body is getting. There were more sunburns there than I have ever seen. I tan and am always wearing at least 45spf and I still got a little burnt, on the hands and feet! If you want more beer or alcohol in your room, tip your butler. He will schedule a time and call you daily for more. We tipped ours $25.00 and were never without. This came in handy when bars close at 11:00 pm and the disco opens at 12:00. Or if you just want to enjoy a drink in your jacuzzi tub. Shop at the beach versus the Pueblo Principe in Gran Bahia. You will not get the best deals and they won't bargain with you as much as the beach vendors. By the way, if you buy something a lot of other vendors as you walk along thier tables will want you to buy, but I found it's not as pushy as some of the Mexican vendors I've encountered. Taxi versus shuttle: Taxis all the way. $33-37 one way. Private car with AC and no picking or dropping people off. Simple.If you fish: prepare for rough waters. Very choppy. Take dramamine.Have a great trip!

<Content>Terrible Service for a 5 stars My wife and I booked at the Ambar understanding that it was an upgrade section of the (too big) Bahia Principe complex. There is in fact a few upgrades (adult only, closer to the beach, and all 脿 la carte dinner). However, many of the benefits rely on other parts of the complex. Unfortunately the information was inexistant and the staff unable to help. Yes, the place is nice, the beach is beautiful, we had great weather but everything else was a bad experience. I have been to about 20 different resorts(maybe I'm becoming picky) and I don't feel I experiment what I paid for. I would not recommand it and will not go back myself. In fact, from my visit in oter parts, I felt that service was much better in other sections. It leaves a bad taste when you pay for the most expensive section and you have to address your questions in an other lobbies in order to be answered properly.Our feeling was ''We offer you a great spot, now take care of yourself and do not bother us'' Here are a few exemple:- My wife inquired for aquagym. She was answered the there is no aquagyn on the complex but someone could arrange it for her at 89$ / hr. ???? In fact, after personal serches, there was aquagym in other pools-The first two days we couldn't get a chair at the pool or at the beach. Not enough of them. We then decided to do like everybody else and ''reserve'' our chairs by dropping our towels as soon as possible in the morning (had to be before 7:30 ... no sleep in if you want a chair). We then went for breakfast and when we came back, chairs and towels were gone. I ask then ask for two new towels and was told that I need first to go to ''customer service'', pay 20$ per towel and then, I could get new ones. Something to put you in the mood early in the day. - One of the worst, we were stolen our perfume in our room. In brief, we were blamed because we didn't put it in the safe. I had to '' come back in one hour'' there time to be told '' come back tomorrow''. The day after they kindly offer to give me the name of the maid and do my own investigation. WHAT? Do you think I go in vacation to investigate your staff stealing me??? At the end, I was told that they could not do anything for me and case was closed. That's it that's all. No compensation of any sort.- By the way sport installation (tennis  bicycle) are very very bad. At best a 3 star level. And anytime we called we were told courts were full. We had to go to see that it was not the case. The person at the sport installation did bother turning the head to look. Easier to say no. Also, from Ambar we had to wait for two shuttle (train) to get there or walk a mile.- The claim that wines are better at Ambar. It is true. But there is only 3 脿 la carte restaurant at Ambar and when you go on the other side if you want a similar wine, you have to buy it otherwise the wine is very poor.-I could go on and on but in conclusion, I understood after my contact with JORGE LUIS - Customer Service Manager, why there was no hope with service at Ambar. All questions, comments and requests were answered by : NO, I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T, NO IT'S NOT TRUE by the customer service staff. On the 4th day, exasperated, but in all good intention I decided to share my with experience with higher instance. Nobody ever accepted to refer me to the manager. I had to find out myself. Finally, I got to JORGE LUIS. He listened to me, agree that I had been served and answered real poorly and told me I could come back to him anytime if needed. He offered to send a bottle of white wine to the room. My answer was ''I don't want any special treatment, I just thought I was important for you to know what is going on on your resort. He insisted. I did not get the bottle! Hum! The day after, I walk by him and now he tells me that he would send a bottle of champagne. Did not get it. HUM! At the end of the third day (night before leaving) I called him to share something I was teached early in my career : try not to be long on promises and short on delivery. Overall this is the memories I have from Amber.Before going I read on Trip Advisor and most comments were good. However one left me thinking for a while. It was titled ''It's all about services'' Now I agree 100% with that one. I have a very good resort sampling and at Ambar, you don't get what you pay for. Sorry

<Content>the best Oh my Goodness!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the best!!!!!!!!!!!We stayed at the Amber Feb 10 to the 17th. This place has it all.The room was huge clean and very close to the beach , pool and ala cart resturants. We have nothing to say but great things about this Hotel. This was our first trip to the Dominican and I was a little concerned. We know people that have gotten sick there before, but true to the Bahia chain this place is amazing. Great service good food no KIDS what more could you ask for. W e stayed in building 68 right next to pool, Thanks Mary... Please be kind to the staff they don't speak english well but understand a smiling face and will go beyond to help you. The Bar was well stocked in our room all week, just leave a few bucks in the fridge if you want extra. and the maid will make sure yiu have enough.We arrived at 11:30 at night and just ordered room service to get food that came within 20 minutes and was really good. The express service on your telephone will hjelp with any problems you have quickly and they speak great english. The weather was the best we have ever had in 10 years of travelling at the same time in Feb. If you are considering this resort over the Bahia Principe Punta Cana or BRavaro. For the few extra bucks it is really worth every penny. Enjoy your trip, we can't wait to go back

<Content>BE careful, you do not get what you pay for! We have traveled to international destinations 1 to 3 times every year for the last 8 years, so I do feel qualified to offer an honest review. This was our first trip to the Domician Republic. Our travel agent recommended 3 different choices, but we and the couple we travel with, decided to upgrade to what we thought was the finest and adult only resort on the goregous Barvaro beach. We were surprised as soon as we requested the first service. A refreshment of Jack Daniels and coke after a long trip. We were told that only bar brands, not preimum brand liquors were included at this top-rated all-inclusive adult resort where we had paid an extra 30% to upgrade to the BEST. We could have the premium drinks but at $6 each upon request.. Not a good way to start the vacation. We were told we could use the sister hotels Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana and Barvaro anytime we wanted and would receive services the same as the ungrade at the Ambar. Put when we returned to the Ambar after visiting the two other resorts, we were charged for drinks that the Ambar considers included,but the other resort considered premium. The Ambar required us to pay for them even though we had top level arm bands. Other areas of service problems were: All BARS close at 11pm every evening, Pool closes at 6pm everyday, No food service restaurant open at all times and EVERY restaruant requires long pants for men EVERY evening (no dressy shorts). We felt like we were in the geriatric ward, everything shuts down early and NO activities. The real deal breakers for us came after a quite and civilized confrontation with management about the inconsistences. We felt UNSAFE at the resort. As we returned to our rooms, we found the the deadbolt lock did not work when room key card was inserted two times in succession, door opened. We could not sleep or enjoy the remainder of our trip. Management listens to our concerns but did nothing about any of them and claimed things like misprints and misinterruptations. Punta Cana is the most beautiful place we have ever traveled to, but we will NEVER return to this resort and question the like of service orientation of the area, especially when you pay extra for just that. So sorry Ambar, you are not 5 star or 5 apple!

<Content>Poor Service.... Please read the other reviews describing the poor service before deciding to stay at this hotel. My new wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon and the level of service was lacking. We had read the reviews prior to booking but figured that people were just being overly harsh (we generally are fairly easy going people and don't expect a lot). Our actual experience however mirrored many of the prior posts. A couple of highlights and lowlights.Highlights:-Hotel itself looks very nice.-Beautiful beach-All of the staff were very nice and sweet-we felt bad for many of them as it didn't appear that they were treated very well by the management. When given the opportunity, most all of the staff members were quite helpful (it seemed to be the management and hotel policies that were a detriment to service not the staff themselves.)Lowlights:-In general not very accomodating. Example: we were on our honeymoon and given a room with two double beds instead of a king size like we requested. The desk manager refused to switch us...nuff said.-Rules and schedules: I have never stayed at a hotel that has so many rules and schedules. Examples: the pool closes at 6PM and it is enforced strongly by security. Men have to wear long pants at all of the restaurants for dinner including the buffet. -Reservations: You need a reservation for everything (usually a day or two in advance). This includes all the dinner restaurants, massages, any of the beach activities and water sports, tennis, etc.-Food: There were one or two restaurants that were excellent but in general the food was very bland and pretty much all tasted the same.Hope this helps.

<Content>Poor Experience at Bahia Principe Ambar My Name is Igor, Toronto, CanadaI would like to express the poor experience we went through in this resort. We arrived to the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar in Punta Cana section at approximately 1.30 AM on February 07/08 ( actually it was already Feb 08/08 ). Unfortunately, we were not too impressed with the initial greeting that we received at this resort. We were told to go to the biding 鈥?Villa鈥?64 on the second floor and look for room 64206 and 64204 (we were two couples and travelled together)To our big surprise only two doors on the floor had the number tug .....in order to found the right door we had to play a guessing game: trying 鈥渙ur door card鈥?in different doors ( At 1.30 AM ......). We were told that 鈥渂ecause we arrived so late 鈥?the restaurants are close..... and if we like to get something to eat, we will need to call and order room service. We called room service, ordered some food for 4 persons 鈥?and after waiting 2,5 hours the food finally arrived ....... The order was mixed up! We received not the food we ordered .... But for 4 persons we received only one fork and one knife ......was lathe and we went to sleep.In the morning we started to unpack the luggage - another surprise: the safe was loose and not attached to the wall ....... I called to the express service: the answer was 鈥渨ait in five minutes the person will be to fix this problem鈥?鈥?this repair took to resolve all day long! When I complained to the customer service they told 鈥?you did not had to wait in the room鈥?.....Next day after our day on the beach my wife told me that her make-up is missing. After double checking all our belongings, we went to the customer service desk and informed the clerk Victor about this incident. Victor told as not to worry and he will get back to us next morning..... Next morning and during all day 鈥?nobody contacted us! My wife went again to the customer service desk, this time she specked to Erika. Erika specked to Victor and told to my wife that by next morning action will be taken and reported back to her...... The next day is over 鈥?no further responses! My wife was pretty really upset, went to the customer service and requested to speak to the manager of the customer service. The lady that called herself manager, told my wife that we need to fill-out a special report, go to the room with security guards 鈥?then she will resolve the problem..... We did all what she requested and next day she approached us in the lobby and told as that the investigation did not bring any results: they searched the locker of the cleaning lady and could not found any-thing...... (after 3 days ......? ) She advised to proceed with our travel insurance....By this our poor experience was not over: next day TV stopped working 鈥?took two day to fix it ....One day after, when we wanted to get in to the room 鈥?the card did not open the door 鈥?we forced to walk to the lobby, wait in line for 45 min. (there was a line of not happy guests!).Completely upset 鈥?I went to the manager of the customer service and told about all what happened 鈥?she promised to contact us in the morning (before our departure) 鈥?nobody did!I am disappointed with the way customers are treated in a five star hotel and strongly would advise to all my friends - stay away from Bahia Principe Ambar!I wish to receive comments from Transat Holidays and from Bahia Principe Ambar management in regards to all surprises we went threw in a five star resort.Remain,Igor Toronto , Canada

<Author>Have-a-Dream
<Content>It鈥檚 definitively not a 5 stars hotel. A beautiful resort but the service needs improvement.The bottom line: The place is beautiful especially the beach. The rooms are very comfortable and have a nice bathroom. The restaurants and the buffet are good but not exceptional. But the place is big, too big! You have to take a shuttle to go to the theatre. In this kind of resort you are a number not a client and the service is not as high as it should be for a 5 stars hotel.The express service: We arrived at 10h30 pm, no reception (too late I suppose), only one person for the checking and we just received our keys with no explanation. At this time all the restaurants and the snacks are closed. But you have the 鈥渆xpress鈥?service, in theory. Once in our room, we check for a menu, no menu, so we phoned to the 鈥淓xpress鈥?service around 11h pm. At midnight we called back just in case they have forgotten us. 鈥淭hat won鈥檛 be long鈥?was the answer, but at 1h am we gave up and went to sleep with a diet.The air conditioner: You have to let a key card in a box to get the electricity and the air conditioner, but you are not allowed to let the key inside the box when you go outside. If you do it, the house keeper will take it. The problem is that your room is hot at the end of the day. So we gave a special tip for that every day and were able to keep our room cold. We also let a tip for the washcloth, but it didn鈥檛 work every day. It鈥檚 becoming a tip industry but it鈥檚 not what we expect in 5 stars hotel.The Beach towel: They don鈥檛 use card for the beach towel and put 2 towels in your room, in theory. As we didn鈥檛 have these towels, we had to go to the reception. The staff was suspicious but finally we got our towels. I have to say that we found too often an attitude of indifference or nonchalance from many of the staff. You can change your towel in a special place close to the pool between 8h am and 17h30 pm, in theory. Each time we arrived at 4h30 pm they were no towels anymore. Actually, they are really available between 9h am and 4h pm. Not what we consider a good service and it鈥檚 why we saw a lot of towels drying out on the balcony, not very beautiful.The internet: Internet is free in the hotel, in theory. There are only two computers available for all the people. So the line-up could be long! If you have your laptop, you can use the WIFI service, in theory. The guy that takes care of this service is not from the hotel so the staff has to call him to come and give you a username and a password. If you are lucky the guy will come in 10mn but it could last more than 1h. Not what I call a good service.More: I could speak about the safe that didn鈥檛 work, about the sprinkler that sprinkled our entire terrace, about the sand we found on our bed when we arrived, about the palapa you have to book before 6am on the beach or on the pool, about the lobby (that seems to be an outbuilding if you compare with the other lobbies) with almost no animation, etc鈥?Conclusion: We had good vacation in this place and we took long walks on the beach but we didn鈥檛 receive a service that could have given to us the feeling that we were in a special place. Go there uniquely if you can have a good price but don鈥檛 spend more money for this place, if you are looking for a really 5 stars hotel go elsewhere.

<Content>Great vacation! We stayed at the Bahia Principe for a week - from Sat. Feb 9th through Sat. Feb 16 2008. We booked online through Apple and left from Philadelphia for a direct flight to Punta Cana. Our original reservations were for the main resort, Bahia Principe Punta Cana, but we arrived after 10 p.m. and were told we were upgraded, which we found out meant they were overbooked. So we were taken to Ambar, which is the newest section of the resort, BUT were told we had to use the restaurants, bars and pools in our original location - and they were quite far apart. My husband asked - nicely - and we were given privileges to use everything at Ambar. Another couple who were arguing and yelling at the manager, were NOT accomodated, so please be nice! Anyway, the entire resort grounds can be confusing - there is Punta Cana, Bavaro, Ambar, Diamond, and they are all separate, but there are common areas. Trying to figure it out took all week. But instead of worrying about it, we just enjoyed where we were. There is SO much there, it would be impossible to use it all anyway, so just go out and enjoy. The grounds are immaculate, the beach is beautiful. All the things others have said are true about reserving beach chairs or palapas - I swear people go out in the middle of the night to stake their spot. We did get a palapa every day, but it was not easy. Beach towels are provided, and plenty of towels in the room. Ambar rooms are serviced twice a day - maid service in the morning, and turn down service at night - with more towels, chocolates and little bottles of liquor. Minibar was replenished every day with beer, bottled water, soda. If you use washcloths in the shower, bring them - we bought 15/$5 at Walmart. The rooms are lovely, the mattress was comfortable, and so were the pillows. The pillow service and bath service are extra at Ambar - you can order scented pillows, and scented baths, but I can't see the point myself. There is a lovely balcony where you can sit at night and have a cocktail - be careful - our porch door locked behind us and we were stuck on the balcony until our shouting got a maintenance man. Making yourself understood is difficult - hardly anyone speaks anything other than Spanish. But they try very hard.The food was wonderful, particularly at the buffet. So many people complain about hot not being hot - cold not being cold. Aside from the cold cuts ( which we don't eat) we found everything to be as would be expected. There were plenty of choices, a theme every night, and beautiful selections of salads and desserts. Coffee is served only at breakfast. The specialty restaurants are a nice idea, but there are many servers running around in a disorganized fashion, and the food is not really reflective of the theme. We had reservations in the Italian restaurant, Portofino, and there was NO pasta on the menu that night. Nothing remotely Italian. Also, we sat and waited there for 45 minutes, got water and bread, but never got anything else. Some tables were getting excellent service and some were getting none at all. We left and went to the buffet. The staff on the grounds, the buffet, and the cleaning staff are very efficient. So are the barmaids - but we usually went to the lobby bar at Punta Cana - much livelier. There is also coffee and tea service every day at 4.Drinks are OK - many not like what'd you get in the US with the same name. Margaritas are good, blended drinks, and Irish coffee. And don't forget to try mamajuana - the aphrodiasiac that makes mamma wanna. It's made with rum, branches, spices, etc - and you drink it as a shot - loved it! We saw one show, Lion King. Very cute, kind of amateurish, but this is not Broadway. The shops at the little village were OK - mostly cheap souvenirs. Be sure to bargain - a lot. Casino costs extra- didn't go. Didn't take any side trips.All in all, we had a wonderful vacation - we went to relax, and we did. We spent our days on the beach reading and walking and just enjoying the beautiful weather. At night we dressed nicely for dinner and had a nice dinner with wine. Got tons of beautiful photos.For all the complaints we read, we would still go there again, and just realize that nothing is perfect, and the people here try hard to please and they are very nice and friendly. Exceptions were a couple bartenders who had an attitude, but you will find different people everywhere. We tried to tip people who don't usually get tips - like the drivers of the shuttles that are available day and night, and the housekeepers. Just GO and enjoy - be sure to take insect repellant ( our room in building 69 was on the edge of the jungle and I am covered in mosquito bites), sunscreen, immodium in case of diarrhea, books for the beach, insulated mugs to keep your beer cold on the beach, and some hats. Don't overpack - you don't need more than lots of swimsuits and some nice clothes for evening - we could have gotten along with HALF of what we took. We would highly recommend Bahia Principe - it's a work in progress, but we'd surely go there again anyway. We have been to many other all-inclusives and this one is very, very nice. Enjoy!

<Content>Great Time...Solo Adultos GRAN BAHIA PRINCIPE 鈥?AMBAR (Feb.3rd-10th)Overall rating 4.5 stars鈥ome room for improvement. Went there because of the 鈥淪olo Adultos鈥濃€ice vacation for me and he wife.LIKES:-The beach was great鈥een to Punta Cana 4 times now and never found anything different. With all the new resorts popping up there was quite a bit more pedestrian traffic on the beach than I had noticed in the past.-The resort was beautiful.-The room was great. No complaints.-Food was overall good, usually something to find at the buffet and I found the A La Carts to be 鈥渉it or miss鈥?depending on what you ordered.-The service was fantastic鈥hey are always getting you drinks or taking your plates away etc. At he A La Cart restaurants there seemed to be even more staff to give that little extra service.-The Ambar pool was very nice鈥e usually found a couple of chairs by the pool. There is a limited number of seating that is shaded so you would have to be out there by 8am.-Always found chairs at the beach no matter what time we went down there.-Using the Catamaran was easy and a lot of fun.-Room safe was included at Ambar and it was secure and easy to use.-Maids did a fine job.-The 鈥渓ocals鈥?at the Bahia were friendly.-Enjoyed the Bavaro lobby bar because the singer there was more up beat and lively than the jazz type at the Ambar. Both singers were good. The waitresses seemed to be a little quicker at the Bavaro too.-Met a lot of great people, some were from North Bay, Winnipeg, Richmond Hill, Hamilton, Milton, and Barrie. I am sure there are others but those were just the people we met鈥?br/>-Free Internet in Ambar Lobby.DISLIKES:-The Ambar lobby bar was really quiet (Don鈥檛 know if they think because of adults only everyone would be sleeping?). At 11pm they stop serving alcohol and shut down the bar鈥on after they were coming out with plastic glasses to put your drinks into. It really is a shame because several nights we were anywhere from 6-10 people gathered around as a group and the place was quite busy and people obviously still wanted to be out鈥?br/>-The room mini fridge was not always stocked with everything on a daily basis鈥 want my Pringles!-Had to wear long pants to all the restaurants for dinner鈥t was a bit warm and muggy some nights and I prefer to wear dress shorts鈥?which still look formal enough in my opinion.-The entertainment shows鈥ut who goes to Punta Cana for the shows?Side Notes: -Our bus arrived in to the resort late and we went directly to the room without ever having to check in at the front desk. Due to overbooking we were put in the Bavaro Premium part of the resort for the night. The guy on the bus told us it was part of the Ambar resort which it clearly was not鈥ot tough to look at the map and see we were on the other side of the line. The next day we went to the Ambar lobby desk at 10am and they told us to come back at 1pm and they would be able to give us a room at that time鈥ecause checkout is noon. Returned at that time and we got a great room on the 3rd floor in building 67 overlooking the pool with a view of the ocean. Very happy with that. They even gave us a couple small bottles of rum. 4 t-shirts (make great giveaways upon returning home), and $100 USD.-Checkout is at noon. Advised to have a small bag with whatever you need including airplane clothes because you can change and shower at the Bahia Gym shortly before having to go to the Bavaro lobby to catch the bus. There are clean towels there for you to use. -Calling to Canada or USA from Domican Republic 鈥?We had no problem I got a calling card that calls above for a great rate. Upon checking out of the hotel we were NOT charged any type of connection fees nor any other hotel per minute fees鈥he calling card has 888/800 numbers to facilitate the connection. (Just google buy america calling cards).-We didn鈥檛 eat at all the restaurants so I am only going to make one recommendation 鈥?We liked the Mediterranean at the Bavaro Gold section at the resort the best.-They have a square not far from the Bavaro lobby somewhere that is open after midnight for drinks and snack food鈥n addition to the disco.-Bring your own shampoo/soaps鈥 found that I had a bit of reaction to them.-Try the drink of the day鈥nd enjoy.

<Content>Beautiful Beach Feb. 2 - 9th, 2008 - As Ambar guests, we were automatically checked in  our room keys were handed to us on our bus ride there from the airport. A real bonus.The use of the entire resort (Ambar,Bavaro,Punta Cana) was nice, but made for the entire resort feeling way to big.The Ambar side is definately quiet. The Beaches are beautiful here. Possibly the best we've been to in the Dominican! But it is becoming more  more commercialized with every passing year. The stretches of Beach were wall to wall bodies. Makes for great people  activity watching! The Food was just OK. I got a little bored with it by day 4,  I am usually a try-it-all kind of eater!The bartenders need lessons on speed, service  friendliness.The maid staff was just OK too. No real issues, just a little slow, but that is the way of the Dominicans!I have attached a new map of the entire Bahia Principe resort.The weather was great! And that is what we went for!Enjoy,Dar 'n DarWasaga Beach, Ontariodarlene@wasagahomes.com

<Content>Very Good with Potential to be Excellent Check In: We took a taxi from the airport ($35 US plus tip), arrived around midnight and had a smooth check in. No waiting, no issues. Thank you, Marconi.Room: Very clean, in good condition as expected for a new property. Nice bathroom, nice sheets, but knobby bedspreads from too many washings - must have been recycled from another property.Beach: We've been everywhere in the Caribbean, and this is one of the nicest. Soft, pale beige and endless. Surf was substantial most days, but swimmable. Plenty of shade and loungers.Restaurants: The food was very good to excellent. Restaurant service is the Achilles鈥?heel at the moment. Some waiters are excellent, but overall, the staff needs to learn to focus on the guests and not on setting/resetting tables at the expense of all other aspects of guest service. It was typical to have to signal one's waiter, who often walked by without looking in the direction of the tables with guests seated. They are busy, no doubt, but just need more training on attending to their guests.Bars: Pool bar staff (Jose  Carlos) make excellent Mojitos when fresh mint available. Not a big drinker, but tried a few tropical drinks that were very sweet - not to my taste, but nice enough. Good mojitos are quite labour intensive, so the staff appreciated that we left a tip each time we ordered one. Entertainment: Didn't take in any shows, so can't comment, but advertisements indicated the cheesy lip-sync fare typical of the all-inclusive, was offered.One Beef: Since it is common knowledge that tipping included really means no tips for the ground-level staff, my major issue is with people who don't tip. In spite of the fact that service isn't tops yet, I can't believe how many people sit in the specialty restaurants and even the buffets, and leave nothing at the end of the meal. How cheap can some people be? Surely people have their eyes opened on the way to the hotel and can appreciate how much a few dollars mean to the hard-working staff. If you can't spend $10-20 dollars extra a day to thank people for their service, you should go somewhere cheaper or stay home.Conclusion: Since the hotel's Ambar section hasn't been open long, a few service glitches were not surprising. Compared to the Majestic next door, which we went to later in the week for a few nights, it is similarly good with the notable exception of restaurant service, which was excellent at the Majestic. Overall, we had a great vacation. We would certainly go back to GP Ambar again.

<Content>Would return in a minute! My husband and I were at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar January 27-February 3rd. This was a beautiful adult only all-inclusive resort. Considering it was only open for 2 months it was run quite smoothly. The grounds were kept perfectly, with staff pruning, planting  watering daily. The room was beautiful, with a large sitting area, four-poster bed and large marble washroom with a whirlpool tub and glassed-in shower. Our maid service was great; we had no problems with towels or the -bar being restocked. We even had face towels each day, which seems to have been an issue with some other travellers. The staff were all very friendly. There was a bit of a communication problem sometimes; staff did not all speak English well. Mauricio in the main buffet spoke English beautifully and was extremely attentive without hovering. We gave tips to those who did a good job and it was most appreciated.The pool was lovely  quiet, but would it have been against 'adult only' rules to have had some music playing for part of the day? You did have to go quite early (i.e. 6 a.m.) to get a lounge chair in a good location. The beach was gorgeous white sand and it was easy to get lounge chairs any time of day, with lots of palapas for shade on the beach. Great for long walks!A la carte restaurants were pre-booked for us on arrival; it was easy enough to change at Guest Services if we wanted. Portofino (Italian) was lovely, as was the Don Pablo Gourmet. The service at the a la carte restaurants was a little inconsistent; one night very slow and another very good. I chalk this up to being new and the staff (and chefs) still needing training.Generally it was a great vacation; nice and relaxing. I would return tomorrow if I could get away again!

<Content>Just returned from Ambar - it was excellent! Hello,We just returned from 1 wk (Jan 31-Feb 7) and our vac met all our expectations in every way at this resort. I was concerned since the Ambar side is brand new but we would def go back  recommend the resort to friends  family. The adult side is the way to go, as it was peaceful, lovely to dine and quiet at night. The regular Bahia Principe side was very noisy, crowded  busy. While walking the beach we kept checking out other resorts  liked this one much better.We ate  drank lots at all the a la carte's (Don Pablo Gourmet was great)  buffets and our stomachs were perfectly fine the whole time, same with many people we spoke to said the food was amazing. They purify the water, so you could eat salads, ice cubes  water in restaurants (we used bottled water for brushing our teeth). They import all the fruit which we ate tons of.The maids work incredibly hard from morn/night so our room was always sparkling, beds are firm and brand new and everything is spotless, they are always cleaning  grooming the lush, beautiful grounds  hotel lobby  the villa's at all times. We tipped all the time (didn't see too many others doing it) as they work such long days  most are soooo cheerful  will do anything you ask. We also left gifts  $$ for the maids -but pls if you are tipping, give discreetly right into their hands, we suspect the supervisors/bosses take it otherwise - they are soooo incredibly grateful when you do this and really deserve it.If you need anything in your room, just leave a note for the maids, we had our fridge filled, fresh towels and bed turned down ea night w/chocolates, we were incredibly impressed for our first time in the Dominican. Our sliding door broke one eve  after calling service there was a repair man there within 5 mins  he fixed it. Safety deposit box worked perfectly  was great to have.There are plenty of lounges on the adult beach area even if you don't place a towel early-you can get a quiet place to nap anytime of the day  listen to crashing waves  palm trees. No one bugs you on the resort property re timeshares  vendors at all which was great - there was a market you could walk to on the beach 15 mins away which was fun too. They take US$ and peso's - be sure to barter, never pay full price!The pool area is a dif story, people put towels there early but if you come back around 4-5 to swim, there will be chairs available and you always have sooo much room to swim, it was never crowded, most were sun bathing or drinking at the swim up bar.There were only a couple rude employees out of so many who work hard there (one gal in the outdoor grill pool area should be fired as she was terrible, spilling water all the time, dropping things  incredibly rude - and the lady who greets you at Don Pablo needs more training too in being more polite) whereas Rudolfo was outstanding and same with Sonia who cheerfully greets you at Portofino's morning and night it seemed. A lot of the servers are cheerful, singing and tend to you constantly asking which language you prefer as well - they are really trying hard we found. Do make sure to learn some basic spanish sentences as you will need it  it's appreciated. Portofino's is a great place for bfast to eat quietly overlooking the ocean too.We are seriously considering going back next year (if the price doesn't go up) as the value was excellent and after speaking with several people who have visited other AI's worldwide, they were praising this one a lot too.

<Content>Awesome!!! Hi,My wife and I just returned from a one week stay at AMBAR, and we had a great time!We booked with expedia and the vacation was with Air Transat. Check-in:The check-in process was a breeze! We landed at the airport, received our luggage and then we headed to the bus that took us to the resort! The check-in was done on the bus! We received a package that had our room keys, and all info that you need for check in. We arrived at the resort, and we were immediately shuttled to our rooms! So quick and easy!Restaurants:This resort has 7-9 different restaurants in total. As a guest staying at AMBAR you are entited to go to these restaurants an unlimited number of times (whereas other guests had a limit). When we arrived, our welcome package already had four A LA Cart reservations pre-booked for us. We changed a few, and the process in doing so, was VERY EASY!The Japanese restaurant was by far our favourite! The Italian was also very good. The other restaurants they have are on par with medium to high quality restaurants here (Toronto).Rooms:Clean. Well maintained. Maid service was good. Mini-bar was small but always stocked daily. We were on the bottom floor, but as expected only encountered a bug here and there (nothing to worry about).Pool:There were 3 or 4 pools in total. The AMBAR pool was nice and quiet. A great place to read a book or sleep. If you want some action, then go to the main pool, and there is always music and games! They gave everyone one blue towel which was to be used for the pool and beach. Whenever you wanted to exchange it for a clean one, it was very easy to do!Beach:BEAUTIFUL! And very long as well! You could walk for a very long time on the beach!Night Entertainment:OK, not totally great every night. Having said that, the Michael Jackson show was VERY impressive (it's a MUST SEE). The club (beside the small Casino) is fun at night (Thurs-Sun are best). The Karaoke is lots of fun too.Casino:Small Casino with about 20 slots, 2 roulette tables, 3 blackjack tables and a 3-card/Carribean poker table. They DO have Texas Hold'em every night ($100 US buy-in, no limit). Fun to watch!!Staff:Always friendly, we expected some of them would have some communication difficulties but overall had very little issues getting what we needed. Just learn a few basic words like Hola (Hello), Donde Que (Where is...?), Gracias (Thank you), Bien (Good). The more the better.Excursions:Only went on one and it was fantastic - Bavaro Runners Jeep Tour ([--]) - picked the all day package. Also heard the Catalina cruise was amazing from fellow dwellers.Things we should have brought:Heavy duty cold meds - we got the sniffles from a sick passenger on the way down. In DR only Pharmacies can dispense over-the-counter meds. Also bring Tums - lots of drinks equals acid buildup.All in all - great trip for us (married). For singles - well the Bahia Bavaro or Bahia Punta Cana (all on the same grounds) would be better. Ambar is too ritzy for party folks.Bottom Line - would I go back? Yes, for sure. We met a couple who has been to Bahia 6 times.

<Content>RELAXING My husband an I stayed at the Ambar Jan 10 to 17. We have traveled to all inclusives (5*) before, so knew what to expect. We went by ourselves, and found it relaxing. The hotel was clean, the maid service was not 5*. We too had to chase down pool towels, extra h20 and mini bar was rarely stocked with food. We left 5 dollar tips daily, and on day 4 my husb accidentally left 20.00 by the T.V, this was after the maid rec'd her tip and made up our room. When we returned to dress for supper, the money was gone... We did not really like the idea that someone was going into our room randomly. But overall, the resort was great, as well as the food. The staff were friendly. The most important thing was we got away from real life for a while and enjoyed a beautiful setting. I knew booking this resort that it was brand new, and expected some glitches. One thing we will do is return to the Gran bahia Principe Bavaro with our two boys next year, as we toured the rest of the resort and realized it'll be a great place for our whole family...

<Content>loved it Have stayed at Royal Suites Palladium, and Royal Suites Occidental Xcaret and found the Ambar by far the best. The resturants on the Ambar side are all good-way better than the resturants at the Bavaro and Principe. No problem with dinner reservations they were all made for us on arrival at around 7-7:30 which was perfect for us. If you wanted quiet -you had it at the Ambar pool and lobby -if not just go to the other pool or in the evening hop on the train and head over to the square and catch a show-three were outstanding; Lion King, Legends and Michael Jackson.Then if you still want more there is a choice of a live band,the Karokee bar or casino and from 12-3am the Disco.The place is beautiful and sparkling clean. We had room in building 67 which is an excellent location to several resturants, beach and pool. Staff were very friendly and most accomadating at every place within the hotel we went to. People did get up early to save chairs under palapa's -we were lucky to find a nice couple whom we dubbed Mr.  Mrs. Tim Horton who very kindly saved us a spot every morning. Things aren't 100 percent yet-but after talking to management-they are working on it. I had no complaints other than trouble with room key. Normally like to go to different resorts but fell in love with the Ambar and will definately go back. Travel dates Jan 24-31/08. Please feel free to ask questions.

<Content>Beautiful getaway! Spent a week at this new resort January 25th to Feb 1st. We were very pleased overall. Highlights were the beautiful white sand beach, with royal palms overhead, lots of beach chairs, turquoise ocean and constant breeze. The resort itself was exceptionally clean, the marble lobby floors polished continuously. The grounds were well manicured and lush. Our room was nice, although the lighting was too dim. Although clean, there was a faint septic smell, sometimes stronger than others, in the bathroom. We did not have a view of the ocean, we were in building 63, which is closest to the lobby, rather than the ocean front. Building 60 is on the pool and ocean front, if you can request ahead, and a corner room is nicer. The food was very good, a great buffet, but like all buffet could get tiresome day after day, which is why the a la carte was a nice option. They had prebooked us for four evening meals at various a la carte restaurants, and we took the ones they provided, and enjoyed them all. The food was good. Desserts in the carribean are not up to our standards, but the entrees were good. Good wine included, as much as you wanted. The downside was the service in the restaurants. Language is a barrier throughout the resort, and so also in the restuarants. They seemed to be training a lot of new staff, and considering the 3rd world state of the Dominican Republic, it is no wonder that it would take some time for them to gain the skills required. They were mostly friendly, and trying, but not up to standard. Knowing some spanish was a definite asset. Take lots of US one dollar bills for tipping. We did two excursions - one was snorkeling among nurse sharks and stingrays at the reef, as well as a cruise on a ship. It was a good outing, although it poured rain for part of the afternoon.We also went with the Bavarro Runners on a tour in a big jeep that took us out into the dominican countryside, for a variety of experiences, including a tour of a local school, an average house, a fruit farm, a cigar factory, a horse back ride, a visit to a local public beach. It was a very good day out.We would go again.It is a very romantic, quiet, low key resort. Enjoyed the adult only venue, which was strictly enforced by security guards.

<Content>Very clean resort, could be better service. We just returned from the Ambar, where we spent the week of Jan. 19-26th. First I would just like to mention that often what makes a vacation is the people you meet, and we met some wonderful people. Hi to Danny  Toby, Steve and Jane.Now about the Ambar:Rooms and grounds: beautiful rooms, although we did have a leak from the ceiling in our bathroom. (Room 69215). It took me three complaints before it was finally fixed. It is a brand new section and is probably the cleanest resort we have ever been to, Beach bathroom and all.Service: We found the service to be fair. And, unfortunately, I have to say that there was really an attitude of indifference from many of the staff. Not all, but most. To be fair, it is possible that part of this may be the lack of an ability to speak English. I'm not referring to the maids, but even the bar staff, waiters, front desk, etc.. As we know very little Spanish, it was very difficult at times communication wise. Since the majority of guests are english speaking one would think that this would have been given more attention. We have traveled extensively to Spanish speaking tourist areas and have found the service much better in the Mayan Riviera for instance.Restaurants: Make your reservations for the a la carte restaurants for your entire stay as soon as you get there, or a.s.a.p. We found the best resteraunts were on the Ambar side; the Italian and the Don Pueblo Gourmet being our favorite. The filet mignon at the Ambar was excellent. By the way , look at the english translation menu closely. ( you'll get a kick out of it.) The buffet was ok, the usual omelettes, fruit., Dont expect good cereal, unless you like fruit loops??Beach: The beach is large. Beautiful sand and you can take long walks on the beach. They have dancing lessons on the beach at 11:00 a.m. further down, not in front of the Ambar. Punta cana is on the Atlantic side, so the water can be a bit rough. Pool: If you want shade by the pool, plan on waking up at 5:00 a. m. to get chairs under a palapa, as practically every lounger has a towel on it before 7:00 AM. There aren't many. Pool area was quiet and relaxing.Lobby bar: Beautiful lobby bar area with lite live entertainment. However the down side is that once the bar closes at 11:00, things really shut down. They dim the lights, and even take your glasses away, (replacing them with plastic cups if you decide to finish your drink). There is nowhere to go except to take the shuttle to the other side. The Karaoke bar there opens at 10:00 p.m. Tues - Sat.. By the way this is also the piano bar, but there is no piano?? The Disco is opened at midnight, alot of people and alot of fun.Sickness: My stomach was just alittle off one day. I didn't even take anything. However I don't eat red meat or sea food. My husband was ill one day. I brought Immodium, and that did the trick, he was fine after that. He feels it was the Calamari at the buffet one evening. The cook didn't leave it on the grill very long. Just common sense, make sure things are well cooked. Bring Immodium, pepto bismol, and you'll be fine. They do wash the salad with purified water, and the ice is also fine. Just don't drink the tap water or brush your teeth with it. The maid stocks the fridge with bottled water, but sometimes they seem to forget, so I had to ask for water a few times. I work in a pharmacy, and another good thing to take if you're really worried about it is acidophillus, a couple of days before you leave and during your stay.Overall: A beautiful resort, but service needs improvement, mainly due to the lack of english.

<Content>We'll be going back! I'll keep this short because the last few reviews can't be topped.Our stay at the Ambar was perfect.Jan 15-22. Even the storm that went through on the 21st didn't bother us...it gave us a chance to take some last minute pics and get a frew trinkets. By afternoon we were back in the ocean.To comment of a few beefs I've been reading...First relax you're on a holiday!Ask nicely and you'll get better results.You don't need to tip alot but the cost of a couple of Timmies a day sure helps those who aim to please you.Go to Debbies Dominican Republic Page and study her simple spanish phases, helps to understand alittle.I've noticed that the complaints relating to check in were mostly late arrival flights. Book a morning arrival, we arrived 1pm were checked in, had our braclets, luggage secured,went and had lunch and the room was ready at 3 as promised.Any problems were rectified shortly after a call to the front desk.There is definently no shortage of food or drink, lots of room around the pool, never had a problem finding chairs on the beach. Everything is mint shape and kept clean...amazing for the size of the resort and beach area.The only excursion that I took was to play a round at LaCana Golf Club.Beauty course. 30 min ride to play along the Carribean Sea was well worth it.Would I go back? Already saving for next year!So, go, relax, remember the great resort and don't sweat the small stuff.

<Content>Almost a five star....... My girlfriend and I stayed at the Ambar during the week of the 13th of January, 2008. We know the Bahia Principe product very well due to we stayed at the Grand Bahia pricipe Punta Cana Golden Club(2005) and the Grand Bahia principe Tulum (2006 Mexico) and we were always satisfied with these resorts. We heard that the Ambar was a cut above the rest due to its included in the Don Pablo collection and that peeked our interest. The Ambar is a better Hotel than the BP Punta Cana and the one in Tulum mexico. However it has its faults. The Check in at the arrival to the resort is disorganized. You arrive at the BP Bavaro and then you take a navet to the Ambar section. Then the check-in at Ambar is also slow and never there fault...... We waited about an hour for our room wich wasn`t too bad because we went and had a late lunch at the buffet. We then did the usual check-in and then they gave us our key cards and proceeded to our room. The bell hop took our bags to our room on the third floor and our room was open due to it was freshly cleaned. We diceded to go and have a swim and relax on the beach. coming back from the beach we arrived at our rooom and our key cards didn`t work so we went to the front desk and told them that our cards didn`t work due to they were in contact with water and it was our fault and we should know better and they rolled there eyes back like we were stupid tourists. I stayed in meany hotels and never experienced a problem with a magnetic cards due to water......I would say that they forgot to program the cards, then there answer. Its funny how the key card stayed in my swim shorts and worked the whole time I was there.The rooms are amazingly well appointed and it shows that this resort just recently opened. However the hallways are noisy in the morning and people often slam there doors closed. The restaurants aren`t worth the time. The service is slow and the meals are very well presented, but its not worth the time. The Buffet was excellent however and the service was very good. Every evening had a theme and as well as the core items such as;steaks and seafood. They had lobster, shrimp and various cuts of meat almost ever evening. The beach is awesome and the water is crystal clear with a beatiful sandy bottom. Theres a private section of the beach with a bar for Ambar members only. Actually the whole resort is reserved for Ambar guests only and we saw the security gaurds estorting other BP guests of the Ambar section. We went to the the other part of BP Punta Cana and Bavaro resort and it was packed with people. They must have been booked to the limit. If you want to have a nice relaxing vacation on a beautiful beach with a nice hotel/resort then stay at the BP Ambar. I found it was great value for the money. I think next year it will double the price due to it just opened we got the special openning price. Its a great hotel for couples due to its an adult only resort.

<Content>Fabulous We just returned last night from 7 fabulous days at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar resort in Punta Cana.Everything was first class. The rooms were beautiful, clean, cool, etc, etc. Maid service was perfect (extra beer, liquor, etc when ever you requested it). The food was the best we have ever had in the Dominican (and a great selection)The staff was very accomodating. No real language barrier, if you try the spanish, they will also try the english.The only suggestion I would make is that the bartenders at the Lobby Bar (particulary Wilson) get a few more lessons in mixology and personality. But it was always fun both watching him work and seeing what different versions of common drinks he comes up with.This hotel is another excellent Bahia location and I would highly recommend it.

<Content>What Does 5 Star Mean? We are a 50ish couple who have travelled extensively in the Caribbean at resorts and cruising both as a couple and with our kids. Our criteria for this holiday was 5 star, adults only, good food and a great beach. While the Ambar met all of these expectations, both my husand and I felt that there was something missing. What does 5 star mean? I am convinced that it has little to do with quality and everything to do with amenities. Yes, the Ambar has all those amenities; well-equipped room with mini-bar, spa, gym, ala cart restaurants, room service, swim up bar... and so on. So while we had a great vacation... here are some observations.Flight - flew out of Kitchener - what a treat! Skyservice is well... Squish service! Check your baggage allowance, they do weigh! Carryons - 5 kg. Checked baggage 20 kg. per person, may combine but no piece can be over 32 kg. As guests of the Ambar you have the use of all the facilities of the resort and it is HUGE! Well over 2200 rooms! Take the time to explore. We simple got on the tram and rode it around the resort a couple of times. You can get off, check out the pools, restaurants etc. Use your little map, but be careful ours was in shreds by the second day.Rooms- excellent comfortable bed, free safe, large washroom, slippers and robes. Villas 60, 64 and 67 are closest to the beach and pool.Overall service - inconsistent, try to smile, be patient and learn and use a few spanish phrases, it really does help.Maid service - inconsistent. Facecloths only 2 days out of 7. Towels not changed when room cleaned, delivered anywhere from 5-10 p.m.Never saw the advertised butler.Dress code - Men must wear long pants at the Palmyra buffet restaurant in the evening. We saw many men wearing a nice golf-type shirt and shorts denied entrance to the buffet but men with white t-shirts and tight blue jeans were fine. Anything seems to go at breakfast and lunch.Drinks - If you are a rye drinker (Canadians know what I mean) you are out of luck. The only rye that is available is Canadian Club for an extra charge. Selected international drinks are included but there is a long list of spirits and liqueurs that cost extra. Pina Coladas are excellent. Presidente on tap, good, similar to Blue Light. Wine, satisfactory Spanish, has Bahia Principe Label, waiters get a kick if you can order in Spanish - dos vino tinto or dos vino blanco.Entertainment - next to none. 2 aerobics classes on the beach in the morning and a singer (flat as a pancake) in the lobby a few evenings. All the shows and other entertainment are over at the main hotel. There is no information at the Ambar on times and themes for the evening show. You have to go over to the theatre to find this out - a 20 minute walk or 5 minutes by tram. There is also no information either in the lobby, pool area or rooms about any entertainment or activities anywhere!Dinner Restaurants - Transat Holidays made 4 reservations at the ala cartes for us. Barbacoa (barbeque) was open air. Good salads, breads, desserts (buffet style) meat being cooked on large barbeques. Beef was tough and undercooked, piglet was undercooked and the server had no idea how to carve it, chicken and sauage were good. El Olivo (mediterranean) again buffet appetizers, salad and dessert. Food was good but we waited over an hour for our main course as they kept pouring wine..... Garlic shrimp and ? Very small portions. Porto Fino (Italian) again buffet appetizers, salad and dessert. Main courses were very good. We had chicken cutlets and lobster pasta. Don Pablo (gourmet) - truly ala carte we wanted the soup and an appetizer, but only could have one! We chose lobster canneloni and smoked salmon, both good. For main course filet mignon and lobster something. I ordered my steak medium - it was very rare! If you want well-done you really need to make sure they understand. The desset Fantasy of Chocolate was excellent. I also booked with Guest Services the Mediterraneo up at the Premier Club. It was the best! Truly ala carte. We had grilled sea bass and citrus chicken, both excellent. We ate 2 times at the Palmyra and it was very good. You can also make reservations at the ala cartes at the Bavaro and Punta Canta sides but we ran out of time.Breakfast -available at the main buffet Palmyra or at the Portofino. The Portofino was our favourite - smaller and less extensive buffet but quiet and not busy.Lunch - available at the Palmyra and pool side buffet. Portofino may open for lunch only in peak season. Good lunch choices but the same everyday. I wanted a hamburger but was very concerned that the insides were very pink. One day there was a man testing the temperature of the buffet food. I asked him to check the burgers. He said they were fine but.....?Food in general - there is a huge selection, fabulous salad ingredients and salads, fruits, breads and desserts. Remember that they are catering to both European and North American tastes so there are often some strange items on the buffet.Tours and Excursions - only did one, Reef Explorer. Excellent trip altough a bit pricey - $83 for 1/2 day. Pick up at 8:10, to the Marinarium by 8:45, on the floating dock by 9:00. 3 hours to snorkle, swim with the stingrays ($10 for picture), swim with the sharks, kayak, have a massage, sunbathe. You plan your time! Great snacks- sandwiches, fresh fruit, juice and water. This is NOT a party boat but a very relaxing time in the middle of the ocean.The Towel Game - played everyday! There is not usually a problem at the beach unless you arrive in the early afternoon but at the pool all the sun beds with shade are reserved with towels by 8:00. There are not even close to enough sunbeds or shade at the pool for the 500+ rooms of the resort.Beach - what can I say, it is beautiful. you can walk for miles and the only thing you run out of is time. However, I have never seen so many people in all my life and I don't think we were at peak season! WOW!So... for our tastes Bahia Principe complex is just too big. We have discovered that we do prefer smaller resorts (300 rooms) even though there may not be as many amenities. Saying that we are off to the new Edenh Real resort in February with a group of 8 of us, but that's a whole new story.....!

<Content>Not Horrible, Not Great The review which was just posted was very detailed and accurately described our experience as well. Accordingly, will just say that we agree with all that has been said - good and bad - that is the problem, inconsistency. We have stayed at 10 other AI resorts in other countries - this was the first one in the Dominican. Would we go back? Probably not. Was it horrible? No, we can have a good time wherever we go. Some things were wonderful, some just really not great.We rely on Trip Advisor heavily so just want to paint an accurate view of the resort so you can make a knowledgable decision. If you already booked, no worries, you will have a great time. If you are considering booking this resort, I would read this review, and some of the others carefully - in the end, the price was very cheap (probably b/c it just opened) and if you are looking for a good value, have a lot of patience, and can overlook the inconsistency, you will have a great time.Overall, we arrived at main lobby and it was a bit of a circus atmosphere -enjoyed arriving at the Ambar lobby - much more sedate and the facilities are just beautiful and brand new. Brought to our room and it was b/w lunch and dinner - there was no info in room, but knew from Trip Advisor that we could get room service. Called the Express Service (which by the way was supposed to attach you to your butler for your building - never saw or heard of any such butler) and asked where to find a menu and they told me there wasn't one, but they could tell me what they had - thought it was strange. About 45 minutes later burger, fries and nachos arrived- they were fine. Wouldn't bring drinks and was told they were extra - that is one thing that bothered me - either be an AI resort or not - for some, the safe was extra (for us not - not sure why), certain drinks - seems like they should charge $50 more per person and make it all inclusive period. Anyway, was given a map but no info about show times, restaurants - really had to figure a lot out on our own - good thing we had read all these reviews.We were in Buidling 64 and 3rd floor - nice balcony, could see water and close to beach.Mini bar was totally inconsistent -w e did feel like we had to beg for water bottles. Also, second day we returned to room around 5:00 pm and had not been cleaned.Room was very nice. True, AC doesn't stay on unless you put room card in - we just left one of our cards in there all the time or else it got very stuffy.We had no problem with check in like many, but it was an absolute joke inquiring about a later check out. The front desk just smiles and you know they have no idea how to answer.Overall, was supposed to be adults only but did see kids wandering around and on the beach.Lobby had two terminals for internet - extra again for wireless access in your room - always a line for the computers- need to get a few more terminals. FoodThey had made our reservations which was fine, except the first night was at the main resort and after seeing the circus atmosphere, traveling all day, and being w/o our kids, we wanted a quiet dinner on Ambar side - was told all full. Very strange, finally got into the BBQ restaurant and food was good, but it, and the Brazilian next door were empty - we asked if we could change to Brazilian and told no w/o reservation - the place was totally empty and it made no sense. Also, we tried to change the time of one of our reservations and was told no - all booked - again, that night restaurant was empty. I thought Ambar restaurants were for Ambar only but we saw lots of different color bracelets. Go to Portofino for breakfast - same buffet, view of beach and much more peaceful than Palmyra.Lunch at grill was fine grill fare. Lobster at Don Pablo was excellent. They worked hard at presentation in all restaurants. However, I came home with food poisoning, my husband didn't. Did overhear another complaining of stomach distress. He was speaking French, but was easy to understand his problems!I had read not to drink water and we put water bottle in our bathroom to brush with - tiny sign under towels telling you not to drink the water - if I hadn't read it here, not sure I would have seen that sign. Heads up.BarsLobby Bar was nice and elegant. Pool Bar and Beach bars were inconsistent in hours and had to hike over there to get a 6 oz glass of water. Not sure why they don't have water bottles out like most resorts. No drink service on the beach - would have been nice to be brought a soda or water. Had a little rain one day and it stopped, but beach bar closed for day and never reopened.Beach Pretty, deep and water was nice. All chairs at beach and pool were reserved by 8:00 and made no sense. Nice little huts, but no palapas or anything special. closer to the water is that stretch of Bavarro - beautiful, but very very touristy - this is not the place for solitude and quiet (think parasailers, someone walking around with monkeys and iguanas to take pictures etc)Yes, the people work hard and yes there is a language barrier. I think management (who runs other resorts) could really have a great place here if they trained the staff appropriately and had some that spoke English and French. The menus are in several languages, but no one could answer a question. We just laughed and went with the flow, but there were many disgruntled people at this resort. Biggest problem is lack of information and ability to get any - a book in the room in various languages explaining the options, policies, room service menu, etc would go a long way.We went on a last minute trip for a good deal and without kids - we had a nice time, but there is nothing about this resort I would want to go back for. It wasn't awful, but it really was not great either. Hope this helps.

<Content>Did not meet expectations My boyfriend and I just got back from our trip to Punta Cana where we stayed at the Ambar section of Gran Bahia Principe. We had read some reviews and we booked our trip with high hopes for our stay. Unfortunately, the hotel did not live up to our expectations. We arrived at the main lobby of the hotel late in the day (after 10pm) and were driven to the Ambar lobby to do the check-in. I thought that both lobbies were absolutely beautiful, with marble floors and an open concept. There were few walls, so they were open to the breezes. We checked into the hotel at the Ambar lobby and were told to mark our luggage with our room number and the bellboy would bring it to us. Then we were given a map and pointed in the direction of our room, then sent off to find it for ourselves. It wasn't too difficult, each villa was numbered and then the rooms were the last 3 digits. It would have been nice if we had a guide though. THE ROOM When we got to our room, the first thing that we noticed was the smell. It was closed up, with no air conditioning on and smelled very musty. We turned on the air conditioning and hoped that it would clear up. Over the course of the week, we asked that they spray the room with something to make it smell better. After first thinking that we wanted it sprayed for bugs, they figured it out and it did improve. It never completely went away though. We never asked to switch rooms because we had a nice corner room overlooking the edge of the resort, so our view was of lots of palm trees and we could still see a bit of the ocean. When we were out on the balcony, we could hear the birds chirping out in the trees and were not disturbed by a lot of activity within the resort. The closet was fairly spacious and had an ironing board, umbrella (which we didn't notice until we checked out), robes, slippers, and a safe. The safe was very safe. We put our passports and money in it the first night, and then couldn't open it the next day. We had to call for maintenance to come and fix it. It was a bad motor and he had to take it apart and put a new one in. There was also a vent for the air conditioner on the ceiling in the closet - watch out for condensation and don't put anything on the shelf directly underneath it. The bathroom had a separate shower and tub. The shower had a choice between using the regular shower head or the wand. I used the tub once during our stay and found that the nozzles for all of the jets were very loose so you can't set them to one position. When I turned it on at the beginning, it immediately sprayed upwards and soaked my book. After adding more water, and watching where I positioned myself, I was able to avoid too much spray into the air, but it was disappointing because a jet tub was one of the things I was looking for in a hotel room. As for the toilet, the seat was not quite the right size, and seemed very loose so you had to watch when you sat down. The rest was pretty standard - sink, hairdryer, vanity mirror. It was a good size though, and they provided shampoo, body wash, moisturizer and a loofah. We had a king-size four post bed with what looked like a wooden tic-tac-toe board overhead. That was actually a pretty good place to hang clothes. I found it very comfortable, and very big. The dresser had three drawers on the left and a mini-bar on the right hand side. The middle was open, with a seat underneath. It had a flat screen TV on it (which we did not use) and a coffee machine. Each day, the maid would make sure that we had a big bottle of water available, and the bar was stocked with Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Tonic Water, 2 beers, and a couple of small bottles of liquor. The mini-bar was included in the price of the room. More storage space was available in the two nightstands, which had one drawer each. The room also had a small table and chairs under the ceiling fan, and a sitting area near the balcony. SERVICE Since we arrived so late the first night and only had a small dinner on the plane, we immediately looked around for a room service menu. We couldn't see one, so we called down to the desk and found out that they don't have one. They told me what was available, and it was things like hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos, chicken nuggets. During our stay, we tried the nachos and the nuggets. Both we alright, but nothing spectacular. The nuggets looked like a type that you buy from the frozen food section. Room service should take 45 minutes, but one time it took over 2 hours because they first delivered to the wrong room. Housekeeping was okay. On arrival, we saw a card with our maid's name on it, and she was responsible for our room the entire stay. They cleaned during the day and had a turn down service at night. Each day we dutifully left a tip for her and the room was cleaned while we were gone. It wasn't until our last full day there that we came back early to find the tip gone, but the room still unclean. She came by later to clean up. On the bus-ride back to the airport, we heard that a supervisor came to one of the other people's rooms, picked up the tip and left. It made us wonder whether the maid ever got any of our tips. Service around the resort was mixed. Some of the staff were very friendly and helpful, while others just did their jobs. I had a tough time getting a glass of water at the buffet sometimes because it was hard to get someone's attention - and then get them to follow through. Of the great staff, some of the waitstaff in the restaurants would laugh and joke around with the customers, and many would sing a bit while they worked. I distinctly remember one of the waiters at the Brazilian restaurant who let us know what type of meat was on the skewers by imitating the animal it came from. Cluck cluck cluck - chicken! Oink Oink - pork. The way he did it was hilarious. Many of the signs and menus were available in multiple languages, and we did not have very many problems being understood. My Spanish is very rusty, having only taken one year of it in high school, years ago. So, I thought we got by very well. Some of the translations into English on the menu were absolutely hilarious though. Each time we had a problem and called down to the desk, we spoke with someone who was fairly good at English. The maintenance guy was not good at English, so we were kept informed of what needed to be done with the safe by someone at the desk who was able to speak to us. There was one nice thing that they did, which seemed like overkill at the time, but was probably a good thing. They followed up on everything by calling our room afterwards. Did the maid spray for the smell? Did you get your room service okay? We had thought that there was a butler/concierge attached to each villa, but we never saw one. THE RESORT The Ambar section of the resort is limited to adults and the facilities are supposed to be for the Ambar or Diamond Club guests only. We saw signs everywhere that it was ADULTS ONLY and we only saw one kid walking down a path in that section. We had white bracelets to wear to show that we were able to use the facilities and enjoy all of the extras that were offered. I only noticed one time where it made a difference. A non-Ambar couple had gone to the buffet in an Ambar-only restaurant by the beach. One of the staff noticed and asked them to leave. The beach was nice and had many chairs and umbrellas set up. They had music playing which was kind of an upbeat reggae. I would rather listen to the waves, but it wasn't bad music. It was pretty crowded each time we went, but we were able to find somewhere to set up. I only went into the ocean once, and there was some seaweed there, but that was after a couple of rainy days so it is probably to be expected. The pool was also very crowded. They had umbrellas set up there as well and since I am not all that prone to sunbathing (as in never), I appreciated that. The pool had a few sections with jets that you can slip into from the main pool. It is the same temperature as the rest of it but has some strong jets and seats along the edge. There was another section that was fenced and walled off from the rest of the pool, which we thought might be the hot tub. It turned out to be the slightly warmer tub so we didn't stay in there long. There was a swim-up bar and a hut where you could exchange your towels. We were disappointed that the pool had specific hours that you could use it. It was well-lit at night and we thought that it would have been nice if we could go for a night-time swim. It is a pretty big resort and we did not see all of it. They provide bus service to get around the main areas and have them running fairly often. Their buses had bench seating and a roof, with some plastic to pull down on the sides for when it rains. There was nightly entertainment, a disco and a casino available, but we didn't make use of them. THE FOOD We found it a bit difficult to keep up with the scheduled meal times. Breakfast was served from 8:00 to 10:30, lunch from 1:00 to 3:30, and dinner from 7:00 to 10:00. Since we like to stay up late and sleep in, we were always rushing to breakfast at the last minute, then trying to schedule in lunch, which always seemed to interfere with something else we wanted to do, like relax on the beach. (It wasn't until the last day that we realized that we could have gone to the beach-side restaurant for lunch each day). Dinner was by reservation at one of the a la carte restaurants, or you could go to the main buffet. When we arrived, 3 reservations had already been set up for us. On the third day, we stopped at the desk to make more reservations, and a few of the restaurants were full, so it is best to do it early. The Ambar buffet was pretty good. They had two cooking stations set up as well as the regular cold and heating lamp sections which you would see at most buffets. You could get eggs cooked for you in the morning - omelets, soft or hard boiled, fried, etc. They also cooked up french toast and pancakes regularly, so you could usually get something fresh. At lunch, the cooking stations were used for pasta at one and meat or fish at the other. I really enjoyed getting a fresh plate of pasta with my own selection of toppings and sauces. It had a somewhat varied selection, and they did change a few things each day. The menu at the restaurants was not large. Many of them had a buffet and then you could order the main dinner as a la carte. I had trouble getting my meat cooked well done, but otherwise it was fine. We did wonder why the Greek and Italian restaurants didn't seem to have anything that we would consider Greek or Italian food though. Two of the restaurants that we went to were on patios right near the beach. The night that we went to the BBQ one, it was really nice sitting outside and having our meal. The night at the Brazilian one, it was pouring down rain, so we had to watch our step and try to stay under the umbrellas. Overall, the food at the restaurants was fairly good, not 5 star, but good. The room service food, however, left much to be desired. SHOPPING There is a common section to the resort where you can go shopping. They had a few indoor boutiques, and a lot of stands. Indoors, the prices were shown and seemed to be set. Outdoors, you have to play let's make a deal. If you like to spend the time haggling over prices, then this is the place for you. Most of them seemed to have a great time talking it up. My friend, I have a great deal for you. You just put everything you want into a pile and I will give you the best deal because I like you. They start out quite high and then you can get them down to something more reasonable. Our tour operator said to start off an opening offer of 10% of the price they first tell you, and that seemed to be pretty good advice. One of the vendors asked us if we had anything Canadian to give him because he loves Canadians. He showed us what others had given him - a toonie, a 5 dollar bill, Canadian tire money, and various business cards. I hadn't thought to really bring anything like that, but I had a pen from a Montreal hotel in my purse, so I gave him that. We paid for everything in US dollars and never really had to make an exchange for Dominican pesos. GENERAL IMPRESSIONS Overall, I felt like the Ambar had the potential to be something really great, but they were not there yet. If they had a deal on prices, I would go back, but I think that I would prefer to try another resort. Other guests seemed to have more problems than we did, and I am glad I didn't hear about them until the ride back to the airport because it would have tainted my vacation if I heard about them earlier. Based on our experience, I would give them 3.5 stars, 4 if I was being generous.

<Content>It was good but not 5 star This is a beautiful resort but there are problems. Overall, the trip was worth the price we paid.Beach - no problems here. Loved the beach. The water in the Ambar pool was quite cool during our stay but that was not a problem as the beach was wonderful. One warning if you are going to the resort (not the Ambar section) with children. Topless is not frowned upon and neither are thongs (even for men). So, if you have a problem with your children seeing these things, this is not the place for you.Excursions - went on a couple of excursions. Both excursions were great although the Catamaran was a bit expensive compared to the other excursion. But, it was worth the extra money.Food - loved the buffets. We were booked into the BBQ buffet one night and it was wonderful. The restaurant food was disappointing. Japanese food is not supposed to be laced with garlic. Other meat, including shellfish, tended to be undercooked and tasted like they'd been frozen for a while. After a few nights, we gave up on the restaurants and stuck to the buffets. There was enough variety that we could get something different to eat at every meal.Drinks - try out the cocktail of the day each day. It was usually superb.Service - not the best. Our room had a problem which was not fixed the entire stay. We had to find a work around as it was a safety issue. And, this was reported three times during the stay. We spoke to others in our villa and everyone that we spoke to had some kind of problem with their room which required attention (in other words, they weren't just minor issues like the bathroom door not closing completely tight. They were safety issues). It also took all day, some days, to get the room cleaned - although a good job was done. One night fresh towels didn't come until 10:15 pm. The lack of English among the staff was the biggest problem. Even people at the reception desk had very limited English.I really felt like we had to tip the staff, even if a good job wasn't done, due to the poor economic conditions in the country. Although I was always worried that the tips were going towards alchoholism.Decor - they definitely rushed to finish construction. Grout missing between tiles.....But, that is only if you look (I am currently renovating a house so I do look). Overall, the decor looks really good on the surface. I would have liked some pamphlets in the room about where to find things (like the ice machine which is hidden quite well with only a very small picture on the wall to point the way).Shopping - the shopping was a disappointment. Many cashierscould not speak English. If you showed them a credit card they would look at you and sigh because they had to get a calculator, figure out US$$$ for the purchase and show you the amount on the calculator (they didn't know how to say the amount in English). Twice, at two different stores, the credit card machine had problems and I had to go to the ATM to get cash.Entertainment - didn't partake in any entertainment. The theatre had what looked like good shows but they didn't start until 9:45. We like to go to bed early and get up early so they were a no go. Even the Lion King, which children in the resort would have enjoyed, didn't start until 9:45.Yes, I have lots of problems shown in the review but I wanted to let people know what to expect. But, I went there to see something of another country and to relax on a beautiful beach. Both these objectives were met. So, although there were problems the trip was overall a good one - especially considering what you get for the price.

<Content>Could have been better... My fiance and I went to the Ambar over Christmas, December 21 - 28th. We booked with Air Transat flying out of London ON.Flight was great - no problems at all and our transfer to the hotel went smoothly. We arrived at the hotel about 10:30PM.We called room service, we were famished, it tool almost 1 1/2 hours to get our food. We'd ordered a hot dog  a hamburger. That was the only time we used room service.Room was lovely. We were missing a shower head and it wasn't installed until our last night after asking 3 days in a row. We had a leak above our toilet for two nights - it was finally fixed. No other problems with the room.The pool, grounds, beach were great... it was quiet with no small children running around. We have 8 of our own, and so the quiet was lovely. There was no loud music poolside either... very relaxing.The service staff was generally quite good. Not 5 star good, but alright. Basically friendly, although the language difference was a problem. Too often you'd say something and you'd get a vacant smile in return, but for the most part the communications were alright.The food was excellent. The Japanese restauarant was a hoot.. .they tried to tell us they had no chopsticks, but I pushed, and they found some. Great evening there!The buffet's were all very good. Tons of selection and all great quality. Christmas they did a seafood buffet that was out of this world. However they need to be more consistant with their dress code rules. We were advised that long pants weren't necessary in the buffet, and on the last night they turned us away becuase my man wore Bermuda shorts for the only time that week. We went to one of the buffet's in the main resort and it was no problem. Also, the first three mornings he wore a sleevless t-shirt to breakfast no problem, the 4th morning he was told to go back and put on a sleeved shirt. Minor inconveniences...but they need to know what their policies are, and follow them all the time.The booze wasn't the best, but we managed... lol They did have a lovely 'champagne' that was available at most bars and I certainly enjoyed that. My fiance  I both loved the cigar bar... we dopped in most evenings after dinner for a cigar and a liquer and felt like James Bond  his girl... lots of fun.We met a great group of people from all over Canada... Montreal, Emonton, and some from clsoer to home as well.Our dissapointment was the lack of customer service when we had our problems with the plumbing. The service man came very quickly, but nothing was resolved quickly and the customer service reps were of no use to us. It was our on site Air Transat rep that finally got some results for us. We were hoping for some kind of comensation for the missing shower head and leaky cieling and all we got was a fruit plate on our last evening there. The area has so many great resorts, so because of the lack of response to our problems, we won't go back to this resort again. I would hope that once it's been open for a while longer, that every thing would run smoothly. It certainly has the potential to be a great resort, but it's not quite there now.

<Content>Ambar is short for Amazing! My husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay January 15-22nd. This was our first tropical getaway in 19 years without the kids, and was meant to be quiet, relaxing and romantic and it was all of those!We flew with AirCanada Vacations. Flights were both perfect. Tour operators were great at both the airport and the hotel. Transfers provided were awesome. Our bus was only to make 3 stops, but ours was first on the way there (about 20 mins from airport) and we were the last pickup and went straight to airport.Check in was easy. We arrived at around 2pm. Our room wasn't to be ready until 3pm, but that was expected. We travelled in just carryons so we used the lobby washrooms to change into bathing suits and sandals, and headed right to the pool! I went back at 3pm on the nose for the keys, and everything was ready. We had 2 tshirts waiting for us, and a bottle of rum, and a fruit basket.The room was gorgeous and kept spotlessly clean.. We were in building 64, 3rd floor just as requested. We had an ocean and pool view from the balcony. Building 64 is the first one directly behind the pool, so it was very convenient! The beds are large and comfortable. There is lots of english on the satellite TV (though the reception isn't so clear....but we weren't there for TV right???). The bathrooms are absolutely gorgeous. No plumbing problems at all! Maid service was great. Most days our room was cleaned by 12. A couple of days it was later, but always done by dinner. They also have turn down service, so usually when you're gone to dinner they remake the bed, turn down the covers, and leave chocolates on your pillow. We always made sure to put the do not disturb sign out whenever we were in the room, because they do make frequent stops to drop of towels, fill the mini bar, and sometimes for the supervisor to check the job! It is easier to put out the do not disturb then to say don't come in! We had TONS of water in the room all the time and used only this to brush our teeth, rinse and use the coffee maker. Alcohol refill was hit and miss, but one day when we didn't have beer Erika from guest services called to check on our stay and ask if there was anything they could do for us....so I mentioned the beer. Next time we went up to the room there were 4 cans of beer in the fridge!!We ate everything we wanted. They made 4 reservations for us before we got there, but we didn't have one for the night we arrived. When I went to get our key at 3 I checked with the concierge, and they were able to get us a reservation for 7 at the Mexican Restaurant for that night! And we also booked our other 2 nights right then. We ate breakfast at Portofino's everymorning. It opens at 8, and has wonderful ocean views from the windows. They have an omelette station, and good sized buffet. There were never more than 10 tables filled while we were there, and no lineups for the omelettes. We ate lunch at the snack bar on the Ambar side most lunches. It is open 10-10, and is buffet as well. They have a good selection of salad, fruit, hamburgers, hotdogs, chips and guacamoe (best we've ever had) and rice, potatoes and vegetables and french fries. The roasted chicken was the best and went really quickly. Buffet was refilled constantly before anything even ran out.We ordered room service on our last day, as it had rained all day and we were hanging out playing cards on our balcony. We had Burgers and fries. There is no longer an actual menu in the room....you just call down and they tell you what is available. They said it would take 43 minutes, but I think we had it in about 25 minutes.All of our al a cartes were excellent. Service was almost over the top sometimes, but it was very nice. We ate over at the Bavaro/Punta Cana side a few times, but it was slower and more relaxed at Ambar, and of course NO Kids!!! Things were a bit more hectic, loud and rushed on the PC/Bavaro side.We had absolutely no stomach problems at all. And I was really worried after some of the reviews. We were careful at buffets to make sure things were hot...I tended to avoid the last of anything, and preferred to wait till it was refilled. Only drank and brushed our teeth with bottled water, and washed our hands frequently. Now, this vacation was everything that we wanted it to be. It was serene, quiet, mature and relaxing. It is NOT a party resort...they don't even play music at the pool, or do any activities. We loved it that way. If you want loud and lots of activities you only have to wander over to the PC/Bavaro side. But be warned...there are 5 times as many people, it is loud and crowded. The pools close at 6pm. Snack bar and any other bars I think at 10pm. Then you have to go to the Hacienda Principe (3 minute shuttle ride away). There the small casino is open from 4pm to 4am. Karaoke bar from 10pm to 12pm I think. And the disco from 12am to 2am. There is also a hamburger place up there that is open 24 hours for late night snacks. And live entertainment. I don't know what it is like...we never went up in the evening.We never did get chairs under a cabana at the pool....even at 7 am for some reason those were all taken. We watched one set that had 2 towels, and a pair of hot pink Crocs on them from 8 am, till 4pm when we left the pool, and no one ever sat in them!!! It didn't bother us, because we actually preferred the shady/sunny area under the sun shades they have built....lots of room, and a very quiet corner. The rock wall also provides shelter from the breeze if there is one.Service by the pool was awesome. Bar opens at 10 am, and for the rest of the day there are 2 or 3 pool waiters wandering the area to take your order. They picked up glasses whenever they were empty, and brought you your drink within 10 minutes of ordering. All the drinks were wonderful. Varying amounts of rum depending on the bartender! We just brought the welcome gift bottle of rum with us in our beach bag and topped up any that we got without rum by accident! We were there for 7 days. The day we arrived and the next full day were beautiful. The next day it rained and was cloudy for a couple of hours in the middle of the day. The next day was awesome. We had one full 1/2 day of rain, and it did rain our entire last day. But it is always really really warm.The beach is glorious. You can walk forever, and will get tired before you would ever run out of beach!!!! And it is different everyday.One quick note: There were flyers posted everywhere (in the shuttles, at the towel huts, in the lobbies, advertising that if you were interested they would pay you to vacate your room and go on excursions...and would also pay you $100/room /day to move to the Excellence hotel, and some of the other Bahia Principe properties on the island. Obviously there are some overbooking issues, though they did not effect us. I remember reading one review where someone didn't like the hotel (I think it was the Bavaro side) and said he'd moved to Excellence, which he said was a much better hotel. I think he forgot to mention that they paid him to do that!!!!!!I think I covered everything! I posted a mini review on the Punta Cana Forum...so feel free to ask me any questions there! I already miss it!!

<Content>very bad food If you like line ups, over crowded beaches and spitting your food into a napkin then this place is for you.  My husband and I liked the quiet lobby and non party atmosphere. The room was very comfortable. Carmen the maid deserves a raise.If you bother to bring along an English/Spanish translation book you'll get much better service. The staff do not speak Engish and really appreciate the effort. And don't be so cheap people...TIP. This is a very poor country, a dollar here and there goes a long way.  We went to this place base on reviews on this site, which I think were written by the people who own the resort... The word 'Gourmet' actually means 'worst food you'll ever eat.' Don't go to the sit down restaurants. They are trying to do high end food without training thier staff basic cooking techniques. This is an upper management issue. The cooks and servers were trying hard to please, perhaps too hard. Too much focus went into presentation and not into quality. We left all three restaurants thoroughly disappointed only to go back to the line up at the buffet.  Oh, and if you're flying Air Canada bring a gas mask...They spray the inside of the plane with insecticide just before landing. Not sure what kind of bugs a plane from Canada could possibly be carrying in January...Really glad to be home.

<Content>still a great spot - but give it some time Just stayed at the Ambar from the 7th of January until the 14th.Filght in and out, customs etc went very smoothly compared to Costa Rica and Jamaica.Was slightly disappointed in the maid service, mini-bar and ala carte restaurants (only ate at one - the Don Pablo Gourmet) but overall was a beautiful resort, plenty of room and good food and selection at the buffets.Don Pablo had 2 courses and dessert. Food was good but nothing to write home about.Ala cartes were hard to get into sometimes as others have mentioned but this is brand new. Most were only 1/3 full as staff is on a major learning curve.Never really saw a butler either.Room was nice and clean. We were in building 68 overlooking a service road but since we were on the 3rd floor had a nice wview of the ocean. Very quiet also.The service problem seems to be a lack in direction from management and somewhat of a language barrier. Luckily I can speak Spanish so it helped overall.A hint for those going, the Italian restaurant, Portofino, is open in the morning around 8:00 with a good breakfast buffet. Had quail eggs and caviar every morning. Not too many people know this and it is never crowded. Sit by the window and enjoy the ocean view with your fresh coffee.Manuel and Wilson were great in the bar, and Ramon in the main buffet.Pool service was also very good.We would go back as we want to relax and enjoy the weather when we travel...perfect place for this.

<Content>Very Pleased We stayed 1 week in this almost new 5-star.The ADULTS ONLY section was great: quiet, off by itself.While the resort is huge, with some sections quite a distance from the beach, we were very close.The food was great, premises spotless, staff seemed happy/helpful.English was not spoken as widely as say, Mexico- a good excuse to try your Spanish!The beach was beautiful: went out of sight in both directions. The resort has 3, 12- foot catamarans for use. Do not be 'sucked in' by the attendants' request for $25! Maybe a little 'dinero' at the end!At times, room maid service was a little inconsistent, but nothing serious enough to contact the desk.Ground transfers went smoothly, as did the flight from the airport. This is less than 1 hour away.We would consider returning!

<Content>Good place. We booked through Travelocity and arrived only to find that the hotel was overbooked (about 5 other couples were in the same situation). They compensated us by having us stay at the Majestic resort next door (which is just as nice if not nicer, you might want to check it out as well), gave us $150, and promoted us to the Ambar section of the hotel (which is nicer with its own pool, no kids allowed, own restaurants). Food is good to average but don't expect to be blown away by the food. We ate at the Mediterranean restaurant (so-so) and the Brazilian Rodisio Steakhouse (actually pretty good). Service was also very good and rooms were clean. Having stayed at an all inclusive in Cozumel recently (the Occidental Grand), I definitely say this place is better.The only negative is that the beach is crowded and it's probably too rough to snorkel in. Next to the sea expect to find a sea of beach chairs. But it wasn't just our hotel. If you walk down the beach they are all very crowded. People would go out there at 8:00 AM and put towels on the chairs to get a good spot. Also Punta Cana is in a rural part of the Dominican Republic. There's a town close by but not much for tourists to do there. The place is enormous with its own little shopping area, casino, tram/bus, and is subdivided into several smaller hotels (Bavaro, Punta Cana, and Ambar). The place claims to have over 1800 rooms.Very diverse group of tourists, more so than Mexico (where its mostly Americans like myself), especially Canadians, French, Russians (which I was surprised to find), and British. Probably more Russians than Americans when we were there. You will see a lot of men wearing speedos and an occaisional topless lady (some of them you wish would wear a top, some not so bad). Expect to hear all kinds of languages spoken. I liked the diverse crowd, it kept it interesting. We paid a $10/person entrance tax (impuesto entrada) at the airport but no tax to leave (it might have been included in our ticket through American). Also the taxi ride from the airport was around $33 each way.

<Content>Almoat perfect My husband and I have just returned from the Ambar resort. Our stay was from Jan5th-12th. Overall we had a wonderful experience.Upon arrival we had a very late check-in. It was fairly quick and efficient however we didn't wait for the bellman but instead found our room ourselves. Our room wasn't up to the cleanliness standards of a 5 star nor did the mini-bar have any beer in it. I found some management and they delivered a few beers which was pretty good at 2a.m.The next day we requested a room transfer and got it no problem. Our maid was wonderful and ran a tight ship on our floor. Our room was spotless and we had more than enough towels and facecloths. She restocked our mini-bar everyday with more than what was required. We did tip her daily and I took an interest in her and asked questions about her family ( no I don't speak Spanish nor her English but you can always communicate if you try). She kept us very comfortable.The beach was beautiful and peaceful on the Ambar side. The BP Punta Cana/ Bavaro was a nuthouse with people crowded on top of each other and screaming kids. They were just having fun as kids do but I was glad we were on the quiet adult side. Not that those folks didn't try to bring their kids or themsleves over to our peacefulness but were quickly turned away by security.We walked through their pool area once and never went back to that side of the resort.Wilkins at the beach bar couldn't have been nicer and very generous on his free pouring. I also asked about his family and he was delighted to show me pics from his cell phone. Needless to say, he was wonderful to us. No he didn't speak english either but if you are kind and gracious, they will be too.The food was good and presentation very nice. Whenever I saw a chef or a lines person from the kitchen I shook their hand and thanked them for their hard work. We only had excellent service. We never waited for a thing, nor did we have anyone who was rude to us. All the staff smiled and said good morning or hello but then again I did too. Get it? You reap what you sow.We had a shade hut on the beach every morning but we were up early to enjoy the day. At mid-day you may find it hard to find a shade spot. The pool had plenty of chairs and fresh beach towels were always available.All the staff at the front desk spoke english as well as the consierge. And they were more than helpful.Our only complaint would be the check-out. We were not leaving the resort until 8pm but check-out was for noon. ( if you want a late check-out its $30/hour if your room is available). They took our bracelet and gave us a check-out piece of paper with the date and a signature from the front desk person. We were to use that for the reminder of the day but the staff didn't know what it was. I complained to the food and beverage manager and was told he would address it with all the staff. My suggestion, don't let them take your bracelet.Be pleasant, smile because you are on a lovely beach with warm temperatures and swaying palms and try to be personal with the staff and you will get many benefits in return.

<Content>loved it We stayed at the Principe Ambar from Dec.26 to Jan.2, 2008. We abosutely loved it! In reading some other reviews people were concerned with the service. They were correct in saying that the service wasn't the BEST service I have ever had, but it is to be expected. Unlike life in Canada or the United States, life in the Dominican Republic is a lot slower and laid back. Once a person gets used to this, they realize that the service is really quite good. Another thing that is important to do is to always tip. Try to tip everyone. For a lot of the rude people the workers endure, they do a very good job and are always happy. They help you when you ask for it, and even better when you tip! We always had WAY more than what we needed in our mini bar because we go to know our housekeepers, and treated them like anybody else, not our servants.The food was fantastic. There was a lot to choose from. I would recommend the Gourmet restaurant in (I think) the Bavaro side. It is much better than the Don Pablo Gourmet. Best a la carte was the Japanese by far! I was never hungry there. There is always something wonderful to eat or drink.The evening entertainment wasn't fabulous, but in all the different places I have stayed in, this entertainment was by far the best. Although the bar closes at 11 pm, it didnt really matter because there is still something to do, and to be honest, I was usually exhausted from all the sun I had gotten each day.The grounds and pool were beautiful, but be prepared to wake up at 7:30 am to put towels on your lounge chairs if you want a cabbana. Like every resort, people reserve their chairs with their towels, so a person must wake up early enough in order to do this because there aren't a ton of chairs.There were a few kinks here and there but overall our stay was great. I would recommend it to anyone and I am looking forward to going back.

<Content>All Things Considered-Great As my title states it was great--hotel grounds,service, beach,food were all excellent.The staff were friendly and helpful and took care of something when asked.Coming from NYC i'm always rushing so I had to get used to a little slower pace --once I did I had a great time.The hotel is brand new and beautiful--the pool could be a little warmer but overall great.Anyone going to this resort should attend the orientation offered and check out the map given them--it will save time and help in your navigation of this huge resort.I plan on returing later this year--OLA!!!!

<Content>Poor Service, Beautiful Resort My wife and I stayed at the Ambar resort from Dec 20th to 27th. Upon arrival at the Bavaro, which is where you go prior to heading down to the Ambar, they could not find us in the computer system even after we had told them we were booked in at the Ambar. Took the person at the desk about 10 minutes to realize that we had to go down to the Ambar to check in. Minor detail but I thought they would have know ahead of time that folks staying at the Ambar would be made aware of this upon arrival because we boarded the bus at the airport the rep there knew where everyone was going and told my wife and I that we were all set at the Ambar and that's where we would check in. After finally arriving at the Ambar, the front desk was excellent. He had our package ready for us. Bracelets, room key, information pack etc. He had a bell hop take us over to our villa/room. Well we had to turn on our cell phone to use as light as the stairwells and hallways were not lit at all. Felt this was quite unsafe especially due to the high humidity factor and ceramic flooring. Asked about it the following day at the Guest Services desk and all I got was a blank stare and a comment ok. First 3 days of our stay was absolutely great. However on Christmas eve it all went down hill. We went to the Palmyra dining room for our dinner and we dressed accordingly as per the rules of the resort/dining room. No shorts for men etc. Upon entering the dining room the young gentlemen at the door gave my wife a long stem rose, very nice. We were seated at a table and had champagne poured for us, again very nice. We then went to the buffet and got our meal, returned to our table to enjoy the dinner and our evening. No more than 10 minutes into our meal the doors opened up and the dinning room began to fill up with small kids, strollers, teenagers and other adults. Not that we do not like kids because we have 4 of our own, we took this so called Adult Only vacation to give ourselves a bit of a break. Well the dining hall noise level went through the roof. The other 30 couples that were there were also as upset as we were. Kids were running around screaming and crawling under tables where couples were actually seated and the parents of these kids didn't seem to care and some actually thought it funny. Let me tell you, if you pay extra for an Adult Only resort and vacation, that is EXACTLY what you should get. We complained to guest services, and we were probably the 20th couple to do so in a very short time frame, and were told that oh no, this is Adult only and no kids are here. I told the guest service lady to go have a look in the dining room and see for herself but all I got was another blank stare, somewhat like a deer caught in the headlights look! After that everything seemed to go badly. Our mini fridge/bar was to be restocked daily but was only done once and we had to call and have it restocked after that. We just gave up after the second call. And I know for a fact that people have experienced this at other resorts as well. All inclusive and mini bar restocked daily means exactly that. Not that we drink a lot but the pop and water should be replenished daily and wasn't. We tried to order room service twice. The first time was met with oh we don't have that today. Ok, not a big deal. We just happened to be going by guest services again and asked her if the item we wanted to order was available today and she called herself and then told us yes, its available, why?. We told her we had just called 30 mins prior and were told it wasn't available. This was the first time someone actually apologized to us and said they would take care of it for us. We went back to our room and 20 minutes later our food arrived and it was very good. We also had a fruit basket delivered with two wine glasses compliments of guest services. Fruit was bruised and very, very ripe. And yes, no wine to compliment the wine glasses.We then found out the day of check out that the passbook they gave us upon arrival was NOT for the Ambar portion of the resort. Check out was 12 noon but our flight wasn't until 8pm so we opted to pay for 3 additional hours, which according to the book was 10 dollars US per hour. Went up in the morning to the front desk to pay and was told oh no, that book not for Ambar and the rate is 30 dollars US per hour. I was more than upset with this and pointed out to the desk that it was clearly written in the book THEY provided me. Didn't matter to them. So I very reluctantly paid 90 dollars US for 3 additional hours. I do have to say that the food at this resort was absolutely spectacular! Never have I enjoyed so many different meals that were prepared to perfection. Well done to all the Chefs and their staff.Rooms were neat and clean as well as the grounds which were kept in perfect condition. A simply beautiful place. We loved the resort for its beauty and achitecture. I also acknowledge that this is a new hotel and there will be some growing pains but NOT looking after your guests concerns and addressing issues raised by them is most definitly NOT the way to win repeat business. I will not return to this resort anytime in the future nor would I recommend it to my many friends and family whom travel a great deal. Sorry Ambar, but service FIRST is what its all about!

<Content>good but not great...new hotel blues just got back, stayed from dec. 29th until jan.5thI had read alot about this hotel in the past few weeks and my expectations were high...i was a bit dissapointedWe got there, the weather was beautiful and so was the placei mean everything is new and beautifulthe beach is breathtaking...lots of room, deep beach with perfect sandour first days were really nice...i thought i had found the ideal destination but with time, we realized that we were suffering from the 'new' hotel bluesi.e. the service was inconsistent (which is kinda normal for a new place on new year's eve)...we had to wait numerous times over an hour in our room because our toilet blockedno one ever said sorry for arriving after 3 hours...nor did they want to accomodate us by leaving is a plungerwe wait once for 25 minutes at the bar for some coffees...not because the barman was not good, but the bar seemed understaffed while other areas where emtpy with many employeesthe maid service is poorly organized...i.e. factory style..meaning everyonehas one little task to do...we ended up always lacking towels, drinks and even our comforter 1 nightmost employees were very nice but we quickly noticed that we ought to learn spanish before our next trip...we thought it was a bit dissapointing for our concierge to not be able to understand us...as i am sure that is in part the reason why we had daily little problems and/or delays, could not communicate them to him clearly...they never really made me feel special, in that 5 star way lol...and when they gave me the run around on the last day to find some towels in order to take my shower at the gym...they never offered to bring them to me but directed everywherewithout organizing anything, i ended up bumming them of a maid...after my other ones had been taken from me and not replaced while the beach towel girl me basically to 'just not shower then'because we were leaving that day and she did not want to give me clean onesi was expecting a a la carte lunch place but there was none... bummerbesides these things....it is a beautiful place, the food is good, the beach...amazing...the ambience and night shows and casino (with texas holdem poker!!!)it is my best weather yet...only 1 rainy day and never too hotin my opinion...i has dissapointed because i went there thinking it would be like other places i have been (royal hideaway, paradisus de oro,..) but i was not...it will take a bit of time for the management to get the twist...especially on busy weeks like this past onehopefully i was just unlucky...which could be as most posts are quite positive sor farmy bottom line: go there to find a beautiful place...but not if you like to be pampered :)
