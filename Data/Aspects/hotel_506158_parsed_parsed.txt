<Content>Horror Show I am an experienced traveler. I travel for business and pleasure. We take two vacations a year as a family. Those vacations are for a period of seven to 20 days each. My wife and I have used Tripadvisor for years. She has posted in the past but I have only used the site for my edification and am writing today for the first time. Our current travel experience has prompted me to write.I almost always look askance at postings of a terrible experience at a hotel that has a high Tripadvisor rating assuming it was an aberration. Alas, we are in the throws of such an experience at the Hotel 1898 in Barcelona, Spain. We love Barcelona. This is our second trip to the city. On our first trip, we had a wonderful experience. Great sites. Great people. I purchased one of my favorite pieces of original art from an artist in Barcelona which hangs in the entrance to our home. Our second trip to Barcelona has been a horror show. We came to the city for two days prior to a cruise. Our flight from Boston was delayed 10 hours but we slept on the flight to Paris before our connection to Barcelona. We looked forward to the Hotel 1898 as an oasis from the downside of travel. Alas, Hotel 1898 was anything but an oasis. My wife lost her passport. We assumed she lost it in the Barcelona airport but her recollection is that she had it in the hotel room. We take responsponsibility for not putting our cash and passports in the safe in our room. The passport is missing along with 300 Euros. It is a curious amount to be missing because it was three 100 euro bills that were taken from a larger sum of money and not all of the money was taken. We have taken the position that we lost the passport and have not complained to the hotel. We did ask them for their recommendation on what to do and they recommended we report the lost passport at the police station. They also told us the police would give us a report that would allow us to travel. I tipped the gentleman behind the desk 20 euro for his assistance. We did as advised and the police were very accommodating. We were told it will be up to the cruise line as to whether they let us board.We chalked the downside of our trip up to the adage: ---- happens and were ready to put the incident behind us for the rest of the evening. Alas, that's when we ran into a Barcelona we had not seen before. In the lobby of the hotel is an oriental restaurant, La Xina. We looked forward to a relaxing dinner in the hotel. It was 10pm and we were told by the restaurant to return at 11pm for seating. Upon our return we were told a table was not ready and that we should go up to the bar and they would let us know when a table was ready. The bar consists of an oak runner around an open kitchen. Four bottles of Moet and some wine were stacked in a plastic crate filled with ice. There were no more than eight bottles of alcohol on the counter. It looked more like a bar you would see at a house party. I waited patiently while the young man made three frozen margaritas. Just before he was done another man that worked at the restaraunt came up from downstairs with five young women in tow. He stepped front of me and spoke to the bartender who nodded in return. Upon finishing the margaritas and passing them to a waiter the bartender looked past me to the young women to take their order. I politely said, Excuse me. Without missing a beat, he told me he knew I was waiting but that he was told to wait on the women next. I asked the ma卯tre d if the restaurant was affiliated with the hotel or unaffiliated (I did not bother to complain). He told me it was unaffiliated. One can not give one's business to an establishment that could be so outwardly rude. Our family went for pizza down the street. When I travel I maintain low expectations and normally appreciate the courtesies extended to me and my family as guest saway from home. The Hotel 1898, and its unaffiliated restaurant, failed at meeting even the minimum standards.

<Content>A negative part of our trip I just looked up this hotel, suprised to still see it is #3 in Barcelona. I have been meaning to write a review on this hotel because of the fact that staying here made me dislike Barcelona (hotels really can affect your overall view of a place, unfortunately). I usually trust trip advisor, and I did when I booked this hotel. The hotel rooms are nice, the roof deck/pool is great, and the hotel is beautiful. It is also in a great location. The problem with the hotel is the staff. The staff on our initial 2 days there were horrible, unhelpful, and never smiled (particularly the front desk staff). On our final day there, after much complaining, we managed to find some helpful staff and wished they had been that nice the entire time. A great hotel should never have mean, unfriendly, and unhelpful staff. The best part of our trip was when we actually left the hotel and stayed elsewhere!

<Content>Won't stay anywhere else!! My wife and I just stayed at H1898 for eight nights, from 21 to 30 Nov 2008. Given the length of stay, we had initially thought of trying two different hotels (the other hotel we considered was the Meridien next door), but we are now glad that we stayed the entire period at H1898. We had a privilege room on the third floor overlooking the Ramblas. There were two windows, a large one opening out onto the Ramblas, and a smaller side window looking at the Meridien. The choice was made after we had inspected a superior room and a deluxe room (with a terrace) for comparison. The privilege room appealed because of its large size, high ceiling, separate sitting area with full length sofa, and above all else, its fantastic bathroom. The bath room was not only large and luxurious (in a classy green marble), but really clever in design, because it had twin vanities (facing each other) OUTSIDE of the main bath room, which housed a bath tub, WC, bidet and a generous glass enclosed shower stall with a rain shower. This room was definitely a five star rather than four, on account of this bath room and the size. The window facing the Ramblas brought life and light into the room, the sounds of pedestrians, street vendors, entertainers, and even clinking of cutlery in near by restaurants, wafted in along with the cool autumn air every evening. We felt pretty much part of the street scene even as we sat in the comfort of the sofa sipping sangria.Its location on the Ramblas is simply superb. Although there are a multitude of hotels all along the strip, this particular corner is literally a few steps from the Plaza Catalunya (transport hub for the airport bus, tourist bus, metro, tourist information), and also the location of Carrefour right next door means grocery shopping is a cinch. A daily trip there for fresh fruits and bottled water became a routine for us. Via the Ramblas, almost all the major sights are walking distance including the GOthic quarter, the Palau Musica, the Palau Guell, the Columbus monument, the Gaudi masterpierces of Casa Batllo and Casa Milla, and the main shopping street on Paseig de Gracia. The hotel is also a few steps from the La Boqueria Market, which means you can eat the freshest produce and sea food the city has to offer every day. The excellent Bar Boqueria in the market itself is great value for money. After we found it, we ate brunch and dinner there almost every day. Forget about the tourist trap restaurants touting tapas sets along the main street.Finally two features make H1898 truly magical, instead of merely excellent. The roof terrace with its really classy outdoor furniture, which offer a panoramic view in three directions (the fourth being blocked by the Meridien), best enjoyed in the early morning and late evening. Many other reviews have raved about the terrace so no further elaboration is needed. However, it is the indoor pool which captured my imagination and which I really want to draw attention to. It is in the basement, and while not big (about 9m x 4m), the cavernous design with serial roof arches and gothic stone claddings on the wall, together with special lighting effects, and haunting music make swimming here a surreal experience. On one end, there is a large back-lit black and white picture of padi fields carved into a cliff which makes one think of Bali. An early morning swim will definitely invigorate and give a great start to the day. The adjoining changing rooms come complete with towels and toiletries so you don't need to bring anything from your room. Strangely, it was always empty on each of the occasions I used it. Perhaps it should remain a well kept secret.Overall, despite going with already very high expectations from reading all the past reviews, the reality managed to surpass our imagination. The staff are helpful and responsive when approached, but are otherwise discreet rather than proactive, The only one gripe I have is the hotel could not provide an umbrella on a rainy day. Given the room rates, I think it is fair to expect this provision in every room since it is not a standard item in most travellers' luggage.

<Content>100% in every way! My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel 1898 for 3 nights last weekend. We stayed in one of the privilege rooms overlooking the rambla. It was sound-proof which was greatly appreciated except for the occasional tolling of the cathedral's bells. The room was extremely comfortable, the beds were fabulous and flat screen tv showed english channels. Bathroom was spacious with power shower and generous towels. We enjoyed our reflexology in the spa on the sunday evening and the staff were friendly and helpful. The spa was a wonderful haven of peace after spending the day in the busy streets of the city. Our stay in this hotel was one of the most pleasant and enjoyable of any hotels we have stayed in the past. I would recommend Hotel 1898 to anyone and everyone. The location is perfect as it is so central to all the districts and the maremagnum is also accessible at the end of the rambla. When I visit Barcelona again I will definitely stay here, wouldnt dream of going anywhere else after such a relaxing stay in Hotel 1898. Thank You!

<Content>fantastic hotel My husband and I stayed in this hotel on November 11th this year. It is in a prime position on Las Rambus, Barcelona which really is the place to be. The hotel really is more like a 5* rather than a 4*. We did not eat in the hotel although it did have a restaurant, (which did look a little pricey) there are so many places to eat around the hotel. The room was very comfortable and roomy. The staff were really friendly and could not do enough for us. Although we did not use the spa it looked lovely. The parking facility was very good and there was a lift from the carpark into the hotel, Overall I would definatley recomend this hotel and I am extremely fussy!

<Content>Great find in Barcelona We stayed in this hotel prior to our tour of Spain based on the reviews it had received on multiple web sites and travel magazines. The building is the former headquarters of a import/export (tobacco?) corporation and actually looks like a former bank that's been extensively renovated into a chic boutique hotel. It's location on the Ramblas is very convenient and is across the street from the Meridien. You can actually see the Meridien from the lobby which is decorated much like a gentlemen's private/yacht club i.e., dark wood, model sailboats, black and white photos, and club furniture. Service is quite professional and efficient since many business persons use this place. The rooms are quite spacious, especially the corner units, and decorated with Pottery Barn/Crate and Barrel type furniture. The bathrooms are very comfortable with granite/stone tiles, large tubs and showers, and good quality soaps/shampoo. Although we didn't have a chance to use it there is a spa and pool which appears to be quite nice on the web site of the hotel. If you want something light the tapas restaurant in the hotel is great--much less olive oily than the traditional fare found in many restaurants. And, for those who can't do without Starbucks, there is a branch in the hotel itself where you can get a reasonably priced coffee and baked goods for breakfast. This place is actually much nicer, larger, and cheaper than the Meridien where we also stayed during the trip--don't bother with the bigger name hotel, this is the place to stay!

<Content>brilliant hotel we stayed here for my girlfriend's 30th birthday in september despite other hotels being rated more highly on trip-advisor at the time as we liked the look of the decor and the fact it had a rooftop pool and garden.we had a deluxe room which looked away from las ramblas and are located on the higher floors, making it quiet. it also had a terace which was great to relax on.the room was on the small side but the terrace gave you extra space. it was beautifully decorated and very stylish. the same can be said of the lobby and the rooftop bar and pool area, which was brilliant for relaxing in after the bustle of barcelona. the prices for food at the rooftop bar were not cheap as people have commented, but it was fairly quiet when we stayed and we were able to ask the barman to see if we could order food from the room service menu instead and have it brought up to the rooftop. he asked for us and it was no problem, so that made it much more reaonable. the pool was too cold for swimming in but the chance to lie in the sun more than made up for that. they also let us hang out there on the day we checked out as we didn't leave barcelona until the evening but we were able to keep using the facilites all day. the indoor pool was excellent as well.also the staff were helpful when we were trying to book restaurants and in general they were very polite. as noted previously they didn't carry our bags up to the room for us upon arrival, but personally i don't mind that. i certainly didn't have any problem with them as previous reviwers have commented.overall this is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed in and i would definitely stay there again. it is expensive but if you can afford it the extra cash for the deluxe room is worth the price.

<Content>Great stay at 1898 We have just come back from a 3-day stay at the 1898 Hotel in Barcelona. We drove over from France and had no difficulty in finding the hotel. We arrived with a flat tire and the staff were extremely helpful in getting it fixed. The staff were ever so friendly and spoke excellent English. The hotel is well located. In the same building there is a Starbucks and there are lots of small restuarants (not too pricely and with a good selection) to be found in and around the street Carrer de les Sitges which is just a block further up (but be warned they don't start eating dinner before 20:30 in Barcelona). Our room was small - but pleasant (classic). It was kept very clean and tidy, twice a day by housekeeping staff. The beds were comfortabel and you get to choose between a large choice of pillows. We were also very pleased with the large flat screen TV which was easy to view from bed. The bathroom was also small - but clean and covered in beautiful green marble.The hotel has an historical feel but all the facilities are modern. The entrance from La Rambla is amazing. We will not hesitate on choosing this hotel on our next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great stay We enjoyed our 3 night stay at the end of October. Our superior room looked out over La Rambla and was beautifully appointed in an understated way. The room and hotel generally were as clean as anywhere we have previously stayed and the toiletries, robes, slippers etc were replenished frequently. We made full use of the spa facilities which were of the highest standard. Best to use them first thing in the morning though, as they were a little oversubscribed in the early evening. The reception staff were very helpful in giving information, directions etc. and arranged a taxi for us to the airport. We didn't eat in the hotel at all as there was a great deal of choice in the immediate vicinity. A great visit to Barcelona, made all the better by a truly excellent hotel.

<Content>Very modern and well run We booked this hotel as a last minute substitution for another hotel because it could guarantee us a no smoking room. it was much more that that that. We booked a superior room and it certainly was with a great bathroom, closet space, reading light and every everything else needed including very comfortable king size bed. The guest services including handling our luggage and hailing a cab was first class. The air conditioning worked great also. Also, they readily accomodated our request for a late checkout on the day we left so we would not be at the cruise ship too early.The location on Las Ramblas was great and it was right in the center of many activities. (We were too busy visiting the sites of Barcelona prior to our cruise, so we had no opportunity to try their restaurant, bar, and other facilities.)Our only complaint was we could hear some of the noise of the restaurants below our back window even though we were on the next to the top floor. The noise was not terrible but a light sleeper might want to stay away from any hotel this close to the main streets with so many late night restaurants open.

<Content>superb service My wife  2 teenage boys stayed for 2 nights/3 days. We've been to Barcelona for short breaks previously, but this was our first time at this hotel. Perfect central location, immaculate hotel, beautiful rooms,  great spa which welcomed the children, not always the case. Very good value for the quality of the accomodation. But most impressive was the service, from the moment I 'phoned with pre-booking enquiries to the time we left in a shower of rain with one of their umbrellas, they could not do enough to make us welcome, without being obsequious. We all look forward to returning to this hotel.

<Content>This is what a city hotel should be Hotel 1898 did not live up to expectations .... it massively exceeded them.Its location could not be better, just a short walk from the Plaza Catalunya. Within a short walk, almost every type of retail/restaurant exists in abundance.The property is quite stunning inside and out. The decor throughout is strong (a lot of black and white) but somehow extremely restful. The use of striking black and white photographs rather than the normal boring Hotel Art is a clever and effective touch.We selected a Privilege room, which was just that. It was large with superb facilities. The range of complimentary toiletries was better than I have ever seen and these were properly tailored to our needs, without any request having to be made.The staff were so friendly and helpful that it was a pleasure to deal with them at whatever level. The only negative was the assumption by one of the younger porters at the hotel that because I speak English I do not understand Spanish! His offensive comment, as I discovered, was merely typical of the local men of Barcelona.If you are going to Barcelona, seriously consider Hotel 1898, but do book up a level or two above the basic room to get the full experience.

<Content>Wonderful We found our stay, 5 nights, to be extremely well supported by a fabulous staff. When we had an issue, the response was as good as it could be. The decor is beautiful. Our room (636) was extremely well appointed. The location of the hotel couldn't have been better. The restaurant was well run with good food. This is the only hotel we have found that PRINTS the paper of your choice.If we were to return to Barcelona we would definitely stay again at the hotel.

<Content>Quality Hotel In A Great Location We had booked a five night stay at The Hotel Jazz but due to technical problems in the rooms we were offered alternative accomodation at another N煤帽ez i Navarro hotel, the H1898. We were not disappointed as this was a four star hotel instead of the three star hotel we had booked, a taxi was ordered to take us to H1898 which was paid for by the hotel. We had a superior room overlooking Las Ramblas, it definetely had the wow factor. The whole hotel had lovely furnishings, very clean, with a feeling of class about it. Breakfast was buffet style and was well stocked with fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, breads and juices. The staff were all very helpful and provided tea/coffee as requested. The roof terrace is a real asset, very relaxing place to enjoy a drink taking in the view of Barcelona. All in all a brillant hotel and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic location! If there's one thing I regret about my stay in Hotel 1898, it's the fact that I only stayed for a night here. I loved this hotel -- from its facilities, the room, the service and the location.Location -- It's along Las Ramblas, so there is a lot of activity going on right when you step outside the hotel. It is a touristy area, so for some it may not be your cup of tea, but it is conveniently located beside MANY shops, cafes and most of all, the La Boqueria (a large public market quite famous in Barcelona. Make sure to go here if you're a foodie). You'll never get bored (shopping and lot of street performers) or hungry here. There's a McDonalds and KFC a few minutes walk away from the hotel, so if you're starting to miss the fast food, you can always go there. Room -- Immaculately clean. The design was very nice. My room was navy blue and white, very classy. Quite spacious for one person, really. They were quite generous with the amenities as well. There's a cool room feature that sort of sets the overall lighting of your room depending on your mood / activity -- for watching TV, for entertaining visitors, sleeping, etc. :)Staff / Service -- Professional and accommodating. Although I really didn't get to interact with them that much except for check in/out and when I asked for an electrical adaptor. But all in all, they were alright.Price -- Got this hotel because of an error made by the travel agent in my booking, so this was a pleasant mistake. But I would say it is still good value for the money. Facilities -- I haven't had the chance to use the facilities, but from what I have seen of the spa and the pool, I would like to go back and try them sometime. Food - Nothing remarkable. Don't expect an eye-popping spread, but it's alright. Overall - I love the hotel for the location, primarily. The fact that the other factors such as the room and staff were great is just icing on the cake.

<Content>Classy comfortable hotel but a couple of niggles. Breakfast a disaster. We stayed in a standard room which was small but well equipped and well designed with an extremely modern 'classy' feel.In the room there were tea/ coffee making facilities and a lovely large flat screen TV though limited choice of channels. Good internet access included in the price.Lovely comfortable lobby area and nice bar.Spa was a disappointment. It looked 'the works', had spout/fountain type things, but the water was luke warm only, not encouraging us to stay in there. Steam room was adequate.Breakfast area was very nice, and food reasonably good, but the breakfast service on the two weekend days we stayed was APALLING. They checked your name when you went in to the restaurant but then you had to fight for any kind of service. Two staff were doing their best, but were totally unable to cope with the number of guests. No-one to show you to your table. No unused place settings, and no-one offering to prepare to a place -- unless you work very hard to get someone's attention. Cold coffee.Lovely roof top terrace area, great place to relax after touring round the city.All in all not a bad hotel, excellent location, but not cheap and by no means perfect.

<Content>Wonderful stay Chose this hotel for a weekend break after reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor  we were not disappointed. We stayed in a basic room which was excellent - striking decor, lovely bathroom with extras not usually found in basic rooms (bathrobes, slippers). We ate breakfast in the hotel each day  this was quite expensive but very good - great selection.The facilities of the hotel were fantastic. The rooftop terrace  bar were wonderful and the indoor pool  spa area perfect for a relaxing swim  sauna after a long days sightseeing. Complimentary tea/coffee each day between 5 pm  7pm in the lobby bar was also a nice touch.We found the hotel staff very friendly  helpful and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a high quality hotel right in the hub of Barcelona's tourist district (its right on Las Ramblas).

<Content>Great room and terrace Overall loved this hotel... when our driver picked us up at the airport, he said that's a fantastic hotel! We agreed, starting in the lobbing, then seeing our room and then going out to the rooftop terrace for some sun and drinks.Our basic room was spacious, clean and chic... bathroom was very modern  the toiletries (including toothbrush/toothpaste  shaver) were high-quality. The mattress and pillows were very comfortable (you can select different pillows, etc., but the standard ones were fine for us)  the radio had excellent sound.We picked up a cruise after a few days in Barcelona  two couples we met onboard had stayed at the Hotel 1898--all of us raved about every aspect of the hotel (perhaps with the minor exception of some cool staff). The location is great, too... across from the M茅ridien adjacent to La Rambla  close to all major attractions.I cannot wait to go back... I tend to shop around for a good deal, but I might pay a little extra to stay here.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! This hotel in Barcelona gets high praise on Trip Advisor but having just stayed there for 3 nights I now know that the reports are all true!! My wife and I have stayed in some great hotels but we will have very good memories of Hotel 1898. Friendly, helpful staff, wonderful facilities and exceptionally clean and well maintained. We had a room with a private balcony - which included an outside bed!!The location is on La Ramba which is a very busy and lively main street - very touristy. The noise didn't disturb our sleep on the 5th floor. The location is excellent for walking to all the key sites.Breakfast is expensive but the choice on offer is excellent so we eat enough to get us through to mid afternoon tapas.

<Content>Great location We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay at this hotel. Situated on La Ramblas it was a fab location for visiting the attractions of this wonderful city. Our room overlooked La Ramblas with a tiny balcony (wide enough to stand on!). Yes it was quite noisy, but not bad enough to keep us awake, even on the Friday night when the fiesta began! The room was a reasonable size. The bed was comfortable. Tea  coffee making facilities available. The staff were courteous. Marti on reception (seemed to be on duty the whole time we were there) was extremely helpful recommending fabulous restaurants. The Patagonia is definitely worth a visit - beef to die for! The roof terrace gave us great views over the city. The pool is tiny and was very cold at the time of our visit. But plenty of places to sit and relax. The only downside was the bar prices.....be aware!We loved Barcelona and will definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Great for special occasion! I took my husband there for a special birthday, along with our son and daughter-in-law. We arrived very late on a Aug 22nd -Friday night after a BMiBaby flight delay of 2 hours. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we were soon checked in. Location of the hotel was fantastic and our room overlooked Rambla. I had booked PRIVILEGE rooms which certainly surpassed my expectations, large, airy, comfy bed and pillows, bathroom large and very well appointed. There was no noise from the street below. The roof top terrace provided a brilliant view of Barcelona. Terrace staff very polite and efficient, the cocktails and sangria were to die for (yes we sampled many). Having read some of the reviews and knowing the rating I anticipated that drinks, breakfast etc would be fairly expensive, but the luxurious Mackintosh style decor, the atmosphere and the quality of the food made it worth it. We had a really enjoyable stay there and would certainly go back again for a special occasion.

<Content>Loved it! Hotel 1898 exceeded our expectations and we cannot wait to go back next year. Superb decor, very clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Even though it is situated so close to La Rambla you could not hear any noise from the street. The 5 course breakfast served on the roof top terrace took a bit of getting through but was excellent.

<Content>Arrived on the evening spain won the Cup! We arrived into Spain on 29th June 08, the evening that Spain won the football and had to clamber through the crowd and the fireworks to walk down Las Rambla. Very hot work but a wonderful atmosphere.When we arrived we were impressed.H1898 is in summary a fantastic hotel.Why? Excellent Service, both front of house and room service.Spacious room with excellent bathroom facilities.Well located.Best roof bar in town.Nice sun terrace and the pool - well it's more like a plunge pool, but refreshing none the less.Good conciergeNice Spa (so my girlfriend told me).It was hard to fault the H1898...my only foible would be that the amazing shower/bath system takes a few minutes to get used to but apart from that we had a fantastic stay and would definitely go back. We had friends that stayed in Le Meridien around the corner and thought that H1898 put their hotel in the shade in comparison.

<Content>Loved hotel 1898 My husband and I had a lovely experience at the 1898 hotel. It was convenient, the service was excellent, the amenities great and the roof pool (although very small) not crowded and with delightful views of the city. The staff was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and making reservations.

<Content>Hotel nice........front desk manager NOT NICE. We walked into H1898 and made a reservation with the desk clerk named Martine. We asked for a cot for our children. Martine moved us from a regular room to a superior room at no extra charge. The next day we check ed out of the hotel that we had been staying in and walked 2 blocks to H1898 in a light rain. Upon arriving at the desk a gentleman named Mr. S informed us that there was a baby bed in our room and that the superior room that we had reserved could not be used for my family. He said we would have to move up to a larger and much more expensive room. Mr. S refused to give us a discount on the larger room. I got the feeling that Mr. S realized the position we were in....we had checked out of our hotel and it was raining. We were in no position to walk and look for a more reasonably priced room. Mr. S took advantage of us. That said, the hotel was very nice. Mr. S............not so nice.

<Content>Good for first time visitors to Barcelona My partner and I stayed at the Hotel 1898 for 5 nights on our trip through Southern Europe. All in all, a good experience for the following reasons:1. The location is right in the heart of Barcelona's main sights. The hotel is right on the upper part of La Rambla, which is the main street that divides the Gothic Quarter and the Raval districts--the two areas that are probably of most interest to tourists. You are within walking distance of the Cathedral, the Picasso Museum, the waterfront and the central marketplace, plus many good restaurants. You are also within easy walking distance of most of Gaudi's most famous works, which are generally in the neighborbood called Eixample--just north of the Gothic quarter and Raval. You will probably want to take the metro to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, however, as it would be a long walk.It is also less than a block away from Barcelona's highly efficient and cheap subway system, so you can also have quick access to other districts in no time. La Rambla is known for being pretty raucous, even into the wee hours of the night. But Hotel 1898 is apparently well insulated, as we could not hear any street noise at all. Granted, we had a room on one of the inner courtyards of the hotel (which we would recommend, as there isn't a great view from the rooms on La Rambla), but, even with the windows open, we didn't hear a thing. If you would prefer a location that is not right on La Rambla (e.g. quieter), we would recommend the hotels in the lower part of the district called Eixample, right on the other side of the Catalunya square from La Rambla. These are still great locations, but without the craziness of being right on La Rambla.2. Great breakfast. Our room rate included breakfast, and we would recommend you ask for the same. The breakfast is served daily from 7am to 11am. It is buffet style/all-you-can-eat, and has everything you could want. Fresh fruit, cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, waffles, pastries, vegetables, fresh juices and even diet food.It is served in the main restaurant on the second floor, but, if you book a day in advance, you can also eat on the rooftop with views of Barcelona. 3. Nicely decorated rooms. The hotel is in the former building of the Phillipines tobacco company, and, although fully renovated, they have decided to keep the decorations consistent with the Filipino/tobacco theme. Lots of beautiful wood (floors, mouldings), marble and hallways lined with pictures from old Filipino tobacco plantations. The rooms tend to be done in green and white, red and white or brown and white stripes...very hip and modern, with still a nod to the past.4. The rooms have luxurious fittings and amenities. The bed, in particular, was awesome. It was even larger than a California King, and very comfortable. Down pillows and down comforter (which we didn't use because it was warm). They also have one of the better air conditioning systems I've experienced in Europe. And you can set it just the way you want it. And they have pre-set lighting scenarios you can choose from with the touch of a button, depending on your mood. For instance, they have one for romantic night lighting and one for reading. It was a nice touch.Plus, they had free wireless access that was very quick and easy to use.5. Rates were reasonable for the luxuriousness of the hotel. The hotel is at the higher end of the offerings (although there are even more luxurious offerings), and the rates we paid seemed like they were quite a bit less than other comparable hotels. We paid 225 Euros per night for the smallest size room, and similar hotels were charging 300-350 Euros for similarly sized rooms. So we felt like we got a good deal.OK, so there were a few things that we didn't like, which is why we didn't give it a 5:1. The shower was a bit of a disaster. It has three nozzles...a rain shower, a hand shower and the main tub faucet. There are three handles to control each of these, and each of these handles had sub-handles. I dare you to figure them out easily. We had to have the concierge come explain it to us, and even then it was really difficult to get it to work properly. My sense is that many people have complained about the complications of the shower, as they have a directions card in the bathroom to tell you how to use it...but I followed them exactly and couldn't get it to work.Plus, there was no cold water in the shower. The coolest you could get it was luke warm. It was hot in Barcelona, so we occasionally wanted a cold shower and couldn't get one. When we called to ask about this, they said they had never heard of anyone wanting a cold shower, so they didn't provide it as an option.2. They didn't have a concierge that we could find, and we could have used one to give us advice and help book events. So, we had to do this on our own, which did create hassles every now and then. The front desk staff tries to answer your questions, but they aren't as knowledgeable about the city and sights as one would hope.3. Not a big deal, but the lighting system I mentioned above does have one fatal flaw. Like many European hotels, you have to leave your card key in the main light switch for it to work. If you forget to leave it in there and have to turn a light on in the middle of the night, watch out...because, when you put the card key in, it automatically turns all the lights on, waking up anyone who is trying to sleep. One of those instances where they've over-engineered the system, in my opinion.4. The cheapest rooms are tiny. There is little room to walk around the bed and little storage space. You're constantly tripping over your luggage. They do have larger rooms (for a premium, of course), which we would recommend you take. Again, their rates are reasonable by Barcelona standards, so you can give back part of your savings to get a larger room. It will make the experience better.So, all in all, we really enjoyed our experience here and would recommend the hotel, particularly to first time visitors of Barcelona. But, if we were to go to Barcelona again, we would probably opt to stay in one of the hotels in the lower Eixample. Now that we know the city, we don't need to be right in the heart of La Rambla.

<Content>Mandys 40th treat After doing the usual research we stayed at the hotel in August 2008 as a treat for my wifes 40th birthday. From the time we walked through the door we could not fail to be impressed by the wow factor. I can only echoe previous comments- staff brilliant, they actually want to help and are all professional in the way they go about their business. Rooms reflect the thought that has gone into the rest of the hotel, class and quality with many nice touches that make you feel that little bit special. The roof top terrace is indeed an oasis within a very busy city, a place to relax and be pampered but at a price when you order from the cocktail bar! The spa was immaculate and was quiet most of the time. The location is spot on for exploring the city and transfer via taxi from the airport 25 euros. We will return to this hotel having always said we would experience a different hotel everytime we do a city break, it was that good!

<Content>Loved it all From the moment we arrived right up to the moment we had to leave we loved everything about Hotel 1898. Location of the hotel was fantastic, the interior cool, clean and staff very welcoming. We booked a PRIVILEGE room which certainly surpassed our expectations, large, airy, comfy bed and pillows, bathroom large and very well appointed. The roof top terrace provided a brilliant view of Barcelona and the area was kept clean and tidy (we saw maids tidying, mopping and re arranging cushions on the loungers every couple of hours - their attention to detail was brilliant). Terrace staff very polite and efficient, the cocktails and sangria were to die for (yes we sampled many) unlike some of the reviews we had read before our stay we didn't think they were over priced at all. We loved the whole experience and will certainly return to Barcelona and Hotel 1898

<Content>Fabulous Spa hotel City break My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights from 22nd August based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and we loved this hotel. We paid the extra to book a Priviledge room and it was worth every penny, keep an eye on the hotel's website for some good deals that are updated regularly.Highlights were the large bedroom and bathroom, lovely products, quiet room (even though it was on the corner of La Rambla, we heard little noise), roof top pool and terrace but more than anything the basement spa area. We used the pool, steam room and sauna every day and it was so relaxing and peaceful. The pool has lots of water jets for you to find. We went for a city break and ended up having a relaxing Spa one!The other thing we norticed about the hotel it that there are always staff cleaning it, whether in the lifts, the lobby, the rooftop or the spa and so it is spotless. The staff are all really proud of this hotel and rightly so.As mentioned in other reviews, there is a Starbucks next to the hotel which was a bonus for us caffeine addicts. There was also a lovely seating area away from the bar where they played silent movies which were fun to watch over a drink.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Hotel 1898 lived up to expectations. We had the standard room, which was still beautifully furnished and large enough. Great location, and the sofas on the roof top were very relaxing. Pool and gym in the basement also great. Had breakfast on last day, which was delicious but expensive. Rooms were regularly cleaned and towels swapped several times a day if required. Hotel was like an oasis in a very busy city!

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I stayed in the hotel 1898 on the first night of our honeymoon before a going on a cruise the next day, when we arrived we where tired from the wedding stress and where hoping the hotel lived up to expectation! It did, the hotel was beautiful and my wife and I really enjoyed our night there! I wanted to stay in 5 star hotels and really enjoy a luxurious honeymoon and when we arrived at H1898 we where greeted with friendly staff and a very nice lobby. The staff where friendly and when I told them it was our honeymoon the man who checked us in gave us a king-size double bed as I had accidentally booked two separate beds!The rooms are very tastefully decorated, well finished and the bathrooms are very spacious and clean. The H1898 also has a very nice pool and bar area on the rooftop with sun beds and comfortable seats which looks out toward the gothic and central areas of the city. All in all a very nice hotel and we where sad we only had a night there!

<Content>rooftop oasis on the busy las ramblas My boyfriend and I stayed at 1898 July 2008. Wonderful hotel, great moden decor in a charming historic building. Excellent location on Las Ramblas. Beds and pillow are super comfy and the bathroom had an excellent grohe rainshower and sleek black granite. Very clean, but not terribly large (at least our std room was not). The would definately be a case of quality over quantity-room quality was superb for a european hotel but not the largest in size. The most outstanding feature of this hotel is its rooftop. It boasts amazing panoramic views of the city, a decent size pool, loungy beds and chairs all around. The vibe at the pool bar is very chill and the drinks are great-especially the forzen mojitos and sangria! The food was also good. You almost forget your staying on Las Ramblas when your up there. Amazing hotel for the price. Would stay again and not hesitate to suggest to my fellow travelers.

<Content>Smart, Classy and Well Located Smart, central and a very good standard of 4 star hotel. I stayed with my daughter (24) on a shopping/sightseeing trip and it was ideal. We stayed weds, thurs and frid during august and found the rooms excellent, all the staff were helpful, everything is very well kept and the location is really superb.We booked direct with the hotel on a package that included reflexology for tired feet, breakfast and the option of a late check-out (the only disappointing part was that the late check-out didn't materialise, but not a great problem). Flights were with flyglobespan and we booked our airport taxi's through the flyg. site too - all without any hitches. We didn't have any problems with noise as some reviewers have said (we slept well) but I think you have to accept if staying in a busy hotel in a busy street in a busy city - there will be noise!The bar service was friendly - drinks are a bit pricey, but again you are in the centre of the city. Breakfast selection was fine - but probably not enough if you like a big fry-up type of breakfast. Great hotel

<Content>cool hotel Beautiful stylish hotel.We were cheapskates and skipped the 鈧?6 per head breakfast ..ate instead at the chocolate shop just down from the hotel which was great.Basement spa,swimming pool ,gym,sauna and steam-room all fantastic.Top floor terrace and bar great but pool just for lounging in..too small or shallow for a swim.Rooms were all deep cherry wood floors ,marble bathrooms and candy striped decor.WIFi great as was internet facility in the library on the first floor(4 computers with attached printers).Rooms and public areas were spotlessly clean.The staff were all friendly and helpul.Hotel definitely has the wow factor in terms of style and decor..

<Content>Heaven on Earth! This was my second time staying at this hotel and it was even better than the first time. Everything about this hotel is first class. It is located right on Las Rambla. It is very tastefully decorated and from the minute you enter the hotel the staff make you feel welcome and at ease. Great facilities with an indoor pool and spa in the basement and an outdoor pool on the most amazing roof top terrace. I really can't recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>One of my favorite hotels ever My husband and I just returned from a stay at Hotel 1898. We couldn't have been happier with this hotel, and often had difficulty prying ourselves away from its confines to experience Barcelona. Some of the other reviews I read complained of poor service. We didn't experience anything like this. Everybody we met was extremely friendly and helpful. It wasn't like Four Seasons service where everybody is asking you every thirty seconds if you're okay, but if you express a need, it's seen to immediately.We booked a terrace room which will go down as one of my favorite hotel rooms of all time. We had an enormous private terrace, almost as large as the room, with beautiful plants, two spacious loungers, and a large table. We ate several meals out here and spent a lot of time relaxing. It faced a side street so noise from La Rambla was minimal.The room itself was decorated in black and white with rich wood floors. A/C was extremely powerful and worked brilliantly. TV was great with many more English channels than most European hotels. Enormous closet with plenty of storage space to unpack completely. Free Wi-Fi. The only complaint we had about the room is that our King bed was quite literally two LARGE single beds. Not bound together in the traditional manner, but actually on rollers and easily separated. This is fairly common in Europe and didn't really bother us. Bathroom was nicely appointed and spotlessly clean. Fresh robes and slippers every day. Nice toiletries and included shaving and dental kits automatically. Mini-bar was a bit sparse, but we stored things that we bought in the Starbucks downstairs in there and they didn't seem to mind.Location-wise, it can't be beat. It's right on Las Ramblas, and a two minute walk to the nearest Metro stop. Restaurants, shops, and conveniences abound. The shopping district is pretty much across the street. La Bocaqueria, the most amazing food market in Europe, is three minutes walk. For a quick fix, there is a Starbucks in the same building as the hotel.Food in the hotel was very good. Definitely above average. Room service was delivered within 20 minutes every time and always hot and delicious. We tried the buffet breakfast and were very pleased with it. Lots of little luxuries like champagne were made available. We ate in the main restaurant one night and LOVED our food. Service was also good, and they let us take our time. We ate on the rooftop restaurant another night and besides the shockingly high price of drinks we had an immensely beautiful dinner. How can you beat the view from the rooftop cafe as the sun sets over all of Barcelona? It was a memorable experience.Pools were fantastic. The rooftop pool was small, but refreshing, and the lounge areas on the rooftop are just too much fun to relax on. We went for a rooftop swim as the sun was going down our last evening in Barcelona, and it was simultaneously fun and romantic. The pool down by the Spa is really fun-looking. The gym was small, but we weren't there to work-out. We didn't try any of the spa services, unfortunately.Overall, we found this hotel to be a really good fit for us. We are relaxed people who don't like to make a fuss, but we also like our luxuries when we're on vacation. This hotel epitomized that relaxed luxury, and combined it with jaw-dropping views and location. If we're lucky enough to go back to Barcelona, we won't dream of staying anywhere else.

<Content>Looks nice but has a big problem First impressions were great. Sexy cool lobby and understated but classy looks from the street. Up to the rooms with the cases and it still looked very nice and cool. However thats the first for two big problems. We had two massive cases with us and hand luggage, and the front desk was manned by two staff members and a porter. No other guests and no offer of any help with the bags. Amazing in a hotel of this class and price range. So being typically english we did it ourselves but not a good opening impression. By the way this was repeated on checkout. No help whatsoever and 4 members of the lobby team watched us struggle past to the taxi. The rooms are good. Well furnished with a super cool lighting system and very nice bathroom. However here comes big problem number 2. The rooms are REALLY noisy. You here everything from the corridor. Its like the door isnt even on. So if your looking for sleep or relaxation. Forget it. This is a party city and we were constantly woken throughout the entire night by drunken guests returning to their rooms. Not good enough for a Hotel charging these prices. You expect to sleep surely ?The rooftop terrace is fantastic ! Very trendy, cool and amazing views. The pool is very small though, but loads of places to sit / lie and catch the sun.So this is a Hotel for party people we think. Cool bar scene, and if your coming in late from clubs, you'll love it. However if your looking to relax and get a decent sleep, be careful as we didnt !

<Content>Hotel 1898--beautiful but let down by uninterested staff We just returned from five days in Barcelona staying at Hotel 1898. I really wanted to like this hotel and the facilities are beautiful but the staff lets the place down. Upon arrival, we were struggling to get out of a cab with all of our luggage, our eighteen month old son and his pushchair--being dropped off into the madness of the Ramblas--and the doorman at Hotel 1898 simply stood and watched us. Did not lift a finger to help until we pulled all of our stuff together and struggled over to the door. That should have been a sign.Check in was okay and the room was lovely, if a bit small for a so-called superior, especially when you add the baby cot. My husband went down to reception to ask for matches and they did not have any. That's okay but when he asked where he could get some or purchase a lighter, they simply shrugged and turned away. When I needed a cab, which I did every day since I was on business, I went out to the doorman who told me I had to go ask at the desk--despite the fact that there were four cabs lined up in front of the hotel with no passengers! And when I did ask at the desk, I would have to wait ten minutes or more while these empty cabs idled outside. What's THAT about?We had a function to go to on Saturday night and asked for an iron to iron my husband's shirt. We were told none was available for guests but that we could use their laundry service to get it pressed, which would cost us money, of course. Very very naughty from a supposed five star hotetl The prices are high, yes, particularly on the rooftop bar where a drink sets you back 12 euros or more. And none of the receipts--for room service, drinks, anything--let you add a tip. So, if no one is working for tips, it's no wonder the services is so shoddy! We kept loose euros on us to tip the deserving ones such as the rooftop bar servers. The rooftop is lovely but maybe instead of staying here, you should just visit it.There were many more small slights--room service order errors (because the person taking the order could not understand English), LOUD rooms--bring your earplugs, LOUD housekeeping staff--all if it adding up to make this more of a three star hotel than a five star hotel. It is beautiful but the service really lets it down. And since we were paying 225-275 euros a night, it should have been better.Will find somewhere else to stay next time I'm in Barcelona.

<Content>Loved the 1898 Stayed at the 1898 for a week for our wedding anniversary and loved it. We had a 'superior' room in the red and white colour scheme (331) which was immaculately clean and had plenty of room. Nice touches included the robes and slippers and the fact they always replaced the soap - maybe petty but I've stayed in some '5 star' places that expect you to use one tiny piece of soap for your whole stay. Plus toothbrush and shaving kits as standard in bathrooms - no having to ask reception if you'd forgotten something.The location is ideal for exploring Barcelona - I don't know how someone can describe the location as 'awful' - umm if you don't want to stay on La Rambla - then don't, but it's on a major tourist central road - I'm not sure what they expected . The room was lovely and quiet considering where it was located. We didn't eat in the hotel as it did seem a little expensive for what was on offer and there are plenty of cafes nearby - there's a Starbucks next door for those craving a caffeine fix and a number of small supermercados nearby for picking up water/drinks for cheaper than the mini bar. I will definitely stay at the 1898 for our next Barcelona trip - in fact I can't wait.

<Content>Outstanding Experience This was the second time I stayed at this hotel. The hotel is exquisite. The rooms have all the little toys such as the lighting system for reading, relaxing etc. The Hotel is immaculate and the staff is friendly and very responsive. The location is wonderful. You are right on Ramblas between Plaza Cataluna and the Harbor in the middle of everything. One thing I would recommend though which has nothing to do with the hotel. If you are a single person on a business trip in Barcelona, be careful of the pick pockets at night on the very busy Ramblas. There are many groups of African women who are very aggressive in their attempts to pick your pockets. They kind of swarm you, while one grabs your arm to try to distract you while their partners go for your back pockets or any bag you may be carrying. I live in Amsterdam which has its share of Pick Pockets, but they are nothing like the crews in Barcelona.

<Content>great spa We booked this hotel as a mini honeymoon. I e-mailed the hotel and told them it was our honeymoon and they gave us twin beds! They eventually gave us a double on the third night of our stay.The hotel in itself was beautiful, the spa and rooftop pool were both excellent as was the buffet style breakfast in the morning, definitely worth the money. The location was also first class.The rooms were a little small but overall a great hotel but the price would ony be justified if you amde full use of spa facilities.

<Content>Overpriced I had originally booked the Hotel Arts for our 3 night stay in Barcelona for our wedding anniversary. Upon reading the reviews and seeing the location of Arts, I cancelled this booking to stay at 1898. What a mistake. The cost was about the same, (370 Euros a night for a bedroom with terrace at 1898). Paying this sort of money, I expected, rightly or wrongly so, to have some sort of standard of service. How wrong we were. We arrived to be told that there were no irons and ironing boards allowed in the rooms, that they were a 'risk', so if you wanted anything to be ironed, you had to pay for laundry (I am surprised no one else noted this?). The luggage we brought along would have cost well over 100 Euros to be ironed. How ridiculous. So we nipped to Carrefour next door and got a travel iron!!!! Not exactly what I had in mind for our special break!!!!! The room (532 I think it was) was smaller than I imagined it would be, spotlessly clean I hasten to add, with a nice private terrace to lounge around in, which I appreciated. It was nicely decorated, but not at all spacious in size for the price we paid. The service is what lets this hotel down. We had problems getting a taxi one night and there were 4 people behind the reception desk doing nothing, whilst the concierge over the road at the Meridien, were hailing every available taxi for their clients. Very irritating. Also, the service on the roof top terrace was spectacularly awful. I shouldnt have to send my husband to find a waiter to get us drinks, or have to look at remanants of breakfast left by other guests for half an hour. The location, la rambla, is awful. Coming from Amsterdam, this was the worst place for us to be situated. What a nasty, smelly, crowded tourist hellhole. We went to Hotel Arts for a drink one lunchtime and I severely regret cancelling that booking. There were staff everywhere. Service was efficient and polite and professional. This was truly a 5 star experience. I shall be booking there on our next trip for sure. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone, because I felt it was majorly overpriced for what you get. Majorly disappointed and not sure why this hotel is number 1 in Barcelona????!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Peaceful but Expensive Oasis We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of July using one of their special packages which included a meal on the rooftop terrace.As others have said the location is excellent and the hotel is clean and we found the majority of staff super. We had a superior room which whilst not huge was easily big enough for us and the bathroom was a good size and well equipped. We made great use of the roof terrace which was never crowded and a super place to relax late in the afternoon after a hard day in Barcelona. It is only a pity that the drinks were so expensive.We had an evening meal included on the terrace in our rate and this was very good with excellent service although again cost would prevent me from eating there if it had not been included.Again, breakfast, which consisted of pretty much all cold pastries, hams, cheeses with a few hot choices was good but you can eat way cheaper nearby.All in all, although the hotel was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay, we did feel that it was not quiet value for money

<Content>Smart hotel, a little let down by precise and unemotional service We came to the 1898 for our 25th Wedding Anniversary and made the choice based on the position of the hotel and the roof pool and bar (and the generally positive reviews). Overall not disappointed,but there are few minor issues that mark the hotel down a little. First the positives:Great position, really easy to get to from the airport - the bus stops around 500 metres away - and central for everything, right next to La Rambla. The roof pool (for dipping) and the bar are really great; they made a great Negroni - very strong. The drinks are expensive but you are paying for the fact you are on a roof with really comfortable seats and a good view. Food is also pricey and not hugely original. One evening we ordered a selection of meats for 鈧?3 and received a plate of one type of ham! Staff on the roof are very willing but service is a bit slow if there are a lot of people. Bedroom was large (Privilege Room) with a fantastically comfortable bed; room was well sound proofed with efficient A/C. Huge choice of pillows if important to you.Free newspaper (laser printed) every day.We didn't use the spa in the basement but it looked good if a little small.Now the minor niggles, which did not detract from our stay but should be ironed out based on the prices they charge:Free tea is offered every day in the lobby between 5 and 7 pm. The lobby and bar lack atmosphere (everyone is on the roof!). There was no one around to serve the tea and when the barman eventually was found we were not offered a choice of tea (there were 2 types) but the tea was poured and it was pretty awful!One of the bathroom taps kept falling off and we were only supplied 1 small piece of soap (both these issues were rectified the day the hotel was notified) The A/C control is inside the main cupboard: It's very hard to read the control and if any staff member needs to get at it they have to go into your cupboard where all your stuff is stored - not a great piece of planning.No biscuits in the room with the coffee - a bit penny pinching.We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (v. pricey) but there are loads of places outside - even a Starbucks in the hotel building if you like their coffee!The staff at the main desk are polite and efficient but as has been mentioned by other reviewers they do what is necessary and no more. That little extra touch is missingOverall we would stay again in one of their standard rooms and spend all moments at the hotel on the roof, which is the highlight.One other thing; Eat at Alkimia restaurant, Industria 79 behind La Sagrada Familia. Fantastic chef - and yet again precise, cool service - must be a Barcelona trait.

<Content>Fantastic oasis in the most central location This hotel is located very central at all day long lively La Rambla, close to Plaza Catalunya. Therefore one is always in the middle of everything and can reach shopping, sightseeing, city tour busses, plenty of restaurants and even the waterfront in short walking distance. Travelling to the airport can be done very easily via the airport bus (costs ca. 4 EUR pp) which goes to Plaza Catalunya - then ca. 5 min. walk to the hotel.The hotel itself is fantastic. Great service, extremely clean (it seems they are cleening all day long) and it offers a fantastic roof terrace with pool and bar. The terrace is the perfect place to escape a bit from the vibrating city life - you can just relax at the pool or lay in one of the roof terrace couches and enjoy some drinks or food. The pool bar is open late night and they also offer breakfast up there but one has to pre-order that the day before. - That seemed a bit odd and they were not flexible if you just wanted to take the breakfast there in the morning without preordering. Another advice: as you stay so central there is always cabs going along outside the hotel you don't need to order that via the hotel - some cab drivers charge up to 6.20 EUR for coming to the hotel after being called - even though they just drive around the corner ... So, just stop a cab at the street, works all the time.

<Content>A beautiful retreat in the heart of Barcelona!!! Having just returned from our honeymoon in Barcelona I felt I had to write a review of the 1898. As with any hotel booking there is always some trepidation, especially for such a special occasion, but the 1898 fulfilled all the criteria on our list. Wonderful service, beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and a cool haven from the heat of the streets.The roof terrace was a wonderful place to spend time reading a book and although the hotel was nearly full it was never over crowded. The pool was perfect for a cooling off dip and the views over the roof tops of the city a delight. We had our breakfasts on the roof terrace most days and although fairly expensive at 21.5 euros we found that we were full for most of the day, plus the pleasure of eating in the morning sunshine seemed worth the price tag.The 1898 is not a budget break in Barelona and would probably not appeal to all, but for a romantic escape or special treat we would highly recommend it.

<Content>Classy  The title of this review is a bit of a give away...Position- spot on- right in the guts of La Rambla...initial perspective, lobby etc, very classy, expensively done, very stylish. The reception people were a tad cool I thought, not overly burdened with a service ethic. We arrived around 1pm, and were told that check in was at 3, and felt that they didn't really try and help us in what we might do for 2 hours. They weren't rude or anything ,just didn't really seem to care too much. Anyway, our friends booked into their room- a normal one with a view over a alley way/stairwell thing, and we went to our superior room- v expensive at 420 Euros, but very well appointed, lovely big king size bed, superb pillows, and a sun terrace. good for entertaining. All a bit small for the $$$ however- comparing it to the room we had in a Paris hotel afterwards.We were on the 5th floor, out the back, overlooking a plaza that got a bit noisy later in the days. Faciities are very good, the gym/ pool complex in the basement was very groovy, as was the bar/ pool area on the roof- warning- don't try and dive in the pool, it is tiny and only knee deep, really there for true dipping as opposed to anything else.Yes, drinks are expensive, but the 360 degree view is superb. The service levels stayed the same over the 3 nights we were there- cool, standoffish- they don't help people in off the street with their luggage for example- they stand back and wait for you to come to them! Didn't eat there, too many choices outside.All in all, as I've said above. I think it was expensive for what we got, I think you may as well just get an ordinary room, a fair bit cheaper. I wouldn't stay there again, as much to do with the overall attitude as much as the value- they are linked of course.

<Content>Don't look elsewhere go to the Hotel 1898 After much searching for an hotel in Barcelona, on the strength of reviews for the Hotel 1898 I booked a 3 night stay here - I was not disappointed.The hotel location is fantastic - directly on to the Ramblas, and is very well located for shops, nightlife, harbour etc. Despite its central location, the hotel itself was very quiet. I asked for a quiet room and was given a room on the 6th floor, which was on a side street (so did not face the Ramblas). There was no noice from outside or inside the hotel.The room itself (a superior room) was very nicely furbished, a good size bathroom, and a good size room. No complaints about the room at all. Other revies referred to a balcony. There was no balcony, only a large window that opened. (NB The suites on the 5th floor below us had their own private terraces, and I noted some had their own private pool).The rooftop terrace and pool were brilliant. A great way to chill out and relax in the heart of the City.We dined on the rooftop one evening and the food was very good. No complaints about the breakfast - plenty of choice.The hotel itself is not cheap, but I would regard it as value for money, on the basis you get what you pay for. You have to remember this is regarded as a Luxury hotel. We had cocktails on the rooftop terrace which were 10 euros each - the same price as a beer on the Ramblas !I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to go to Barcelona (and have done so), but not on a tight budget. If I was returning to Barcelona, it would be my first choice of hotel.

<Content>Perfection This hotel was so good that I have no complaints at all.The location is so good, as others have said.It was close to Playa Catalunya where we picked up the hop on/off bus, and to the train. It was an easy walk to the beachfront too, where we had a nice lunch in Port Vell.We stayed post cruise for 3 nts. We were at the hotel by 9 am, and our room was ready.We loved our room, and it was big by European standards.It had a really comfortable king size bed with a pillow menu available.Our room had a french door that went out to a little patio that was furnished with a table and 2 chairs.We had a tub/shower combination, and lots of nice amenities including slippers and robes.The best part of the hotel was the rooftop terrace and pool.There is a bar up there as well.The views over the city are amazing and there are plenty of lounges and tables.It was really nice up there at night as well.All the staff we met were very helpful, whether it was to give directions and maps, to recommending restaurants and calling for reservations.Our package came with breakfast included, and it was good.This buffet has so much on it, but they will also make you eggs to order.It also includes cava and wine, although I don't know who would want that for breakfast. I would definitely stay here again if traveling to Barcelona again.To me it was perfection!

<Content>Nice hotel, need to iron out some faults The Hotel 1898 is located in the former buildings of the Philippines Tobacco agency of Spain, a trading company. This makes for a truly nice and genuine old building, where the insides have been ripped out and redone completely. Absolutely everything inside is new, including the newly carved out parking garage.We arrived to check in without any problems, after first having some quarrel with the GPS. The street La Rambla is not a valid GPS destination for this hotel, after calling the hotel we were told the street address is Pintor Fortyun 1, and the GPS guided us to the front door.The location is on the main tourist street in BCN, apart from the scores of cheap-flight tourists hanging around the location can't be more perfect in BCN.After check in we ordered parking for the car a bit pricey at 23 鈧?per night. But the garage is right under the hotel, amazing for such an old building and I was guided in by the bellhop. The room is probably too small for its price category, but very tall and nicely done. Very clean, and always magically cleaned when we were out. The A/C was found inside the closet not difficult to find but a bit difficult to read the screen. After shivering through the night with an overzealous A/C I decided to read the manual and discovered how to run it proper.Room was quiet, apart from some low hallway noise. Not a nuisance.There's plenty of channels on the TV, but not all of them were as according to the manual. Nice to have Fox Series to watch in the evening after the spa.We did not feel the 20 鈧?breakfast was a good enough value to eat in the hotel.On the roof is one of the major assets of this hotel, a smallish pool and a very nice bar. The pool is good for a dip in the heat and there is several beds along the rooftop. Ample amounts of towels and a complimentary bathrobe makes the lack of changing area near the pool a non-issue.In the bar, there's no a lot of perfection, in spit of the staff effort. They are courteous and friendly, but not very professional. Also, the drinks are very off on the recipe, like the strawberry daiquiri. Nice selection of cheeses on a plate along with a bottle of good red wine is a much better bet in the not very comfortable large divans. The spa in floor -1 is nice, with a warm and comfortable spa pool. Steam sauna is still out of order, and the Finnish sauna was not hot enough at 70 degrees Celsius and low humidity.At the business centre, there's the usual Americans hogging the computers chatting along with home base in Kentucky or where ever but fortunately there is enough of them to go around. I had to print, sign and fax a contract in the evening and none of these actions were an issue. WiFi in the room was very slow and needed a login and password from the desk to function.All in all, this is a 4/5 because there's some issues that need to be corrected. They have an almost perfect building and location but partly fail on details and prices. This does not mean that the hotel should be avoided, however.

<Content>Fabulous Classy Hotel This is a fantastic hotel, Reception were so friendly, supplied us with maps and even highlighed places of interest. The breakfast is lovely and very varied.The rooms are beautiful, spotlessly clean.The pool and roof bar are lovely and give you fantastic views of the cityOnly slight negative is there are bars beside the hotel, it's not soundproofed enough so the sound carries and can disturb you through the night.Highly recommend this hotel if you fancy a relaxing base for sightseeing!

<Content>Great hotel and location My wife and I really enjoyed this hotel. I have stayed in Barcelona before on business trips and this time I was at the Hilton for a meeting before moving to the 1898 for three nights. I was not at all disappointed; we were in a standard room facing the courtyard so no view but it was very quiet considering you are right in the middle of all the action on the Rambla. Staff was highly courteous and allowed us to check in at about noon which was terrific. Needless to say, with the current exchange rate of about 1.65 dollars to the Euro, it is not cheap (about $450 a night) but it's one of the nicer hotels I've stayed in, and I've been to quite a few. The rooftop view is great, just be careful as a few drinks will set you back at about $18 a pop. The location is spectacular... I have heard the Meridian across the street is also very nice at about the same price or higher, and the 1898 has a lot of history to the building. The mood lighting as described in other reviews is nice. Bathrooms very pleasant. Internet access is free in the business center on the second floor (called Floor 1). Not much nightlife in the bar, mainly due to the fact that the weather was so great that everyone wanted to be outside. Have a great time!

<Content>Close but not perfect There is certainly no complaints about room size or style. Not sure what room the reviewer had that said they couldn't swing a mouse but ours was big by European standards. A lot of storage and a large bath for two with a brilliant rain shower. The bed was a true queen / king size (not two pushed together) and the style of it was very modern and chic, without being two cold and souless. The turn down service supplied fresh towels if you had used the ones supplied in the morning during the day. This was a first in my experience.The roof top pool isn't olympic size, or one you would do laps in. But it has 360 degree views and is great on a hot summers evening. The euro habit that used to be confined to Germans of putting towles on pool chairs is alive and well here. I didn't spend much time at the pool but one morning I noticed two chairs were reserved for over two hours. There are not many of these chairs so if you can't beat them join them and get up there early then go have breakfast.The roof top bar is wel appointed and has great views. The furniture consists of large lounges and cushions. Very pricey though. It also attracts outsiders so I would assume gets busy in peak summer.The only reason I didn't give 5 was the staff were just so indifferent and the bar prices over the top. The staff at the roof top bar didn't want to know you and were certainly not friendly. I don't really care about service but on this trip had stayed at a place just before this one that had brilliant personal service which really made this place look even worse than it probably was.Also, I could be wrong, but it didn't seem to have air conditioning in the rooms? It wasn't overly hot so not an issue, but would be in August. I couldn't se any controls or vents.

<Content>The reviews don't lie! Chilled and elegant boutique style, exudes class This for me proves what Trip Advisor is all about - having read the reviews booked it - and it was everything I hoped for.When you pull up first impressions are superb, elegant yet not too formal. Fit-out is superb, top materials and workmanship. Room was only just big enough as a single but well fitted out especially bathroom (no bath though). Rooftop terrace bar and pool was breathtaking - like something from an LA movie, ultra chilled and cool, had drinks there later in day too. Obviously dependant on weather so summer is the time, especially since you are in the city!Location is probably unbeatable. I am so going back here with my wife, was there with clients who were impressed. Staff professional and helpful.Difficult to have a gripe about anything (no in-room movies is the most I could think of - even though I didn't want one)A real find!

<Content>impeccable Lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona. We stayed at Hotel 1898 in June 2008 for 2 nights. We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel but the rooms are a little small, especially at 拢350 a night. We had a terrace so that helped, otherwise we would have felt too squashed in. We stayed in room 526, which was on the 5th floor, facing the back of the building. The rooms were extremely clean and always had fresh towels and bed linen. The bathroom was lovely and with me being 6'2 the bath was ample. As for the rest of the hotel, the spa in the basement was nice, but the water in the pool was extremely cold. Almost to the point of shivering, the steam room was not working either! We found that it would have been nicer if someone from the hotel had shown us around first as it was a little off putting just walking round free roam. The roof top bar/pool was ok. The bar is extremely expensive, 拢15.00 for a gin and tonic. The pool on the roof is very small, the photos on the hotel website make the pool out to be bigger than it actually is, also there is no where to change on the roof so if you are wanting a quick dip in the pool, forget about it. You would have to walk back through the hotel dripping wet. Also we couldn't find any dry towels on the roof on 2 occasions. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as for 鈧?0 it seemed expensive. Plus the hotel has a door into the Starbucks next door so we just went there {be warned though that in Barcelona none of the Starbucks Menus had a translation so unless you are fluent in spanish/catalan you might just have to guess}.We had drinks in the reception area of the hotel, but again very expensive and the quality was nothing special. They had very little choice if you didn't drink alcohol, which is the norm in Barcelona from what we found. We found that the hotel staff didn't really speak to us much, even though they had door staff and reception staff. This was a little off putting. We were able to check in at 12 o'clock which was nice. The music system in the room didn't work at all and the TV was almost unwatchable, very fuzzy! for 拢350 a night you would expect these things to work. The pillows and bed were lovely though. Very gay friendly in the hotel, we had no issues with that. If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me x

<Content>Lovely Hotel, great location This is a beautiful, stylish hotel. The staff are very efficient and friendly. The rooftop bar and pool area is lovely; unfortunately the weather was fairly overcast during our stay so we didn't sample the pool but cocktails up there were a very civilised way to start and end an evening. Only disappointment was that our room overlooked the central courtyard and so natural light to the room was limited.

<Content>Expensive, but top notch quality. Finally, a hotel worth its star rating. The interior of this hotel was every bit as nice as the exterior. It exuded understated elegance. The location was excellent right in the center of everything on Las Ramblas. The staff was very friendly and helpful too. The reception, bar, and sitting areas were very classy with leather seating, club chairs, and 1930's style of decorating. The business center was outstanding with 4 computers with free internet access, leather furniture, and a conference table. Again, very classy. The rooftop bar and pool area was great. The spa and pool area in the basement was top notch. I had the silk feet massage and it was wonderful, but too short. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. You could special order eggs, which was nice. It wasn't worth 20 euros, but typical pricing for western Europe.We booked a superior room. It was very clean and quite lovely with quality features: king size bed with a selection of pillow types, plasma TV, wood floors, light dimming switches, room safe, robes, slippers, etc. The bathroom was in marble with a nice rainfall showerhead. Although not huge, the bathroom was above average compared to other 4 and 5 stars we have stayed at. There were several complaints on tripadvisor about room noise, but our room faced the side street and was very quiet.We payed an average of 315 euros per night which is very expensive by American standards. We have stayed at less expensive 4 and 5 star hotels in other major European cities only to feel disappointed in the end. We were very pleased with our selection this time.

<Content>Probably the best hotel we ever stayed. I have booked this hotel for my husband's special birthday treat, so my expectations were very high, I wanted everything to be perfect. And to be frank, it probably was. Although quite pricey, the location is fantastic, the hotel is very modern and furbished in elegant, understated style. We stayed in the standard room, which was not large, but still a decent size and airy, certainly not pokey or dinky. I was worried about the noise from La Rambla, so asked for quiet room at the back when booking and our room (No 404) fitted the bill perfectly. In fact, we got really good night's sleep (the bed was large and very comfortable) and did not wake up before 9 am. We skipped the breakfast, at 20 euros, it's expensive and you can eat like a king at plenty of cafes in the neighbourhood or at the Bouqeria market. The rooftop pool and terrace are just fantastic, great to unwind in late afternoon to catch the last of sunshine before going out in the evening. The same goes for the grotto pool, sauna and the gym in the cellar. The reception staff was very helpful, they secured us a last minute reservation at Hisop on Saturday night. I cannot fault the cleaning or other services either. The toiletries in the bahroom also contained complimentary toothpaste and shaving kit, which was a nice touch, now when you have all these flight hand luggage restrictions on liquids and sharp objects. If you can afford it, this is the ultimate choice.

<Content>chic Lots of positives and the location is excellent. but overpriced and on our stay, the breakfast/restaurant staff couldn't cope with the numbers ... Offered a free lunch on the charming roof top terrace pool area which was lovelyCertainly a quiet retreat from the bustling traffic outside the door...

<Content>Perfect location to explore barcelona My wife and I had the opportunity to visit Barcelona recently without the children, and so I wanted to book a quality hotel that would not disappoint. I chose the hotel 1898 mainly based upon tripadvisor reviews and we thought the hotel was absolutely fabulous.The location is as near perfect as you could find being on La Rambla. It is convenient to the Plaza de Catalunya which has the departure point for the two tourist bus companies as well as shops and restaurants. La Rambla is always extremely busy but the hotel althought located on this street is like an oasis from the bussle of the throngs of people. Indeed when relaxing in the lobby of the hotel it is hard to imagine that outside it is so busy.There were two things we particularily enjoyed at the hotel. The first was the rooftop terrace. People in their reviews constantly refer to this terrace but it really is that good. The views were outstanding and it is so relaxing. The second thing we enjoyed was the spa in the basement: what a lovely way to enjoy an hour or indeed two. The spa was very clean and tidy and in the pool area the jacuzzi beds and water jets were so much fun.We booked a superior room and my first impression was that it was a little bit smaller than I had imagined. However the quality of the room was evident to see in both the fittings and style of the room. The bed was very wide and there was a choice of four types of pillow. The room had a sound system that gave a choice of continuous music to whatever type you found relaxing as well as a lighting system that allowed to select for different moods/requirements which I found quite good.The reception staff were helpful in chosing restaurants and had books showing the decor and menus of several. We chose one called Barkeno and if you like fish I can highly recommend it . It is also within walking distance of the hotel.The hotel is not inexpensive but if you are looking for a good 4 star hotel then in this location it is well worth the expense. I certainly would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great location, roof pool and stylish rooms - poor service I chose 1898 on the basis on TripAdvisor reviews and as usual was not disappointed - the location, just off Las Ramblas near Placa Catalunya is central and excellent. The hotel is quirky and full of history but styled recently very similar to the Hotel du Vin chain in the UK (good). The hotel is clean and well appointed and rooms are (for city centre) well sized with air conditioning in room, free internet, and good bathroom.The staff I met did slightly let down the hotel. I realise they are full all year, deal with tourists and transient business travellers every minute of every day, but regardless, they are in the service business and the couldn't care less disinterested attitude to any question (neither complaints or compliments) in both English or Spanish, was the only thing that let this otherwise excellent hotel down.Didn't try any hotel food at all - this is Barcelona and there are great restaurants (try Barceloneta for fish or Comer莽 24 for tapas). Would I go back - yes - so that says it all.

<Content>Overall two thumbs up for Hotel 1898 Hotel 1898 is a unique, trendy property in the heart of the action, Las Ramblas.We booked the hotel for three nights starting Monday April 28th. We didn鈥檛 arrive until 4:15 PM and so the 3 pm check-in time was a non-issue. We had reserved a superior room and we were given Room 445, facing Las Ramblas. - Ok, so for those that have commented on the noise factor in past posts and for those who may be concerned about this 鈥?it is a real issue if you have a room facing Las Ramblas. When we checked in, I specifically asked if the room faced Las Ramblas and was told yes, to be fair. I asked for a different room facing another street but was told there were none available. The noise was not a factor on Monday evening or Tuesday evening 鈥?keep in mind we were out until 2 AM or so ourselves and once we hit the pillow we immediately passed out! So, no worries there. On our last evening, we were in bed quite early by Barcelona standards 鈥?11 PM 鈥揳nd by now it was Wed of course. There was constant noise all night long and admittedly it was pretty loud at times 鈥?seemed like there was an actual rave happening down on the street below! My fianc茅 and I laughed it off in the morning 鈥?it wouldn鈥檛 keep us from staying there again 鈥?for reference we are thirty-somethings who aren鈥檛 terribly conservative but don鈥檛 party until dawn anymore either. Another point on the noise 鈥?the Metro runs underneath the hotel (at least it feels like it must) 鈥?every 15 to 30 minutes you can feel the train passing by鈥eels like a 1 or 2 on the Richter scale actually. Did we sleep through that every night? Absolutely. Did you wonder what the hell it was the first or second time it happened? You bet. On to the wonderful traits of Hotel 1898鈥he lobby and rooms are of spectacular design and feel. The designer did a great job of combining modern amenities with an Asian twist (building housed the old Filipino tobacco company in case you didn鈥檛 know). The lobby is amazing, complete with a sitting area and bar. The dark hardwood floors and green/black color scheme is really cool. Room 445 is a Superior Room and provided considerable more space than a standard room (we peaked into a standard room being cleaned as we walked by). There were two twin beds pushed together to form a double which was a little annoying. Another negative was no iron in the room. As an American I think we just needed to get used to this concept, that's all. However like Casa Fuster we checked through Travelocity and assumed there were irons in the room - not the case. Anyway, I digress.I know a couple of other reviews talked about things being stolen from the room - a non-issue with us although we used the in-room safe religiously. The bathroom was very nice with rainfall showerhead, bidet and toiletries. My fiance liked the full length mirror against the bathroom door as well as mirrors above the bathroom sink and behind you on the back wall. Altogether we were very pleased with the room. It had a nice layout and was very clean and stylish. The rooftop terrace is awesome 鈥?a pool slightly larger than that of Casa Fuster鈥檚 (where we stayed prior to the Hotel 1898) and a bar on the rooftop with posh, comfortable seating all around. Definitely a huge plus.The basement spa and exercise facility are also quite nice. Compared to Casa Fuster this was far superior. The exercise room had 2 treadmills, 2 bikes, a stairmaster and a weight bench with some dumbbells. The basement pool was more of a spa pool with a couple of jaccuzzi-type massage chairs and a few shower-type waterfalls. There is a sauna and a steam room as well as two showers. One can also book massage although we opted not to do so. We certainly enjoyed the basement pool on two different occasions in the afternoon after a long day of walking. The service of the staff was definitely above average. However, keep in mind we had just come from the Casa Fuster where service was far superior. Hotel 1898 staff just weren't quite as overly accomodating is all, although we didn't find fault with anyone at all. As I posted in my Casa Fuster review, it was more of a 'we provide the info, you do the work type of scenario. The staff did book a taxi for a 6:30 AM departure upon checkout without issue. Location, location, location. Noise comments aside, one cannot beat the location of Hotel 1898 if being in the thick of the action is your thing. The hotel is right across the street from Le Meridien and, although we didn't go inside and although Le Meridien has recently been renovated, Hotel 1898 certainly appears to have trumped the Le Meridien. More importantly, the hotel is 5 minutes or less from La Boqueria, 5 mins from the Barri Gottic (if that), and perhaps 10-15 minutes to Born. We loved this about the hotel. By the way, we never felt the least bit unsafe leaving/returning to the hotel. It was a sanctuary from all the action going on just outside the front and side doors. We would definitely stay at the Hotel 1898 again. A very cool place.

<Content>Hotel 1898='Perfection' in Spanish We had just one night to spend in Barcelona and wanted a central location and comfort to recover from jetlag, flying in from NY in the morning to start a month-long trip. Hotel 1898 was perfect on all counts; our room was ready when we arrived mid-morning, the decor was sophisticated, the room was super-comfortable, the personnel welcoming and the location perfect for walking everywhere. We hope to return to Barcelona and 1898 would be the perfect choice once again.Trip Advisor was the source of our choice and we much appreciate the time people took to write their reviews once home.

<Content>Best hotel ever! The Hotel 1898 was amazing. Every detail in the hotel is incredible, starting with the gorgeous rooftop bar, amazing spa/bath facilities, and non-stop Charlie Chaplin movies playing in the stunning lobby. The staff was terrific, the beds huge and comfortable. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. I literally had not a single complaint (and I'm a difficult, picky traveler!). Just book it!

<Content>Avoid but... The hotel is nice and the spot is ideal: you're IN the city. But the service is totally different with so many rooms for improvement it became not acceptable. Room cleaning was not done at 4:30pm! Room cleaning involves your active action: there is always something missing! Spa really need to be cleaned (avoid the hammam). Breakfast service is unefficient say rude and even if food is abudant, avoid quality. Do you want an umbrella, they do not have - Do insist: they have some! And finally, rooms are really noisy! The price is the one of a 5stars in BCN. But you pay for the place as the service is an up-3stars. Prefer the Neri or Le M茅ridien or, for excellent service: La Florida or the Arts (but then forget the city!).

<Content>Fantastic hotel Stayed in this hotel in Sept 07, choosing it after seeing it was located right on Las Ramblas, and No1 on Trip Advisor for Barcelona. Never got round to reviewing it, partly because it was just as good as everyone said and there was nothing to add. But now I see it has slipped to No3 - probably because other people who loved it thought the same! So I have to set the records straight and say just how fab it is!!!Stayed here for two nights at the beginning of a cruise starting from Barcelona, and for one night at the end. The rooms were great and exceptionally well equipped. Luxury bathrobe, cute 1898 monogrammed slippers, and lovely toiletries come as standard. Also welcome was a kettle and tea making facilities (so rare in Europe), as well as very useful fridge, safe etc. Beds were huge and very comfy, and the bathroom with state of the art shower was also fab. The lobby with its huge seating area and ground floor bar are a great place to relax, and lovely and cool in contrast to the heat of Las Ramblas outside. But the highlight has to be the open air roof terrace with fantastic views of Barcelona, rooftop pool (small but great for cooling off), roof top bar and a huge range of sunbeds, al fresco four poster 'beds' (yes really!), sofas etc. A stunning place to relax with a drink, or a book, or even take a snooze - day, evening or night. There is also a basement indoor spa which we only looked at briefly, but would be a great place to relax during a winter stay. The dining room also looked inviting although we didn't sample its fare, and breakfast looked great but wasn't cheap (so if you are a breakfast fan look for a breakfast inclusive package).We also loved Las Ramblas - don't expect the chic of Paris or you will be disappointed. But for buzz and atmosphere its hard to beat - a huge range of bars and resturants, street entertainers and market stalls leading down to the port. Nearby squares are inviting, with yet more resturants and some great shops and tapas bars - the Calamari seemed to be consistently fantastic wherever we tried it. And the huge glasses of Sangria have to be seen to be believed!! On the waterfront (just at the bottom of Las Ramblas, turn left when you reach the water and walk for about ten minutes) there are some fabulous seafood resturants, and a great bar situated on a boat which is a stunning place for an early evening drink. From here its only fifteen minutes walk or so to the beach; the close proximity of beach and city is one of many things that make Barcelona so unique. Here there are another huge range of resturants to choose from - our favourite undoubtedly the Carpe Diem Lounge Bar - yet more al fresco 'beds' where you can sit and lounge with your drink and even eat dinner - totally surreal!! And from here its only another ten minutes or so walk to the Olympic Marina with a huge range of resturants and nightclubs - and a taxi rank to get back to the hotel if your feet aren't up for the walk home! Other things we loved included Gaudi Park - amazing architecture and fabulous views over the city. A bit of a walk from the nearest underground stop but well worth it. We also loved the sensational Fountain of Montjuic that does a fabulous 'Sound and Light' show around 9pm every Thursday to Sunday evening in Summer (Fri and Sat in Winter) - nearest Metro stop Placa Espanya. And finally no visit to Barcelona would be compete without visiting the Sagardia Familia and taking the lift to the top. This unfinished cathederal is simply unique - a truly amazing place. Its difficult to describe just why its so good; you just have to go there and see!!! Queues for the lift were long when we were there, but worth every minute of the wait.Overall I can only highly recommend both Barcelona and Hotel 1898. Only one disadvantage. When you say to a taxi driver at the Airport or wherever you would like to go to 'Hotel Eighteen Ninety Eight' they look at you completely blankly - since of course it woud be said completely differently in Spanish!! So unless your Spanish is excellent, have a pen and a piece of paper to hand - as soon as you write down 1898 they get it straight away!!!

<Content>Nice hotel, well-situated We spent three nights at H1898. We wanted a top-end establishment in the heart of the touristy part of the city, and we picked the 1898, well, to be honest, because of the tripadvisor reviews - I think it was no. 1 in popularity at the time of booking! The reception was slightly disappointing - in spite of my having given my credit card details when booking, the clerk insisted on taking a photocopy of the card, something I have never encountered before. The room (we took a 'superior' room) was superbly furnished (it must have cost a bomb to kit out!), with mahogany furniture, exotic parquet flooring and a gorgeous all-marble bathroom. Everything was spanking new, and not a sign of shabbiness anywhere. I particularly liked the lighting 'modules', whereby you can choose a programme such as 'Welcome', 'Ambience', Read', or 'Night'; I wish I had installed such modules when recently building our house, but had never heard of them or imagined them before. At night the room was quite noisy. This didn't bother us as we wanted a room right on La Rambla, and sleep well through noise; but the window was ill-fitting, and it sounded as though it was open all the time. The hotel could well do a bit of work on soundproofing, which could be far more effective. The bed was very comfortable, but I could have done with sheets and blankets rather than duvets, which are far too hot (I often end up taking the duvet out and sleeping under its cover only). The bathroom was luxurious as I have said, but why only one tiny cake of soap? It looks mean amidst all the luxury. The bath taps were complicated to work out: there were three of them, all with different functions, and the porter could have given an explanation when he brought the bags up. The service at reception was excellent (although we only asked for restaurant bookings in town a couple of times). Otherwise the reception staff were perfectly helpful and friendly.The spa was delightful (although I was hoping for a jacuzzi temperature!). We didn't check the roof terrace and pool as it was far too cold. Breakfast was fine, but perhaps a trifle dear. We had the small breakfast: coffee, tea or chocolate with ready-made salami sandwiches, or croissants and pastries, for 鈧?. The large breakfast (strangely called 'continental' - which for me is a limited meal) looked excellent, but very expensive (鈧?0 I think) and we didn't want to fill ourselves up before lunch.I was disappointed by the fact that there was nowhere (apart from outside on the roof) that I could smoke. Most hotels have a smoking room or you can smoke in the bar, but I was banished to a sleazy bar in the Pla莽a Reial to indulge my naughty habit (I can hear righteous non-smokers cheering). But there seems to be no reason why the beautiful and unused marble hall giving on to the side-entrance (La Rambla entrance) should not be set aside for smokers. The situation is perfect for the tourist, being smack in La Rambla, and almost everything you want is within not unreasonable walking distance (Park Gu毛ll apart).The price is perfectly normal and reasonable for what the hotel is - no arguments there.All in all a good experience, and tripadvisor's reviewers were absolutely right. We would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Brilliant hotel This is an excellent hotel in a fantastic location. Very stylish hotel set in the old Filipine Tobacco company building. The hotel is on La Rambla, the most famous street in Spain. We had a standard double room and were more than happy with our choice.The only negative comment is that they strictly stick to the 3.00pm check in time which potentially can be a problem if you arrive early. The best thing to do is to pack your swimming gear in your hand luggage and head to the 7th floor of the hotel 鈥?there you will find a heated swimming pool, changing rooms, towels as well as sun loungers, a bar which also serves lunch, wide relaxing chairs and fantastic views of Barcelona.You will not regret staying here.

<Content>Give us a break Charlie Hill, Cork Ireland.Stayed two nights 8th and 9th April 2008The hotel is well situated, clean with a good mix of old and new decor, The Spa and indoor pool are very good.However, do not accept allocation of room 522 if at all possible.On the morning of the 10thApril, at 8 A.M. it became the noisiest hotel room in Barcelona, the noise coming from the corridor outside our door and it was impossible to have a lie in. It rather spoiled our impression of the Hotel, we will not be going back.

<Content>Hotel 1898--Outstanding My daughters (ages 15  20) and I stayed three nights in this exceptional hotel last week. It is wonderful. The decor is beautiful, the service is friendly and competent. The rooms are very nice with the key feature being fabulous bathrooms. We really liked the terrace bar on the 7th floor, among the most inviting places to relax that I've ever enjoyed. The looby bar is quiet and relaxing as well. We ate at the restaurant one night, rather than venturing out into the rain, and really enjoyed the food and the professional service. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Amazing Escape When we first arrived, we were not that excited. Had to carry our bags across Las Rambas ( a zoo) and came in the door off Las Ramblas....not greating. And checked into the room- seems small. HOWEVER, as we stayed, and explored and got to know the staff, and the restaurant and the business center and the QUALITY of all of the amenities and service, it became one of my most favorite hotels in the world. I think because it is just off Las Ramblas, the lobby is even more inviteing- a peaceful retreat from the crazy street. Was absolutly worth every penny.

<Content>Very good Very good experience. Stayed there for a long weekend with my wife. The hotel room was great (I had a privilege room), and the hotel is very conveniently situated (right on La Rambla and very close to Placa Catalunya).On the minuses side, its proximity to La Rambla makes it a bit noisy and you can hear the metro each time it passes by. However, this was not really annoying because I was sufficiently tired after walking through Barcelona to have a good sleep.Don't miss the La Boqueria, which is about 3 minutes walk away.

<Content>Brilliant - highly recommend Stayed here over the weekend 28-31st. Had brilliant stay.Highlights included: - spa - open till 9pm - complimentary water and fully equipped gym - pool on the roof - little chilly in March - but beautiful! - beautiful bedroom with pillow selection - location looking into Atrium - very peaceful - fabulous location - supermarket on Ramblas 1 min away and all shops and bars easy walking distance.Overall highly recommend this place and would definitely go back. Tip - get the free train from the airport to the central and then get taxi or walk for amazing views in! Otherwise bus (for 4.10Euros) gets you to Plaza central - 2 mins walk from the hotel.Please contact if you want anymore tips!

<Content>Loved the Spa We loved the spa! The water was warm w/ massaging waterfalls, a sauna and steam room. We spent a couple hours each night we were there relaxing in the pool. Definitely the highlight of the stay. The location is amazing, right on the Rambla but the rooms were still quiet. The rooms themselves were a good size - enough room to spread out, the bathroom was large with a great shower/tub! The only draw-back of the stay was the bed. Not comfortable at all and surprising in such a nice hotel to have such sub-par sleeping accomadations. The roofdeck was gorgeous. Unfortunately, it was a bit chilly when we were there so we weren't able to take advantage of the outdoor pool, but it gives us reason to come back again in the summer:) The staff was polite and very helpful with restaurant and store recommendations. Everything about our stay was fabulous. Besides the bed, I would have upped my overall rating to excellent.

<Content>A perfect hotel for room only Stayed four nights here and loved the location ,comfort and cleanliness of this hotel.We booked a superior room and it was quite a good size.I think all the superior rooms overlook the Rambles,and even though the windows have excellent double glazing it can be a bit noisey.The housekeeping was excellent,and the sheets were changed daily and towels twice daily.The first morning we ordered a continental breakfast to our room and it was quite good .The next morning it came it seemed as if it had been prepared the night before.We ate out the next morning(and there are plenty of coffee shops etc.minutes from the hotel)On the morning before we came home we had the restuarant breakfast at 21 euros.For a cold breakfast it was okay but the bacon and scrambled egg were just on cold trays.My husband ordered an omlette and it was more like a burnt fried egg! I wouldn't let the food stop me returning to this hotel as there are so many excellent eating places beside it.I loved everything else about the hotel and would stay here again if we return to Barcelona

<Content>very romantic place to stay but be careful !! my girlfriend and i went to the hotel 1898 for a 5 day stay and it was all what we wanted !! it was so romantic and the staff there were lovely apart from one member of staff at the bar ! but that doesn't matter, the thing we loved was the fact that we were in the middle of the most amazing city and all that hustle and bustle outside but you would never know which is great if you want to relax!!the only problem we had with the hotel was that we booked a deluxe room which we didn't end up staying in as the room it self was very small and the balcony only had a brick wall and no view so we didn't fancy looking at the wall for days so we asked to be moved, with it being busy they only had superior room which i would like to add was great it didn't have a balcony but it had two windows that opened up onto the great sound and views of la ramblas and the room was a lot bigger then the first room!! we would without a doubt book this type of room again also we were impressed the way the room was cleaned twice a day ,we only had breakfast once at the hotel which was nice but not great as we tend to like English breakfast however there is still a lot to choose from we also had dinner which was really nice but plz be warned a medium cooked steak is more like rare cooked steak in England so if u don't like blood be warned !!!if u want a great place to eat with a lovely romantic view try totre dell mar in port vell ask Dani in the reception of 1898 he will book it for you.(hes great)if you book this hotel or any other hotels in Barcelona plz watch your bags and wallets as mine was stolen while we were site seeing but we still had a great time and would return to this great city in a flash there's so much to see and do but i wouldn't take children here as we would say its a adults holiday .

<Content>Great location poor food noisy rooms The hotel has a terrific location, and the building and decor are superb. Our room was rather small, and almost windowless (just a very small window at one end) and whilst the bathroom was excellent, the room itself attracted all the corridor noise - especially tiresome when (after our 12 hour flight) the domestic staff started loudly and energetically cleaning the rooms at 7.15 am. The staff were pleasant and helpful, but the breakfast, although abundant, was poorly maintained - hot items eg.scrambled egs, bacon etc. were left to go cold, and bread was left to go stale. Worse, room service delivered exceptionally poor food - salad that had obviously sat for hours, fish that was old and oily, stale rolls, and an inedible hamburger. The cuisine of this hotel is distinctly poor, and more attention should be paid to sound proofing the rooms.

<Content>Amazing Experience, Perfect Honeymoon! Absolutely wonderful stay. They upgraded us to a room with a deck b/c it was our honeymoon to start which we very much appreciated. The room was wonderful, very modern with a beautiful deck where we spent a lot of time. The decor was very modern, more like the Omni than the Ritz. The location in Las Ramblas is PERFECT. Right in the middle so you can either walk up to Placa Catalunya, walk across to the Gothic Quarter, or walk down to the water. We love to walk so this was the best location as we walked to many places from here such as the Picasso Museum and La Padrera.Our routine was to run around the city, come back and sunbathe on the gorgeous roof deck, then take a dip in the roof pool or go to the basement where they have an awesome grotto like pool. The roof was even better at night to grab a drink with some ambient lighting and views of the city. Front desk was helpful with food recommendations and how to get places. Everything about the hotel was beautiful. Very nice staff. I hope to go back to Barcelona one day, and if I do, I can't imagine staying anywhere else.

<Content>A jewel in the center of old-world Barcelona.......! We realize this review is almost two years late, but like they say, better late than never.My wife and I stayed at the 1898 for 9 nights in April, 2006, and found this hotel exceeded every expectation we had based on other reviews and their web site. It was located right in the middle of the old city, had an understated elegance, and the staff could not be more informed, helpful and professional. The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable and had gorgeous marble bathrooms. The decor was also nicely done and high quality materials could be found throughout the hotel. As well, the bar located in the lobby was a nice place to unwind after a long day touring, and the bartender made us the best Sangria we had ever had. Our rooms were located on the inside of the htel, overlooking a beautiful atrium, and were very quiet.Overall, a fantastic experience!

<Content>Excellent staff and beautiful surrondings I chose this hotel from reviews I had read and was not disappointed. The staff are excellent in a really understated way and I hope they are well thought of due to their wonderful presentation and manner. I loved the bed, the pillows, the pools and the wonderful location. I loved the style of the hotel, very old world. I cannot say enough about it, I loved it.

<Content>An oasis from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas we were there for a long weekend and the location and standard of the hotel made the weekend for us.It was great to be able to walk off the Ramblas straight into the hotel, where peace and tranquillity was the order.The staff were both courteous and efficient and the bar service was excellent.Some may consider the rooms on the small side, but they are furnished and decorated to a very high standard and to be fair, you will not spend a lot of time in them if you want to take in all the sights and experiences Barcelona has to offer.I have recommended the hotel to both family and friends and will definately stay here again on our next visit.

<Content>weekend brake we went 2 couples away for a extended weekend getaway, and wanted too bee in the middle of it all, wee wanted at the same time too be in a place where things seemed too be of a good standard.Everything was perfect, the rooms-especialy the restaurant that you have too try, expencive but worth it, the spa area and swimmingpool is built in true harmony too the concept, as well as the decoration all around, the bar is a plecent place too spend an hour or two.We have stayed a lot of places around the world, and this hotel takes the cake. Eapecially because they have succeded with the story and athomespfere.

<Content>Excellent except the front desk The hotel 1898 is ideally located on the Ramblas. It has been beautifully refurbished. Rooms are nice, privilege rooms are superb. Everything is 4 stars level except the front desk. During our both stays in this hotel, we were disappointed by the low level and the lack of friendliness of the staff at the front desk. The service you are expecting from a 4 stars level is nil. Examples : You need tickets for the Opera (Liceu) : it is at walking distance, do it yourself. Ordering a taxi 2 hours ahead for the dinner on 31st December : take the metro, it is not possible. Ask for a small hour late check out time on the first January : impossible. It is rather hostel style than 4* level. Pity because it is the only weak point. Fortunately very unusual in this category of hotels in Barcelona.

<Content>Very Nice but expensive We stayed at this hotel from Boxing day to 31st Dec. We satyed in a deluxe room with roof terrace which was lovely. It was very quiet as it was located at the back of the hotel. The terrace was a great little sun trap (even in winter) and I imagine would be lovely to sunbathe on in summer. It was a fairly good size room, although for the prize some might consider a little small. The bathroom was very compact, although very nicely done in marble with a good range of extras provided. Toothpaste, vanity set, shaving kit, shampoo ( no conditioner though) and hairdryer. The entrance and bar area in the hotel are very plush and it certainly feels like a top class hotel. It's location matches this, right on La Rambla, perfect walking distance to many sights and great shops/cafes. You may need to use the buses/metro for some places but again the main plaza is just a 5 min walk away where you can access these links and very cheaply.We ordered room service which was excellent. The bar is nice but very pricey. Barcelona itself is fantastic and we would certainly return. Try the cable cars (there are 2) and Sagrada familia is a must see.Hope you enjoy as much we did!

<Content>Truly Wonderful This was our first trip to Spain and we used concierge.com to obtain info about the best hotels in Spain. Barcelona was our first stop there and our stay at 1898 was absolutely wonderful! The rooms were beautiful with both modern and traditional design. The bathrooms were large with a large shower. We were centrally located to all of the sites and right on La Rambla. We were able to walk to almost all places (esp. if you like walking). We would definitely stay here again if we were to return to Barcelona. Stan  Jo

<Content>Great Hotel!! We went to Barcelona for our wedding anniversary. We chose this hotel after reading the reviews on here and were not disappointed. The location is excellent right on La Rambla, but the rooms (or at least our room) are still very quiet, we couldn鈥檛 hear the street at all. We paid extra for a 鈥渄eluxe鈥?room which was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but still very nice with everything you needed. The spa area was also very good with a small pool, jacuzzi鈥檚, sauna and steam room. This was great after a busy day sightseeing.I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed for 3 nights over New Year, it was our second trip to Barcelona, and as we had such a great stay at the 1898 last time we stayed there again.We could only get a Standard room this time, but whilst the room was noticably smaller, it was still very nice.Everything about the hotel was just as good as our first visit.Still don't like the 3pm check-in, but our room was available at 1-30pm, so no complaints.Wanted to add a short review of a Restaurant called El Choquito, it is on Las Ramblas on the opposite side to the hotel, about 70 yards closer to the port, our experience was terrible, the service was awful, the food very moderate indeed and the prices very high, so don't go near it, it was a terrible mistake.

<Content>Lovely Hotel My husband and I have just come back from a 2-night stay at the 1898 Hotel. It is a lovely hotel and the location is really ideal. We had a standard bedroom, and it was lovely. A bit small, maybe, but really nicely decorated, very clean...and I loved the light switch!The good thing was that the room was very quiet, as it was at the back of the hotel.The breakfast was quite expensive...but you were spoilt for choice, and let's face it, it is not everyday that you can have smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and champagne for breakfast.I would definitely go back!

<Content>Incredible Hotel !! We stayed in the Colonial suite and was worth every single Euro. The room and hotel was one of the best we have ever stayed in (The hotel Intercontinental in Hong Kong was as good) . We intend to go back and stay again. The rooms swimming pool was too cold but that was changed as soon as we asked. Do yourself a favor and book the Colonial suite.Dennis Burkhartsmeier

<Content>the best value for the money in BCN I spent 4 nights in Barcelona following ThanksGiving a few weeks ago. Two of those were spent at the Hotel 1898 and I have to say that I would have spent my entire stay but they did not have availability for all four nights 鈥?unless of course you count the Colonial Suite for 1500 Euro a night, which is 鈥?regretfully 鈥?outside my budget for Barcelona.I also spent two nights at the Casa Fuster which was also very nice, but much more expensive than the 1898. In the end, although I liked the Casa Fuster better than the 1898, I really cannot fault the later for very much. Although the hotel truly falls short of a 5-star property, it is probably the best value in Barcelona 鈥?euro for euro 鈥?hands down.I had a Superior room which was large, comfortable, and contained a number of great amenities. I also really enjoyed the 鈥渕aritime鈥?themed decore that was echoed throughout the hotel. Instead of cheesy hotel art there where nautical charts, maps, and old photographs aThere was a fairly large marble bathroom with a full bathtub. It鈥檚 definitely not the most luxurious bathroom I have seen, but it did the job and was certainly spacious enough for one person. Although there were two sinks, you really had to squeeze to accommodate the second person. Most noteworthy was the 鈥渁utomated鈥?lighting system. I have seen this many times before, at other hotels but I was really impressed with it at the 1898. One button turns all the lights on, one turns them all off, one keeps the bathroom lights on and a small 鈥渘ightlight鈥?and there are modes for TV watching, reading, and more. Other hotels attempt to do this but I always find myself manually turning on various lamps, unplugging others, and generally cannot seem to make use of the automated lighting features. I also got to make use of the indoor pool which I absolutely loved. I never made it to the gym section 鈥?which was small but stocked with a few treadmills, elliptical machines, bikes and light free-wieghts. While I was swimming I noticed a number of people using the equipment 鈥?so people do actually get good use out of the gym. This whole section looked like it had just completed renovation and looked brand new, swimming in the indoor pool as the temperature outside dropped a few degrees every day was a dream. I did not make it to the rooftop pool but it looks fantastic from the other trip advisor pictures. There is a bar up there in the summertime, but it was closed at the end of November when I was staying there.The breakfast was also standard 4-star fare. I did notice a number of exotic fruits like dragon fruit and passion fruit which I wasn鈥檛 expecting to find but for 19 Euro a person I can鈥檛 say it was any better or worse than your standard over-priced hotel continental breakfast. I wouldn鈥檛 pay for the breakfast again. One evening after I was tired from a full day of sight seeing and wanting to rest before heading out for drinks, I decided to eat dinner in the main restaurant of the hotel rather than head out. I walked in at 8:45 and there was not a single person there. Just 2 or 3 bored waiters. Needless to say, I walked right out and went to the restaurant next door to the hotel 鈥?I think it was called 鈥?11.鈥?I wish I would have avoided the hotel鈥檚 restaurant b/c seeing it empty like that left me with a disappointed feeling about the hotel in general. Although the 1898 offers so much for the money, I don鈥檛 believe it really could be a truly deluxe 5-star property. Although everything was very nice, it was obvious where a few liberties had been taking in order to save money and be able to offer the value. The furnishings had this low-cost feel to them, almost like what IKEA would offer if they went the maritime traditional look. Sure, it looks great in a catalog and on a website, and at the end of the day it gets the job done, but there are certainly better options (for more money, of course). My biggest complaint however were the towels in the bathroom. Although there were many of them and the bath towels were extremely large, they felt like towels you are given at the local gym when working out. Either they had been washed way too much or I have been spending too much time at the Four Seasons and have gotten used to soft towels. I don鈥檛 know. How hard could it be to provide soft towels? And speaking of the Four Seasons, I thought the mattress could have been a bit softer, but I find that firmer (and slimmer) mattresses are the norm in Europe and so this was not unexpected.I should say that the choice of pillows was a very nice touch thought I did not have an opportunity to take advantage of it.Although I have gone on and nit-picked a little above and I have decided not to give the 1898 5-out-of-5, I want everyone to know that the above negatives are totally minor. I would stay at the 1898 again a thousand times! It is the perfect choice for a hotel on the Ramblas. It is so close to Placa Catalunya and a perfect starting point from which to enjoy the city. There is even a Starbuck鈥檚 attached to the lobby for all those who are homesick but want to avoid McDonalds et al. 鈥?but watch out: At a worse than $1.50/Euro exchange rate on the street, those white chocolate mochas will cost you dearly 鈥?as will everything else. The old adage 鈥測ou get what you pay for鈥?is certainly true, if you want a truly deluxe experience, 225 Euro per night for a superior room will simply not get you there. Instead you get an experience that approximates the 5-star deluxe hotel which for most 鈥?and at those fantastic prices, is more than enough.

<Content>Perfect !! This hotel was a pleasant surprise having spent some time looking for a hotel for a few days to chill out. I can honestly say there wasn't anything I could say bad about this hotel, it was perfect. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The whole layout, decor, efficiency of the staff was second to none. Very clean and well maintained. It was central to everything. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Lovely hotel, very modern. The reception area is lovely, nice bar  lovely big couches to lounge on  have a drink.Our room was really nice, a bit small, but it was spotless clean. Huge bed, bday in the bathroom. The pool area is really nice  relaxing, it is also a bit small, but really nice. Sauna  steam room also.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it is right on Las Ramblas, but be careful, as there are lots of pick pockets  lots of ladies of the night approching men, not shy about it at all.

<Content>Amazing Hotel This is a truely fantastic hotel - one of the best we've ever stayed. Its plush but not pretentious and the decor is fabulous. We ended up in Barcelona by accident (budget airline problems at Stansted) and had only planned to stay one night - this hotel was so good we stayed for three. Both the roof top pool, bar and four poster loungers and the pool/spa in the cavernous basement of the hotel cannot help but induce a state of total relaxation. What a find and worth every penny.

<Content>Stay here for its calm efficiency From the moment you push though the revolving door off the Rambla till you wake in the morning, peace and tranquility reign at this lovely hotel. The staff are friendly and have marvellous suggestions for tapas bars and restaurants. The room was spotless and cleaned punctiliously every day of our three night trip. The spa is a welcome treat at the end of a day walking the streets and the view from the roof swimming pool as the sun sets was brilliant even in November (if it was a little chilly out of the pool). We were on a room only basis so cannot comment on the food though there were so many restaurants and bars around that there was no need of hotel food.All in all, a top recommendation for a Barcelona hotel.

<Content>Luxury and tranquility at Hotel 1898 Hotel 1898 is a luxury boutique hotel where attention to detail leaves a lot for its rivals to desire. Reception staff are warm, friendly and helpful. Our classic room was spacious and modern, a real delight. The pillow option is wonderful (try the memory foam option for ultimate comfort) and the ability to change the room lighting with the clever dimmer options is a joy. Rooms are cleaned twice daily, beds turned down in the evening and chocolates left by your bedside. Our room faced the courtyard, a peaceful oasis away from the rustle of Las Ramblas. Ladies, one tip bring your own hairdryer, the hotel suppliers a hairdryer that is too heavy, especially if you have long hair! We didn't opt for the hotel breakfast, there is plenty of choice, with an abundance of local eateries within walking distance (try Vienna for snacks)and Starbucks on the corner. Two tips, flag the taxi on Las Ramblas, taxi's ordered on your behalf incur a 5 euro charge on the meter and eat later than you normally would. The Spanish tend to eat from 9pm onwards. For a fab restaurant with views over the city try [-], its really breathtaking. Really enjoyed my stay but at 199 euro a night plus 7% VAT I expect to! Try it you won't regret it.

<Content>It was the start of a great honeymoon I intially booked a room at the Jazz hotel, but they over booked and sent me to Hotel 1898. What a gorgous hotel. Rooms were a bit small but had much extras. Very comfortable and the location was the best, in the middle of the strip where everythings at. I give the hotel 2 thumbs up if the price doesnt scare you.

<Content>Fantastic Place I work for hotels so I know what I am talking about.I staid 3 nights in the 1898 in Barcelona. I had booked a Superior room by Internet.First of all, the location is great: you can do whatever you want as you are staying in the middle of the Rambla. The hotel has a car carp 5located in the basement) which is very safe and where you won't damage your car.It was not very hard to find the hotel from the highway as you just have to find the city centrer....Check-in: nothing special, nice staff but not very original. All are very elegant. The Lobby looks great: modern, stylish, comfortable ... exactly what you see on the website.The room: it was a Superior Room;, 4th floor. It looks that my room was the only one with a small balcony... nice if you want to have a panoramis view on the Rambla. The room is great: large and comfortable (no surprise if you look at the website). LCD TV on the wall (26 inches), radio, free wifi, 20 international and national channels etc etc...On of the great thing is the 4 programmed ambiances that you can choose for the lignting.... that's nice !!!!!!Bad point: you can hear/feel the underground and some noise of the Rambla, but that was not a big problem for me.Bathroom: nice, complete and modern. I just had an issue with the cold water.... Terrace: roof terrace with heated swimming pool: G R E A TBasement swimmingpool + SPA: G R E A T + G R E A T nothing to pay for the spa except massages and manual treatment. Water beds and swimming pool are so nice !!!!!This 4 star hotel could easily have 5 !!!! A very good address for Barcelona !

<Content>Brilliant hotel! We stayed in the Hotel 1898 for a couple of nights en route from Ibiza to England. Having left home at 5.00 am we arrived at the hotel at 10.30 am and expected to have to wait a few hours to check in. But no, our rooom was ready and we checked in immediately, much to our delight. We had booked a Standard room which we expected to look out onto an internal well, but actually it looked out onto a side street, so was really interesting, but still quiet, given that the hotel is actuallly on La Rambla. The room was gorgeous, with a HUGE bed, and a really well equipped bathroom. Everything in the hotel we sampled (the bar, the spa, the pcs in the library, the room service) was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Add that to the fact that its situation makes it so easy to visit the sights of Barcelona, and I really couldn麓t recommend a better place to stay.Jan  Graham M, Ibiza

<Content>good hotel Very nice, although expensive hotel in the tourist area of Barcelona. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast good, although a long wait for coffee. Public areas had good ambience. Basement pool and sauna area small, but ideal for a relaxing half hour.Only problem we found with the hotel was the noise. Suprisingly, although the hotel is directly on the Ramblas, and our room was above it, the noise did not come from there - rather from guests arriving late and chattering on their way to their rooms! The rumble of the metro was also very noticable on the 4th floor, as another member mentioned.

<Content>Difficult to beat this ! For value for money in Barcelona, this hotel will take some beating.The efficiency and friendliness of the staff; the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms; the facilities and the situation of the 1898 are all beyond reproach.The front-desk and bar personnel all speak perfect English and all the maids, the bell-boy and other staff whose paths we crossed, all greeted us with a smile and a hol脿.The rooms were spotless and the beds very comfortable - you even have a choice of pillow! The bathrooms are wonderful and bathrobes are slippers are at your disposition.The roof-terrace and pool, the basement spa-pool are all to be experienced. The bar area abounds with comfortable sofas. The hotel is right on the Ramblas, very close to the Liceu metro station.We will return here as we loved our stay - you will feel the same.

<Content>Loved the hotel and its location Booked this hotel for 3 nights shortly before our US departure based on the many favorable reviews. The Hotel succeeded in exceeding our high expectations! We arrived late evening after a longer than planned trip from Madrid. We were warmly welcomed and immediately put at ease. The Hotel is located right on La Rambla however it is a world away in the peace and tranquility inside. Our rooms (superior) were small but so well designed that size wasn't a factor; they were extremely comfortable and quiet. Staff were available and very friendly and helpful. The roof top offers a beautiful view of the city and though it was too cool for us to swim in the pool, we did enjoy a drink at the bar while we watched the sunset over Barcelona. The Hotel location is perfect and we walked everywhere. Can't say enough about how positive our experience was!

<Content>Outstanding hotel Hotel 1898 is outstanding and even after decades of business and leisure travel qualifies for one of my personal 'top ten'. The decor is an exciting blend of old (it's the 1898-built HQ of a colonial tobacco company) and new - sensitively and stylishly brought right into the 21st century with a blend of Scandinavian style and top notch interior decoration with great attention to detail. The rooms have almost every possible facility - and we stayed in the cheapest (interior view rooms are actually best if you want a quiet night). Plasma screen TV - even in-room tea/coffee making facilities - rare in Europe outside the UK. Rooftop heated outdoor pool with a view to die for over the city. Indoor cellar pool, spa and sauna - all free. Service immaculate - friendly, helpful and unfailingly courteous. Position ideal for the tourist - right on Las Ramblas and a very short walk from Plaza Catalunya (metro, airport buses, tourist info and tour buses). I can't comment on the food as we ate out - spoilt for choice in Barcelona. This is not the cheapest hotel - but by no means the most expensive and great value for money if you want a little treat. I am usually super-critical but can find little to fault here - and I have absolutely no connection of any kind with the hotel!

<Content>H 1898 is superb Stayed 2 nights in a Superior room (on the net it says Deluxe) which is well worth it as it looks out to the Ramblas with a step out balcony (normal rooms are a little on the small side).Unfortunately, the Metro's rumbling noise can be heard  felt on the 4th floor. The Spa is small but lovely, roof top bar closes at the end of Oct. though the warm, small (more a plunge) pool is still available. Amazing views  lots of large loungers all around the roof to relax on. Staff is professional  on the ball. The bar lacks a bit in speed - you wait  wait  wait if there are 2 people being served before you. Excellent b/fast buffet in a very large, swish b/fast area. It comes at a price though but if you're willing to pay for an excellent hotel....We have booked again already !

<Content>Brilliant location, terrific style I booked 1898 for a 3 night stay with my teenage daughter. This is the first time I have used trip advisor to find a hotel and will definately use it again. I have never written a review before and would not do so had I not been a)grateful to all the other reviewers who advised 1898 and b)been so impressed with the hotel.The location of 1898 is brilliant. It is right on La Rambla so within walking distance of many of the sights. It is also within easy walking distance of Placa de Catalunya which is where public transport departs for the airport.The hotel has a terrific mixture of old and new style. It is housed in the old Phillipines Tobacco Company building yet has been modernised with a contemporary feel. Plenty of old polished wood and leather armchairs, mixed with black, white and red furnishings. Lots of nice touches such as heated mirrors in the bathroom, different automatic light settings etc. Quite unlike anywhere else I have stayed. (We even remarked on the style of the black and white stone stairs when we walked to our room rather than taking the lift!)The rooftop pool is heated so we were swimming in it in October! And the view from the terrace is fantastic (shame it is not open longer hours in the winter...we would have liked to have seen the view late at night as well). There is also an indoor pool and fitness area in the vault downstairs.This is described as a luxury hotel which it certainly is. However, I thought it was extremely good value. I would have expected to pay at least 50% more for something similar (if it existed) in England. Even more than that in London.Overall we were very impressed with the hotel and would definately go back.

<Content>Style and luxury on the Ramblas I have just come back from 4 nights at the 1898. I relied on the comments and ratings from Tripadvisor and they were spot on: The superior room is easily big enough for all but (possibly ?) the North American market, which does after all like things really BIG. The hotel bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Normally I long to be back in my own bed, but this one was just perfectly comfortable - not too hard and not too soft. Very dark curtains means you can sleep all morning and not realise it! (yes, I did...)Dimming room lighting: bit of a gimmick, but very nice touch once you get used to itLinen was crisp and heavy cotton, and changed daily. Towels were changed twice daily (dont go here if you are an eco-warrior!)Shower and bath taps: I noted the comments on TA: its really not rocket science - there is one dial for temperature, one for shower/bath tap, and one for small shower head on sep pipe. There is no need for further instructions, IMHONoise: had a room overlooking ramblas (room 444). Could hear some noise through double glazing (occasional police siren, some traffic) but never enough to disturb or prevent sleep. Benefits of overlooking ramblas outweigh noise problem. If you're a VERY light sleeper, go for internal room. Spa and pools: superb. Dark cellar pool was atmospheric, roof terrace pool superb location with view of city. Roof terrace probably comes into its own in the summer months, though...Location: cannot be beatenDecor: stylish, modern, bit on the dark side, but it all works well together.Staff: Faultless. made restaurant reservation, confirmed my existing reservation, left note in my room to say they had done it. always courteous and polite. multi-lingual.Top tip: no need to get concierge to arrange a taxi - they ring for one and by the time it arrives, it already has several euros on the clock. Just walk 5 yards onto Ramblas and hail one - never took me longer than 30 seconds.

<Content>Excellent location in Barcelona My daughter and I had a 'girls' week' in Barcelona. The location of this hotel was excellent for us as most of the main sights were within walking distance. The accommodation was luxurious with very well appointed bathrooms. I do not know if it was our shower but we had a problem getting the water temperature to a high enough level. We had booked bed and breakfast and breakfast was entirely satisfactory. Many people have mentioned the rooftop pool and although it looked very nice we were never able to get sunbeds round it as they were always taken when we went up. This may be due to the fact that there are not that many beds. The pool in the basement is nice to visit.The bar on the roof is lovely and it is nice to have a drink there in the early evening.Although the hotel is situated on La Rambla there is no noice in your room due to the excellent soundproofing.If I was returning to Barcelona I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>H1898 - elegance from the past, great stay!! My stay at the H 1898 recently was great from beginning to end. It took me back in time with old world feel (over 100 yrs ago was home to the Phillippine Tobacco Co!!) but a hotel with all the modern features a business or holiday traveller needs. The indoor pool is unreal---as well as the views from up on top of the hotel! The location for checking out the old town is unbeatable. Staff very friendly. I hear they have other hotels in town... I will be checking them out next time in Barcelona. Jeff

<Content>Impressive Everything about Hotel 1898, from the decor to the service and facilities were outstanding. When we arrived at 7 AM, we went up to the roof terrace, found a bed and took a nap. The downstairs pool/ jacuzzi was perfect for soothing the feet after a long day of walking. The superior room was certainly large enough for two. There was plenty of storage, robes, slippers, large tub, excellent climate control. Even the balcony, just enough to stand on, but provided a bird's eye view of the goings on in Las Ramblas. Quiet too, except I was able to hear (feel) the sound of the subway. Never did it keep me awake - perhaps a higher floor (we were on the 3rd) would help. Never used the restaurant - so many bakeries and cervesarias nearby, and the Boqueria Market. Don't buy the mango juice from the stalls in front. They charge 2 euros - the ones farther back to the side only charge 1 euro.Staff was professional, and provided everything we asked for - which was plenty! Excellent restaurant advice. Two of note: Neyras on Via Laietana 41 - easy to find - both tapas and regular menu. We ordered off the regular and were impressed.Also, El Pintor (Sant Honorat 7) in Barri Gotic off Placa Jaume. So incredibly good we went back for a second dinner before we left. Have the hotel make reservations for you! Try the salted cod with honey, pine nuts  raisins. Try the profiteroles. Seriously.Also, we found success by never taking the Turistic Bus. The bus/subway is so cheap, easy and clean. Why go all over the place when you can only really see 2 or 3 sights a day? Why wait on that horrible line? Take the 24 bus from Placa Catalunya to Park Guell. Take the subway to Sagrada Famiglia and then walk the Ruta de Modernisme following the signs in the sidewalk along the Diagonal. Take the green line Subway to the funicular up to Montjuic and see Joan Miro and the National Museum of Catalan Art. Walk through the Barri Gotic and make sure to see the Roman ruins in the basement of the Museum of le Ciutat of Barcelona. ARTICKET: if you like art, history  architecture, buy it. For 20 euros, you get entrance to 7 museums (Picasso, Joan Miro, La Pedrera, etc. - it pays for itself after three) Buy it at the tourist info center below Placa Catalunya. (Look for the I sign) Best thing: if you have the Articket, you can skip the long line at La Pedrera. Just give the ticket to the gate guard. She will get it stamped for you and you have just saved yourself a 30 minute wait!!

<Content>Horrible Service, Nice Building My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 in early Oct. 2007. I am a frequent business traveler both within the US and internationally and have experience with many hotels (Four Seasons, Starwood, Ritz Carlton, etc...).Hotel 1898 is part of a chain of upscale boutique hotels in Spain. The pluses are that the hotel is in nice condition with clean rooms and good looking common spaces (including 2 pools). Our experience was ruined, however, by the incredibly unhelpful staff at Hotel 1898 who seemed to go out of their way to be outright rude to us - for instance, my wife called to ask if the conceirge could make a dinner reservation for us. Four hours later, we had heard nothing so she called again. The concierge responded by snapping that they were very busy and would call when they got around to it - by the time they did, the restaurant was fully booked. Another major problem was that the Hotel was simply mismanaged - although the check-in time was 3pm, the hotel refused to check us in at that time saying that the rooms were not clean. We were not able to check in until over two hours later and the hotel offered us no recompense for this significant inconvenience aside from one drink at the bar. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as the service is horrendous.

<Content>Hotel 1898 - Luxury and Location We recently returned from a trip to Spain, including Barcelona, where we stayed at the Hotel 1898. We had read several reviews of this hotel; most were positive, some were not. We would absolutely recommend this beautiful hotel for adults travelling without children.The hotel's central location on the La Rambla was perfect, and after a busy and crowded day signhtseeing, the hotel's quiet and sophisticated interior was like a calming oasis for us. Although we did not eat in the hotel, we made use of the luxurious roof deck, with its pool and deep upholstered chaises (in some cases, as large as full sized beds) to read and relax. The sunsets were glorious from the roof and the roof bar served fabulous cocktails. Yes, the drinks were pricey, but certainly in line with a hotel of this quality.Our room faced a side street off La Rambla, which was great since there was a three-day festival going on during our stay, resulting in huge crowds and lots of activity. Although our room was a bit small, it had a high ceiling and luxurious appointments. We were especially impressed with the lighting and dimming control system and how well buffered we were from the noise outside. Our stay cost us $2,200.00 USD for fournights and five days in a Superior room.We had read previous reviews which were critical of the hotel's staff. We found the staff to be curteous, friendly and very helpful.Since we were arriving in Barcelona early in the morning, the hotel made arrangements to have our room ready for us earlier then the normal check-in time, secured our luggage and made a safe available for our use. With reference to the safety within and without the hotel, the staff stressed using the room safe for our valuables and being aware of the people around us in the streets while touring the city. We never had any problems or felt unsafe in Barcelona. Our favorite place to eat a light and scrumpous breakfast was Escriba, only as few blocks from the hotel. Be realistic about prices since the US Dollar is weak compared to the Euro. Expect to pay around $30.00 USD for two mini quiches, coffee, bottles of water and one (fantastic) chocolate croissant. You should make dinner reservations for popular restaurants or expect to wait until 10:00 p.m. or later to have dinner. We would suggest purchasing the one or two day tourist bus pass which provides an excellent overview of the city. You can get off and back on the bus as often as you like during a twelve hour period, allowing you to visit sites of interest for as long as you wish.Barcelona is a city not to be missed, especially if you appreciate fantastic architecture, both old and new.

<Content>Stayed and Returned on the same trip! Expensive but worth it. Beautiful rooms, spacious public areas and a great roof pool and bar. It's right on La Rambla, so, either book in advance and ask for a room at the rear of the hotel or put up with a little noise until 2 AM. The windows are even made to seal out the noise. We started our trip at the Hotel 1898 and liked it so much that we reserved an additional night at the end of our trip.

<Content>Perhaps Too Much? This was one of those hotels where it is difficult to tell the staff from the guests and I felt the staff were doing us a favour. The location is perfect and the hotel facilities excellent. The rooftop bar and pool is fantastic and the inside pool in the basment too. I did'nt use the restaurant apart from breakfast, but once again the staff were not too helpful. Some reviews mention small rooms. This was not the case for me. My room was pretty big with a high ceiling. I looked out onto an internal well so there was no view and it was tough to tell the time of day or the weather. Many other rooms on other floors had this view to the well too. The room was very high tech. Lighting, had several settings rather than just on and off. There were no instructions or channel listing for the television or video channels. The bathroom was very luxurious although the controls for the bath/shower were difficult to programme - simly becasue there were lots of taps and controls. Despite the luxury, I dont think I would stay there again.

<Content>Loved 1898 This was the best hotel we have stayed at in Europe. I don't understand the people writing saying the rooms were small. For a European hotel, this was the largest room we have ever had. We did take advice from here and ask for an inside room so it would be quiet. The personnel were the best! Their English was superb and they were helpful with everything, restaurant recommendations and reservations, taxi's, tickets for the hop on hop off bus. The rooms are clean. It was a location that allowed us to walk to many things nearby, Las Rambles, Old Town that includes Picasso and Dali museums. We'd stay there again. Directly across from Le Meridien at half the cost and 1898 is newer.

<Content>Great....but they need more rooms with double beds! The hotel was very beautiful....well designed and a real oasis in the busy city centre. Conveniently located for everything with a fantastic roof top bar and pool which was a great place to recharge your batteries in the sun after a mornings shopping. The spa was excellent as well for a hotel of this size!The only complaint is that they dont have many rooms with double beds....catering it seems for dual occupancy business travellers.....so make sure you reserve one when you book. We were offered a room with a double but it was MUCH smaller and apparently this ones they have get taken early!We would go back!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! My fiance and I went to Barcelona before sailing on a 12 day cruise. The hotel was easy to get to and the staff was very friendly. The rooms were small, but very normal for European standards. The hotel was clean and decorated like a boutique hotel in San Francisco. We absolutely loved our stay and would definitely return! Just beware of the expensive drinks at the rooftop bar, my drink was 20 euros!!! Very overpriced, but still worth it to look out over the city at night.

<Content>Hotel 1898 Stayed at the H1898 for 5 nights starting Sept. 12, 2007. Did take a superior room. Some comments are shown below.1) The taxi was 21 Euros from the airport. The fare was 28 Euro from the hotel to the airport--traffic was heavy in the morning. Did tip. If you request a taxi at the front desk and they call for one, the flag drops when the taxi driver receives the call. We did this once and when the taxi arrived at the hotel, the fare was already 4.5 Euros.2) The front desk was very nice and helpful. Most spoke English. We are in our middle 60's and my wife has difficulty walking because of back surgeries. We asked to see a few rooms to see which bathroom would work out the best. They showed us 3 rooms. We picked room 344--overlooked the La Rambla. Windows cut out most of the street noise.3) Room was very clean. Two twin mattresses were placed together. In the tub/shower, the top knob determined if the water came out of the spigot or the 8 shower head. The lower knob determined the water temperature. The bathroom had a hair dryer and a towel warmer rack. The room was equipped with a light dimming system--very unique. 4) The Hotel has 4 free computers for your use on the first floor.5) We did not try the breakfast. We did not think it was worth 19 Euros(26US$)/person. The room was supplied with complimentary instant coffee, teas, and a water heater. There is a Starbucks next door and a grocery store on La Rambla 1 block toward Plaza Catalunya. We picked up OJ, rolls at the bakery, and with the instant coffee,had breakfast in the room..There is a small refrigerator in the room. Afternoon tea complimentary in bar area between 5:00PM-7:00PM.6) The roof top, with pool, is very nice. Cost of a beer is 6 Euro. Spa treatments avaliable, but pricey.7) We made use of a taxi to see the various sights. Fare between 6-8 Euros. We made use of Bus 59(on the La Rambla) to get to the cable car. The cable car cost 12.5 Euro/person--round trip. Did eat at the top. Great view of the port and city.8) For dinner we ate along the La Rambla. A number of the restaurants had a daily fixed price menu--9 Euro--3 courses. One night we went to an up scale seafood restaurant along the seafront--El Cangrejo Loco. (Crazy Crab) The upstairs had an excellent view of the sea and beach. We had salad, fish(Seabass supreme and Monk), and wine. Professionally prepared and presented. Cost was 100 Euro including tip.[--]9) We did go to a Flamenco show with buffet dinner. Cost was 69 Euro/person. [--] Located at La Rambla 35--Walking distance from hotel. Would stay at the hotel again.Suggest you purchase a book by Rick Steves--Spain.Note: Be Careful. If you use a debit card, watch which one you use. I used a MasterCard and a Visa. If you use the Mastercard you are charged a 3% surcharge. At the ATM, if you withdraw 300 Euro, we were charged an extra 11US$. With the Visa, I was charged 1US$.We spent 5 nights in Barcelona and then flew to Malaga. Spent 7 nights along the Mediterranean Sea in Torremolinos at the Melia Costa del Sol.If there any questions, please do not to hesitate to Email.

<Content>Hotel 1898 - Beautiful We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary here recently and we had the most fabulous experience. We always wanted to go to Barcelona as it is a beautiful city steeped in history. The hotel staff where brilliant to say the least, nothing was a problem and any requests we had before arrival and during our stay where sorted with no fuss whatsoever.The hotel is situated in La Rambla ( City Centre), its an historical building redesigned wonderfully whilst keeping with the character. The reception, rooms, spa, swimming and eating facilities are top notch. Put it like this, when searching hotels websites, everything looks amazing, when you get there, sometimes its not what you originally thought it to be - Hotel 1898 however is everything its made out to be.Would strongly recommend it, and will most definitely revisit!Ps: Check out the roof top pool and bar - Very interesting.

<Content>Good Location Stayed here for 3 nights last weekend. The location is great, rooms are small but clean. Had fab weather - was nice to relax on the rooftop after sightseeing during the day. Most staff helpful. Drinks in bar were very expensive but overall enjoyed our stay. Would like to stay somewhere else on next visit.

<Content>Loved the luxury First thing about this hotel is the location, right on the Ramblas, loved it. Downsides are:The rooms are a little small and there's no view or balcony; check in is at 3 which is a bit excessive, everywhere else it's 12. The upsides way outweigh the downsides, though. The staff are very helpful and speak good English, which is a relief when you're travelling around Europe and you only speak English. The luxury level is amazing. The beds are great, really comfortable, and so are the pillows. There's a spa in the hotel which was wonderful and the rooftop bar is a great place to relax after a day's sightseeing when you want to wind down somewhere close to bed. The food at breakfast was great and there was plenty of it. The hotel is close to a metro station and easy to get to the beach, too. All up, I'd recommend this hotel.

<Content>Overbooking notice 1 day before arrival Ok so I never actually stayed at the hotel, but if this is how their service operates then they deserve the 1 star rating - as does Opodo who I booked through.Booked the hotel for two nights over a month and half a go - money taken, and all booked up according to Opodo.18 hours before depature and Opodo call to say the Hotel is overbooked and that they can't get us a room, and the Hotel is offering hotels of much less quality to stay in instead.Awful.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel! We stayed here for 4 nights and absolutely loved it. All staff were very friendly from the reception staff to the maids. We had a superior double room with city views on 6th floor. Beds were really comfortable and the room had heavily lined curtains so the room was dark with no sunshine waking us up in the morning! Very modern decor, great bathroom with lots of supplies including toothbrushes  paste, shaving razor etc. We didn't hear any noise at all considering we were on La Rambla - what an ideal location.The roof top terrace was great after a day sight seeing - great sunbeds and towels supplied. But better still was the spa and pool in the basement.Couldn't recommend this hotel enough - I've been telling everyone about it.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This hotel is fabulous , we arrived in Barcelona to learn that the city was celebrating it's largest festival. The city was mainc and the hotel was just a haven of peace and tranquility.It's location was superb, right in the heart of the city and just of Las Rambals. The hotel decor is stylish and beautiful. We arrived early and were lucky that our room was ready. The room itself was there standard room. It wasn't large but beautifully decorated and well equipt for everything you would need. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries, and included bathrobes and slippers. The hotel offer a special pillow service so that you can change your pillow if you have a particular preference. I particularly liked the light controls located next to the bed, at the touch of a button you can change the lighting to relax mode, reading mode etc. The facilities were excellent , the roof pool and terrace was spectacular, and lovely just to sit and have a drink . The basement pool was equally impressive and very relaxing. I even used the gym which was adequate for a quick workout.Breakfast is served on the first floor and there was a wide choice of food available from cakes to cerals,and juice to cooked sausages, bacon and scrambled eggs. All the staff were polite and very helpful, I would not hesitate to come back again it really deserves a five star rating, and I have already started to recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>Very nice Hotel Our room was their mid-range deluxe. With hardwood floors, granite bathroom, and terrace overlooking small plaza to the side of the hotel. The bed was oversized King (California King) and was luxurious. We adjusted the room temp several times with the thermostat and were pleased with the ability to control the room temp. I read something in the room that said the property was renovated in recent years. I would say that the rooms and lobby are decorated in very good taste. The staff were knowledgable and helpful. The location is excellent. This is a first class stay. Will recommend to family and friends.

<Content>Love it! For those who do not really like the indepth, nitty-gritty, I will just sumise for you right at the start. The hotel is beautiful. It's very clean, the staff speak excellent English and will answer any queries helpfully upon arrival.Right! Here's the broken down summary for those who like a thorough review.The best way I can describe it, is that it is like having complete luxury brought to your hands. You feel as though you are being treated just by being there.The maids were constantly cleaning around tables, glass (in the lift), toilets and you know that their standards are high when it comes to cleanliness.The bedroom came with en suite with toilet (and one for the men) shower, sink, shower cap, shaving foam, razor, body lotion, bubble bath, manicure set, hairdryer, robes, slippers (robe and slippers to be taken to the Spa), mini fridge, desk, box of paper and writing matrials, flat screen TV (with access to CNN and BBC News in English).The beds were very comfortable, and you are given a choice of 3 pillows to choose from, depending on which postion you sleep in. The bedding was very clean, and very contemporary. There are blankets in the cupboards incase you get a bit chilly (which we did, as the air-con came on just before we went to bed and we were unsure as to how to use the control for it). The maids did visit at about 9pm to change towels each day - which sometimes did become a little frustrating if you did want an early night they would knock until you answered the door. We did not see the need for this as we had our rooms cleaned and they changed the towels already that day, so sometimes they did not need changing.The hotel has access to the Internet and they do have a business suite however I did not visit this section of the Hotel and could not comment on the efficiency of service.Oh and in your room coffee and tea facilities are provided. Although, there are only 2 small pots of milk given and these were not replenished during our stay although other drinks sachets (i.e. coffee, tea, sugar) were. The Spa is such a fantastic thing they have on offer. We found that after a day of shopping, you would get back and feel exhaused. So to be able to use a steam room, sauna, theraputic shower and pool was like a dream come true! We found that between 7-9 the pool was empty and it felt lovely to have the peace and quiet. The pool has 2 seats, which you can sit on and activate the bubbles so that you have a kind of massage while sitting. The speed is rather fast though so you do need to hang on! The pool also has another corner dedicated to these massaging pulses of bubbles and also 2 fountains which are good for shoulder massages when standing up under them. There is also a gym facility which was also empty between 7-9pm. Towels are provided when using the Spa/Pool area but you do need to take your robe and slippers with you. There is also a shower downstairs in this area if you want to shower and change before going back to your room.The roof is also very modern and relaxing. There is a bar where all drinks are served. You can either pay there or you can charge it to your room. On one day while sitting upstairs we were given complimentary vegetable crisps to have a munch on while drinking which was an added bonus! There are sofas with cusions upstairs along with sunloungers and this was never busy so there was plenty of privacy for you, and those who prefer a topless tan (as was the case each day of our stay!).To get to the roof pool and bar, there is only 1 lift of the total 3 that get there. So if you are on the ground floor, and wanted to go to floor 7 (where it is situated) then sometimes you had to go to 6 first, then go up again to 7, which became a little tiresome. The hotel itself is situated right in the heart of La Rambia, which is a busy centre for both traffic and people. Although we could not hear the traffic or people from our rooms we could hear the music playing from the roof top bar until early hours which did actually keep me awake one night (this was without our bedroom door being open).Also our bedroom had one window, facing onto a wall of other apartment windows. We could actually see into the guest toilet opposite our apartment (not through looking, you could very easily see through) which I found a little discomfortining about the design for privacy of others.All in all an excellent stay with excellent facities and we will definately be returning

<Content>Great hotel, great location Hotel 1898 is in the most ideal location, right on the Ramblas, within walking distance of Placa de Catalunya, the port end (Colon), Placa de Gracia  the Metro station. Rooms was modern  clean, but very small (no balcony, poor view), and we weren't offered an upgrade, and couldn't be bothered to change after waiting for the room to be ready for hours (there's no leeway on the 3pm check-in time, and we got there at 9am, having just dis-embarked a cruise). Loved the cool dimming light options!Service was otherwise good, at the desk, bars, restaurant and pool area.Would recommend the Barcelona Turistic Open Top hop-on hop-off bus (19 Euro for one day, 23 Euro for 2 days).

<Content>cracking hotel we booked this hotel after reading the reviews on here and a recommendation from a friend, and can honestly say we weren't disappointed. the location is spot on, just off la rambla, and the room was fantastic. we were thoroughly impressed by the size and cleanliness of the room, and it was very nicely done out. the room service was spot on, and we found the staff to be very helpful. we were told by our friend to ask for directions to the tapas bar they recommend, and we loved it there so much we went back the next night!! we loved the rooftop bar, which was especially nice after a hard day's shopping and sightseeing! yeah the drinks aren't cheap, but then again they aren't cheap in london either and i think thats the kinda price you'll pay in a big city. they do a mean margarita which is well worth the money though!!! theres a metro stop nearby and its only a short walk to the harbour where you can do boat trips and theres a lovely shopping mall too. if you're looking for a good hotel with a central location, decent breakfasts, nice rooms and helpful staff then you found it here!

<Content>A nice place to stay in Barcelona We're a mid-30's couple from a large North American city who stayed at the Hotel 1898 from Sept 5 - 7, 2007. We found the hotel and room to be very comfortable and nicely designed. The front desk staff was excellent and very helpful. We loved the roof top patio / lounge. What a great place to relax after a busy day of sight seeing. The location - right off La Ramblas - is ideal if you want to be within walking distance to pretty much everything, but it wasn't noisy at all.We would definitely recommend this hotel to people looking for a nice, stylish hotel in the heart of Barcelona.

<Content>Great sanctuary in choas of La Rambla We booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and had high expectations!We arrived a little earlier than the 3pm check in but had emailed them in advance to let them know. The receptionist was astounding and told us that no-one had ever arrived early in Spain!! Hence our room wasn't ready and he could give us no time of when it would be! We did however get our swimsuits out of our case and enjoy the sun and the rooftop pool and bar!We had booked an upgraded room with a balcony. The room itself was large and spotlessly clean, and the balcony was huge - plenty big enough for a party!! Our room once at the back of the hotel and was very peaceful.The spa was also a great feature of the hotel giving you a great chance to unwind after a day of sightseeing and lazing on the beach. It really was a great way of calming down after the choas of the return walk home via La Rambla.The location of the hotel was great - central to all attractions, about 15-20 mins walk to eiher the beach or segrade familia.The service in the hotel is little more than functional, the reception team are very matter of fact, no smiles or friendly welcomes! This was similar throughout the hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel due to its great facilities, location and cleanliness. However dont expect fantastic over the top service and be prepared for the prices at the pool bar (8 euros for two glasses of coke!)

<Content>Fantatic Place..indifferent staff This is a great hotel and we were most impressed with the location and rooms. If you are booked into a courtyard room take note that the courtyard is merely a large air shaft with some potted plants and it tends to be a little dark. We were advised to book that type of room as we were told the outside rooms tended to be affected by the street noise. The only negative one could say is that the staff tends to be a little stiff, unfriendly. We had asked for a wake up call to get to the airport and despite confirming the time it was made an hour late. We had also booked a van to get 4 people and bags to the airp[ort and again confirmed with the front desk t that it was ordered and would be there. The van did not arrive and the staff didn't appear to care. The only response was that it was raining....

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Just had a few days in Barcelona, we were looking for a Central hotel, decided to book Hotel 1898 based on tripadvisor reviews and could not be happier that we did. Location is great and central, but the room was still perfectly quiet. Booked the basic room, immaculate, modern and clean. Staff were helpful and friendly, breakfast buffet was great, and best still is the rooftop pool and bar. After a few hours touring and shopping to have a pool with great views to relax before going out in the evening was perfect. I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and would totally recommend this hotel we loved it.

<Content>The best in Barcelona Truly great stay at Hotel 1898 - if you are headed to Barcelona there should be no other choice. Great location - easy access to all major tourist spots - neighborhoods and subways. Clean and chic interiors - great amenities - roof top pool and bar is incredibly cool with great views and stylish setting - indoor spa is unique and very chic with great mix of services - solid business center - rooms are not huge - but very well thought out decorated and clean. Two pane windows so even though we had a partial view of las rambla where on the 3rd floor and the hotel next door was under construction - noise never bothered us at all. The hotel is in the mix of Las Rambla - but it feels quiet and secluded while still being right in the mix of the city. And if you don't like crowds you should not go to Barcelona any way. Easy walking distance to the Boqeuria market - the contemporary art museum - the Gothic quarter and Picasso museum - Placa Catalan and all the other major neighborhoods - plus 2 minute walk to two major subway stations that can take you anywhere you else you might want to go. I travel all the time stay at 5 star (Four Seasons etc) - this is just as good as any 5 start hotel. When we get back to Barcelona - we will stay here without a doubt - its not cheap - but its well worth the money - cant think of a single thing I would change. The perfect place to say for a visit to this great city.

<Content>Beautiful, stylish hotel Let me make this clear from the start, Hotel 1898 is not cheap. However, it is gorgeous. It is very stylish and chic without being all trendy and aloof! The reception staff were very helpful every time we spoke with them. They provided lots of eating recommendations and had three or four books worth of menus and pictures to help choose. The only issue was with the staff at the roof top bar who didn't seem very keen to come over and get you more drinks (although we could have gone up and got them ourselves if we weren't lounging on the big sofas in the sun!).We had a deluxe room which had it's own balcony. That was a definite advantage and we ate breakfast there each morning (although we did buy our own from the supermarket a few doors down rather than pay the 19 euros each the hotel wanted). The bathroom was a reasonable size with a lovely deep bath, and a huge shower head. Also the room was very clean and was serviced well each day.The food in the restaurant was superb and the service extremely friendly. The complimentary appetizer was delicious, and the other courses were just as good. It was the nicest restaurant we ate at although we were a bit unorganised at booking other restaurants - which is advisable if you want to go to a top level restaurant, we missed out on one promising venue because they were jam packed all evening. After reading other people's comments about the noise level from La Rambla we were a bit worried about being able to sleep. But there was no noise issue with our sound proofed room (which of course won't work if you open the window - there's no need as the room was very well air conditioned!). We slept soundly each night in the huge bed which you can customise with the pillow menu!

<Content>H1898 is just amazing! Took my girlfriend for a romantic two nights stay at 1898 I'd been to Barcelona for the fist time with my son only a few weeks earlier. Loved the hotel so much I decided to make the return trip. Our stay at 1898 was an experience in itself, we wished we could have stayed for a few more nights to enjoy more of the spa and the rooftop chill out area! The staff were very helpful as usual and nothing was too much trouble except we needed an iron to sort out a few creased items of clothing but unfortunately we couldn't do that ourselves there and then. Would have had to hand it in and collect the next day, not convenient. Advice is to take a small travel iron. Apart from that the facilities are wonderful. It really is in a different class and in the pefect location! Step out onto La Rambla and soak up the atmoshere immediately. Planning our next stay there very, very soon!

<Content>Amazing hotel, loved it. Unique experience. We stayed here for two nights, August 12. I've seen many hotels over the years, both for business and leisure, ranging from Eur20/night to Eur500/night. H1898 beats them all. Easily. Very distincitive in every respect, from the beautiful lobby to the indoor pool and great rooms (nicely decorated, high ceilings, huge bed, excellent pillow service). Best of all is the rooftop terrace with great 360 view of Barca...and a pool.

<Content>Great hotel at a great location The location is right at the heart of La Rambla, so it is walking distance to the best sites to see in Barcelona. Rates are among the highest, but it is truly a well worth indulgence - with their high thread count sheets, excellent spa facilities, cozy lounges and quiet rooms (considering it's right in front of a bustling street). A historic hotel with ultra-modern amenities, Hotel 1898 is a landmark of luxury and comfort in Barcelona.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel! We just returned home after a 4 day stay at the 1898 Hotel in Barcelona. We had two rooms, each with a somewhat different decor, but both were quiet and extremely comfortable. We were impressed by the helpfulness of the staff, the unique features of the rooms (e.g., multiple different lighting settings), the convenience of the computers in the business center, and the wonderful location (right on La Rambla and within walking distance of many sights, restaurants and shopping venues). The rooftop pool was perfect for those wanting to sun themselves and the indoor pool was equally relaxing (and uniquely designed). We have traveled many times, in many countries but this hotel will remain one of our favorites!

<Content>Couldn't do better I booked this at the last minute - at a bargain price too.I didn't have high expectations after previous Barcelona hotel experiences BUT - WOW!!!!!!This place is amazing. FANTASTIC LOCATION, BEAUTIFUL DECOR (Wonderful air-con! - Do NOT consider a hotel without air-con in summer in Barcelona!), STAFF were unobtrusive and helpful.There is a spa with many wonderful sounding treatments but we were there for only a short stay but I would advise finding out about the spa before you go - a chocolate massage sounded divine!After several trips to Barcelona I won't be staying in another hotel!

<Content>Some postives...some negatives... We booked Hotel 1898 for two nights...the front end of a cruise and thene again on return. Location is excellent, and the hotel offers great rooms, amenities in the room,and a very calming atmosphere , after a day in the city. However, front desk service was indiffernent. They forgot our wake up calls (both rooms) which could have been a real problem since we had a flight to make on one occasion and despite pre-booking a cab the evening before in order to get to the airport in time, they seemed to care less when it didn't show up....I would suggest to the front desk that a smile sometimes goes along way when dealing with the public...at least pretend you care !

<Content>Excellent hotel, consistent high standards There is very little to add as its all been said before by other reviewers. However its hopefully useful to mention that everything positive that has been written was still in evidence when my wife and I stayed there for 2 nights earlier this week.I booked to stay in a Priviledge Room which is larger than the standard rooms and situated on the corners of the hotel overlooking Las Ramblas. Interestingly I found that these rooms were only on offer by booking direct with the hotel.Our room was comfortable, very modern and spotlessly clean and had all the services we have come to expect from travelling.A nice touch was also the free computers, Internet access and printers on the 1st floor in the Library area as this allowed us to check-in online and print our boarding passes for the journey back to the UK which saved some hassle at the airport.We went to the hotel restaurant for one night and while the menu sounded excellent and the prices were comparable with a high quality establishment we didn't end up eating there as it was rather quiet that night so atmosphere was lacking.The roof terrace pool and bar is a nice touch, as is the underground swimming pool complex where again all the basic facilities are free of charge.Location is perfect on Las Ramblas and our taxi drivers had no issue finding the place.To summarise an absolutely fantastic place that deserves its top position on Tripadvisor and I'd be very happy to stay there again and would thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>Great Hotel, all the amenities! We stayed here for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon in Spain, and we had a great time! The rooms were very fashionable, and the hotel amenities were excellent- we used the rooftop pool every afternoon. The location is great for sightseeing- although La Rambla can be VERY crowded during the summer. The staff were very accommodating. Overall, it is a very modern hotel, with all the best features and little touches (even the lighting system in the rooms)- we have already recommended it to friends.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Tranquility in the madness of Ramblas We have just returned from 3 nights in the 1898 celebrating my 40th Birthday. Being No1 on trip advisor was the reason we booked this hotel. We read the very few negatives on here and this is what i think. You will always get people who are never satisfied with anything, you know the type. they are at the reception desks screaming at the staff about the slightest issue, no wonder then they get nothing sorted because lets face it, no place or event in the world is perfect and i suppose the true test of a hotel is how they react when things go slightly wrong because hey this is the reality of every day life. So firstly we got to our room, great room but right outside the elevator, based on previous comments i didnt want to settle in the room and find i could hear the elevators through the night (im a light sleeper) so we went down to reception straight away and explained.(by the way they have removed the lift bell on those floors now anyway) we got a better room issued immediately ! Result ! But you know what, if you speak politely without attitude and explain the issue, 99 times out 100, you get it sorted, and thats the point about the negatives reviews here. Next we ordered some bollinger off the menu at 80 euro's, good price i thought, when we got the bill it had 130 euro's on it, on checking the menu i had been given an old menu, no problem sir the correct price is actually 130 euro which i have to charge you but what i will give you is free drinks for the rest of the night !!!(we drunk easily more than twice the diff)- result No 2. Next morning we ordered 2 types of breakfast, they only brought one, on ringing the kitchen they apologised and the other was with us within 3 mins - result no 3. The reception were very helpful with ordering taxis( you cant be charged double going to the airport because they are all on meters NB previous review) and booking restaurants, in fact they got us into a restaurant that was full because they regularly send customers there. We didnt really do any site seeing, it was relax in the sun, wine and dine break and the hotel is perfect for that. The Ramblas outside the hotel is madness in august, it is so busy, so when you step back into the hotel it is like an Oasis of calm and tranquility, and for the previous comment about the bar been quite - what do you want when you have been in crowds of people all day ! certainly not queueing with hoards of noisy people at the bar. If your looking for the better bars and restaurants then turn left has you come out the hotel onto the Ramblas and walk couple of 100 yards up, this way you get away from all the tourists coming off the boats and getting trapped in the Ramblas restaurants which are poor food/high prices. 2 places were excellent, a traditional tapas bar called Alfonso for lunch and theTralaguz restaurant for a big night meal.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We only stayed in the hotel one night before we joined a cruise ship for our honeymoon. But the hotel was great, the room was lovely - very stylish, the bathroom was fantastic and we even had a little terrace area with a table and chairs even though we had booked one of the cheapest rooms. We ate dinner that night on that terrace using room service (we were so tired!) which was brought to us in very efficient time. The menu is a little basic but tasted great! We then walked around the city the following morning to get a taste. The location of the hotel is great and gives you a real feel for the city. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic I stayed here for a weekend in Feb. I booked this after reading some of the reviews on this site and it was a fantastic choice. Upon arrival we were immediatly received an upgrade. Our room was superb, the decor was very striking, the room was spotless and the bathroom was excellent.The location of this hotel was the main reason i booked this was because it was on La Ramblas, although we did not suffer from any outside noise in our room.The rooftop pool area was exceptionally clean and the views were great. The basement held the pool and sauna and again these were superb.In short this is a great hotel with very good staff and a brilliant location.

<Content>What a find! We returned from Barcelona last weekend - it was our first visit and a special occasion, celebrating my husbands birthday. It was a surprise booking for him and the hotel was discreet in all correspondence since my booking earlier this year. I booked a superior room and it exceeded all expectations. We had views around the city, our bedroom opposite the Cathedral. The hotel is situated on La Ramblas, but you would never know as our room on the 6th floor was well sound proofed and tucked back with views of the luxurious suite privatepool terrace below. It was an oasis amidst an exciting and lively city. The hotel was exceptionally clean, the facilities including the roof terrace and spa were superb, the room finished to a high standard and the service was very friendly at all times and nothing seemed to be too much. We will certainly return as we managed to have a long weekend with a good mix of rest, sun  evening relation on the roof terrace, cool drinks by the pool, sight seeing and excellent food  wine. The only point we would make is book your own taxi to the airport from outside the hotel, the taxi company charged us nearly double the fare when we booked through the hotel to return to the airport.

<Content>Blessed oasis of calm and order Within 30 minutes of arriving in Barcelona, at the Franca Station cafe in fact, we had a bag stolen containing our passports, tickets and driving licence, Do be careful in Barcelona - crime is rife! Anyway went straight to the 1898 and the receptionist let us book into our rooms although it was only 11 o'clock, then called us a taxi to get to the British Consulate to arrange emergency passports. After a dismal afternoon trudging between the police station and the consulate what a relief to return to the sanctuary of the 1898. Great rooms, room service and rooftop pool. I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Fabulous hotel My husband and I stayed at the beginning of August for three nights. I emailed the hotel a couple of days before our arrival to check that the booking was confirmed and mentioned that we were celebrating our wedding anniversay. We were over the moon when we arrived and had been upgraded from a standard to a superior room! It was gorgeous - the decor is really sleek and modern and the room was quite spacious.  The rooftop terrace and pool is a fantastic bonus - just what you need after a morning's sightseeing. A great way to chill out and relax in the sun for an hour! The spa in the basement is small but immaculate - loved the jacuzzi water bed! Staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful, especially those on the roof terrace. Amazingly ,bar prices seemed quite reasonable when compared to every other bar and restaurant we visited! Barcelona is definitely not a cheap place to visit!I cannot recommend this hotel enough - we will definitely be going back.

<Content>Great Hotel Hotel 1898 is a very beautiful hotel in the heart of the market section of Las Ramblas. Everything you could possibly need is within two blocks of the hotel. The rooms are all high tech, spotless, and beautifully designed. They are small by American standards, but not an inch of space is wasted. We stayed in two superior, double rooms. The beds were big and comfortable and you have your choice of pillows. The bathrooms are large and gorgeous - all marble and chrome, with towel warmers and showers with full bathtubs. Everything is state-of-the art, which meant that sometimes we had to call the front desk to figure out how to get things to work. The common areas are open, beautiful and inviting. Staff is professional and friendly and you can always find someone who speaks English. There is a small swimming pool on top of the hotel, with a bar and a deck from which you can view all of Barcelona. The hotel is on a part of Las Ramblas that is packed with tourists, but it is fun to walk down the street and see all of the street artists and visit the vendors. The surrounding streets are lined with stores, good restaurants and cafes. We only spent one night in Barcelona en route to somewhere else, but Hotel 1898 was one of the highlights of our trips.

<Content>Outstanding Great hotel! Lots of hisortic features have been thoughtfully blended with all the modern touches you would expect and more. Roof top pool and bar area is the highlight but be sure to check out the indoor pool which is prettty special.Paying the extra for a delux room which comes with a great private terrace is essential.Nominally a 4 star hotel i believe. Strange as it is better than nearly all the 5 stars i've stayed in.

<Content>Really enjoyed Hotel 1898 My wife and I stayed at Hotel 1898 for 2 nights at the end of July for a long weekend. The hotel, located in a beautifully restored old building in a very central location, looks new and well-kept. The (standard) room, while not very big, had a clean and fresh feel to it. The bathroom was nice with a great shower and good water pressure. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke English very well. On our last day we were able to extend our room stay until 6pm for about 40% of what we paid for a full night. Maybe not cheap, but it allowed us to fully enjoy the day and freshen up before heading back to the airport. We particularly enjoyed the rooftop pool and lounge area. It was very warm when we were in Barcelona and after some sightseeing in the city, it was a great place to relax for a few hours and have some drinks. That brings me to the only negative thing of this hotel. The prices for drinks on the rooftop were excessive; we paid almost 15 euros per drink for a rum  cola and a mojito. We also used the indoor pool downstairs, which is beautiful. We will definitely come back here for our next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>An excellent centrally located hotel My wife and I reviewed quite a few hotels on line before choosing Hotel 1898 and I am so happy that we picked it. The hotel can be summed up simply - A centrally located, clean, very chilled/modern hotel with excellent/attentive staff and very good facilities.We have stayed in quite a few hotels in Europe and we both agreed that it is one of the best.I would highly recommend a deluxe room with a private terrace, its well worth the extra money.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in Barcelona My wife and I were in Spain this July for a two week visit, starting and ending in Barcelona, with stops at Valencia, Denia and Granada in between. The Hotel we had first booked in Barcelona, the Hotel Jazz, also a part of the Nunez/Navarro chain, informed us they were full (due to a cancelled airline flight) when we arrived late on a Monday evening. At first our hearts sank, but they then informed us that they were transferring our reservation, at the same rates, to another hotel in the NN chain in Barcelona, the H1898. What seemed at first might be a disaster turned out to be great good luck: the H1898 hotel is a beautiful property, staffed by professional and considerate hoteliers in the old sense. The building itself is an historic site that has been superbly renovated with furnishings and decor and fitments of high quality. It is warm, welcoming, comfortable everywhere: the rooms, the lobby, the restaurant, the bars.The location couldn't be better: on the Rambla, at the edge of El Raval, and close to everything we wanted to see: the Bari Gotic with the old Cathedral, the Museu Picasso, and its side streets; the El Raval itself with MACBA and CCCB; the Paseo de Graciawith the Fundacio Antoni Tapies and La Perdrera; Parc Montjuic with the Fundacio Joan Miro; and the Sagrada Familia a short subway ride (3 stops) away.The hotel staff were terrific: most had English skills superior to our Spanish skills, and communication was pleasant and easy.At the front desk, at the door, in the bars and the restaurant, all the staff were polite, extremely considerate, and willling to go out of their way to help. Even when busy they were patient and understanding.The H1898 boasts some extras you might not find at other hotels: first, a rooftop terrasse with a pool and a bar, a perfect place to have a late afternoon swim and an evening cava plus a terrific view of the Barcelona skyline and rooftops, down to the Old Port and the harbour; second, a pool/sauna/spa complex in a large stone grotto downstairs: magical and relaxing.We liked H1898 so much after our first two nights there at the start of our trip that we cancelled our reservations at the hotel we had booked for our last week in Barcelona and booked into H1898, and had five wonderful days in a charming, lively,dynamic city made better by having H1898 as our base.

<Content>Stylish and comfortable This is an excellent, and stylish base from which to explore the city. Given the comfort levels and facilities (eg a pool in the basement), we thought the room rates were very reasonable but think that this may change as this new hotel becomes more popular.Highly recommended.

<Content>Underwhelmed by 1898 My husband and I stayed at 1898 July 3 - 5, 2007. My overall assessment is that it was not worth the price. The room was very tiny and without a patio it was close to claustrophobic. We tried to change rooms, but no luck from the front desk. Only one suitcase could be opened at a time. However, the location is convenient We went to the opera, just a few minutes walk away. We saw Manon. Even if you're not an opera fan, Barcelona is the place to see one. The Opera House is exquisite. Make sure you buy your tickets on-line in advance. We had them sent from the opera to the hotel and they were waiting there for us on arrival.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel Experience Wow! We have stayed in many hotels over the years but this must rate as one of our favourites. Situated on La Rambla this is a perfect spot for visiting the sights of Barcelona. The hotel has a wonderful atmosphere, sophisticated but not stuffy. The day we arrived (after a traumatic train journey from France) we relaxed with lunch on the roof terrace followed by an hour in the downstairs pool ,steam and sauna and finished with a large cocktail and the last of the sun bt the rooftop pool! Sheer bliss!!!The breakfast appears expensive at 19 euros per person but as they served until 11am we treated it as brunch and found it to be great value....there was every foodstuff imaginable.Dinner in the restaurant was wonderful but unfortunately almost empty!I cannot praise this hotel enough...so much so that I overlooked the fact that one of our rooms was not available when we arrived, even though it was well after 3pm.....who cares when you can chill out in such luxurious surroundings.Step off the hustle and bustle of La Rambla and into an oasis of peace and calm. The staff were courteous particularly the bar staff on the roof terrace who we got to visit frequently.Can't wait to return.

<Content>Central, fantasic hotel. This hotel very well placed being on La Rambla. Close to the main square and shopping ares and close to the beautiful harbour area. The hotel is very chic with good sized airy, well decorated rooms with large plasma TVs. The bathroom was also spacious (as far as hotel bathrooms go) with marble units and, very important... a proper glass shower screen rather than a shower curtain. The roof terrace is very nice and kept clean although the small pool is very cold. The pool in the basement is great but a little dark. It's more of a spa pool than a swimming pool with it's small size and above average temperature.The staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke good English (I don't have any Spanish).The bar is well stocked but a little expensive, but there are bars all around the hotel.It's a mixture of the big AND the little things which make this hotel great... from the decor and friendlyness of staff to the choice of 9 different types of sleeping pillows.The next time I'm in Barcelona, I'll definately be staying at Hotel 1898.

<Content>Awesome Hotel Went to Hotel 1898 for a pre cruise stay. Well, I must say that this is one of the finest hotels in Barcelona. What a great location, right on La Rambla. The staff, and amenities in the room were first rate. We also loved the rooftop pool, and the special grotto on the ground floor featuring a complete spa pool, gym, sauna, and steam room. There are great restaurants in the area as well so don't be afraid to venture out and explore this magnificient city. We would definitely return to this property.

<Content>Our second visit....says it all. Our second visit to the hotel....5 nights in September 2006 and 7 nights July 2007! Says it all really!However, just to note that it appears children are now accepted as guests at the hotel, this wasn't the case on our first visit. We noticed that as a result the roof top sun terrace was much noisier and the small pool a little overcrowded.

<Content>Great Hotel AND Great Service We loved the hotel and felt they also provided great service. Our luggage didn't arrive for several days and the front desk was so helpful in contacting the airline on our behalf, even calling the airline on their own without us asking, and then reporting to us on what the latest info was from Air France. They also called a taxi for us for our very early morning check out. The Boqueria Market is just down La Ramblas and is an absolute must for eating and people watching. A Starbucks is connected to the hotel lobby and the computer center on the second floor has four computers with free internet. We rented bikes and had a tour from Budget Bikes which is also off La Ramblas and Calle Unlo. It was one of the best things we did in Barcelona. You can just rent the bikes or take a guided tour. A delicious, reasonably priced and very popular restaurant is in the Placa Reial square off La Ramblas called Les Quince Nity. Get there early or you'll find a big long line. We had a great experience at Hotel 1898.

<Content>Honeymooners at Hotel 1898 We went to Hotel 1898 for our honeymoon from June 21-30th (we are 26  29). First off, I would highly recommend this hotel, but there are some things that need some improvement. I understand that my new husband and I are used to five star accomodations in Latin America and the States so the may scew our view a bit. Well, here is a summary of our impression of the hotel.Arrival: We flew Miami to Barcelona (via Madrid) by Iberia. It was a travel disaster. Iberia is the absoluate WORST airline we have ever traveled on. It was more like being on a bus, but I won't bore you with the details. Let me just say they are poorly informed (we both native Spanish speakers, so it wasn't a communication problem), rude and the food was inedible. We are not tall people (5'8, 5'11) and we were smashed into our seats. Anyhow, we made it to the beautiful hotel at around 1 p.m. We figured are room would not be ready and we were right. We went and grabbed a quick lunch and waited in the lobby. The concierge sent us up to the roof for a complimentary glass of Champagne at 2:30 and told is it would be a bit longer (I think he wanted us out of the lobby, we looked a bit shabby). At 3 p.m. we checked and were escorted to our room.Room: We had room 535, it had a HUGE terrace which made the somewhat small room seem much larger! The bathroom was nicer and larger than expected. It had an oversized tub and great bathing products. We really took advantage of our terrace. We bought cheese, wine, and ham at the loca Carrefour Express and listened to our Ipod on the balcony many nights before going out. The room was decorated beautifully, with deep reds and black and white. The bed and pillows were delicious! We were very pleased.Service: I would give them a C (I am a teacher). This is where they need some work, they do not bend over backwards. My husband is Colombian and we both speak Spanish. We found the people in the hotel to be cold and uninviting. The lobby was dead, which we really didn't mind because there are much cooler places in BRC, but they need friendlier service, especially when we were paying top dollar for 9 nights in a top room at the hotel!Amenities: We took advantage of both pools. We are from Miami, so we found the pool on the roof to be FREEZING, but it was a great way to cure a hangover and tired feet! The pool in the Spa was always deserted and was very romantic. We used the steam and sauna, but didn't use any spa services as they were booked when we wanted them. I think they should keep the pool in the Spa open later. It closes at 9 p.m., which seems really early for a city that doesn't eat dinner until 10:30 pm.Food: We ate lunch there on our first day. It was okay. I had a pretty yummy salad and my husband had some rice dish. We felt it was overpriced, but the view is beautiful from the roof and the beds were nice to sit on. We had breakfast one day before a long day of touring and although a bit pricey we thought it was great. We ordered room service once (a fruit salad and club sandwich) it arrived promptly and was quite good. We never ate dinner there because there are SOOO many good restaurants in Barcelona.Summing it up, the hotel is VERY centrally located and is an oasis in the noisy and sometimes frustrating Las Ramblas. It is the most gorgeous structure on the block and it a very relaxing place to hang you hat after a long day of touring or partying. In the end, we were VERY happy with our stay. We just think they need a bit more work on their manners and need to spice it up a bit (a little soft music by the pool maybe?). We were on our honeymoon, so really we were going to be happy no matter what. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.Here are some suggestions for Barcelona:1) Do the Tourbus(it is a great way to see the city and its main sights)2) Walk down to the beach, eat lunch, and lay out on a towel and watch people in their swimsuits (or lack there of). 3) Eat at Tragaluz. We ate next to Woody Allen the night we were there, but the food was so good I didn't notice until on our way out!4) Buy the Top 10 Guide to Barcelona (it has great suggestions and is well organized and it fits in your handbag)5) If you like the 'scene go to CDLD and eat some sushi and then buy a bed and party until 6 a.m.6) Eat tapas at Taller de Tapas, they are the BEST tapas in the city in a lively environment.7) See Goudi, even if it is not your thing.Have Fun!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel with indifferent staff ! Stayed at the 1898 on the basis of previous reviews and arrived with Great expectations ..... maybe I should've taken the novel, because the expectations were only partly realised !The hotel is in a fantastic location right on La Rambla  within walking distance of loads of Barcelona's attractions. The 1898 is beatifully presented with all of the facilities you may need for a short stay. The room was as we requested, spacious, well equipped and very clean, although the views were pretty dissappointing.The rooftop pool is a must after a day wandering around Barcelona trying to figure out how Gaudi persuaded builders to start his wonderful projects  you'll get the views you'll wish you had from your room here. The restaurant is good  the wine massage in the underground spa is a must.We only ordered room service on our last morning, which was very nice, although a little late. But the glass of Cava with breakfast more than made up for it !We did have a few issues with the service at the hotel though.The lock on our door was faulty, which resulted in the room being left open by the maid a couple of times .... fortunately nothing went amiss.When we reported the problem, we were surprised to find that the staff felt we were ruining their day by interupting more important things they had to do! Not the service I'd expect from a 4 star.Concierge facilities were pretty much non-existent, so take a guide book ! ..... when we tried to get the hotel to order a taxi upon our departure, we felt it would've been easier to wander the streets of Barcelona for a couple hours in the blazing heat, dressed in a ski suit, holding aloft a sign in spanish saying 'I hate taxi drivers' !!However ......... Don't be put off staying here. The hotel is great despite the majority of the staff  we did still have a great time ...... probably due to the sangria from the bars on La Rambla !If the staff smiled every now and then and did as you asked this would be a fantastic hotel.

<Content>The 1898 - A Fair Assessment... I rely on tripadvisor quite heavily on selecting a hotel to stay in but it is always important to read between the lines of the various comments. The reviews of the 1898 range from the sublime to the underwhelmed and in fairness both are fair descriptions but also true of any other ranked hotel in Barcelona. This is an extremely comfortable hotel which is fantastically well appointed. If staying in summer the ability to get away from it all and sunbathe by a roof-top pool may for many make it worthwhile in itself. There is also a well equipped gymn and OK Spa. We never had breakfast in the hotel (20 euros ahead!) but worth missing for all the excellent alternatives on the doorstep. The rooms are very comfortable and fully equipped (although the plasmas volume is set to such a low maximum volume that you can't hear them even in your own room). The gentleman who said it was a bit soulless in the bar and reception areas is correct and some of the staff (especially the bar man) could definately have done with a happy fix. All that said this is probably still a good choice for a few days stay in a simply breathtaking city. If you book a room make SURE you get a small balcony at least (we asked to be moved) and I imagine not looking over La Ramblas itself. If you are looking for the hotel to Make your Stay then this may disappoint (as probaly will most others). If you are looking for a fine place to explore and enjoy then it has much to recommend it.P.S I am being very nice by not mentioning that they took 25 minutes to bring our bags from our room when our taxi meter was running (i'm not proud I would rather have brought them down ourselves!)

<Content>Uneven service, loud housekeeping, but a nice property. We had a three-night stay here from June 19 for our wedding honeymoon. Our superior room had a nice large patio, but the room itself was small (more like the classic rooms from the picture).Noise was an issue -- not because of Las Ramblas, but because the chattering housekeepers would laugh up a storm in the hallways early every morning (before 9 AM).More generally, service was uneven: sometimes friendly, sometimes surly. (1) Doorman did not help us with our bags upon depature, even after seeing us carrying them. (2) Doorman told us a cab would take 10 minutes, even though walking one building over enabled us to get one ourselves in 1 minute. (3) Housekeepers were extremely noisy in the hallways as mentioned above. (4) Spa/gym attendant required us to put plastic booties over clean sneaker in order to view the gym, so as not to scuff the floors (which makes no sense in a gym). For 350 Euro/night, guests deserve better service.

<Content>A hidden treasure I wavered between choosing a hotel based upon a local business owner's recommendation and my own search and Trip Advisor. I couldn't have been more pleased with my own search. Following a horrific beginning to my trip (business trip where my luggage was lost and my credit cards, passport and money stolen) where I stayed at a terrible HUSA hotel, I felt as if I had died and gone to heaven when I finally arrived at Hotel 1898. The hotel is beautiful, elegant, clean, professional and exceptionally located without having to be in the middle of the Las Ramblas noise and craziness. I stayed in one of the quiet rooms overlooking the courtyard and it was perfect. My daugher likened this hotel to an elegant cruise ship with the dark wood trim, plush carpets and brass hardware along the hallway.The room was spacious by European standards and was well equiped including very nice toiletries, bathrobes and slippers and tea service. The beds were comfortable although not plush. Internet connection was brisk and there was a good sampling of english language TV stations. The hotel is in very close proximity to the metro and around the corner from Las Ramblas although very quiet and secluded. The lobby has a tea time and cocktail hour but I never saw much action there. There is a roof top deck but my daughter and I were out exploring until late so never had a chance to use it. We had the American Breakfast served to our room. Service was prompt and for those longing for a good American Breakfast, this was it! It was so plentiful, we only needed one tray for the 2 of us.If you are going to Barcelona, search no more. Hotel 1898 is an experience everyone should have. Enjoy!

<Content>Loved it! We had a wonderful long weekend away - just the two of us for a birthday celebration - and would happily recommend this hotel.We booked this hotel on the strength of the Trip Advisor reviews and so were aware that the room we had chosen was small, however it was perfectly formed with everything we could have needed. Yes, the hairdrier was a little tricky, so I would advise taking your own if you have very long hair or would have difficulty in holding down the rocker switch continually. On the plus side the heated bathroom mirrors never got misted up so perfect for make-up and so on.Just a note to anybody wishing to book a room with a terrace, we were located on the 6th floor and the rooms with terraces were on the 5th floor directly below us so we had a clear view onto what may be considered a private area. We were not disturbed by any street noise because again, we knew from previous reviews that it's a good idea to request a quiet room. We were next to the lifts, but were not particularly bothered by them - but then we did go to bed quite late! We did not eat breakfast in the hotel until the last day, partly because of the price, partly because it is so lovely to sit out in the morning sunshine at one of the many cafes serving breakfast. We did take the hotel breakfast before leaving for the airport - it was lovely but expensive all the same.My final point is that the roof terrace is stunning with amazing views over the city. This brings me to our one moan and that is there is a roped off area to the right of the bar with beautiful day beds in the evening sun and well sheltered from the wind. We told we could only use this area if we were drinking cocktails from a rather pricey list (14 euros for a mojito). We did go ahead (too beautiful not too), but felt that if you are paying to stay in the hotel then really all guests should be treated equally. By the way, you cannot sunbathe in this section and so cover up and wear shoes - there is no sign to indicate this but the bar staff won't let you in otherwiseTo sum up, we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!

<Content>Not as good as it has been cracked up to be We were expecting to be staying in a truly remarkable hotel given the recent reviews (making it the No.1 hotel in Barcelona) and the price. Whilst it is an excellent hotel in so many ways it is also a soulless sort of place - the lounges, bars and restaurants were practically empty for the whole duration of our stay. Whilst we don't like crowded hotels, this one was more like a morgue than a hotel. Management needs to have a rethink, because the hotel has the makings of a great hotel - but it will never be that so long as they serve mediocre food and overpriced drinks, and have second rate staff performance. By way of example, the male receptionist who greeted us was the most miserable soul I have had the misfortune to meet for quite a while. We are used to staying in 5* hotels worldwide and the 1898 unfortunately misses the mark by quite a wide margin, both on price and service; I find it hard to believe that, according to Tripadvisor reviewers, it is Barcelona's finest - I guess it deserves a ranking of about #10 at best - but there again I haven't sampled the others yet.

<Content>Fab choice for Barcelona! Booked Hotel 1898 based on previous TA reviews and was not disappointed! It's all been said before - what more can I add?! If you arrive at the airport, just take the airport bus from immediately outside the Terminal door (3.90 Euros per person) as it takes you right into Plaza Catalunya and it's just a short walk round to La Rambla and a couple of blocks down on the right you'll find the hotel.The Hotel is actually an old building (which used to house the Philipine Tobacco company) but was beautifully restored just 2 years ago. We paid 199 Euros per night for a classic room (supposedly their most basic but it was perfect). Our room faced onto an inner courtyard and was very peaceful. To re-iterate previous reviews, all the positive points of the Hotel: location, interior design, spacious public areas, lovely rooftop terrace, beautiful rooms and bathrooms, immaculately clean. Two (very tiny) negative points - (but in no way should it stop you from booking!): the hairdryer was a bit cumbersome and awkward to use, and, while the rooftop terrace is a huge asset in a city centre hotel, the number of loungers is a bit limited. However, after a day's walking  sightseeing, this is a lovely relaxed area with cushioned benches to flop with one of their marvellous glasses of sangria! The breakfast was 19 Euros each - a bit pricey but the quality was excellent (cereals, freshest of fruit, pastries, breads, smoked salmon, cheeses, meats, omelettes made to order etc.) We also used the Royal Hotel just up the road - good value at 9 Euros but not quite the same quality. There is also a Starbucks attached to the hotel if you just fancy a coffee and a muffin one morning. Further down La Rambla, La Boqueria food market is wonderful for a walk round - and you could just pick up fresh fruit, pastries etc there!4 restaurants tested and definitely able to recommend, none too far from Hotel 1898:1. Can Culleretes, C/Quintana 5 (oldest restaurant in Barcelona and cheap too).2. Taller de Tapas, C/Argenteria 51 ( very busy but good tapas).3. Els Quatre Gats, C/Montsio3 (full of character and live music too).4. Les Quince Nits, Plaza Reial (popular with the locals too).Things to do (some obvious!): open top bus tour (23 Euros for 2 days with Bus Turistic), walk down La Rambla watching all the street entertainment, take the lift to the top of the Columbus monument, visit some of Gaudi's buildings (Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, Sagrada Familia), visit the Museu D'Historia for a great insight into Roman Barcelona, visit Poble Espanyol to see the different Spanish styles of building and see the different crafts, tour round FC Barcelona stadium. I actually think Barcelona would be a great place to take children too - apart from the places already mentioned, there's the beach, zoo, aquarium etc!I will definitely go back, and will definitely book Hotel 1898 again! Enjoy!

<Content>disappointing. 5* building run as 2-3* hotel Stayed here at the begining of June having chosen it after reading the reviews on this site but were very disappointed. On the positive side, the location is unbeatable, the decor beautiful and the hotel very clean. But.....We arrived well after check in time but our room was not ready and had to wait nearly half an hour for it. We were given a chit to take to the bar for a complementary drink whilst we waited. We went to the bar which was unattended, there was no bell or any way of attracting attention. We could here the staff in the room behind the bar so, after 7 or 8 minutes, we politely called out to them. We were very surprised (and shocked) when a male voice shouted back wait a minute. A couple of minutes later a female opened the door, poked her head out, and again said wait a minute. It was a further 2-3 minutes before we eventually were served.We booked a de-luxe room which was small, as we expected having read the reviews here, however, it was the terrace that really disappointed us. We selected the de-luxe room specifically for the terrace which was not only much smaller than expected ( the ones either side of ours were much bigger) but also instead of the stone balustrading shown in the pictures, we had a solid wall facing us which not only allowed us no view, but also made it dark and quite dingy. There was no seperate shower cubicle as some other rooms seem to have. Our room was by the elevator and there was the constant noise of the elevator pinging and of other guest laughing and joking throughout the night (fault of the room not the guests).Having missed eating one evening we discovered that room service finished at 11pm. There was absolutely no food available in the hotel after this hour. I have never before come across a hotel that couldn't russle up at least a basic sandwich, even if nothing else. Breakfast was the worst part of the experience. It was very poor but pricey (19 euros). Having sat ourselves down and having waited several minutes, we had to call the attention of one of the waiters, who had totally ignored us up to that point, to ask for tea and coffee. When it eventually came, nearly 10 minutes later, the coffee was fine but tea was a cup of hot water and a point at the teabags on the table. No milk and when requested, hot milk was brought. I should mention that the room was not even half full so there was no excuse of being busy or them being rushed off their feet.The cooked food was not only not freshly cooked, but the pre-cooked food was placed on a normal, unheated counter therefore it was barely warm and very unappetising. This is truely the worst breakfast, food and service, that I have received anywhere, including in 3rd world countries and travelodges! There were several other niggles that I won't mention now.I wondered afterwards about the great reviews that have been given here and realised that had we:1. arrived an hour later - we would not have known that our room wasn't ready and would not have gone to the bar and experienced the problems there.2. been allocated a different room, there are clearly better de-luxe rooms - we would not have been disappointed with the terrace.3. been allocated a room away from the elevator - we would not have been woken up several times a night or been aware that some guest were experiencing that.4. not missed our evening meal - we would not have wanted food at midnight therefore we would not have known that it was not available.5. not had breakfast in the hotel - we would not have known how bad it was.Had none of the above things occurred we would have gone away having feeling that we had stayed in a well located, clean, beautiful looking hotel. We would have been unaware of the shortcomings of it, and, in ignorance, given it an undeserved very good, review.Maybe we were just unlucky with our room allocation, but unless you have been there before and specifically request to have or ask not to be given a particular room, you can't know whether you have been allocated a good or a poor room. A good hotel should offer a consistently good experience, which ever room you are in or whatever time/period you stay there in. Hotel 1898 does not offer this consistency. We may have been unlucky BUT SO MIGHT YOU BE!!!The building has the makings of a 5* hotel but unfortunately it is run like a 2-3* one.

<Content>Good, but some issues As others have noted, the rooms are very, very nice and the location is perfect. We had a 3rd floor superior room on the Ramblas and the room was nicely furnished, large and comfortable. The rooftop deck is great even if the pool is a bit small for actual swimming.However... 1) You can hear the rumbling of the metro at night and 2) You can hear creaking and popping in the walls or air conditioning system? (loud enough to wake me at 4AM and I'm a heavy sleeper) and 3) the staff is hit or miss - some are very friendly, others are brusque. I have to believe that for the money, there are other hotels with nice rooms and locations that don't have the negatives.

<Content>No wonder it's the tops! Thanks reviewers! Definitely a great choice! Visiting Barca for a friend's wedding in the Gothic quarter, this hotel was the obvious choice. I've stayed in Barca several times before in the Rambla area but this hotel is streets ahead of the others. A superb conversion of an old building, well and truly sound-proofed and with fabulous facilities for a hotel in this position, it is hard to find fault with it. Possibly some may find the rooms a bit on the small side and rather dark. But dark is the theme of the hotel throughout and is extremely smart. Our room looked inwards onto a courtyard and directly into several other hotel rooms but that wasn't a problem - better that than having street traffic. Rather silly controls for the lights (letting the designers lose is a dangerous thing sometimes!) meant that you had to have both bedside lights on or off at the same time. But on the plus side, the rooftop bar area with a small pool and masses of lounging space has superb views all over Barcelona, and downstairs in the basement, the small pool has jet corners for getting out the aches after too much shopping in La Rambla. Breakfast is expensive at 鈧?9 but with so many fabulous cafes and the fabulous, famous food market next door, who needs it! Altogether a superb city hotel.

<Content>All round excellent Booked this hotel following the reviews on tripadvisor - what a relaxing place amongst the chaos of Barcelona! Firstly, it is placed just off Las Ramblas. The reception area is just a fantastic area, with large windows, even larger leather sofas and friendly staff. We booked a superior room which had two sets of double opening doors looking over the city rooftops. The room itself was beautiful, wooden floors, comfortable king bed, large wardrobe. The contemporarybathroom was entirely marble with a large bath and a separate shower cubicle (no light in there so couldn't be used though). Room service was excellent. We felt completely happy with our choice of hotel.You must visit the marina/waterfront, its a beautiful area and so well looked after. Take the cable car from the mountainside to the harbour - eye popping views and photo opportunities!We would definately return here - well worth the price.

<Content>Fantastic Like most other reviewers here, I have to agree that the quality, comfort, location and style of this hotel are the best in Barcelona. The rooftop pool and cabanas are reason alone to stay here. Although it is getting pricey (the first time I stayed there a superior room went for 170E, now it's 300), it is still worth the cost for the quality you get. If you can afford it, do it!Another very hip hotel 2 blocks away is the Casa Camper. Check my review there as well.

<Content>This one compares to the best What a gem right in the middle of Barcelona, on the Ramblas. Its stylish, clubby look is an oasis of peace and quiet, in the bedroom, on the roof aside the pool or in the basement in the indoor pool and spa. This is top notch in every aspect. The beds are solid and comfy with a choice of 4 types of pillow. The safe, plasma and tea making all good touches and the bathroom luxurious green marble- the shower rose is the biggest I have seen!! Even down to the Etro toiletries, this is such a classy place!Please dont got there, it might become even more popular and they will push the prices higher!!I am going back!

<Content>Perfect stay in Barcelona My husband and I just returned from this hotel this week, stayed June 2nd, 3rd and 4th. The hotel exceeded our expectations. We loved the decor and the welcoming staff as we checked in. We stayed in a superior room and I would recommend that , the other rooms we peeked in seemed a little small. Our room also faced La Rambla, with absolutely no worries of hearing the street noise at night. We absolutely loved the upstairs outdoor pool and bar on the top floor of the hotel, great for relaxing and having a glass of wine to watch the sunset. We did this as soon as we checked in! This is a romantic setting, that I will never forget. Our plug did not work either in our bathroom, not sure what the deal is with that, but I just used another plug, hopefully they are working on that. We loved the hotel all around. Swanky, but in our opinion comfortable - not pretentious at all. I would recommend, you will not be disappointed. My husband and I travel a lot for work and throughout Europe, so we have a very good idea of what works and if we ever went back to Barcelona, this is where we would stay. Other tips.. Restaurants ... Taller de Tapas, EXCELLENT for Tapas. Also, PLA.... great small romantic place for dinner. Great food too... Both are in the Barrio Gottic. walking distance to both.

<Content>Doesn't live up to its reviews I stayed in this property alone for 2 nights on my way to visiting a friend in Andorra. I selected the property based on the rave reviews and was most disappointed. The hotel is trying so hard to be hipper than hip but at the end of the day, the value is very poor. The room was just OK and smaller than a typical 5-star hotel. The electrical socket in the bathroom doesn't actually do anything and when I called for help they just took my shaver and plugged it into a socket on the floor in the bedroom. Same for making morning coffee in the room. Hmm?! I paid a very high rate which did not even include breakfast. Upon check-in they went out of their way to point this out to me and that breakfast was available in their restaurant at 23 Euros. I passed.OK the location is geat but there are other properties at lower prices equally well located.Overall. I found the hotel quite pretentious but very ordinary and poor value for money. I have given a lot of thought to why the reviews of this property are so good and I can't really figure this out. I do spend a lot of time in Asian hotels where far better rooms are generally available at far lower rates in 5-star properties. Perhaps I am spoiled for choice by this. It's not really the price. i don't mind paying a high price but I do expect value and this hotel simply did not deliver.I would definitely not stay here again or recommend it to others.

<Content>Histroy meets La Rambla I just came back from a business meeting held an the Hotel 1898. Overall, a great experience. Hotel rooms are okay size with beautiful wood floors and marble bathrooms. Also, the Etro products were nice. And the rain forest shower a great way to wake up. I stayed at a room on the 6th floor with a private patio. What a great experience! I would recommend this hotel for all travelers. It has a quite and tranquil athmosphere and you are just in front of one of the busiest areas: La Rambla and Barrio Gotic. I would go back anytime!

<Content>Great location and great stay Hotel 1898 is right on Las Ramblas, centrally located near two metro stops. When we arrived at our room, we were very happy with its size, cleanliness and layout. We had a peek-a-boo view of Las Ramblas, which worried me a little - it can get loud at night, and we happened to be there at a time when drunken British soccer hooligans were out all night long singing their little soccer songs on Las Ramblas. But the windows are double-paned, and the lager louts did not disturb my sleep. There is a very cool indoor pool, sauna and exercise area in the basement of the hotel. The staff of the hotel were friendly, helpful and knowledgable. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Overrated Hotel We chose the hotel after all the great reviews we read about it but it really did not live to its reputation. For the money we paid for this hotel, staying in the superior room, we were not so pleased. I think it's overrated. The room that we had, had a sink with a very slow drain and we called to have it fixed and nothing was done. There was one employee, though, that was super nice. He moved us and our luggage and belongings when he found out that someone missed our request for a nonsmoking room at the time of reservation. The rooms aren't really sound proofed and being next to La Rambla, it was hard to have a good sleep. The food wasn't great either. We had the New Year's eve party at the Eurostar Grand Marina Hotel and stayed there one night and it was less money and more amenities like 2 toilets, and bigger room and the food for that party was awesome!

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I spent 4 days at this great hotel. The rooms were vary spacious (USA Standards) then most European hotels. Flat screens, great baths, and linen. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. the location is great if you are wanting to be right on Las Ramblas and easy access to metro as well. On the weekend evenings, they have local bands come to play at the bar, great place to start the night at with some drinks and nice music.We are coming back in 2007 and decided to book this hotel again for all the postivies, and no negatives that we found.

<Content>One of the best ever We stayed 3 nights and picked this based on Tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed as, whilst it isn't the cheapest hotel, the facilities and the staff are extremely good. The rooftop pool and comfy seats were a really oasis after a busy day and the views were fantastic. The rooms, and in particular the bathrooms, were of the highest standard but the best of all was down in the basement. The pool may have been small but it was never too busy and, on top of excellent sauna and steam room, the pool had 2 water jets, the jacuzzi jets and jets in metal loungers in the pool to massage yourself with.You cannot fault the quality of the hotel decor and the location is in the middle of Las Ramblas and so easy to go in either direction. Drinks were a bit expensive and whilst breakfast at 19 euros may be expensive for some, there was a Continental option at 9 euros.One of the best and easiest hotels we've ever stayed in.

<Content>Wonderful stay! Had 3 wonderful nights at this hotel. We booked a privilege room which was roomy and exceptionally clean. Our window was facing La Ramblas but once the windows closed you couldn't tell there were thousands of people on the streets below. The location was perfect and convenient. Service was also very good and the decor was hip but classy. The bathroom was huge and the shower/bath combo were the best. After a not so great night at a nearby hotel the previous night...Hotel 1898 was a welcome and pleasant surprise.

<Content>eleven out of ten every once in a while you stay somewhere that is actually BETTER than all the reviews and websites. This place is gorgeous. We cannot fault it in any way. Excellent location - right in the middle of the action, three doors from fresh food market, 20 metres from the Metro, walking distance to everything yet quiet and so professional. The decor is stunning ( and I'm an Interior Designer) and at the end of a looooong day of sightseeing etc... we discovered the rooftop - the daybeds and the bar with spunky little waiters spinning their trays and flirting with the customers, serving huge jugs of Sangria and playing Michael Buble ( live in Spanish). Then theres the underwater 'grotto' pool ! And all for such a reasonably price. Magnificent.( not going to post photos as they cant do it justice - you have to see for yourself)

<Content>Hotel 1898 My DH and I stayed here for 3 nights pre cruise 04/30/07- 05/03/07. We booked this hotel based on trip ad visor reviews. It is a reallygood hotel but not the best I have ever stayed at. We booked a superior room which was lovely, but very small with only one window looking out into the back court yard.The bathroom was really beautiful with a really cool shower and enormous bath towels. Very hard mattress but was so tired from walking all over Barcelona was able to sleep well. We did not eat the breakfast for 18 euros. Many places to eat around hotel. Ate at the Attic restaurant right across the street, need a reservation for sure. Next year when I return to BCN I will probably try another hotel there are many to choose from.

<Content>Location x 3, design and atmosphere We booked the hotel based on Trip Advisor rating and experience from sister Hotel Jazz (which is more modest and less expensive).The experience lived up to our expectations. As we were a large family group, and we got one suite upgraded to a roof-top suite with a private pool, it actually surpassed our expectations!One thing to remember if you have the pool though, there are other rooms above your terrace, so it麓s not for skinny dipping...The kids also tried the roof-top and inhouse pools, among which the indoor pool was the favourite.To have a roof-top terrace with lots of nice sofas, chairs and tables - and a pool, right above the Ramblas, well it麓s hard to beat!All rooms were nicely furnised in a comfy and modern style. The staff was young, courteous, friendly and helpful.Breakfast was nice (and as others say - expensive...) and with a large selection of tasty food and drink (bubbles for breakfast?).We麓ve tried the Arts, Jazz, Grand Hotel Florida and other hotels in Barcelona - but I think we麓ll go for the Hotel 1898 the next time as well. The price / location / hotel combo is proably the best in town.

<Content>Great Hotel - Fantastic for a small business meeting This is a fantastic hotel in a febulous location.We chose to run Customer council of top CEO's at this hotel and it worked perfectly !The staff are attentive, food creative and REALLY tasty and it is the cleanest hotel I ahve ever been to! The staff seem to be cleaning every minute of the day - its spotless...Pillow menu in the bedroom is a nice touch and the bedrooms are just greatTwo very small but important faults...Cooked items at breakfast were cold - it cant be rocket science to find a way of keeping breakfast warm!!! Come on this is not difficultAnd please please get some better plastic glasses for the roof terrace - i promise you, you cam buy really good plastic glasses now!I would however HIGHLY recomend this hotel , and also the Restaurant Quo Vadis round the corner - the settng looks nothing but the food is tops - our clients feasted on , King Prawns, Steak  wild strawberries and raspberries for dessert !!

<Content>Very Enjoyable Great Hotel booked on the strength of reviews on Tripadvisor, fantastic location. We stayed here for 3 nights in early May.There have been a few complaints about the expensive breakfast but if you like a large breakfast like we do it is well worth it. Just one minor complaint about breakfast - the 'hot' food is barely luke warm (but still very tasty), surely the hotel can find a better way of keeping the food hot?The roof top pool and terace is great but be warned that the pool is not heated! Very refreshing on a hot day, but otherwise could be a bit of a shock. The downstairs pool (heated), sauna and steamroom were very good, and quiet.Now - just a plea on behalf of he mime artists on the Ramblas, PLEASE - if you want to photograph them give them a euro or two (or even a few cents), they are very entertaining and go to an awful lot of trouble to make up etc, but it did annoy us people trying to sneak a photo then walking off without paying them anything.

<Content>Fantastic !!! What a fantastic hotel !!! I took my fiance for a surprise 40th birthday present and what a brilliant time we had. The hotel is grand without being too pretentious. I booked directly with the hotel (which is cheaper than through an agency) and explained that this was a special occasion and could they allocate an extra special room. When we checked in I mentioned this and although our booking was for a classic room, we were placed in a fabulous room with its own terracing (room 202). The room itself was maybe not the biggest but the attention to detail cannot be faulted. The choice of lighting, the digital radio, the tea/coffee facilities (but take some teabags along if you need your fix first thing in the morning!), the bathroom is stunning and not to mention the spa, pool and steam rooms. What an absolute pleasure it was. Las Ramblas is an experience, the city bus tour a waste of money as its much nicer to walk to attractions. We will certainly be going back to Barcelona and will stay at Hotel 1898 again. Have fun !!!

<Content>Perfect for a short break We have just returned from a 3-night break in early May. The H1898 is a well-presented modern boutique-style hotel in an absolutely fabulous central location on Las Ramblas. Despite the busy location the hotel was an oasis of calm and our room (which faced into a central courtyard/atrium) was quiet whatever the hour.We found service to be pleasant and prompt; the wonderful breakfast extensive and reasonable value at 19 Euro; the public lounge areas comfortable and impressive; the rooftop lounge/pool area fantastic (though with so much to see we didn't have much time to use it); and the basement pool/spa well presented (even if the pool was a little on the cool side).If we were being critical we might say that the hotel is a little dark, mainly due to the style and finishes (our room saw little daylight) and the room and bathroom could have been larger.Overall I would heartlily recommend this hotel. Given the wide choice available in a city like Barcelona we chose it for it's high tripadvisor rating. If you do the same we don't think you will be disappointed.

<Content>"I'll be back!!!" We went to Barca a couple of years back and had our stay spoilt by an overrated shabby hotel. Needless to say, our experience prompted us to be a bit more thorough in our hotel research since then and it was time to return to what has now become our favourite short break destination.Our research led us to this gem of a hotel situated as near as can be to the centre of Barcelona and unlike our previous hotel encounter in this magnificent city, this hotel did live up to the hype.From the friendly helpful concierge who greeted us at the door we knew we were in for a good stay. The staff were always falling over backwards to help, and when I wasn't too sure of my skills with the Spanish language, most of the staff spoke good English and were always polite and welcoming.The room was very well appointent with a large double bed, lcd tv on the wall, good sized bathroom with power shower and small balcony. Although as expected in the middle of the city, the views were of other buildings, this was a welcome touch. The rooms were very clean and toiletries and mini bar were well stocked.Unfortunately it was a bit cold in December to test out the rooftop pool so I am unable to comment on that but would expect that if it is in keeping with the rest of the hotel, then it would be just as good.It is in a great location for shopping, site seeing and eating out.I no longer need to look for a suitable hotel for when I return to Barcelona as I will be staying at Hotel 1898 every time.

<Content>Exquisite Hotel, Fantastic Location Booked through Expedia, stayed during Easter break 9th April for three nights. We had a very quick check in, with my request for a quiet room on the upper floor provided. The rooms are soundproofed with nice lighting system. Bathrooms are my thing and it was very nice especially the heated mirror. Location fantastic on the upper part of La Ramblas just beside Le Meridien. Booked hotel because of good reviews on this site and it lived up to its reputation. Hotel interior quite trendy, rooms spacious and quiet, nice bar area, the staff however are the best selling point of this hotel.I have stayed in many four and five star hotels from North America, Ireland, UK etc. The staff at hotel 1898 would surpass most of those I have encountered. A very professional hotel from the back of house to front of house staff.Just to let you know how much I enjoyed my visit this is the first review I have taken the time to write!

<Content>Loved it, Loved it, Loved it I agonised for quite some time about which hotel to book for our 3-night stay in April (back yesterday - depressed!).Once I had seen 1898, I kept coming back to it and booked it once I had gotten my head around paying so much for the hotel (拢156 per night incl breakfast). Well, my wife and I were not disappointed - FANTASTIC. Here is the good stuff:The decor in the hotel is exquisite, so tastefully done that you could while away many hours just chilling in the lounge or bar. Our room was small but perfectly formed, really classy decor again, great bed, a choice of pillows(!), plasma tv, great bathroom etc etc. Everything you could possibly want.What made the hotel for us was actually what was above the hotel, i.e. the rooftop deck and pool - awesome. I'm afraid some of the Barcelona attractions took a back seat each day as we chilled with our sangrias by the pool, with the mild din of la rambla in the background. Yes, the drinks were expensive, but worth it in our opinion. The basement spa area was also really nice, although we only used it once because the weather was so nice! The location is also great, right on the rambla for convenience, but once inside, you would never know it.Not so good:Some people mentioned noise in their reviews which concerned me, as I am a light sleeper. I was woken two of the three nights, but that was by people coming back to their rooms. I never heard the maid service etc at all and this wouldn't stop me staying here again. Better sleepers probably woudln't have heard anything.I didn't find the staff to match up to the overall 5 stars (although still 4 stars). For example, we sent an email in advance requesting a quiet room and never got a response, and generally the level of servive could I think be a bit better.SummaryOverall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, especially if you want to stay somewhere where you can happily spend some time relaxing, rather than charging around Barca. I would thoroughly recommend staying somewhere (if not 1898) that has a rooftop pool.Final point - due to my estensive research beforehand (AKA procrastination), I recognised quite a few hotel names as we explored Barca. Montecarlo is right opposite 1898 and looked nice from the outside - again, great location. Passed Casa Camper on last day, near the University, looked nice. Torre de Catalunya is right next to Sants station and too far out of the action in my opinion.

<Content>A Fine Hotel - Value for Money My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in April of this year. The hotel is in an excellent location on Las Ramblas. The room was a good size with plenty of space. Tea/coffee facilities were provided and the minibar was fully stocked. The restaurant and bar are fine especially after a long day's sight seeing. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was expensive at 19 euros per person but you could have as much as you liked. The weather was rainy so we didn't use the roof terrace or pool but this would have been a plus point in good weather. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone wishing to travel to Barcelona. The hotel was a bit pricer than most but we considered it money well spent.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We spent four nights here with our two children in late March. The location is excellent and the hotel wonderful. The indoor swimming pool and the rooftop terrace, also with pool, are delightful. We booked the hotel based in part on the glowing TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed.

<Content>Understated but wonderful! if you blinked you would miss this hotel. no big sign, even our taxi driver hadn't heard of it. booked this hotel after reading the reviews on trip advisor for my sisters 21st birthday surprise. was worried i would be dissapointed with the hotel considering the price. I should not have worried and my sister loved it. yes you probably pay a bit extra for being right on the Las Ramblas but its worth it, its a great central location. the rooms are lovely, we stayed in one of their classsic rooms which are the cheapest and it was lovely and clean, nicely decorated, big comfy bed, gorgeous bathroom with fantastic shower. I stayed in another 4-star hotel in barcelona, which was more expensive, not on the las ramblas and not as nice. I would deffinately reccommend this hotel and probably more to couples and groups of adults than families.

<Content>BRAVO - fantastic hotel We have just returned from 3 days in Barca staying on Hotel 1898. It was a fantastic stay. The service, location, the cleaning, design and the rooms was so perfect and not to forget the most fantastic spa and roof terasse - also with pool and a great view of Barcelona.We are used to very high level hotels, but this was in a league of its own. BRAVO.

<Content>Good Hotel, but Not Exceptional Value We stayed for four days at this hotel last week (the week after Easter). I would say the hotel is perfectly adequate for a 4 star hotel, with reasonably-sized rooms and adequate service, but perhaps not quite the top notch status as some other reviews might suggest. Although we have no real complaints about the hotel (it justifies its 4-stars), we are not convinced of the premium it seems to command. (It would, for example, have been cheaper for us to stay at the Claris, the Sofia Gran or the Hilton Diagonal Del Mar - all 5 star hotels).What you're paying for, I guess, is its very central location at the heart of town, and close to attractions/amenities such as the ramblas, the gothic quarter and near to transport links.It also has a panoramic roof terrace, with good seating and an outdoor pool (which was surprisingly warm at this time of year), as well as a small (and stone cold) indoor pool and spa. However, there is only one restaurant, and one bar (based round the lobby) and one cafe (not counting the resident Starbucks). The restaurant is competitively priced (at least in hotel terms), but was surprisingly devoid of guest, as it is very easy to eat out (which we did on a couple of nights). The breakfast buffet has a diverse range, and is good value if included in your booking.Overall, this is a competent and well-located hotel, particularly if you can get a competitive rate (which was hard for us, even three months out). However, for the price of 230 euros/拢160, it's not quite in the same league as (for example) the Plaza in New York, Claridges in London, or the Shangri La's in Asia. (It's more akin to the Malmaison boutique chain in the UK - but perhaps costing slightly more, with fewer extra touches.)Having said this, though, our stay was pleasant and comfortable, and our only complaint (if that's the right word), is that they sting you 16 euros to advertise one of their flaky umbrellas when it rains. (Guests staying in the hotel opposite were treated to complimentary Meridien golf umbrellas.) As for Barcelona, if this is rated as one of the best hotels, then all the other 4 (and 5) star hotels in the city must be considerably wanting. We observed that, although we speak three different languages, it definitely helps to speak Spanish (and specifically the local Catalonian dialect), else you tend to be treated as a second-class citizen with all but the most service-conscious locals (who are few and far between, from our experience). Petty theft in the area also seems surprisingly common - we even met a well-travelled couple who got their handbag/purse stolen by thieves who threw pidgeon poo at them (and used it as a distraction for robbing them).

<Content>A good hotel located at the centre of the action The 1898 is a good, modern, efficient hotel located at the top of La Rambla.It seems to have been recently refurbished, and to a high standard. The rooms are dark wood in decor and have an excellent lighting and air-con system.The spa downstairs is adequate. The pool is small but comfortable, ditto the gym.One let-down is the bar area, which is long and narrow and a bit soulless, but as you've got literally hundreds of fantastic bars on your doorstep in Barca it's not a problem.Even though it's located in the heart of La Rambla, the interior rooms are extremely quiet, so sleeping is not a problem. I took my 75-year old mum to the hotel and she slept no problem at all.

<Content>An Easter treat! We recently stayed for 3 nights at this hotel over Easter having been upgraded from its sister hotel Jazz, which we orignally booked, due to a computer booking problem. What a treat! The hotel is at the top end of the Ramblas close to Plaza Catalunya and is a tranquil haven away from all the activities outside. This is an excellent hotel with high standards of customer service, presentation and cleanliness. Huge comfy sofas in the lounge area nice to sink into with a drink from the bar. Prices are expensive compared to bars off the Ramblas but nice to have a night cap before retiring for the night. Took the continental breakfast served in our room which was good value at 9 Euros including croissants, pastries, rolls, jam, toast, yoghurt, fresh orange juice, coffee, more than enough to keep you going. Rooms were very smart with wooden floors, plasma TV, turn down service at night with free dish of chocolates, also slippers and robes provided, and choice of 4 pillows. Also the hotel smelled lovely throughout! We will book this hotel again when we return to Barcelona.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed here over easter and it is an excellent hotel.Good service, good quality rooms with little touches like bathrobes, slippers, mini-bar and mood lighting.Rooftop terrace was good place to wind down with a beer/wine after doing the usual touristy things with great views, nice sized pool and comfy seating.Bar is a little expensive but no more than other hotel bars on the main street. Ok for a drink before going out or retiring.Location is also good giving easy access to galleries, port, shopping and of course restaurants and bars.Will be back.

<Content>had a GREAT experience at this hotel Just for a point of reference we are very well traveled and live in NYC. Have stayed at Claridge's in London, de Russie in Rome, Plaza Athene/Ritz in Paris etc ....Had two rooms for 5 nights as we were with our kids ages 11  13.Pros: Fabulous beds and pillowsRecently done decorWe had rooms w/ the most AMAZING TERRACES I have ever seen. They had two padded banquets that you could use for sunbathing if the weather was warm enough.Fabulous location.2 fabulous pools one on the roof and one in the gymgreat water pressure in the showersreason hairdryer was so heavy was that it was fabulous and worked!room service was on time to the minute and the breakfast buffet was superior to a lot of nicer hotelsmaid service was good especially considering the mess my kids left everymorningTo address some of the other peoples complaints:We had terrific service. We changed one dinner reservation 4 times in one day -- I know a nightmare ... don't ask -- they did it all with a smile. We were given multiple city maps, room keys etc.Taxis: We come from a busy city and sometimes there aren't taxis to be found. We were advised (honestly which was thoughtful) to take the metro one night (soccer match/raining) which we did, we were found taxis another night, we also walked outside onto the Ramblas and hailed a cab no problem by ourselves.Air conditioning: we couldn't use the thermostat and someone was in our room within 5 minutes showing us how.They were lovely with my children who would occasionally camp out in the lobby .Noise: I will agree that occasionally you heard footsteps and that the marble floor area in front of the elevators was loud from the maid's cart rolling over it. We were able to seep until 10am most mornings with no problemIt does not quite have the finesse of some of the older established hotels but we had a wonderful stay. In the end I think it partially comes down to how expensive a hotel like this is for you. If you have saved for years to take this trip and it is a stretch you might not find it perfect and it would be frustrating. We did not find it to crazy expensive and really enjoyed our stay, hence the good review. I have never stayed at a perfect hotel anywhere in the world -- life is complicated and there are always glitches and dissapointments.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We visited over the first weekend of April 2007 having seen the good reviews written here, and weren't disappointed. Everything about the hotel was excellent. This must be the quietest city-centre hotel I've ever stayed in - we weren't woken by the usual emptying of bins at 0300, nor by traffic in the morning. The place was immaculately clean, and the staff attentive and helpful. Even the price we paid from a discount website was reasonable. The location is about as central as it's possible to get, even if the tourist scene on La Ramblas is rather tacky. The receptionist provided a useful map of the city centre on arrival. Free internet access was fine and fast with a good signal in our room on the fifth floor and in the public areas. We didn't try the restaurant, as BCN is full of restaurants and bars of all types and standards - it was fun to browse from bar to bar on tapas.

<Content>Huge WOW!!! I was booked and had to stay at Le Meridien, across the street, for one night, but I kept looking at the Hotel 1898 because it is just so elegant, especially compared to Le Meridien. Needless to say, I quickly moved and was thrilled. This is a 5 star for Barcelona since hotels there are just so so, in general, but this one is on par with some of the best hotels I have stayed at. The place is brand, spanking new. It is immaculately clean (there are cleaning people everywhere), and it defines form and function (as opposed to many Spanish newer hotels which focus on form rather than function). I was so very impressed with every aspect of this hotel (and I can't say enough about how picky I am) that I wanted to post my thoughts asap. If you are going to Barcelona, this should be your first place to check for rates if you want a place in the center of town, beautiful big, clean rooms (I am not sure what happened with the previous reviewer but all the rooms I saw--211 was the size of a small apartment--were great), and an incredibly warm and welcoming staff. If you don't value these aspects, well, try Le Meridien...

<Content>Nice but worth it ??? We stayed in H1898 last weekend - beautiful decor and fab location but at 鈧?00 + VAT for three nights in March in a compact room I'm not sure I'd go back for a few reasons. With such a fantastic city as Barcelona to see we spent very little time in the hotel but when we did it was REALLY REALLY noisey. The rooms have wooden floors so you hear people walking about in the rooms above and beside you, the areas besides the elevators were marble with the same result and the bing everytime the elevators stopped at our floor was also a bit loud. I'd reserved the room directly with the hotel in early January and requested an early check-in but when we arrived we were told that it wasn't possible because it was a busy weekend - it was 11.45am Fridaymorning. We had to come back at 3 to check-in. Disappointing given the request was made months before directly with the hotel and the less than apologetic attitude of the receptionist.That said the guys behind the bar in the hotel were great fun and make a mean cocktail (even if its pricey by Barcelona standards) and the pillows were amazing...but next time we'll stay in an apartment which seems to be the preferred option of quite a few people

<Content>Service hiccups and very noisy! I stayed at the Hotel 1898 March 26-31 and was disappointed. In fact, I'm writing this at 2am the night before a long trans-Atlantic flight back to the States because I can't sleep! It sounds like there's a club in my room ... it's so loud that I can sing along with the music when my head isn't about to explode from the club beat. Apparently, there's a nearby club that literally rocks the house on the weekends. BTW, they're currently playing Flashdance so the club has questionable music taste.The hotel itself is reasonably nice but the service doesn't match the decor. Other reviewers have noted the location but, believe me, there are lots of hotels in the same location to choose from - it doesn't have to be this one.My primary purpose of being in Barcelona was business and, as such, my key complaints are those of a business traveler looking for service and efficiency ... definitely not what I found:(1) I wasn't offered a map of the city when I checked in(2) I had problems with temperature control in my room. I spent a couple of warm days in the room before calling the front desk to look at the AC, which they said was turned off .... why, they couldn't say. It certainly wasn't obvious the AC was turned off because it's tucked into a side of the closet that requires a sleuthing operation to find.(3) The hair dryer is one of the worst I've ever seen ... It feels like no exagerration to say it weighs a ton and you have to hold down the button continually to keep the dryer on. I had dents in my thumbs after I finished drying my hair.(4) In general, I had a lot of problems with noise .... there was a lot of hammering away in different parts of the hotel during the day and housekeeping was always really loud. I had to call the front desk twice about noise just so I could sleep away some jet lag for 1 hour in the late afternoon.(5) It's impossible to get a taxi at the hotel. This is a real issuefor people staying at the hotel for business reasons. I was late toa conference 2 days in a row because it took so long to get a taxi. The hotel apparently has no special relationships with taxi companies.(6) I had to call the front desk to get information on accessing theInternet. I don't understand why this wouldn't be explained atcheck-in or on a sheet/placard in the room. I spent 5-10 minutes searching for this information in the room before I finally gave up and called the front desk.(7) The hotel gym is missing one of the set of two weights that I use in my workouts. The weight was missing all week so it didn't seem like anyone was in a hurry to replace it. This may seem like a minor issue, but it added up to a general inattention to the detail that creates a good hotel experience.

<Content>WOW! Fantastic hotel, should be 5 star. Stayed there for 2 days whilst in Barca for the England match. What a fantastic hotel, very clean and modem, friendly staff and a pool on the roof that was as warm as a bath! Food and drink at the hotel maybe a little expensive but well worth it, great buffet breakfast. I will return to this hotel for sure next time i'm in Barcelona.

<Content>Fantastic - a great hotel in a brilliant location What a great hotel. We booked a standard room for a long weekend as a bit of a treat, and it was well worth the money. We called ahead and asked to be on a high floor and at the front (after reading comments about the noise from the club below), and were given a fantastic room with a view over the Ramblas. The room and bathroom were big, the bed huge, and the decor throughout was stylish without being desperately trendy. The location could not have been better; we felt pleased to be back there whenever we returned. We were on the third floor - you could hear the club below, but only vaguely. The service was great, and the sense was that you were an appreciated guest. We are pretty fussy (!), and we loved this place. PS. Shop around for the best room-rate as prices seem to vary quite widely.

<Content>Nice hotel but.. Lovely hotel and rooms (a matter of taste I guess from other reviews). Yes they are a bit small but hey it was spotless and well appointed.We stayed there for our 25th wedding anniversary and had a great time in Barcelona and at the hotel in general.There was a problem with the hot water and it took me three attempts to persuade reception / maintenance to do anything about it.The bar is great and the staff very friendly, there was always someone cleaning something so everywhere was spotless.The stay was not excellent in my opinion as we had a room with a marble floor outside and you could hear everyone walk past and the maid service trolly sounded like a tram coming down the corridor. I have to say the room cleaners were very noisy and did not seem to respect the fact that people wanted a lay in in the mornings!If I went again I ask for a room away from the lift and maid station, apart from that it is a really nice hotel!

<Content>Loved, Loved Loved it! Stayed at this hotel 17 to 20 March and loved every minute of it. Definately the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at. The lobby/reception/bar area is gorgeous. The roof top deck was a fantastic chill out area, but was a bit too windy when we were there to try out the roof top pool. We did spend a couple of hours in the basement spa pool and had it all to ourselves which was wonderful. We had booked a classic room which is listed as having an inner atrium courtyard view, however, when we shown to our room 606, on the 6th floor, we actually had an outside view, overlooking some of the private terraces of the rooms below. It wasn't a bad view by any means and as we were expecting an inside room then to have an outside view and be able to see the sun was a bonus.The room was lovely, very clean, king size bed, minibar (for which the prices were very reasonable), kettle, bathrobe and slippers. I had pre-ordered a bottle of Cava to be brought to the room and this was delivered within 5 mins of being shown to the room. It did take us a few minutes to work out how the shower worked and it was a day before we realised there was an aircon control in the cupboard. The room became stiffling hot and we thought the aircon was not working. We called recepton and someone was at the door within 2 minutes to show us how to work the aircon unit.The breakfast was divine, there was so much to chose from although I wouldn't be able to justify paying 18 euros each so thankfully this was incuded in the rate we paid for the room.Our only real critisism is the cost of the drinks in the bar. Yes you expect them to be on the expensive side but 25 euros for 2 glasses of sangria is a bit on the steep side and we didn't order any more drinks in the bar after that. Also there is a distict lack of English TV channels. Dont get me wrong, we weren't there to watch TV, but a couple of nights were shattered after all the walking we did and it would have been nice to go back and chill in the room after dinner and watch a film.Other than that, we cannot fault this hotel and when we go back to Barcelona we will definately stay here again.

<Content>Fantasic. No Complaints We have recently returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel 1898. Wow the pictures on the website don't do it justice. It is spotless, clean, the staff are friendly and helpful. We had a superior room, decorated beautifully with a lovely terrace with table and chairs - extremely peaceful given the location. The spa is fab and a great way to refresh yourself after a hard day sightseeing. Would definitely recommend this hotel however as advised would try and get a BB rate for our return stay as the breakfast was 19 euros each. The breakfast was great with plenty to eat so you could always go back for seconds which we did. Sightseeing we would recommend the red hop on hop off bus and would get a 2 day ticket. If the weather is nice, definitely go for a boat trip, we did the port trip for 35 minutes as limited for time but should really have done the full 1.5 hour tour including port and coastline - much more interesting. Fabulous hotel and have recommended it to 2 friends in work who are interested.

<Content>Superb Hotel - worth the 拢151 without a doubt I stay in Barcelona quite often but this hotel made this trip really memorable. The staff are genuinely friendly and helpful and the rooms are a decent size. The decor is amazing (classic modern) Complimentary slippers, bath robe and water, decent minibar without the daft electronic tagging so you can shove a bottle of wine in yourself. The TV is flash but lacks channel variety and there are no fils if you are stuck in for a night.The location is excellent yet the rooms are really quiet, I will be back whenever I can afford it..Attic restaurant across the road is nice for lunch too.

<Content>Wonderful Location; Not Quite as Good as Prior Reviews While pleased with the 1898, I was dissappointed given the reviews I perused before booking there. The room we had - a superior room - was beautiful and looked over La Ramblas. Our luggage was delayed a day and the front desk staff was disinterested at best; restaurant recommendations were mechanical: they had a few restaurant cards in a drawer at the front desk and fished one out when an inquiry was made. Staff seemed to have little interest in getting folks to the right place for their budget-tastes.Perhaps it was a language issuebut it did not spoil an otherwise wonderful stay, location is perfect and booking on the hotel website gave us the best rate which included a fabulous breakfast (otherwise 19 euros per person). I麓d recommned but you need to do your own homework re: restaurants; tours etc.

<Content>Fantastic hotel with a great spa A lovely hotel which couldn't be more central but was still lovely and quiet. The spa and roof top pool really make this hotel and are just what you need after a long days sightseeing.Our room was comfy, spacious enough and the bathroom had a great huge rainwater shower head and bathrobe, slippers, nice toiletries etc. The only downside of the room was a rather dingy view over the back streets rather than the rambla that we were hoping for but it was nice and quiet probably because of this.A few eating out tips - Bar Ra behind the market is great for breakfast (as is the market itself), the bar next to the hotel is FAB and you can dance until 3am but don't eat in the Taxidermista restaurant (it was in our guide book as recommended but we thought it was terrible). Also despite what everyone says about the pick pockets we felt really safe although we were careful and didn't use the underground; we used the open top buses to get around as you can jump on and off as many times as you like. The bus from the airport was great too (only @ 4 euros) and dropped us off in Placa Catalunya which was only 5 mins from the hotel.All in all a great 3 day break!

<Content>Great rooftop pool What a superb hotel, lived up to our expectations. Every amenity you could wish for, lovely spa pool downstairs, bar, restaurant and the icing on the cake the rooftop pool. Much to my delight I was told when we checked in that the rooftop pool was heated. Being rather a fan of rooftop pools I'd been looking for a heated one for our stay in January, but couldn't find much detail on websites. Yes, the bar was a bit expensive, but this is the best hotel (in my opinion) on La Rambla, right in the heart of things. The breakfast was excellent, but try and track down a BB rate.Overall I am a tough customer to please, but I couldn't find fault with anything, apart from having to come home!

<Content>Fantastic place to stay I've just returned from a short break in Barcelona with my Husband who had fortunately booked hotel H1898, based upon previous trip advisor reviews.We were not dissapointed, the public areas are decorated beautifully and are a lovely place, to sit and relax with a drink from the bar. On the first night we arrived there was live jazz in the bar which only added to the atmosphere.Our room was lovely; modern decor, spotlessly clean and the bathrobes, toothbrushes, shaver were nice finishing touches. We had breakfast in the hotel on both mornings of our stay and I would recommend taking the time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in the dining room which over looks the Rambalas. The food was good, with lots of typically spanish dishes including a great tortilla.The hotel is in the centre of the Rambalas yet is quiet and peaceful inside, check in and check out, was quick and efficient and the staff were helpful and polite. I would highly recommend this hotel, my only regret is that we couldn't stay longer.

<Content>Fantastic hotel Stayed at Hotel 1898 for 4 nights - it was great. The reception areas were great, which created a very good impression upon arrival. We arrived early, but the hotel were able to allocate the room with the minimum of delay.We got an interior room on the third floor. Whilst a Ramblas view would have been nice, the room we got was excellent. Spacious, well set-out, clean and tidy. As was the bathroom.The rooftop pool was great - and you get great views up there. Obviously, in February its not really sunbathing weather but there is a spacious leisure area on the roof that would be ideal for relaxation.The basement spa was also excellent - the facilities available were great. We never tried the hotel restaurant (plenty of places to eat nearby) and only used the hotel bar once. To be fair, it was pretty pricey - but not excessive.We would stay here again - and would recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona.Fantastic!!

<Content>Very good but not quite perfect / weird smoking policy First of all, the 1898 is an excellent Hotel with a brilliant location right in the centre of Barcelona. I booked it based on the previous very positive reviews. Basically I agree with them, but I would like to share some additional observations that led to my overall positive but not perfect experience. First of all, the reception staff was slow and very inflexible the day I arrived. Basic questions could not be answered and the check-in was tedious. I had reserved a non-smoking room: when I asked the receptionist, I was told that the whole hotel is non-smoking but that all rooms are equipped with ashtrays. Isn麓t that a contradiction? In effect, when I arrived in my room and I found the ash-tray on the table and one could tell that somebody had smoked in this room some time ago. Furthermore there was one small burn-whole in one of the pillows == definite evidence. I metioned that during check-out but nobody could give me a plausible explanation. The check-out also took an eternity and I was requested to give the fiscal number of my company that I had to procure from my assistant back in Germany. I was told that this is general policy in Spain but had never been asked for it in other Hotels.

<Content>Location, location, location and a bit more.. My brother  I stayed here for two nights last week for the Barcelona v Liverpool match and our high expectations based on reviews prior to our departure were more than met. We arrived well before the normal check-in time and were delighted that our room was already available to us. The decor in both the hallways and the room was very tasteful. I am guessing that the hotel has been refurbished within the last year. The spa and pool area in the basement was also a great bonus (we didn't venture to the roof pool). We didn't eat or drink in the hotel so I can't comment on the bar / restaurants. A short stroll from the hotel takes you to the transport hub of Plaza Catalunya and the sights of the Barri Gotic. Overall everything about this hotel was ideal for our trip and if returning to Barcelona I'd definitely stay there again

<Content>Worth the extra- superb Booked the hotel for a surprise for my wife's 30th birthday. We arrived carrying a load of ski gear and the reception made us feel welcome despite our dishevelled appearance. Every aspect of the hotel was well thought out and presented; you never felt as any corners were being cut. The swimming pool despite being small can provide hours of relaxation with the various spa facilities.Easily the best hotel I've stayed in at any price- will definately be coming back.

<Content>nearly perfect I have just spent four nights in a privilege room at hotel 1898.The decor of the hotel is magnificent if you like some old colonial, richly done, feeling. Room, at least mine, is enough large and cleverly furnished.Service is great, even if not all staff members speak fluent english. Facilities accurate and cool, meeting rooms great and of safe intimacy. Location, it's probably hard to be more central, directly on the ramblas. The only disturbing thing some squeaking noises in the ceiling, caused I guess from airconditioning system that may be enoying if someone is used to deep silence.For the rest a great place to stay, one of the most charming hotels I have been to and definitely a place to return.

<Content>Brilliant hotel in a wonderful city We loved this hotel, we booked it because it was the top rated hotel by trip advisor reviews and we were not diappointed!!! It is in a brilliant location, walking distance from many lovely restaurants and sightseeing oppurtunties. The liveliness of Las Ramblas is hard to beat. The staff were very helpful and professional, the rooms were kept to a great standard. We stayed a classic room and it was gorgeous, with a beautiful bathroom. From our window we could see down to rooms below us that had a gorgeous balcony with decking and lovely furnishing, if anyone is booking it would be worth while paying the extra for a room with the private balcony! the rooftop pool was beautiful. We also enjoyed the indoor pool, sauna and steam room. overall I would throughly recommend this hotel to make any trip to barcelona even better!!

<Content>Brilliant Just returned from hotel 1898 and it was amazing. We booked a standard room and it was pure luxury - I would love to have seen a luxury room!!! The evening meal was very tasty but only small portions which wasn't great as we love our food, but the service was second to none. The food and drink in the hotel was a little expensive but we booked room only and there was loads of choice and variety on the doorstep of the hotel so this was not a problem. (Would recommed the Attic restauraunt over the road, cheap and very tasty). The spa was just what the doctor ordered if you're looking for relaxation - indoor pool, sauna, gym etc. Would recommend this hotel if you want something special.

<Content>Brilliant hotel on the Rambla Based on reviews on Trip Advisor we booked this hotel and weren't disappointed. We went with two friends and arrived early but our rooms were ready. We had rooms next to each other with an outside view although we hadn't paid for this. The hotel lobby and bar are beautifully decorated, and the theme is continued into the rooms. The rooms have plasma screen TV, wooden floors and a great lighting system, good sized bathroom and generous toiletries. The towels are changed twice daily and your bed turned down. There was a wide choice at breakfast and I thought it was good value. The roof top garden and pool area was lovely but the weather wasn't warm enough to use the bar area although the pool is heated. There isn't one negative thing to say about this hotel. It is a 4 star but you really should go before they realise it is a 5 star hotel and increase the price.

<Content>Lovely hotel, but small rooms In a wonderful location on bustling las ramblas, this hotel acts as a serene oasis in Barcelona. The communal areas are luxurious and tasteful. The only reservation we has about the stay was the small size of our room - only one chair was provided and when we requested a second chair, we were told to sit on the bed.

<Content>Great place to stay We booked hotel 1898 after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. The hotel is in a great location right on the La Ramblas. The rooms are a little on the small side but very nicely finished with everything you could want.We didnt try the food, chose instead to try the local restaurants.Overall a great place to stay.

<Content>Great Memories Great advice helped me select Hotel 1898 for my 11 year old son and I for a weekend in Barcelona. Location is fabulous. Walked straight out onto La Ramblas. A few doors up a supermarket catered well for our late night snack urges and the metro line was 5 minutes walk.The hotel though was excellent. The Classic room was sufficient in size and had enough gadgets with the lighting, TV and bathroom set up to impress an 11 year old lad!There were a lot of couples there, and I would definitely take my wife for a romantic weekend. The bar area was pleasant and the rooftop bar looked great, although it was never open for service due to the weather. I imagine in the summer it would be a tremendous place to unwind after a day's sight-seeing.Reception staff were really helpful, but I didn't ask them for enough help. Once I did I was surprised how easy it was to get around the city via metro.Quick advice if you stay:If you use the basement spa and pool (which is great) get changed in your room and go down via the lift in your room's bathrobe as there are no real changing rooms to speak of.The breakfast is an extra 鈧?9 for the buffet which I felt was overpriced, particularly as when we arrived later in the morning it didn't look too appetising. In hindsight we could have used any number of cafes along La Ramblas and around the area.Get on the rooftop for sunset when you can get some great views of the city and in particular the Cathedral.Anyway, we enjoyed the hotel but then I haven't had the credit card bill yet!

<Content>Fantastic!- what a luxurious hotel in a great location We had a two night break in Hotel 1898 in January this Year. I booked the hotel through Expedia as the deal was fantastic. We found the hotel easily and the staff were very friendly. The room was full of mod cons and was very luxurious. It is located on the ramblas, however we were not disturbed by any noise. The rooftop pool- WOW!!! and the loungers make it feel like a different world, looking out over the city. I would recommend emailing the hotel if you have any requests as ours was actioned without any problems. What can I say - we will return to Barcelona and WILL stay here again as you could not fault anything. A hotel well worth the cost. Dont miss it!!!!

<Content>Perfection We were VERY pleased with our stay in this hotel. Besides having the perfect location central to everything, it's the staff that makes this extra special. They were all very attentive and accommodating. Every attention to detial has been made from the motion-detecting lights to the cushiony rooftop with amazing veiws. Everything is very clean and cozy - the hotel has a way of seeming like a boutique hotel even though it's large. I'll definitely be back!

<Content>1898 - Luxury and winter swimming One of our best hotel experiences ever. A well-heated rooftop pool meant good swimming even in chilly December. As far as we could tell, this is the only hotel in central Barcelona that provides this. With a comfortable large room on the next-to-top floor (room 610) it was like having a large pool and terrace for ourselves. Very helpful staff. There is considerable variation among rooms within a class, so try to get a look at the possibilities or discuss them with the staff. Contrary to what Expedia was saying, superior rooms don't have balconies or terraces. They are the same as standard rooms except for an outside view. The next grade up from superior, which we took (can't remember what it's called) gets you a considerably larger and nicely appointed room.

<Content>Great hotel, some buts... We stayed at 1898 for New Year and the week afterwards.It's a great hotel with many plus points, but there are one or two things to be aware of, see below.Pro's:- great location, at the top of La Rambla within walking distance of many of the main sights including much of the Gaudi architecture - Casa Battlo, Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia, also very near La Boqueria - a fantastic food market, and close to other great shopping around Placa Catalunya-impressive building, impressive bedrooms and bathrooms - all constantly being kept clean- great facilities - good gym (bikes, running machines, some weights) very, very stylish indoor pool with adjacent steam room and sauna, along with spa facitlities. Free wi-fi access in the rooms along with an internet centre on the first floor with a couple of desktops and printers- roof top terrace with outdoor pool - open all year and all evening with great views of the city - this is one of the best things about the hotel - a real oasis away from the hussle and bussle of La Rambla and warm enough in the sun to enjoy at this time of year- many nearby cafes, bakeries, wine shops and supermarketsCon's:- and this is the biggest con - rooms on the second floor at the back of the hotel are noisy. Yes, the rooms are soundproofed so you don't really hear noise outside or other guests, BUT there is a bar and nightclub - Bar Lobo - in the same building as the hotel. Rooms on the second floor at the back are directly above it's dancefloor and the structure of the building very effectively channels through the sound of the music. Bear in mind that the Spaniards love to party from midnight to around 4am, and if you are in one of these rooms, and are noise sensitive, you are going to be kept awake particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel obviously have complaints about the noise regularly, as when we complained there were a set of stock answers we were given. However on one particularly bad night they did move us to another room to sleep for the night. Request a quiet room on one of the higher floors when booking.- don't bother asking the front desk for restaurant recommendations - it's not there speciality. A good option for tapas is Taller de Tapas - they have two restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. For Paella, Can Majo is a good choice on the sea front - 40 mins walk or 10 mins taxi (鈧?0).- irons and ironing boards are not available. There is an ironing service, but taking a travel iron is probably easier.- there are tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms, but no milk. You can get milk in the nearby Carrefour supermarket (also great for buying bottles of Cava / Rioja)- 鈧?8 for breakfast - this is steep if you just want somethinbg small for breakfast. Around the back of the hotel (turn left past Bar Lobo) there is a deli/cafe that the locals go to, which serves great pastries and hot chocolate at a fraction of the price. There is also a good bakery if you continue past the back entrance of Carrefour.In summary, it's fantastic hotel in a great location, but steer clear of those rooms on the second floor at the back.

<Content>Even the cheapest room ("Classic") was great! We stayed here based on TripAdvisor reviews, and we were not disappointed! It is a beautiful hotel, with nice, helpful staff, and located very conveniently on La Rambla, up near the hub of the Plaza Catalunya. We arrived exhausted from our flight, and were shown to our room (we booked their cheapest room, a Classic). It was beautiful, quiet and comfortable, facing onto the beautiful interior courtyard, and we had a pleasant nap before setting out later to explore Barcelona. We also visited (but ultimately did not use) the downstairs spa (it was a little too popular!), and its pool is in a grotto that is unusual and pretty. We also went to the rooftoop, where their outdoor pool was open and heated (some were swimming in it, but the December night air was a little too chilly for us!). Both locations were beautiful and well appointed for relaxation.The day we left, we were able to leave our luggage with their front desk while we explored the city a little more, and the staff was very helpful in our decision as to how to get back to the airport.I would definitely stay here again if ever in Barcelona (Barcelona, by the way, was the highlight of our trip to Spain). A very good experience.Lisa from Williamsburg

<Content>The best hotel we have stayed in, anywhere My girlfriend and I stayed at Hotel 1898 from 26th - 30th of December 06, and had decided to stay there having read reviews on this site, and we were not disappointed. We stayed in a Superior Room, which boasted one of the largest and comfiest beds we have ever had. The room was easily large enough, and the bathroom, and particularly shower were great. We used the leisure facilities every evening and they were all fantastic especially the pool and its massage beds. My girlfriend also had one of the massage treatments on offer, and she said it was lovely.We did not eat in the hotel, instead choosing to get breakfast and dinner out in the streets. All in all we are delighted we chose to stay at Hotel 1898, and are already seriously considering going back in the summer for some warmer weather.

<Content>New Year at H1898 Just back from 2 nights (30/12/06 - 2/1/07) at the H1898. We booked it largely because of Tripadvisor reviews and, in all, it more than lived up to expectations. The decor throughout the hotel is something else and the service attentive and unobtrusive. Our room was beautiully decorated, comfortable, spacious and quiet. The only disappointment was the relatively early closure of the bar on New Year's Eve and on New Year's Day evening. It seemed that there was only 1 poor guy serving, with the bar closing at 1am or so. Not what one would have expected and a missed opportunity for the hotel to make a lot of cash from the willing residents. However this was a only a small disappointment in anotherwise super hotel.

<Content>Truly great We stayed two nights at the Le Meridien before walking across the street (appr. 3 meters) and having a look at the H1898. Totally different level of property. Makes the Meridien look like a 3-star hotel.We quickly switched to H1898 and stayed for a night. Everything from the breakfast, the room, the service, etc. is great. The only flaw to mention is that the subway must be passing by just under the hotel, making some noise every now and then. Not enough to wake you up though.Don't miss the heated pool and the terrace. Great view.

<Content>Never thought Barcelona could be this relaxing We spent seven nights at the 1898 in the run up to Christmas, staying in a Superior Room at the back of the hotel, and found it excellent in every respect. No sign of the niggles reported by a few other reviewers (maids were quiet and didn't bother us at all during the odd lie-in, and there are now kettles in the rooms).Both the spa and the very comfortable bar/lounge area offered the opportunity to relax just moments away from the Christmas shopping-chaos of the Ramblas and, although we didn't use the roof terrace because it was too chilly, we could imagine that would do the same job during the warmer months. We are now looking forward to testing out the roof terrace and pool with a visit next summer.

<Content>Would definitely stay again! Have just returned from a fantastic 2 night stay at Hotel 1898. It is in an ideal location, right in the middle of Las Ramblas. Originally we had booked a superior room, but saw the rooms below had decked terraces, so asked if we could change, and it was no problem. For 45 EUR extra per night we were shown to a huge room, with a big terrace with 4-seater table, and a raised double daybed. It was warm enough to have breakfast on the terrace both days. The bathroom was a great size, with hugh bath, and a separate shower. This room was definitely worth the extra money, for a special treat!The spa facilities are great. The pool is under a brick archway, and is very atmospherically lit. Along with the sauna and steamroom, they also have a water massage bed which is free for guests to use, and it was a real bonus after a day of pounding the pavements of Barcelona!The staff were really helpful, and always seemed to be there when you needed them, but faded into the background when you didn't. Our room was tidied and cleaned when we got back from sightseeing, and the bed was turned down each night whilst we were in the spa.Bar Lobos, round the back of the hotel, was fabulous for drinks and tapas on saturday night, but there was an hour wait for a table inside. That was fine though - we just decided to take our drinks and eat outside. I would definitely stay here again, for the very central location, the level of service, the lovely room, and the spa facilities.

<Content>A brilliant hotel A great hotel overall that I could not recommend highly enough. The rooms must have been cleaned two or three times a day, the cleaning staff always smiled and had the courtesy to look up, the rooms were modern and classic at the same time, the bathrooms without fault, the facilities were excellent including the spa which was just fantastic and it's positioning could not have been better. I would find it hard to consider another hotel if I went back to Barcelona bearing in mind how comprehensive it is. My full trip report for my 3 day break in Barcelona can be found on [----] under Holidays.

<Content>Book it, this hotel is great I stayed here with my partner for two nights in November.Had an outstanding experience. Great value for money, booked room through lastminute.com for 拢100.The Spa facilities were the highlight for me. Room was superb and I would still stay here if the price were double.Breakfast worth doing once although is a little expensive at $18 but the selection is vast. There are plenty of places nearby to take breakfast and the fruit market is on the your doorstep.Great hotel, great location.

<Content>We just loved it! Yet again, Trip Advisor helped us find a really excellent hotel to stay in. The staff were very helpful, it was spotlessly clean, the decor was unusual and very striking. We had a room overlooking La Rambla and the sound proofing worked really well. The breakfasts were a real feast - the choice was amazing and everything was topped up really quickly. It was not cheap but it was part of the whole experience. The lounge area has really great seating and just looked so striking. The hot chocolate served at the bar was to die for! I had a really good massage at the Spa and loved the swimming pool and the different features in the pool. The roof top pool was wonderful with views across Barcelona.It would be hard to fault anything - we really hope to go back again.

<Content>Fabulous times at 1898 My boyfriend I stayed at the 1898 last weekend and couldn't recommend it highly enough. Very fabulous - a real Sex In The The City hotel! I definitely recommend a deluxe room - very spacious, clean and gorgeous interior/deisgn. Loved all the bathroom extras - Etro products, there was even a hair bobble and emery board which I always forget. Order one room service breakfast for two people if you're lazy - the American was great. I disagree with other reviewers - reasonable value compared to other top European hotels. For a brilliant Catalunian meal try the nearby restaurant Los Caracoles and the Bar next door, Bar Hobo, is great for cocktails and tapas.Definitely the best hotel I've stayed in Barcelona - I stay in hotels all through the week for work and as a result have very high standards, this impressed me!

<Content>a lovely hotel this hotel rates as 4 star but it has stunning decor and helpful friendly staff making it much more.it is ideally located and has nice pools and the rooftop area is great.the deluxe rooms are a bit bigger but worth it.we had a room with balcony over las ramblas; great views and the double glazing keeps most of the sound out though not the subway!breakfast is not worth the 18 euro price (you can't eat enough) but theres plenty of places nearby.overall highly recommended!derek baxter desmondo90@hotmail.com

<Content>Excellent Hotel I recently stayed here for my 2nd anniversary. The hotel was of a very high standard. The rooms were of a decent size and clean. We went for a superior room which we thought was worthwhile as we think that its much better than the standard room. The bed was huge and the tvs were plasma however there is only a couple of english channels. The swimming pool and spa  gym are of a good standard aswell.As far as barcelona is concerned we found that the city was just ok. We much prefered cancun in mexico and london to barcelona. There was a bad smell round most of the city and the standard of restaurants can only be described as poor! The only decent place we ate at was called something pizza which was an italian on the opposite side of the road then left about 200 yards cant remeber the name. Please avoid a place called the bello italia its the worlds worst restaurant completely digusting and no im not exaggerating.The zoo in barclelona was a very good day out and the sagrada familia is also very impressive.Overall we enjoyed our stay but wouldnt go back again.

<Content>Highly recommended for an elegant stay (Member in Surrey, UK) We were in Barcelona for three nights. Since we had booked the opera, the 1898 (being such a short walking distance from the Liceu) was an obvious choice. We found it to be a highly elegant, modern and friendly hotel. And was excellent value when compared with the high prices often charged here in the UKBut there are a couple of points prospective visitors might like to keep in mind. Firstly the breakfast is not cheap. But if you intend to have a really good meal to see you through much of the day, then I certainly recommend it. But if, like me, you prefer a very light snack you could do better to go along the road towards the Liceu and enjoy a coffee and an excellent pastry for a fraction of the cost. Also the bar is expensive and not good. We paid a high price for our dry martini (which we didn't object to given the status of the hotel) but it was not a particularly good one (being too ice-melt diluted) and came without any customary cocktail 'nibbles' that enhance the occasion and one could expect at this price. So having a drink was a rather 'triste' experience , which we certainly did not repeat.

<Content>Honeymoon 10/23/2006 We started our honeymoon in Barcelona at Hotel 1898. It was a hip hotel in a great location. I did find it humorous that the only Starbucks in Barcelona was attached to our hotel...yes, a guilty pleasure of mine in the US, but the last thing I wanted to see in Spain! Our room was lovely with a great terrace. Our bartender was very sweet (Lucas). The library was nice with two computers and free email. Classy hotel!

<Content>Excellent Hotel in the heart of the city. This hotel could easily be 5 star, the facilities are fantastic, the rooms beautifully furnished and equipped with all the latest technology. The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in. Take the continental breakfast in your room, it was really good value for money and there was a good choice. We used the spa and indoor pool in the evenings which again was excellent.The lounge and bar areas were relaxing and comfortable, and perfect for a night-cap in the evening.Our only let down was the restaurant, onour first night we had dinner and the food was very poor and the dining room was cold and did not have the same atmosphere as the rest of this beautiful hotel.Over all we would highly reccomend Hotel1898 and would deffinately make a return visit.

<Content>Stay at this hotel! All we can say is if you're thinking of staying here, book this hotel. We spent one night here after a 10-day cruise in Oct. 2006 and it was just what we needed to unwind. The rooms are bigger than you'd expect in Europe, with nicely appointed bathrooms and comfortable beds, which my husband discovered are adjustable. The spa in the basement is unreal and includes an indoor pool. The spa treatments are resonably priced. There is a rooftop pool with a bar and amazing views. The lobby is spacious and comfortable, sit down and you won't want to leave. Hotel 1898 is right on Las Ramblas, but it's not a noisy hotel. It's just a few blocks from La Boqueria, a must see if you're visiting Barcelona.Luca, the bartender, recommended an amazing restaturant, Made in Italy. The food was the best we had our whole vacation.

<Content>Luxury at a discount Thanks to other reviews about where to stay we chose 1898, this proved to be a success as I had wanted something special for my husband and I as this trip was to celebrate our anniversary. From the moment we entered the hotel the staff were friendly and helpful. What a suprise when we were shown our room, it was beautiful. Everything had been catered for and the cleanliness was amazing. We stayed in the basic room, which was all I could afford and I had a slight apprehension this may be equivalent to a broom cupboard. This was definately not the case and for the two of us it was more than adequate, especially as the break was not being spent in the room but in the beautiful city. The swimming pool and health spa were clean and well equipped. Overall I would stongly reccommend this hotel as a base for a stay in Barcelona as it is ideally situated on Ramblas for access to all the attractions.

<Content>A Decent Stay My partner and I stayed here recently for 2 nights and enjoyed the hotel (booked it primarily because of the great reviews on tripadvisor). As for our experience, the hotel seemed quite new, which usually means a clean and modern decor, which we found to be true. Although our room itself was a bit small for a superior room, it was sufficient for our purposes. The room was equipped with free wifi access, an LCD tv (but with only one english channel, no movies or DVD), a minibar, safe  stand-up shower/ bath. Didn't use room service so I can't comment on that. The decor was quite cool and on the funky side, definitely comfortable. The spa facility was only basic and as such, I wouldn't recommend it (poor changing  lounge area, small but neat looking pool with unisex sauna / steam and a couple of treadmills to account for a gym). We had a massage which was okay but not remarkable. Overall, the price is reasonable for what's offered and we would consider staying here again. I'd suggest this hotel is a solid 3 1/2 star (would be a 4 if they took some of the details up a notch).

<Content>Lives up to the good reviews Thankfully the other reviews of this hotel have largely been accurate. I stayed there in early September in a superior room for a week and was not disappointed (overall). Highlights: 1: Decent rooms (but I was glad I followed other reviewers' advice to book a superior room - it costs more for a reason - its usually a room on the outside of the hotel as opposed to the smaller standard rooms overlooking the inner atrium. The standard rooms' dark walls and small dimensions suffer further from the dingy atrium that restricts most of the natural light). Our room was at the back of the hotel with a balcony overlooking a cafe - not a great view, but pleasant and much quieter than those overlooking the Ramblas. 2: Decent Spa in the basement. Not great when kids were allowed in (supervised), but very quiet in the mornings and early afternoons. The pool wasn't very large (the picture on the hotel's own web-site was accurate), and could do with being warmer, but it was ok in conjunction with the steam room and sauna and there were several spa treatments available. 3: Very nice roof terrace. Although the pool was unheated and you needed to get there early (late afternoon) to grab a large sofa or four-poster bed sun lounger on the west side of the building to catch the last of the sun. 4: 24 hour internet access - albeit in the business centre on the 1st floor. Lowlights: 1: Variable customer service - usually very pleasant but hardly overeager. They have a concierge service but nowhere near the level of service of some other hotels (although this is after all only four star) - they were fairly unenthusiastic when asked to phone a restaurant to tell them we were delayed; and room service also seemd a bit put out about being called after they had overlooked re-supplying tea and coffee! Having said that, I did ask them to arrange for flowers, wine and fruit to be in our room on arrival, which they did, and I was never charged !(surely a mistake). 2: The hotel food was hardly much to rave about. The hotel breakfast is only worth the price if you can eat your weight in breakfast items - we found it much better and infinitely cheaper to buy anything we wanted in the supermarket over the road from the side entrance of the hotel. 3: Availability of food and drinks on the roof terrace was limited. Again, the opening hours of the bar varied a great deal and you were better off taking your own drinks and food up there - a bit of a hassle in a four star hotel! 4: You had to call room service for hot water or milk and there no irons were provided, only an ironing service - ok if you trust your clothes to someone else, but far from convenient when you're in a rush to get out - suffice to say the travel kettle and iron other reviwers advised came in really handy!Those gripes aside, the hotel is very well located, even if the Ramblas is a little tacky. We had no hassles from any beggars, and never felt unsafe at any time of the day or night even though we were often returning at 3 or 4 am. Overall, the hotel was well worth the money which is probably why its so popular even though its not a 5 star hotel. Having seen other hotels I was about to book - Casa Camper (dark, dingy and inhospitable!) and Hotel Neri, where I popped in for a few drinks as friends were staying there, I was not disappointed.A few Barcelona recommendations: Breakfast in the cafes at the rear of the hotel (on Carrer del Carme); great tapas at, Taller de Tapas near Santa Maria del Mar church, and even better pancakes around the corner on Passeig del Born. Clubs: Danzatoria in Tibidabo (food and wine was really good although expensive, the club attracts a well-heeled 20 to 30 crowd and is spread over a garden area and several floors of a mansion type house, with a pretty wide range of music (for Spain!)), Shoko is a bit more low rent as its in the Port Olimpic area on the beachfront, but is one of the better clubs there. Club 13 / Tarantos in Placa Real was a lot grittier, but the live bands and largely local crowd make it well worth a visit. Try the web-site [--] for more. Idling away a few hours (or days) in el Born's boutique antique, gift and clothes shops was fantastic, as was visiting Gaudi's Sagrada Familia and Casa Mila, but I would avoid the more touristy shops and restaurants on the Ramblas (including Attic restaurant across the road from the hotel - it comes recommended by some but the service and food was pretty poor quality), as well as any restaurant on Carrer de la Princesa (poor quality overpriced seafood) or anywhere in Port Olimpic (although if you want a quick snack at a subway or Pizza Hut Port Olimpic is the place to go!!) The Maremagnum shopping centre in Port Vell is also full of tacky gifts and high street rubbish. Cabs are not too expensive, but the metro was ideal - it was cleaner, cheaper and more frequent than the london tube and usually quicker than a cab if you don't mind not seeing the sights as you travel. The 3 official guided bus tours that start from Placa de la Catalunya are also well worth a try. If you have time, a tour on each takes around 2-3 hours or so, and you get to see virtually everything you need.

<Content>Great Hotel in best location A 5 minute walk from the airport bus stop leads you to this new hotel at the top end of The Ramblas - right opposite Le Meridien. On entering by the revolving door you notice the beautifully stylish sofas and chairs in herringbone and stiped fabrics. The decor may be classed as 'historic' on the nn website but its not at all old fashioned or chintzy. The reception staff are friendly and helpful and carried out little tasks such as charging a run down mobile phone.The main lobbly is also brilliantly stylish with loads of seating, artwork, model ships in cases etc. Rooms are something else and everything is high quality. The floors are solid mahoghany and green marble in the bathroom, matt laquered wardrobes and doors, double twin bed with a selection of four different types of pillows, bathrobes and slippers and a wide selection of quality toiletries, even totthbrushes, paste, shavers, and shaving cream.Coffees and teas were provided but if you want hot water and milk you have to ring room service. You do get a silver flask full of hot water with silver jug of milk within about 5 minutes.We did not take breakfast in the hotel as $18 is quite expensive if you eat small breakfasts but all around are great cafes where you can get a perfectly adequate one for under $5. Farrgi is a good bet for this. Alternatively try one of the half slices of paw paw, dragon fruit or mango wrapped with spoon from thye market just down the street.The bar, like many hotel bars was quiet and two whiskies came to $14 - not excessive bearing in mind the quantity you get in Spanish establishments.This hotel seems to be the same price with every booking agency so not worth shopping around.

<Content>A few niggles Had a three day break in Barcelona.........drove there, so found locating hotel a tad difficult, as don't have sat nav and signage incredibly discreet. Car Park great, although at 20鈧?a day it should be. Missed the speakerphone on exit, and tripped up on the none slip floor!Would have liked kettle, but understand reasons why they don't have one.Check with staff for location of Air Con controls. We spent two days altering the sound system (which didn't work) in an effort to adjust temp. The very friendly reception staff sent a 'lad' up to show us how to work it and we were somewhat embarrassed to discover that the controls were in the cupboard by the safe!!B/fast pricey at 18鈧? but a very good selection including sparkling wine. There is a caf茅 on the other side of the Rambla which is cheap and cheerful with great coffee. The Moka I think.Great location, very clean, good bathrooms and friendly staff.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location As soon as you enter the impressive lobby area, you know your in a good quality hotel. Reception staff where helpfull and pleasent. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and relitively quite even though the hotel is directly on La Ramblas. With comfortable seating and a bar area the rooftop pool area is a haven from the hustle and bustle of this exciting city. If or when we return to Barcelona, we would not hesitate to book into this hotel again.

<Content>Hotel 1898 vs Monte Carlo THE BEST BARCELONA HOTEL! Stayed at Hotel Monte Carlo 3 days pre-cruise and 1 post cruise night at Hotel 1898. Hotel 1898 wins hands down. I wish we'd booked this hotel for all of our days in Barcelona. I'm very particular where I stay and I could not find one thing I'd change about the comfort and convenience offered. The rooms were much smaller than Monte Carlo but it was large enough to meet our needs. We were in a premium room with a small balcony that overlooked Las Ramblas and there was absolutely NO street noise when the balcony door was closed. I did see some interior rooms that were very small so booking premium for a few dollars more is definitely worth it.I don't understand how Le Meridian gets away with charging so much more for their rooms when 1898 is directly across the street for so much less.We ate dinner at their restaurant one night and it was definitely gourmet quality, a little expensive but the ambience made it well worth it. The drinks on the rooftop patio were around 12E each, but they were large enough to qualify for two drinks and they did not skimp on the alcohol. There is also topless sunbathing so if you're offended avoid it. Can't wait to go back to BCN and I now know which hotel choice we'll be making in hotels if we ever get the opportunity to return.

<Content>Fantastic The Hotel 1898 is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Great location and impressive facilities - from the room, to the lobby and bar, to the rooftop pool and basement spa! The hotel was a quiet oasis from all of the craziness going on on the Ramblas for which it is located. Until you step outside you would never know that you are in such a central location. We just had a classic room, but found it to be a nice size. It was well designed and comfortable. The staff seemed helpful (particularly hot and flirty bellboys!) and took a charge off my bill at checkout for a mini bar service that I did not use. The spa area on the basement level was worth the cost of the room! It was a great way to rejuvinate after a day of sightseeing. Would definately recommend this hotel and stay here again when in Barcelona!

<Content>Really Impressive My wife and I stayed at the 1898 at the start of October 2006. It's a fantastic hotel - in many respects a 5* experience, though perhaps falling short of an official rating on one or two technicalities. Things that you may find useful when considering booking are : * Roof Terrace - Gloriously quiet with panoramic views of the city, nice bar, but no food. (note you can zip out and get a salad in 5 minutes and bring it back without any eyebrows raised!)*Concierge - are very efficient and booked us into some unbookable restaurants at short notice (including Moo which is a must if you want to indulge!). Also left a note in our room confirming this had been done* Location - is possibly as good as it gets. You can pretty much get anywhere you need with ease. Bus-service reliable and easy to work out. We explored a lot and the only cabs we got were to and from the airport. * Agree with the earlier post about the noise from the maids which is quite loud (but the earliest we heard was 9.00am and our room was right opposite one of their base rooms). The rooms were spotless though. * Spa - Pool small but fun, sauna and steam rooms both fine, clean etc. Again if you want to indulge massages were very good. * Price - in response to the other poster who said that the hotel charges for everything, i'm a little surprised. True that there is no kettle in the room but my wife and I asked a few times at the bar for hot water and milk which was provided for no extra cost. Maybe it was the room service delivery element that caused them to be charged. Also, breakfast cost is pretty competitive for a hotel of this standard and of good quality. I've stayed in similar hotels across the continent where a similar spread has been a lot more expensive. Overall, this place is highly recommended and all the positive reviews below, which prompted us to book, are spot on! Enjoy!

<Content>Blissful experience with Hotel 1898!! My boyfriend and I booked this hotel purely based on the impressive reviews we read on the excellent tripadvisor, which has never failed us! I can say that we found the reviews to be a true representation of the place- great hotel, ideal location and wonderfully atmospheric. Even the negatives were on point- watch out for the early morning wake up call from noisy housekeeping staff- two mornings in a row we had a woman barge into our room at 7.30 in the morning!! However, the positives definately outwayed the negatives and we will be booking again- and i can't wait!!

<Content>classy and quiet perfect place to stay a week-end and discover the heart of barcelona.The situation is very central: all the main tourist attractions are within a few minutes walk and it is a convenient situation to go out in the evening and enjoy the night in Barcelona streets. we stayed there during a very special week-end (Merce or Virgin Mary celebration on 24 sept 2006) with lots of noise in the streets during the night and we were pleasantly surprised to have a very quiet room.we had a classic room, which was not big (according to US standards), but spatious enough (according to European standards), with everything my wife wanted (clean batchrooom, bathrobe, hair dryer...)we agree with all previous comments on the interior design and decoration: in one word, splendid!the breakfasts are exceptional ones, with everything you may wish (including local champagne); of course for a rather high price (鈧?8 per person)and the terrace on top floor has a very good view on Barcelonadefinitely one of the best hotels we ever visited, and we will certainly go back there as soon as we can

<Content>They charge for EVERYTHING! The hotel it's self is bautiful, very elegant and in an amazing location, plus if you get a ramblas view, your stay will be very memorable, however, they charge a fortune for everything. We had coffee in our room but no kttle, so you ask for hot water which they brought up, but I also asked for milk in my coffee (no UHT in the room), 6 Euro's! 6 Euro's for milk in my coffee!!!!

<Content>Fantastic hotel!!!!! I stayed at this hotel with my husband for 10 nights in August 06 and we were not disappointed. The style and ambiance of the hotel is quiet and relaxed, and whilst staff are friendly, they keep a respectful distance. The decor is new and the hotel is very clean. Our room was well attended and although our classic room was a little on the small side, it was very quiet and the bathroom (especially the shower!) was fantastic to return to after a day around Barcelona. However, for us the real advantage of this hotel was the spa/pool in the basement. This was often very quiet and we were able to rejuvenate at our leisure. The location of the hotel was also very convenient as it is centrally located and within easy walking distance of many sights. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who will be visiting Barcelona and if I return to this city I will definitely be booking my stay at Hotel 1898!!!!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel The hotel is superb, in a great location, right on Las Ramblas, couldnt ask for more. Even though its in the main district its still very quite when in your room. The only thing for me is that I wished there was a kettle in the room, there was all the facilities to make a drink but you had to ring for hot water, which sometimes took a while and I like a cup of tea when waking up in a morning without having to wait for the water to arrive. The hairdryer is excellent, one of the best ones I've ever come across in a hotel before. You must go onto the roof top when you visit, there is a bar, comfy seating and a pool which is fantastic, you dont feel like your in a city, its great. Overall the hotel was fantastic, staff very helpful and friendly, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would definately stay again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel  We have just returned from a three day break at Hotel 1898. What a fantastic find, great location being right on La Ramblas, fantastic facilities, wonderful rooftop pool and a small but perfectly adequate indoor pool. If I had one critiscism it would be that they need to extend their spa treatements, having said that I had a wonderful massage and felt thoroughly relaxed. I would definately go back.

<Content>Fantastic!!!!!! We have just returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel 1898 and have to say that the hotel lived up to all of our expectations after reading the reviews.It was most definitely more 5 star than 4 star with the rooftop pool and day beds being a very luxurious feature and the views from there- WOW! and at 165euros a night was a bargain!The room was spacious ( we stayed in room 308) and although a little dark ( it being a coutyard view room) it was very quiet and pleasant- peace and tranquility away from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas.The bathroom was fabulous with a great shower ( the biggest shower head I have ever seen) and plenty of towels, bathrobes, slippers and complementary toiletries.The bed was huge and comfortable and the different lighting very relaxing after a hard days sightseeing,eating and drinking.The only criticism I have is that we requested an iron but were advised that they only offer a laundry service.The indoor pool, gym and steam room/sauna were more than adequate.We chose not to eat in the hotel instead opting for the many resaurants/ Tapas bars and market nearby.Breakfast - the market for its choice of fresh fruit and a very handy starbucks next door.Dinner- Dont eat til late -10pm earliest. We tried many restauarants but one of our favourites was 'set portes- passeig d'isabel ll 14'. Its been there since 1836 and has queues out the door so you have to book. The paella was delicious.Will definitely stay again at the 1898 - a real treat!

<Content>Barcelona oasis My wife and I stayed 2 nights in early August following Trip Advisor recommendations and were not disappointed. The location could not be better and although we arrived late in the evening, it was service with a smile. Our standard room was not large, but provided the peaceful rest we were looking for. Breakfast was very adequate and many ate in the restaurant in the evening as the outside restaurants were very congested and busy. The hotel is basically new and oozes charm and atmosphere, The features which make this establishment stand out include ; the silent Charlie Chaplin movies showing in the foyer which make this area a calm oasis from the busy world outside; the fantastic roof top pool and lounge area and the modern ( although somewhat dark) decor of the interior. A great deal of planning has gone into the design and development of Hotel 1898 and all concerned should be congratulated . The staff were very attentive and helpful. Thank you all for a great experience!

<Content>Great hotel - fantastic location Just came back from 4 nights at 1898 with my girlfriend and got to say we were both very impressed.Stayed all over the world but the difference in this hotel is it's ability at key times to take you away completely from the bustle and noise of its central city location.Our room was third floor and had a balcony with side view of Ramblas which was fantastic for early evening atmosphere however has completely soundproof when it was time to call it a night.One thing though - we requested king bed and got twin beds which led to some interesting complications.Roof top area had a tranquil, relaxation feeling and the lift took you straight from there into the basement  cavern spa area and gym which again was faultless.Would recommend this hotel to anyone - can't wait to go back to Barcelona to stay there!Didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on food, however ate in El Gran Cafe in the Gothic area ( great atmosphere and food ) , Los Caracoles ( a favourite apparently - great but very busy - be prepared to  mix it up a bit  ) and Cal Pinxo Palau de Mar in the harbour ( very romantic but the most stuck up waitresses ever encountered ! )

<Content>Excellent = 110% Recommended - Can't Beat It!!!!!!!!!!!! Stayed Aug 11-13 2006. My Boyfriend and I love 5 star and this Hotel impressed in every facet. Go for the Premier room - ask for 601 this room was fantastic. Great Decor, everything is in top condition and the hotel could not be in a better location right in the middle of everything and 1 minute walk to the metro. The underground pool was beautiful and the top deck lounges were great too. The staff were the friendliest I found - David and Martha were outstanding in assisting with every tip and location. 10 out of 10 for this joint.

<Content>frightened to give due praise as may mean cannot get a booking in future! As per so many of the reviews - great locaton (3 euros on the airport bus and a short walk down the Ramblas is even easier than a taxi) but a haven of peace and calm compared to the fun and craziness of the day and night entertainment outside the front door.The cooling pool (towels provided) and deck showers on the rooftop were very welcome, with superb comfort provides by daybeds and plenty of cusions - the views across Barcelona to the sea were a real treat. We did not have breakfast in our package so avoided 18 euros and went to Starbucks right next to the lobby.Loved the room, the pillow menu, the very comfy bed, and the calming lighting! Spotless bathroom with great shower.Modern decor throughout. As great fans of the UK boutique hotel group Hotel Du Vin we are delighted to find a similar level of style and comfort in our favourite short break city. Every trip for us includes a lunchtime visit to the Mercato - a feast of produce that has to be seen and enjoyed!If room mini bar prices put you off drinking the amount of water etc you should do to remain headache free in a hot country there is a supermarket just a few yards up the road (left out of front door).The staff were polite, although not overly warm. One of the young barman at the rooftop bar was very helpful and pleasant every afternoon and evening.

<Content>Very highly recommended Wonderful hotel in fantastic position on Los Ramblas. Would recommend it unreservedly. Stayed for 5 nights in August and thoroughly enjoyed it. Bedroom was a decent size with very good air conditioning and beautifully designed. We upgraded online and I would guess that the cheapest rooms are quite small. Ground floor reception/lounge/bar area excellentRooftop pool area with spectacular views over city. Another (indoor) pool and gym in basementFree internet access Starbucks next door

<Content>pure indulgence opted for this hotel after reading all the great reviews and was not disappointed! Have travelled the world and this hotel comes up top in luxury - choice of pillows depending on the position you sleep!! Breakfast is worth the added cost as it is pure heaven - homeade pancakkes etc could have stayed all day there!! Great location and the roof top swimming pool and a cold lager just topped off a great holiday!! great location for the sightseeing bus and central for the shops! Will definetly return!

<Content>Superb hotel! A friend advised my to book the 1898. And am I glad she did. The colonial style, the locaion and the staff - it`s all just great! I stayed in a junior suite and found it well worth the money. And they even have some great suites too. Each of them with it`s own plunge pool! I am coming back.

<Content>Something Special! Beautiful hotel. I think there are 4 or 5 room grades and ours was the second. Our room overlooked La Ramblas and was on 3rd floor. Room was great, so bright and clean, very nicely decorated with a huge bed! Bed turned down at night along with mats placed on floor either side of bed. Towels changed in morning and evening. Bathrobes supplied which came in handy when going up to rooftop pool and down to spa pool. Rooftop pool very relaxing and peaceful, with superb views over city. We enjoyed the spa pool too along with the sauna and steam room. We ate in restaurant in hotel and food was delicious. Breakfast in morning very nice too with a large selection to choose from (cereal, yogurts, all different kinds of fruit, smoked salmon, parma ham, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs etc) Hotel staff very helpful and friendly. We have stayed in 5 star hotels before but this hotel is the best we have stayed in. It should be rated 5 star. We had a lovely 2 nights in Barcelona to celebrate our anniversary (picked this hotel after reading all the reviews) and staying in Hotel 1898 made it all the more special.

<Content>great hotel, nicely decorated, service and atmosphere needs approvement We stayed in July in this hotel at the Ramblas instead of going to Arts (sea side 5 star) again, because of reviews on tripadvisor. The 1898 at the Ramblas is nicely decorated an still brandnew. We had a fantastic room with a lounge terras, and this really gives THE touch to our 4 days trip. I priorly arranged some flowers and the reception assited me very kindly.The reception is actually also the concierge service. This brings me to one important point for all of you who are spoiled by 5 star services. They really do not offer this. It is really a 4 star and sometimes even a 3 star. The reception staff is 6 stars, really, but the rest is...mmm. Roomservice do not want to bring any food or drinks to the roofterras. The bar on the roofterras is not opened until 1700!!! although there inroom brochure says it is opened from 1200 to 0100. So no service at all at the roof and the splonge pool is only 1.20 deep and very small. In the evening for drinks; no music, no barsnacks, no nuts, no glory, no atmosphere. To bad, cause it has potential! The bathroom is small and has no seperate shower. It's good, not excellent. They do not speak english at the health/beauty club and it is short of staff, so no pedicures for us. This is a great hotel when you book the room with the outside lounge erea. Decoration is hip, the atmosphere is not. So it is recommended, but do not expect 5 star service, they do not make the extra mile. High potential though!

<Content>Unreal If you're looking for a hotel in Barcelona, and you are smart, you'll stop right now and book and the 1898 Hotel. First class hotel. It is a four star, however should be a five star. Only complaint is the size of the rooms was quite smaller, but the hotel in general more than made up for it. Location is unreal, Price was a bargain, pool in the basement was gorgeous, and a pool on the roof which was breathtaking. This hotel, single handidly made Barcelona a better experience on my vacation (Barcelona btw even with a motel 6 is gorgeous).

<Content>1st Wedding anniversary at Hotel 1898 I have just spent a long weekend at Hotel 1898 in Barcelona with my wife to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and I have to say that that I couldn't have selected a better spot! The hotel is only rated as 4+ star according expedia, but is definitely better quality than some 5 star hotels I have stayed in. The facilities were next to none, with the pool and bar area on the roof especially enjoyable in the Catalonian sunshine. The decor throughout the hotel is a very tasteful colonial style with lots of dark wood. All of the fixtures and fittings are of a very high quality and our room had a large wall mounted flat screen tv. When I travel on business I don't usually order breakfast , as I always find it to be over-priced and/or dissapointing. The breakfast at the 1898, however, was very good value for money (鈧?8) and the food was both excellent and plentiful. The only (very minor) critisism that I would have, was that although the price of most drinks at the bar was average for this type of hotel, (e.g. a GT was about 鈧?, a beer about 鈧?), when I ordered two glasses of sangria at the pool bar the price came to a whopping 鈧?5, which I think is highly overpriced for cheap red wine with lemonade! However, this aside I cannot fault the hotel in any other way and of course I got plenty of brownie points from my wife for having picked such a great venue for our anniversary!

<Content>Simply Great! Just back from 4 nights in the 1898 Hotel. Probably one of the best value for money experiences I have had. The room was very comfortable, the place spotless and the staff attentive and professional. I would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel.

<Content>1898 is hard to beat at any price Just got back from a month away and the 1898 was the best hotel that we have experienced on this trip or any other. Service was superb with items such as changing our room to a king sized (matrimonial) bed or getting extra robes. One of the bell boys (Jordi) helped us find seveal superb Catalan restaurants. The roof top and the subterranian pool were clean. The workout room had new equipment and the sauna was perfect. If I would have changed anything it would have been to have stayed in the Eixample section of town as the Ramblas is a circus/freak show for most of the day and night. However, 1898 offered elegance and style that I have rarely experienced anywhere.

<Content>Fantastic hotel - will be going back asap! A colleague and myself stayed at 1898 at the beginning of July for a work trip. We both work in the fashion industry and would be bringing clients back to the hotel so we needed somewhere that would impress - and it certainly did.Because the hotel is newish, we managed to get quite a good rate on the room. It was around the same price as some of the more traditional hotels on La Ramblas but you got so much more for your money. The hotel is really modern but has an old school charm, for example dark oak walls and marble floored bathroom. It adds a cosy feel without losing the sleekness.Oh by the way, bedrooms have a free pillow menu!Breakfast was great and catered for all the health freaks to full on english breakfast and cakes.Location could not be better - you're right in the middle of the centre but we were never disturbed by noise since the rooms are sound-proof.I was on a work trip so only managed to check out the rooftop pool once but it was so lovely sitting on the deck with a cocktail. The views of the city were great and it was so quiet from where we were - you would forget you were in a busy city.I had a full body massage which was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep at dinner later on!We will be going back next year and so will our clients - everyone loves it!

<Content>Fantastic!!!!! Stayed here from July 3st till Aug 3rd. Stunning building in an amazing location. The entrance off La Rambla is beautiful, what a first impression! The rooms were great, fantasic decor, nice flat screen TV. Wonderful shower. The attention to detail is exceptional. As for the now famous rooftop pool, well it really does live up to expectation. You need to experience it, that's all I'll say. Indoor pool is great too, very very relaxing. I thought breakfast was pricy at Euro 18. Also bar can be expensive, but you would expect that. Didn't sample the food, purely because I didn't fancy any of it. Hotel staff were VERY friendly and VERY helpfull. You must go there, it really is amazing!

<Author>Out-of-SFO
<Content>Great New Hotel We just spent three nights at 1898 and were very pleased in all respects. As it is located on La Rambla, we were concerned about noise and had therefore requested an interior standard room. We were shown to our room on the third of six floors, which had two large outward opening windows overlooking a small inner courtyard with potted plants at the base. Because of that, the room was a little darker than exterior rooms or those exterior with terraces, but we preferred that over potential street noise. Location was great, though in a very touristy area. You can walk to all of the main points of interest, and we did not have any trouble hailing a cab either. One real bonus is the Boquiera Market, which is about a block further down La Rambla -- incredible outdoor covered market for meats, seafood, fruits, bar-style restaurants. We bought some food there and brought it back to the room one day. Do watch for pick pockets there and on La Rambla generally, as you would in any highly congested area where it is easy to get distracted by all of the goings on. Spain overall felt very safe, certainly safer than large cities in the US, but like anywhere petty crimes of opportunity will occur. The hotel occupies what was formerly the headquarters for Compania de Tabacos de Filipinas, which was built in 1881. It was completely redone 8 months ago and provides an interesting mix of very modern high-end furnishing and wall treatments but the original fascade, high ceilings (in rooms too) and ornate details. Because it is so new, it has not yet been written up in the guidebooks; however, I expect that when the new editions come out that this hotel will be right at the top. While we paid 150 euros per night without breakfast, a room of our standard room's quality combined with the overall luxe feel of the hotel and its full range of amenities would easily fetch $350-450/night in San Francisco or New York.The rooftop deck, which has a very modern lounge-y feel with built-ins and other freestanding seating areas, is lovely with views out over the city in all directions. It was especially welcome in the evenings during our stay becauses it was so hot during the day. The pool located on rooftop is on the small side, but nice for cooling off and lazing around. On the floor below the streel-level reception desk is another pool/spa facility, which is pretty amazing. Apparently the stone and brickwork arched ceiling over that pool is part of the original building and was uncovered during the renovation. It feels like you are in ancient roman bath or a wine cave, but the new pool itself, which is larger than the rooftop pool, has jacuzzi jets, two overhanging waterfall type fixtures, and two stainless steel lounge chairs that are submerged in the water with pinhole jets in the backs/seats. There is an adjacent steam room and sauna, as well as a glass enclosed air-conditioned exercise room with treadmill, etc. Plenty of towels, water, changing facilities, etc. All of the above is free to hotel guests. The rooms were handsomely decorated (peeked in a few others while being cleaned), complete with large plasma tvs with good array of English channels, in-room music system, and room lighting that allows you to dim the lights to various levels at the touch of a button (modes: welcome, relax, reading, nighttime). The bathroom was all forest green marble with both hand-held shower hose and rainfall showerhead. It was initally a bit confusing to figure out how to go from tub faucet, to hand-held, to rainfall mode. There is a towel warming rack, which was great for laundry. Plenty of toiletries, hair dryer, etc. In closet safe, fridge, etc. I couldn't, however, get an iron when I inquired about it, though they did have laundry service. They offer pillow service as well, which I tried. The room came equipped with hypoallergenic synthetic pillows, two each: one longer bolster-type and then one larger European square pillow. The card in the room offers several other pillows, including down and memory foam. We tried those two, and the housekeeping staff left the originals as well, so we could go back and forth between them. As others have noted, the rooms have two twins pushed together, which does appear to be common in Spain. It makes for spacious king, but isn't ideal. Air conditioning, which we needed worked very well. However, there was a consistent intermittent mild bonking noise, which we finally realized only occurred when the air was on. I would imagine that it was specific to our room, and it wasn't a big deal. There is a large, nicely decorated computer room -- think clubby with sofas, music, great lighting, magazines while you wait. There are two computers with printers, all free of charge. There is no concierge to speak of, though the reception desk attempts to fill that roll. The front desk employees' affect could afford to be a bit more friendly, but they weren't actually negative or surely. I guess I would summarize their mode as slightly cool. Overall, one of the nicest hotels that I have stayed in; hip but not at the expense of comfort. I'd definitely go back and highly recommend it. I wish that every city that I visit had a hotel as nice as this one and at similar rates. While there are three rooms with private pools on the corners of the fifth floor, and others with private terraces, I wouldn't hesitate to stay in a standard interior room as we did, as the overall hotel amenities are so wonderful that you will be very happy with the communal outdoor areas. The hotel is not cuurently very busy from what I can gather, which I think is due to the fact that it is so new. It would an overnight success in Manhattan or LA, or any urban setting in the US for that matter. Best way to book, according to the hotel, is as we did, through their website nnhotels.es. They have several hotels in Barcelona, including Hotel Jazz, which is also highly rated by tripadvisor reviewers. We saw it as we were riding by in a cab one day, but did not actually go in.

<Content>Close to perfection in Barcelona This must surely be amongst the very best hotels in Barcelona. My boyfriend (a hotel snob it must be said) booked this weekend away as a surprise and boy did he earn brownie points for this hotel. Only about 15 minutes from the airport means it's perfect for short stays. Situated just off La Rambla we had reservations that it would be noisy - we couldn't hear a thing when the doors were closed. Our room had a private terrace and I think it is definitely worth the extra expense for that - it meant we had our (fantastic but quite expensive) breakfasts sitting in our own private dining room outside. I reckon room 528 must be the best though as it has it's own pool and is on a corner site - next time...I used the air-conditioned gym (sad I know!) each morning and the cellar pool is just heaven (although respect to anyone who actually manages to recline in the spa loungers in the pool). I appreciated the free bottled water and towels downstairs too. The pool on the roof is also just heaven - need a few more loungers but the views are fantastic and the extra breeze up there is very welcome. Would like to have seen them serve food on the roof terrace as they do have the tables and chairs for it but at the moment it's just bar service. Our room was immaculate and the bathroom was very cool (I'm a huge fan of a good bathroom!) - shower is confusing at first but we got the hang of it after a while. Air-conditioning is the quietest I've ever experienced and works brilliantly. Daily maid service was excellent and it's worth noting that the mini-bar prices are not silly so you don't feel too guilty at raiding it. I would have preferred a double bed rather than two beds put together but then I'm British so we like that kind of thing. Couldn't really fault this hotel at all - if I could go back tomorrow I would - it's a slice of heaven in a very cool city. The only you'd change about Barcelona is to make the shop and waiting staff friendlier - they all appear a little off-ish and stressed and I speak Spanish so they don't have that excuse! If you get the chance go to Hotel 1898 - I'll be hugely jealous.

<Content>Highly recommended! We spent an excellent three nights at this hotel last weekend, which I chose based on the recommendations from this website, and I have to say, we were not disappointed!I had booked us a deluxe room (direct with the hotel through their website) which certainly had a wow factor, and an amazing private terrace (about the same size as our bedroom) from the double doors in our room. The view from the terrace (we were on the fifth floor) was great and there were table and chairs, and padded benches to sit on and laze around. We requested a bottle of champagne in our room for arrival, and this was done without any fuss, they even sent me the champagne list in advance so that I could choose.The room was lovely, the bathroom fantastic, believe everything everyone is saying about the shower - absolutely great, nothing like anything I've seen in the UK. The lighting in the room was also very good with four levels of lighting available.Despite others' comments, we did have breakfast in the hotel on two mornings. I felt that it compared very well in price to the breakfasts in full service hotels in the UK, and there was a great variety in the buffet (though the cakes looked a little rich for that early in the morning!!) The concierge was very helpful in supplying us with a map of Barcelona, even going so far as to point out which roads to avoid in the midday sun, and which ones had the best shade.We did have a slight issue with the bar service on the Saturday evening. Before we went out to eat, we thought it would be nice to have a drink in the bar, but the bar team member did not acknowledge us, and we waited, and even though he was attending to someone else, he did not even acknowledge us, or smile, or say hello, so we decided to go somewhere with a little more friendliness and warmth.The only other issue we had was on our last night, when we could hear running water, and so we couldn't sleep. The night porter came to our room, and heard the noise, but was unable to solve the problem (still not sure what it was, could have been coming from room above?) but he did offer us a room move, but as we were checking out in the morning, we declined. He handled it well, but no mention of a reduction in the rate to compensate our wakeful night.Still, we did love this hotel, the roof terrace is great, with fantastic views, and a good opportunity to relax after walking around a very hot Barcelona. Towels are supplied, so just bring your bathing suit.The location of the hotel is excellent, and we would recommend it to anyone looking to be pampered. I'd recommend the deluxe level room which was very good. We'd go again, and we're hoping to visit this lovely hotel and fabulous city again later this year.

<Content>Fabulous spot We stayed at the 1898 from 21st to 23rd july. Excellent position , half way down the Ramblas. Lovely hotel, nice decor and furnishings, excellent staff, really comfy room and bed. Our room had a balcony overlooking the side street but was very quiet. We had breakfast in the room and it was excellent. will definately go back. We ate in the restaraunt and the food was one of the best we had, the other being La Forma in Zona Olympica near the Casino.

<Content>Great Hotel - Service could Improve I recently spent a wonderful weekend in Barcelona staying at the Hotel 1898.The hotel is superb- set in a great location and the rooftop pool is awesome.I reserved a classic room as when I called to enquire I was told that the Classic rooms which sit on the inner courtyard were all exactly the same size as rooms in the next category up, so I booked one of these thinking we wouldn鈥檛 spend a great deal of time in the room anyway.However when I was shown to my room (room 510) after waiting 20 minutes, it was small, dark and awkwardly shaped, and looked nothing like the images on their website. A bed was pushed up against the tiny window making the room even darker. I checked the floorplan on the door and this room was indeed smaller than the other internal rooms as it was on the corner by the lifts, so I called reception to change the room. As no other Classic rooms were available I had to pay an extra 50 euros per night for the privilege but the Superior room ( room 635) I now had was terrific 鈥?light, bright and airy with a street view.The hotel 1898 have no dedicated concierge- and I was told that all the reception staff could assist with any query, but when I asked them to recommend a restaurant for dinner I was sent to an overpriced tourist trap on the beach with terrible food and awful service. This wasn鈥檛 helped by the inaccurate directions they provided. Taxis also seem to be quite difficult for them to organise (perhaps due to the location), but we were always kept waiting ages or were advised to walk.If you're looking for a great - and cheap - seafood restaurant, then try La Paradeta on C/Comercial 7 about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Superb seafood, served refectory style. Choose from glistening mounds of clams, mussels, squid, spider crabs and whatever else the boats have brought in, let them know how you鈥檇 like it cooked (grilled, steamed or a la marinera), pick a sauce, buy a drink and wait for your number to be called. .I would recommend Hotel 1898 as a great place to stay, especially for the wonderful rooftop terrace and the central location but don鈥檛 ask the staff for tips or advice and make sure they don鈥檛 put you into one of the small and dark corner rooms on the inner courtyard. Oh, and watch out for the 2 elderly gentlemen standing by reception 鈥?I have no idea what their role was as they never spoke, never assisted with anything, never did anything in fact, but they were always there- management perhaps, but what they were managing I do not know?

<Content>Great hotel We have just spent three nights (July 6, 7 and 8, 2006) at this fabulous hotel. It is excellently located, new, clean, quiet and well air conditioned. The bathrooms are well appointed with all toiletry supplies and a heated towel rack. The only negative feature was the small size of the room but this is very common in Europe. The plasma TV made up for the size.The hotel has computers wired with internet available for guest use on the third floor and this was very handy for us. The staff are very helpful and professional. We would absolutely stay there again and highly recommend it for others.

<Content>Best Value to money. Great people I frequently stay at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton hotels. Although the service isn't quite at the same level. It's very good. The staff are personable, helpful and expressed a sincere degree of actually wanting my trip to be an enjoyable one. The rooms are well worth the money. They are modern, clean, well airconditioned and well proportioned. I stayed at the hotel for almost seven days and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering staying in Barcelona.I believe that the same group also owns the Hotel Jazz,

<Content>Sensational!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think I would have to say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in,and I thought that the Bellagio in Las Vegas would take some beating.The hotel was once an old tobacco exchange and the decor is in keeping with this old colonial style.The first thing that hits you(apart from the very welcoming air conditioning)is the beautiful lobby and its sumptious leather couches and gorgeous high end furniture and fittings.You simply know that you are in a quality establishment .We opted for a premium room(265euros per night although this will go up in the coming months as Summer peaks) .It was worth every penny.The room was just fantastic with your every need catered for,from the wall mounted plasma television,to the luxurious bathroom(with beautiful high end toiletries,dressing gown and slippers).There was various light setting that I have never seen in a hotel room allowing you to control virtually everything from your bed.You even had a brochure denoting the various pillows you can order that are condusive to the way in which you sleep(incredible I know).All this is complemented by a beautiful wooden floor and fantastic decor.You could be forgiven for spending the whole time in your room.If you do drag yourself out of your room then you may have difficulty in dragging yourself from the pool and roof top terrace with a bar and very attentive staff.Coming back to the hotel from our various sight seeing trips we headed straight to the basement and into the spa pool,sauna and steam room,that was simply luxurious ,and absolutely spotless with staff everywhere cleaning and replacing the free bottled water.We didn't eat in the hotel aside from breakfast(which isn't included in the price),which was excellent.The surprising thing is that the hotel is a 4star luxury and the le Merriden across the street a 5star and double the price.I have stayed in le Merriden hotels and they aren't a patch.We will without doubt return.This truely is a fantastic hotel .

<Content>Highly recommend this hotel for weekend break First of all - a big thank you to everyone who previously reviewed this hotel and bothered to recommend it on this website. Based solely on the reviews, we booked to go for a 3 night stay. Thought the hotel was great. Wonderful location on La Rambla. Stylish decor in public areas and bedrooms. Quiet room despite location. Staff all friendly. Fantastic to have rooftop outdoor pool and loungers and also indoor basement pool with gym, steam room and sauna (free to hotel guests). Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Had a brilliant weekend break and hope others who visit Barcelona and stay at Hotel 1898 enjoy a similar experience.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel! This hotel is in a perfect location, right on the ramblas, but we were not disturbed at all.The rooms are lovely, comfy bed and good sized towels in the bathroom. We even had a balcony which we were not expecting.The spa in the basement is fab - really nice pool with lots of bubbles which you can control - either sitting on the steps or on a lounger in the pool. The steam room and sauna were also a welcome suprise.The pool at the top was also lovely, although the one time that I went to use it, they had emptied and were refilling it! However all around the pool were great loungers with cushions, including two king size bed benches which are very easy to fall asleep on! Also towels available around the pool.Would highly recommend this and would definatley stay there again!

<Content>Flawless We stayed in this hotel for four nights and amazingly enough for me, there is nothing bad to say about it. The staff were so courteous and friendly, the roof top pool is a gem in the middle of the city and the design is very restful. Sometimes when you are away you want to get out of the hotel and not go back until the last possible hour. This hotel is so different with regard to that. The roof is very relaxing. You can come back in the middle of the day, have a dip, cool down and then head out again for the evening. Things are very easy going here. We were going to a wedding and my husbands shirt was in a ball so I gave it to the housekeeper making ironing motions. It arrived back 20 minutes later perfectly pressed. Crisis averted. Overall, a wonderful place to stay.

<Content>Perfect hotel - we loved every minute! We have just returned from a perfect five night break to Barcelona. It was our first trip to the city and Hotel 1898 had been recommended us. We booked directly through the hotel (the availability was far better than on various travel websites) and the price was great too. From the minute we arrived we were delighted with our choice. We couldn't fault anything about the hotel. We were upgraded on arrival and our room was fantastic - full of small touches to make it extra special. We didn't eat our meals in the hotel but made full use of all the rest of the facilities, all of which were above expectation. We spent early evenings relaxing on the huge sunbeds by the roof top pool with its fanastic views and had a massage, sauna and swim in the basement spa - again the service was impeccable and the little touches - sunlounge style jacuzzi chairs in the pool, waterfall showers - made all the difference.The location is ideal for exploring all of the main tourist areas - the metro is a 2 minute walk, although we walked nearly everywhere. The hotel is so quiet you wouldn't know you were on the main tourist drag. I am not a fan of major tourist areas but La Ramblas is great for people watching and street shows (although I would not eat anywhere - there are far nicer restaurants not far away down the side streets). The hotel is extremely reasonably priced for what are more than 4 star facilities and service. We loved every minute of our stay at Hotel 1898 - we will definitely be returning to Barcelona and wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else.

<Content>Totally perfect hotel! Every now and then you come across an hotel which goes the extra mile and hits perfection. In my opinion, this is exactly what the H1898 does. The location is very central - not far from the adorable El Born and Boqueria - and I would advise booking one of the de luxe rooms. The private terrace is totally to die for and is one up on the more expensive junior suites. Have breakfast brought to your room and enjoy it on the decking, with your priovileged bum on the wonderful cushions. I travel a fair bit for business and you really notice the little touches that make an hotel exceptional. This is defintiely one. As such, we are going back for my boyfirned's birthday this weekend and Ihave booked 15 rooms to take some VIPs there in August! Only gripe was that they were a little touchy with me as I checked out half an hour late as I could not tear myelf away from the rooftop pool!

<Content>Hotel was great - can't fault it Hotel was great. Wonderfully furnished and the pool and deck area on the top floor was great for that well earned bit of relaxation after walking around Barcelona for hours. The hotel is very central on Las Ramblas. Las Ramblas is very touristy now - and well worth avoiding. Don't eat there as the restaurants aren't very good and are expensive. However, this wouldn't stop us from staying at the hotel again.

<Content>A Beautiful Oasis The hotel was top notch. The service, accommodations and food were all excellent. The roof top pool (with great lounge and bar) should not be missed for the views and relaxing atmosphere. This area, as well as the entire hotel are a nice escape from the hustle  bustle of Las Ramblas. The staff are all fluent in Spanish  English. This made my stay even more enjoyable as I'd been in the French countryside prior and had a difficult time with language interpretation. It was the little things (heated towel racks, high powered blow dryers, light settings at the touch of the button that include read, relax  welcome as their level indicators, that really made the rooms special as well. I would HIGHLY recommend staying there and will myself again.

<Content>Perfect hotel for a relaxing weekend My wife and I have just returned from a 3-day trip to Barcelona, and couldn't rate the H1898 highly enough. We have been to Barcelona several times before but this was our first trip to this hotel -- we won't be staying anywhere else in future as you won't find a better hotel for the price.The best bits:* The roof terrace -- very stylishly put together, with sun loungers, a bar, a (small) pool and lots of other seating, including two large double-bed sized mattresses perfect for soaking up the sun on* The pool in the spa in the basement. A superb setting in a converted cellar, with free use also of the gym, steam room and sauna - a relaxing way to end the trip and grab a shower before jumping on the plane if you have an evening flight* It's a brand new hotel, so everything is pristine -- no lumpy pillows or bashed light fittings here* The location -- right on Las Ramblas, but very few rooms actually overlook the road so is isn't noisy. It's situated near the top of the Ramblas opposite Le Meridien -- 5 mins from Plaza Catalunya, the metro system, El Corte Ingles and the airport bus stopWhat types of people you'll see there:* Couples in their mid 30s-mid 50s* Well-heeled groups of twentysomethings* Business peopleWe booked a corner room (if you're booking online it's the room with red furnishings rather than black) which was a little bigger than a standard room and becaise it was on a corner had an extra window. Would probably book a standard room next time, although judging by the relative size of the rooms on the fire exit plan they look fairly compact.We didn't try room service (there are too many good tapas bars around) -- the only thing we'd change is to provide coffee and tea-making facilities in the room. Tea is complementary, but you need to call down for hot water.In case you're hungry there are loads of good tapas bars around, and the restaurant on the 1st floor of the building opposite the hotel on Las Ramblas called The Attic is excellent.Enjoy your stay!

<Content>Quiet, clean hotel, centrally located I spent 5 nights here at the end of June/early July, in a superior room without breakfast included. The room was large and looked out on what appeared to be an alleyway. I believe there was some sort of small restaurant with a patio there, and there was occasional noise as a result. However, it was generally very quiet, and I'm not especially worried about the view. The furnishings and decor are contemporary, though the materials used seem fairly simple.There was a very comfortable king-size bed with nice linens and various pillows to choose from. To their credit, hotel management has installed hardwood floors in the entryway and main room. Air conditioning was excellent and the closet was large. There was a flat-panel wall-mounted LCD TV. The lighting, in its various settings, can be controlled from the bed.The bathroom is nicely done in green stone and was very roomy. Huge towels, constantly replenished toiletries (including toothbrush/toothpaste, razor/shaving cream, and the usual other supplies), plush bathrobes and disposable slippers were provided. The showerhead is about the size of a dinner plate and water pressure and temperature were excellent.There is a restaurant which is really not too bad. I had dinner a couple of times and found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The food, while not wildly creative (go to Abac, Moo, Cinc Sentits, Comer莽 24, etc. for that), was tasty and featured good ingredients and simple preparations.I didn't spend a great deal of time interacting with the staff or using the spa. The lobby area is somewhat dark but tastefully decorated. Features of the old Compa帽铆a General de Tabacos de Filipinas building have been carefully preserved.I would recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. The client猫le wasn't upper crust (if that matters to you), and there seemed to be a number of small tour groups booked in as well. I only hope that the current standard of the hotel will be maintained.

<Content>All Round Fantastic We chose this hotel after reading reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. My husband and I stayed with our 16 year old daughter and her friend. We treated ourselves to a privilage room and the girls had a classic. Our room was about 50% bigger than theirs and had a beautifully large bathroom and overlooked the street, which in truth we didn't really look out at much! The girls room overlooked an inner courtyard and they said the room did feel quite dark most of the time. As other reviews have said the showers are fantastic, but hey they're only 8 months old, hope the standards keep up. Air conditioning was also very efficient. Needless to say the girls made great use of the spa facilites and the rooftop pool and sun lounge area was just out of this world especially after a hard days sight seeing. The breakfast is definitely worthwhile if you have the capacity for big breakfasts, otherwise it's an expensive waste when there are so many cafes etc right on your doorstep. Breakfast in the market is a must. The location too was perfect for us as we wanted to let the girls have as much freedom to explore on their own as sensibly possible, which they successfully did.We decided to eat in Attic, which is opposite the hotel, on our last night. It's a large restaurant and we arrived at about 8.30, quite early by Barcelona standards, they had a lot of empty tables including most of the window ones, but the girls had walked up the stairs first and requested a table for 4 and were being shown to a table right at the back of the restaurant, I asked if it was possible to have a table in the window at which I was told they were all reserved! I must admit my back went up immediately as he was not prepared to offer any other table, so I said thank you but not for us and went to walk out. Needless to say the maitre de stopped the waiter and asked why we were leaving and hey presto we got a table in the window. These tables were not reserved as we sat near the entrance and plenty of other people came in without reservations and got shown straight to these tables. After this minor glitch though I have to say the food and service were great.Happy Hols

<Content>Wonderfull hotel It's not a 4stars hotel, believe me. I spent vacations in 5stars luxury hotels, as Ritz in Madrid and Ritz Cartlon in Naples, Florida and this small great hotel is absolutely a 5 stars!Settled in the main street of Barcelona, closed to Plaza Cataluna, just opened in a old building, the ex Philippines Tobacco Company, modern but sophisticate. You can find old blackwhite photos about tobacco at the entrance and the box in the rooms with paper, envelops reminds that that (wood made). Our room was the chipper one but very, very comfortable, in the bathroom we found toothpaste, soap, etc. appositely made by Etro, flip-flap...small details make the difference.Great spa with steam bath and bobble beds in the swimming pool.Another open swimming pool on the roof (7th floor) with small sofa where you can drink a cup of champagne. Great overlooking.Only one dolente note: our room, n. 206, was just up the kitchen I suppose, because of the small that sometimes come into the room by window. But definitely we will come back again to Hotel 1898.

<Content>Oasis of delight I stayed with my boyfriend in this hotel in May for 3 nights and we were both very impressed. Both of us travel quite alot and have stayed in 5 star hotels on numerous occasions. Hotel 1898 is every bit as good as any 5 star hotel and was magical from the moment we stepped into the foyer - very modern unique chic decor. The Charlie Chaplin slient movies playing on the LCD screen in the lobby is a novelle idea. We had a delux room on the 3rd floor that overlooked the street, as the windows were sound proofed we never heard any traffic at night. Although satellite TV, Sky News was about the only chanel in english. Bathroom was very large with beautiful marble work - bathrobe and slippers for both of us and they were very generous with restocking the toiletries every day. Down side if you want to have a tea or coffee you must order the hot water and as is often the case in warm climates - it wasn't very hot! The staff were all very helpful and were always smiling and polite..The jacuzzi was wonderful, as was the indoor pool (although on the small side) and the sauna just perfect for relaxing on holiday.My boyfriend is a major Starbucks fan and was delighted to have one next door to the hotel - there's even a Dunken Doughnuts open 24 hrs a day a few doors down. Breakfast is definitely best from the market - again only 3 min walk from the hotel. Ours tended to be an unhealthy mix of delicious fruits and decadent chocolates!!Hotel is in a central location right on Las Rambles - within 10 min walk of the port area and only 2 mins from Placa Cataluyna where you can get a hop-on-hop-off city tour bus every 10 mins. Great way to get initial feel for the city. Shops were also in 3-5min walking distance of hotel. Would definitely recommend hotel and would love to return to it soon again - however I fear it will become very popular and the prices may increase too.

<Content>Lovely modern hotel This is a lovely modern hotel right in the heart of La Ramblas. We found it on Expedia at an excellent rate. It麓s directly opposite the Le Meridien and I麓m sure is about half the price! It麓s only five minutes away from the Gothic Quarter and to our delight, less than five minutes away from the Mercat Boqueria, which is a great place to have your breakfast (everyone must pay a visit to Bar Pinotxo for your morning cafe con leche!). I wouldn麓t bother to eat breakfast in the hotel. Staff were professional and polite. Our room was a little on the small side but otherwise it was great. It overlooked the inner courtyard which was fine as I would think those overlooking the street would be noisy. The roof top pool is too small for laps but fine for a dip on a hot summer day. There are also lots of comfy sofas and 篓beds篓 for lounging about on the roof in the evenings when the day cools down. There麓s cable TV though only about 2 channels in English and the rooms come with all modern amenities except you have to call for hot water if you want to make tea (no kettle in room). All in all, I would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel!

<Content>Great location and good value This is a good hotel in a great location. The rooms are a good size with nice modern bathrooms. I would guess that all the decor has been done on the cheap as the furnishings whilst quite stylish were not particularly high quality. The facilities were great. There is a nice outdoor pool (too small to swim in) with many loungers too enjoy the sun in. It is a shame there are no shaded areas. In the basements there is a nice indoor pool with spa area which is nicely done. I felt the service was a little bit lazy. The hotel was not very helpful about our late departure and wanted to charge us 60 euros to keep the room late which we felt was excessive. Overall I would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a very good hotel without paying premium prices.

<Content>Great Hotel for Central Barcelona After trawling this site and others, we went for this hotel for a short weekend trip to Barcelona. We went there on route to a friend's wedding so I was looking for somewhere central that would give us access to all the main tourist spots.The hotel is ideally located at the top of the Ramblas right opposite the beginning of the Gothic quarter.I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The room was small but really clean  contemporary in design. We overlooked the middle courtyard which was great for us as it meant we weren't disturbed by the noise on the Ramblas.The breakfast is fantastic if a little expensive (you're looking at around 拢15 for it). So, either make sure you give youself plenty of time to graze or head out to one of the coffee bars in the area to grab a coffee  pastry.The highlight of the hotel really for me was the rooftop pool - very peaceful and relaxing after a day's sightseeing.I would definitely recommend this hotel as a very good mid range option.

<Content>Chic, calm, haven I stayed at this hotel with my partner for 3 nights over the May bank holiday weekend. The hotel is in a fantastic location on La Rambla and within walking distance of the port / beach. Despite it's lively location the interior of the hotel is calm, cool and chic - an oasis in the madness. The decor is modern and tasteful - all dark wood and monochrome with splashes of red - but has character as it has retained a lot of the period features during it's conversion. The rooms are a moderate size and everything is extremely clean.We went to the hotel wanting a relaxing pamper and weren't disappointed. The basement of the hotel has an indoor pool with jacuzzi and a sauna / spa / gym area. The roof of the hotel has an outdoor pool and numerous sunbathing areas with cushions (big enough for two). There is also a library with free internet access.The staff were very friendly and helpful. We didn't manage to eat in the restaurant (there was too much choice outside) but the hotel bar was a great place for aperitifs.I would definitely stay there again and would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a romantic or relaxing break.

<Content>Hotel 1898 - A gorgeous and peaceful retreat. We spent two nights at this wonderful hotel before and after our cruise last week. This hotel is beautiful. The staff is friendly and helpful. We stayed in a superior room pre-cruise and a standard room post-cruise. Both rooms were very well decorated, with comfortable beds and awesome bathrooms. Only difference between the superior and standard was size and location. Actually, we liked the standard room's bed better because it was one queen size instead of two twins pushed together. The roof top terrace and pool had opened when we returned for our post cruise stay - an absolutely lovely space.We thought this hotel was the perfect place to explore Barcelona - the location is excellent - right at the upper end of La Rambla. Close to wonderful dining and walking distance to many tourist sights. Not far from a Bus Touristic stop.

<Content>Hotel 1898 was the best part of Barcelona I hate to say this, but Barcelona isn't my favorite place in Europe, but the Hotel 1898 is my favorite hotel in Europe. WOW! this place is great. The people are wonderful, especially helping me out with my rusty Spanish. The rooms were great, the hallway could be a bit noisy, but the bathroom was superb. Could have stayed in the shower all day. The roof top pool wasn't open, but Eduardo who works downstairs in the bar snuck us up on the roof around 10PM. It will be open on May 22, 2006. What a view. He also showed us the penthouse suites, if anyone can afford it $1500 eur a night, they are beautiful with their own private pool and deck. The only thing I can say that wasn't great was the massage. My friend and I both had a massage in their spa. The gentleman was very nice, recommended a great tapas restaurant which we ate at almost everyday. Txelapia, or something like that. Anyway, back to the massage. It was very soft, not a massage I'm used to in the States. Plus, and I don't know if this is an American thing, but this isn't for the modest. I was fully exposed most of the time. We complained to the manager and she comped us the charge. Like I said, maybe this is how they do massages in Europe. But, other than we had a fabulous stay. They is a Starbuck next door, but if you want the best capaccino ever, go to the hotel bar. It's pricey, but worth it. If I ever do decide to go back to Barcelona I will stay here again. Maybe I'll save my money and stay in the Penthouse Suite.

<Content>Fantastic Experience I stayed in Hotel 1898 during a business trip to Barcelona. I discovered the hotel by coincidence when I was a looking for a nice hotel -a place where I could feel the history and still be pampered- to stay. The hotel is situated in one of the nicest and most lively areas of the town. The building looks faboulous. The interior decoration is very elegant. The interior and the rooms are decorated in contrast to the historical outlook of the hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, very beautifully decorated and extremely clean. The staff was among the nicest I came across in Spain. They were very helpful and kind. The food was fantastic as well. This hotel has a lot of style. I recommend it to anyone who is keen on staying in a hotel which has both style and comfort. Whether you are on a business trip or just visiting Barcelona, if you want to make sure that you have a wonderful stay, choose Hotel 1898. They are doing a wonderful job!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel The hotel is wonderful; modern but luxurious. We loved our room with its big plasma tv and egyptian cotton bedding as well as different 'mood' light settings. The bathroom was also gorgeous too. The only problem was that we loved the room so much it was difficult to leave each day!The staff were very helpful and recommended a great restaurant called 'Neyras'; a little pricey but superb if you love fish. And I must recommend the hotel bar hot chocolate. The best I've ever had.

<Content>Why is this hotel not rated five star??? I have stayed in several 4 star and a couple of 5 star hotels in Barcelona in the last two years and none of them come close to Hotel 1898. Small touches like changing your towels twice a day, the robe and slippers and the ability to select different lighting strengths in your room by pushing one button, really make all the difference! Will never stay in any other hotel in Barcelona.

<Content>A must stay!! Stayed at the 1898 with my (gorgeous) girlfriend for three nights at the end of April.I booked due to other reviews on TA and wasn't dissapointed. The hotel itself is in a perfect location, at the (nicer) top end of La Ramblas. You are just a stones throw away from one of the open top buses main stations which will take you to all the major tourist attractions that the city has.The hotel itself is fantastic. The decor is very modern, it has the feel of a new hotel as soon as you come through the main doors. When we arrived by taxi from the airport we were greeted at the doors and our luggage carried in for us. The people on reception were very friendly and we were upgraded to a room with a veiw on to La Ramblas straight away. The room itself was quality, with a big plasma TV and the bathroom was gorgeous all green marble and very stylish. The shower head was the biggest I've ever seen and it was a treat to get back to after sightseeing for a day.The pool wasn't open on the roof but the one in the hotel itself was very nice. Dimly lit and very relaxing. The sauna and the steam room seemed fine as well but we didn't really use them that much.The hotel bar is great. The two blokes working behind it, Carlos  Eduardo were veryhospitable and good to have a laugh with (especially Carlos when you'd sunk a few beers), and the Sangira they made us was beutiful and strong!! The bar was a bit pricey but in my eyes your on holiday and should be treating yourself anyway.I wouldn't recommend eating on La Ramblas as it was pricey and the food wasn't that good but there are some great resteraunts located just off it.All in all we had a great time and when we come back will 100% be staying in the 1898.Thanks for a great time!!Tommy  Jerry

<Content>Great location, decor, clean I stayed here a week in March. I love the new feeling and cleaniness of this hotel. The decor and furnishing are very chic, new, and sleek but yet classic. My superior room was just like what the pictures show, with strong red color, hard wood floor, LCD tv, etc. The bathroom is awesome, but make sure someone shows you how the bath fixtures work since they took me 10 min to figure out.The location is perfect on the lively La Rambla, between 2 metro stops, and next to a supermarket and the Boqueria (fresh food market). One negative is that breakfast is not included despite the high room price. I think the hotel breakfast is 20 euros, and not many cafes around the hotel are open before 8 am.The service is great overall. However, there was some construction outside the hotel and the noise can be bothersome. On a Friday morning which I intented to sleep in, construction noise from what seemed to be from inside the building started at ~ 8:30 am. I called in to complain and the noise stopped for about 1 hr. This shows that the staff did care and overall service for the week had been in line for this class of hotel. However, having pounding sound early in the morning is quite unacceptable for a room costing $300 US a night.

<Content>fabulous hotel My mum and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hotel 1898 and it was fabulous. It must have been very recently decorated, the rooms were immaculate and the decor fantastic, it really is a beautiful hotel. The location is perfect, at the nicer end of La Ramblas with everything you need close by, it was a treat to return to the tranquility of the hotel after a busy day sight seeing.The staff were attentive, polite and spoke perfect english. The only down side was the price of drinks at the bar which although you expect, was a little hard to swallow after having had a gorgeous three course meal for two at a local resturant for the same price as two gin  tonics.Although the roof top pool was still undergoing refurbishment during our stay, the basement pool and surrounding facilities were more than adequate.

<Content>Amazing Gem My fiance and I just finished a 3 night stay at 1898 and was wonderfully suprised at every turn... the style of the hotel is fantastic, the service was top notch and the bathrooms made you look forward to a shower (I am not sure where all that water comes from...).. the underground pool is in what appears to be an old wine cave with water sculptures, it was beautiful.......the only suggestion I have is to make sure that you get an exterior room if you want to feel part of the city, the interior rooms look out upon a small courtyard of the hotel which is not unique. I have travelled extensively and stayed at hotels as varied as the burj al arab in dubai or the George V in Paris.. this hotel is not five star, but one of the nicest in town four stars you could find.....also, skip the breakfast as with most hotels in spain, it is better to take a walk down the street..... Try to attend and opera if that is your thing.. the opera is just around the corner. Also, there is a very modern and chic restaurant with great food just across the Ramlbas called Attic... stop by early or have the hotel call for reservations.....

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This is the first time I've ever commented on a hotel but find this website invaluable for honest appraisals of hotels around the world. I know it's probably more likely that a poor hotel/etc would warrant someone posting comment but I was so impressed with Hotel 1898 that the hotel deserved some more warranted praise.Ideal location on La Ramblas, the hotel is a new, nice looking hotel with courteous staff. The room was even cleaned twice a day- once at lunch and then another when we were out at night - never known that! Lovely shower (always a bug of mine when travelling, so often poor showers), plasma tv, comfortable bed - only thing I had a problem with is working out how to use/close the safe. Barca is a great city, and this booked through expedia was the perfect hotel. Best I've stayed in I'd go as far to say.

<Content>Excellent City Centre Hotel We stayed for 4 nights in March 2006, having carefully researched the available hotels we wanted a central location with facilities, pool, spa etc and 1898 did not disappoint. The location is superb, at the top end of Ramblas which is a bit like Barcelona's Covent Garden with street performers and artists making for a lively atmosphere. It is also a short walk to the more upmarket shopping areas and famous landmarks such as Gaudi's Casa Mila, and about 10 mins walk to the port at the bottom of Ramblas. 10/10 for the location.Some of the reviews mention poor service from the staff this was not out experience. All the staff were very friendly and attentive with an eye for detail such as welcoming us in English and by name. The service is however not overbearing, which we prefer, some may interpret this as a shortcoming and there is no concierge but the reception staff are excellent with good local knowledge.The rooms are extremely well appointed with wooden flooring, differing colour schemes, marble bathrooms with high quality Grohe fittings and nice touches such as heated mirrors in the bathroom that don't steam up!The basement pool and spa is a real plus. The pool has Jacuzzi areas, and is just big enough for a bit of a swim. A nice sauna, steam room and gym are also available and a treatment room, all of which was very tastefully finished and kept immaculately clean during our stay.A couple of minor points stopped this from becoming my favourite all time city center hotel (an accolade still held just by Hotel de Russie in Rome).We were woken by workmen in the next room to us laying flooring at 8.30 am, so whilst the room was well isolated from external noise it could not stop the sound of hammering from next door! Reception promptly moved us to a quieter room, but really we should not have been put in a room next to this work in the fist place.We were also disappointed to arrive back one night at exactly 1.00 AM to find the bar closed, despite the fact drinks were still being poured for other guests who had ordered before. A later conversation with the barman revealed a friendly guy, but one who definitely worked to rule! He was planning to come to work in London and was horrified when we told him how late London hotel bars stay open till!Our only experience of the food was a room service breakfast, the order got a bit mixed up, but was corrected very quickly and the food was excellent. When we checked out it had been missed off the bill, which I pointed out to reception who waived the charge for the breakfast. Our return flight was a late flight, and the manager agreed to a late check out and then stored our bags and valuables enabling us to enjoy a final look around the City.The Hotel has only been open since November 05, and I think it is a real find. I would not hesitate to recommend it, and look forward to going back in the summer when the roof terrace is open - where else would you be able to have the best of a beautiful city like Barcelona on your doorstep and then relax in the sun and swim as well?

<Content>Nice Decor Nice Staff Good Location The 1898 Hotel is in a good location, the decor is very pleasant and the atmosphere quiet and peaceful. However our stay was marred by the rooms being too hot. Strangely, rooms have lots of flashy controls for individualising sound and lighting but have none for temperature and have no air conditioning unit. We were sweating buckets and this is in March! So goodness help anyone staying there in August! We had no option but to open our windows which then brought in lots of noise.Our other bug bear was that this is one of those hotels which seems to think that twin beds pushed together somehow constitutes a double room. Very disappointing for a romantic break!

<Content>1898: a jewel on the noisy ramblas! We must admit that we selected the hotel after reading enthousiastic reviews from other people. We had not found a place in our first choice (Banys Orientals) and were almost falling in the trap of the fancy website of GAT RAVAL.Still, one of the reviews claimed 1898 was not at all a luxury hotel and staff was unhelpful so we were warned...Our experience was JUST PERFECT.As we arrived, we were upgraded to a superior room with no extra charge because all standards were taken.The room was tastefully decorated. Having myself worked in the building sector I particularly appreciated the choice of marbles, the quality of the parquet and the finishings.The air conditioning was not perfectly working, so they sent a person to fix it within minutes.Reception people were helpful and friendly (maybe because I am fluent in Spanish and we could exchange more)and the hotel very clean.The only negative thing we experienced was the room service, really too slow...If you can choose your room, prefer one that does not overlook the street: everybody knows the Spanish (but also the visitors of Barcelona!) like to celebrate and stay up late! The alternative is to bring your earplugs!We will definitely go back to this hotel, maybe even organize a business event there, because the facilities are brand new!

<Content>Recommended - 100% A great hotel all round. Deliberated long and hard before booking something special for our anniversary. Wanted something special, clean, not tacky - and this was it. Perfect all round.Hotel rooms were fantastic, plasma tv, fabulous furnishings, ultra modern, and no noise from other rooms. Reception area was lovely, modern and tasteful. Room overlooked La Rambla so of course there was the street noise, but then this was only to be expected on one of the most touristy streets in Barcelona. I expected this to be a busy place. Brilliant. Breakfasts were great, dinners were perfect and spa was wonderful. Would not hesitate in recommending. One reviewer has stated that the neighbour had cockerels...birds are sold in La Rambla on the street market stalls. However, these are removed at the end of the day. No cockerel noises after dark - not while we were there anyway.Would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Highly recommended My wife and I stayed at the hotel 1898 for 4 nights in March of 2006. I give it very strong marks but here are some specific comments that I hope can help people evaluate if this is the hotel for them:PROS:1) location is great: right in the lower middle of las Ramblas. During the day one can exit right onto the street, at night it's just around the corner2) very clean, modern tommy hilfiger-esque appointments. We stayed in the basic room with windows onto the courtyar/airshaft but still had a large room especially by european standards.3) high water pressure in very nice clean bathroom with hot water all day.4) pool is in the basement(the one on the roof was stil under construction) in arched brick wine celler like room. Steam room a real plus after wandering around all day. and the water massage equipment very nice5) electronic lighting and music controls for mood in the rooms and the rooms very sound proof. 6) maid service availible at as many odd hours as we needed the room cleaned and plenty of towelscons1) the hotel bar although very nice with a very comfortable lounge closes at 1 am which was early but there were plenty of places still open on las Ramblas.2)room service breakfast menu a bit limited and had toruble adding ala carte items had to order a double breakfast.I look forward to returning to this hotel.

<Content>Great Ambiance ! The Hotel 1898 was fantastic. Can't believe one or two of the other reviewers stayed at the same hotel !Staff were great, room was good, clean and very modern.The hotel has various nooks and crannies where you can get peace and quiet. Some areas were even showing old movies and the background music was very conducive to the whole atmospere of the place.Would definately recommend the hotel. We paid 拢112 per night for three nights. No breakfast included though.

<Content>Fab Hotel I deliberated long and hard over a hotel having visited barcelona before. I teach in the tourism industry and always choose location, followed by facilites and overall standard and of course price. I have to say hotel 1898 ticked all the boxes and I was so impressed by everything the hotel had to offer. Staff were extremely helpful. The only thing that explains the reasonable price is the small sized rooms but these are wonderfully decorated with great facilities so it doesn't really matter. I suspect this will become a very popular hotel which will, unfortunately, detract from it's overll charm!

<Content>Perfect - really should be a 5* rather than a 4* Myself and my partner have just returned from Hotel 1898 for a 3 night stay from the 9th to the 12th of February. I've never actually written a review before however Tripadvisor was very helpful to me when choosing the hotel for a very special surprise weekend with my partner so I've decided to put our views in writing - so here goes!From the outset there was somebody to help with the bags and the staff were very professional, polite and helpful taking us up to the room and even showing us how to use the lights (a very cool and modern dimmer system) and the bathrooms (all Ghroe fittings with a fantastic rainfall shower). The decor was perfect, rooms had plenty of room and nice and quiet (no noise from the hallway hardwood floors as suggested by some - all carpeted). Our room had a brand new 32 LCD TV mounted on the was which was very nice and the aircon was spot on. Breakfast was amazing (I echo what another reviewer said though - get it included in the price or its 拢18 euro a day each). The pool and sauna faclilities were very nice and very quiet also. We spent a fair bit of time at the hotel bar after an evening out chating to Carlos the happy little barman (he makes great and very potent - Sangria which we recomend!) Location - halfway down La Ramblas (directly opposite the Meridian) was perfect.Somebody made a comment about doubting people who wrote these reviews had ever stayed in a 5* hotel. Well I've stayed at the Conrad in Chelsea Harbour, Capodimonte in Sorrento and the Four Seasons in Montreal and I would honestly say that this hotel is up there with them. When we return to Barcelona we will certainly stay at this establishment again.

<Content>Great on the surface! Booked very much due to the fact that i wanted a good quality hotel in a good area and the reviews seemed excellent. Hotel is in a perfect location half way up Las Ramblas. Hotel is decorated and finished to an excellent standard. The staff are NOT friendly. Must be the only hotel I've stayed at where NOBODY greets you. Rooms were very well fitted a little small but who cares, heating was always on making it very warm, but the windows open which is ok. You hear the water coming down the soil pipe whenever someone uses the shower or bathroom in another room, and the neighbour keeps cockrels which crow in the early am. NO CONCIERGE or BELLBOY, but again not too important. All in all would stay there again due to location and general fittings, but nothing else.

<Content>Over Rated! This is a nice hotel... but really nothing special. I doubt whether those who rave about the hotel have ever stayed at a true luxury or boutique hotel. The staff is adqeuate - but impersonal. There is no extra touch that one who normally would find in a boutique hotel, nor an element of poshness/luxury that you would find in a 5 star hotel. During the stay we had issues with hot water (which were resolved quickly), and with the concierge... who seemed unable to secure a taxi no matter what the time (day or evening!).... that was truly UNACCEPTABLE. As was their attitude when I dared hale a taxi for myself... and successfully!... after they have failed for nearly 20 minutes.In summary - the services offered at the hotel are sub-par for the price. The staff is cordial, but certainly not friendly, and the hotel itself is very nice - but not amazing. Overall an adequate - but not remarkable stay.
