<Content>Want the truth here it is..... Okay first let me say i read MANY reviews prior to going down and it kinda made me wish we had chose a different hotel....BUT....here are the facts of my trip....first i am 26 years old and from ohio...on the trip was myself my 3 yr old daughter my 5 yr old neice my fiance and my fiance's parents. Some of the reviews talk about the food the most so let me start there....its not american! plain and simple...your not in america and our food isnt there...lol....its not great, the kids didnt care for alot of it but none of us starved. There fruit is great, Breakfast is the best and by all means if you get the chance go next door to the steakhouse....its the closest to american that your going to get! Yes we got some stomach issues but it wasnt that bad. The reason you get it is b/c the food is not what you are use to. Your stomach tried to send it through and its not a normal bathroom break. we still 4 days later are taking an extra trip to the bathroom. But its not too bad seriously...take some pepto or tums and that will help immensly!The second thing is SERVICE, weather is be maids or waiters or chefs or in general.....If you go thinking the ppl down there should speak english then dont go. your in another country and there language is spanish...i speak VERY little but it did help....Dont expect to go down and everyone know what your english means b/c they dont. YOUR not in america....so dont complain. There are some that can speak some or understand hand movement, try that before you become rude....we seen many americans getting rude and nasty to the staff b/c they didnt know what they were saying...well heres a heads up THEY REMEMBER FACES AND WILL BE [--] TO YOU THE REMAINDER OF YOUR TIME IF YOUR NASTY!Be good to your maids and mini bar guy. Leave a buck or so and bring some hard candies or pencils and paper for there kids....They will be great to you ALL WEEK! Otherwise you may not be happy with your room cleaning!The beach is amazing, clear water, blue skies and white sand. But dont sit in it too long the sand fleas/bugs will bite your butt and the itch pretty bad....i still have bites on my butt and so does my 3 yr old. The alcohol once again is not american, its not watered down its how there bottom shelf is....let me tell you its not a doubel shot but it got me quite toasty a couple times and im not a lightwieght!. lolI seen no bugs in the rooms and we had 2 rooms. They were clean and bug free, but the moisture makes your floor slippery so be careful.The beds do kinda suck. they have a fluffy mattress on top of a old one and its lumpy...not the best but i slept okay and so did the rest of the family...it was nice coming home to my bed though!There is PLENTY of things to do there....The shows at night are not vegas but they are nice to see, just DONT EXPECT VEGAS....youll be dissapointed!I wish i wouldnt have read the reviews prior to coming...i had too many doubts...and frankly i LOVED IT! My daughter loved it and so did everyone else....we will be back....i even got engaged down there....so maybe a wedding there..hmmmm never know......Dont listen to all the reviews...you have angry americans who think they are staying at a Hilton and they arent.. If you want a relaxing vacation are are not a bitcher about food and spanish its a great place. If your looking for a partying hilton....go elsewhere.....hope this helps someone.....wish someone would have laid it out for me......Have a great trip.....Kara from OHIo

<Content>Bendigedig - the Welsh for wonderful. Where does one start.I think initially I would like to comment on curious remarks from other reviews. Common sense says sun tan oil is more exoensive at the resort and start at factor 30 and work down , there are mozzies in warm climates so take spray with you, it was clear that top shelf drinks were free and was it a surprise that they spoke Spanish; we certainly didn't find that a problem and we're Welsh.When in Rome................Forget the journey from Wales to London etc., we arrived and there was a wow factor at the scale of the place.Reception was a hoot when we were mischieviously told our room was the opposite end to our request. It was spot on, 20 yards from pool bar and 30 yards from beach.We researched and yes staff respond to courtesies and a small tip goes a long way; in our experience better value than the larger tips we give in cities around the world.Our maid was fine as was the room; cistern had a perpetual drip which they worked to resolve.The grounds fascinated me and watching the gardner's was a treat, particularly when they arrived with barrowloads of coconuts.Never thought I would enjoy all inclusive but I did but having said that I fell downstairs four days before leaving so needed pampering and my massage on day 1 certainly improved my mobility.Food - Francia at Hispaniola was a treat and looked after us. We breakfasted there most days and whilst it catered more for carnivores, there was variety. The ommellettes were brill. but after 3 days I felt the pound piling on so gradually through the week my self control improved. It was nicer there when quieter. We lunched there a couple of times but mostly at the beach eatery. We got into the 8am A la carte booking routine which added to variety and did all bar two one of which was a pay for which we didn't do because we did the pay for on the beachat Cafe del Mar and didn't want to spoil the memory. The Japanese is worth trying and great fun and we enjoyed the Asian despite bad reports. Are my wife and I to easy to please, probably not but you have to put things in perspective.Staff were really good and besides Francia, Jose at the pool bar made a real effort to look after custome's and entertain. It's amazing how staff respond to pleasantness.We spent most of our days on the beach , reading, walking, cooling down in the surf and chilling. My bad baxk curtailed water sports but my wife Scuba's and snorkelled off a reef which she loved.Nice touches were a birtday card and a get well card when feeling unwell. Needed a blood test and the medicall centre staff were helpful and no charge for arranging hospital visit.Evening entertainment could be a tad repetitive but so is most of the crap we watch at home on television.Bar staff in main foyer were as good as anywhere and it was a relaxing evening venue.We didn't meet many Brits but had small talk with people from other countries and we saw none of the rudeness reported in other reviews.Shopping at the beach bazaars or outside the hotel can be a bit of a hassle but as long as you get into the mood of haggling it's not too bad. Just don't buy for the sake of it. Had it not been for injury I would have enjoyed sailing but hey there's always next time.Someone mentioned watered down drinks; my head didn't notice that and myself and the Presidente became good friends. Actually the red wine tasted watery but I enjoyed it not being heady. Champagne was fine, not Bollinger but acceptable.We're not posting pics as we have over 400 to choose from.Haven't mentioned stomach bugs yet; didn't have any but we're Welsh and hardy people or is our cooking worse lol.We would recommend this to couples, families, older people ( plenty of shades and beds everywhere ) and from what we saw honeymoon planning was excellent.

<Content>The trip that keeps on giving I just got back from my trip a day ago. My self, two year old daughter, husband, brother and my parents all went. We stayed for a week. First let me say that I have heard great things about D.R. . And there are some nice things about the resort and island. The beach is beatiful (minus the sand fleas). The resort was very pretty. Now the problems are, first I don't speak spanish, every one there does.(staff and other guest) The staff spoke very little english (and they were not always nice) Me and my family felt very isolated. Second I recieved bug bites, be from the mosqitos or the sand fleas take your pick. My husband was very sick with stomach problems by the second day. My daughter is now sick as well as myself , my father ,and my mother. This trip keeps giving just not in a nice way. We booked our trip with Cheap Caribbean - I will never use them again. when we booked in April we were told that if the price come down we would get the cheaper price THAT DID NOT Happen. Also at the last minute they changed our flight coming back where we had to do a stop over in P.R. when we booked we had direct flights going and coming home.

<Content>Wonderful holiday We were a group of 18 with APPLE VACATIONS. Everything went smooth from take off in PHL to the return from PUNTA CANA. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The rooms were the largest I have ever had. Very clean and the mini bar is replentished daily. It rained the first three days of our week but we swam anyway and it didn't ruin the holiday. Hightlights: you can walk to the right of the hotel to a watersports/activity area. The banana boat ($8pp) was alot of fun. We also went horseback riding ($25pp) for one hour. I have read the reviews and people need to realize when they book a tropical island that yes, it is hot and there can be insects. So, do not wear hairsprays, perfumes that attracts the insects. Also being tropical it does rain almost every day even if it is a few mins. AND you are in charge of where you book your holiday. IF you book Punta Cana, it is a spanish speaking island. I found the natives very friendly and you are able to make yourself understood. There was a variety of food at this hotel. The Los Brisas was excellent with lobster every night. You can go to the other properties for the steak house and the italian restaurant. All three had great food and service. Do not go to the MANGU which is located in the Occidential Hotel. We were told $25 pp with taxi, entrance and one drink. When we arrived at the club, the female manager told us $50pp once she found out we were americans. We argued with her and advised we were going to make a complaint with the hotel, she told us $8pp which is the cover charge that is advertised. We left. There are several clubs on the resort which are fine. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and the island.

<Content>Beautiful Island, just not this resort The best thing I can say about this place was the beach was amazing. Beautiful water on a sandy beach. Not crowded at all. The pools are nice also. Before I start with the good and the bad, I felt compelled to write this review after I found many reviews helpful in deciding which hotels to stay away from when planning my upcoming honeymoon. Here it goes:The GOOD:My fiancee and I went along with a large group for my annual FOP convention in July 2006 for 5 days. Besides what I mentioned above, a few excursions are definitely worth it: the scuba doo is excellent! It was very short timewise, but I enjoyed every minute of it. You can set this up right on the beach. We also did an ATV tour and horseback riding. Both were fun and worth the money. The manager (I cannot remember his name) was the nicest person I encountered at this resort. Very helpful and attentive to my concerns, he tried his best to be accomodating. The BAD: Oh god, where should I begin? First the room was horrible. The walls were sweating, literally. It was so bad that we left the room and came back to find some of our clothes moist. We asked for a different room and they obliged, after we had to find someone who spoke some English to help us out. I found that many people here did not speak English, besides some of the front desk personnel. Trying to call maid service for washcloths was a hassle, again because they only spoke Spanish. We went to the buffet one morning and while I understand that most places only serve pork products, the servers should still be understanding of those of us who don't eat pork. I was ordering a made to order omelet and observed the cook using the same spoon to retrieve the various toppings, including ham. When it was my turn, I gave him my spoon and asked him to give me an omelet with peppers and onions only, using my spoon. He called me a [-] (not sure of the correct spelling, but I know it means female dog in English, [-]. I was livid. I requested the manager who was very accomodating and listened to my concerns and a repeat of the incident. He walked away and returned with a platter of turkey meat for my party, which was nice. Needless to say, I didn't order omelets the rest of the week. The casino was even worse. I was playing blackjack and of course the rules are different than what I'm used to in NJ. No problem, but when I asked the dealer a question she responded in Spanish. Again, I speak English so I asked another player if he knew what she said. He told me she said I need to learn Spanish. What???? Again, I had to tell her off and remind her that I was on vacation not moving to Punta Cana. Besides there are many Spanish speaking people in the US who don't speak a bit of English and they are accomodated with no problem. I just couldn't understand the attitudes I was encountering. There were pool activities daily, which was nice and interactive, but again if you didn't speak Spanish, you wouldn't know what is going on. The evening entertainment is okay, something to pass the time and they try very hard. A for effort.Lastly and worse of all, we all got sick. ALL of us. We were sick for at least 2 days we were there and for at least 1 week once we got home. Diarrhea and upset stomachs were the problems. I don't know if it was the same monotonous food from the buffet, the water, or what but it was horrible. In conclusion, I am in no way picky or hard to please. I find the fun in any vacation I go on, which is why I still had a good time in Punta Cana despite the horrible service, or lack thereof, at this resort. I would have prefered to go somewhere that I am not expected to learn their language for a week stay or be cursed at for a simple request based on my dietary needs. Either way, this resort has sealed the deal that I will NOT be returning to Punta Cana.

<Content>Nice and beautiful if you have control of your self. The hotel is great, the service is good and the installation are nice with a few problems in the way but nothing big, the beach is excellent, very clean and beautiful water, they offer you a lot of activities to enjoy (not so cheap but great), the food is good, try just to eat the breakfast at the buffet restaurant, them try the others restaurants that have some specialty in the food, the Dominican restaurant is excellent, you need to try it, warning!!! if you go to the restaurant outside of this complex, the food is not so good and the quality is worse. The pool is nice try it in the morning less people around and more clean of course, don't forget to bring with you a lot of change for the person that serve to you, one dollar can make a lot of difference in the service, trust me, one dollar can move a mountain in this place, you decide what you gave to them. The room was fine with everything, complete, just a few problems with the bathroom and the air conditioner, after a call, they send you right away a technician to fix it (very quick), the lady that help us cleaning the room was very polity and helpful, don't forget their tips, 1 or 2 dollars at day will be very nice. The entertainment in the hotel is nice, but it can be better, try the tropicalissimo show at the casino. With the DRINKS be careful, don't drink to much and don't mix too much, they give all the drinks that you want, is your problem if you kill yourself, remember that you have plenty of days to enjoy. DON'T FORGET THE SUN BLOCKER AND THE AFTER SUN GEL, this items are the life of this vacation. The after sun gel is very important to relieve the pain in the skin, before you go to sleep. TRUST ME.

<Content>Never again The beaches were the best I've ever seen- beautiful water and plenty of included watersports. The friendly staff was eager to please, but the food was not so good. We stuck to bottled water and fried foods to be safe, but still got sick anyway. The top shelf liqours and imported beers were not included, and everything else was watered down. Presidente beer is the locally bottled beer (not too bad), so if you don't drink beer, be prepared to spend plenty extra on wine/beer/liqour. The nightly shows were corny, and by the end of the week we couldn't wait to go home... I will not go there again.

<Content>Don't pay attention to those negative people! Great experience; Lots of good food and great service. Of the 5 Barcelos in Punta Cana, I recommend this one. Not only is it the best of the 5, but staying there grants you access via their free tram to all 5 (they are close together).They offer quite a few excursions which went well.Don't go here if you just want to gamble...the casino is quite small (go to vegas if you want to gamble)Pools and water are great...beach is spread out so its not too crowded.

<Content>I Didn't Hate It This hotel has an unbelievable beach. The pool is outstanding too. I've never been to an All Inclusive before but imagine when chefs prepare food for a thousand people quality usually takes a hit. I thought the food was pretty good --- nothing great --- but I promise you I didn't starve. I didn't have any stomach issues. Drinks were great. Can't beat all inclusive drinks. Cuba Libre!!!The rooms were fine. Nothing flashy. Nothing to write about. We experienced minor problems that, when we called the desk, they were handled immediately. Staff was very responsive. If you don't know a little Spanish it will be difficult to communicate with the staff. Aside from the front desk and those trying to sell you tours --- waiters, bartenders, cleaning staff, gift shop clerks all speak very little English (if any). You might want to dust off your eigth grade Spanish book before you go. For the most part, everyone seemed pleasant.FYI - I wrote this on the main Punta Cana forum. Sun block was $43 to $23 USD per bottle. Be sure to pack enough.MOSQUITOS --- prepare for mosiquitos. That's all I have to say about that.

<Content>Make it your last choice! Just returned. Still have the runs. First thing I did when I returned home is laid flat on my back on my comfy bed mattress. Never so happy to sleep in my own bed. Mattress at the hotel must have been original and never replaced, like everything else at the hotel. Place is clean I must say. But they built this hotel, furnished it, and never replaced or updated a thing. You'll see the other reviews - very dated - they're not kidding. Food went down ok but we still have the runs. And you may find it difficult to communicate with others if you don't speak Spanish because 95 per cent of the staff and hotel guests are Spanish-speaking. Can't beat the weather though. Absolutely beautiful. Best souvenier - beautiful tan!

<Content>A Relaxing Vacation First of all, I found that overall, this hotel was about 3 1/2 stars, and that is using US standards as a comparision. It is extremely helpful if you speak Spanish when staying at the hotel, and if so, one will find many of the people to be friendly and helpful too. Although the trip is all inclusive (food, hotel, drinks), after one eats, leaving a small tip for the waiters and maids who clean the room daily is a good idea. These people make very little, and work long hours in often unbearable heat.When we checked into the hotel, the wait was rather long, and it took us almost an hour and a half to go to our room, which was quite spacious and clean. We had plenty of towels, but the smell was rather musty, and I think it is because the air vents are not changed very often. There are many places to eat, and frankly, I found the food to be quite varied in offerings. The exotic, tropical fruit was a great benefit, including fresh mango, guanabana, guava, passion fruit, and the exotic mame. The beach, although beautiful was not what I had expected, and there was algee, which became annoying at times. Nevertheless, the temperature of the water is a dream, and my husband and I would wake up early and go into the water, then sit and read for the rest of the day. There are also shows at night, which change every night, and although not of the Las Vegas caliaber, are nevertheless entertaining.Additionally, the hotel had some very beautiful jewerely, and I bought some unique Larimar items, which are of top quality. Although this stone is unique to the Dominican Republic, there are plenty of fakes out there, so if buying some, do a bit of reasearch beforehand. The color of the stone, to be authentic is somewhat uneven. Also, there is a swap meet type market set up nearby, where many items, from coffee, to vanilla, to the faceless dolls that are unique to the region can be purchased. When purchasing, remember to negotiate the price, (even in the hotel stores), as they are often inflated quite a bit.All in all a very relaxing stay. If you are speak Spanish, and are looking for a place to forget about the world, this is for you. I found staying 8 days was a bit on the long side, as bordom set in after 5, which to me, would have been an ideal stay.

<Content>WONDERFUL Vacation! Great Time Golfing! I'm a little late with my review as we traveled to the Barcelo Palace in April. My husband and I are late 30's early 40's and were looking for a beach/golf getaway. We got exactly what we were looking for.What we liked- Easy check-in; no wait; hospitality cocktail upon arrival- Service and PeopleLoved our maid; she had 4 chiildren and enjoyed the school supplies we left for her kids The staff was extremely nice. Keep in mind they work very long hours and don't make a lot of money. - FoodWent to the Seafood restaurant twice for all-u-can-eat Lobster Went to the Mexican buffet twice -- loved the fresh made tacos and guacamole We discovered the restaurant at the Beach and ate lunch their almost every day. Pick your own fish or meat and grilled to perfection while you wait.(We started skipping breakfast and went to the Grill for lunch)I'm not big on Buffet's but their's was good. Fresh smoothies and omeletes in the morning and fresh pasta at night.- GolfWe added golf to our package for a little more. I played 3 days and my husband played 4 days. We met a couple from Canada the first night and played golf with them a couple of times - that added to the fun. We brought our clubs; We called the club house each morning and they picked us up at our bldg with a golf cart; It's no Jack Nicklaus course, but its beautiful and we had a lot of fun. I believe we just payed for the cart rentals each day.- ToursOnly did the Segways; I highly recommend it if you've never done it.The beach is absolutely beautiful. Palm trees and white sand -- if you are in the mood for quiet, go to the Palace beach. If you are in a party mood and feel like dancing or playing volleyball, walk a litle ways down the beach to the Beach Resort.-Needs improvementOur room did have a very musty smell and I had wished I brought air freshener. The room was spacious, but definitely dated. The rooms are much larger than the rooms at the other Barcelo resorts in PC. We paid $24US for Internet for the week; We also paid a little extra for more TV channelsI would recommend this resort.

<Content>Horrible Experience - Nasty Food-Do not eat there! First let me say this hotel resort is huge and beautiful. They have the best beach at the Barcelo Bavaro hotels. They have plenty of securtity so you feel safe.My problem with the hotel was the food. The food is so horrible that i tried just about all of them thinking i would get a better experience and it was the same. The only restaurant that was some what decent was the steak hours at the Barcelo Caribe Resort. I got so sick from the food i had diarreha for a few days. i had to take pepto bismal everyday until we left. When i got back my doctor gave me a prescription for antibotics because i got some virus from eating the food. I dont know if the food is not fresh or if they are doing something to it but it made me and a few others sick. If you just want to go the beach then this is your hotel but if you plan on eating do not go. You will be sick and need medication.Also hardly anyone knew english also.

<Content>Great Vacation- Overall - this place is amazing. We had originally booked the Grand palladium, but because they were overbooked, they bumped us to barcelo bavaro palace. At first, i was really annoyed as i did a lot of research and chose that resort specifically, however - in the end, Bavaro Palace was great. Check in wasn't a problem - a bit of a wait seeing how there was a group of 20+. But come on - your on vacation, relax. We arrived around noon and our room wsn't ready until 3 - so we waited on the beach, had a drink and ate some fresh sea food ... no complaints :)the rooms were large and clean. We tipped the maid frequently. Water pressure was low but otherwise, rooms were extremely comfortable. I think we stayed in block 3. Many restaurants to chose from - a la carte as well as buffet. Wide variety of food -- i would say food was slightly above average. Some places were better than others - but overall, there was enough choice and food selection was plenty. Drinks were great as well. During the day, we had no trouble spending time on beaches or doing excursions (did the Saona Island and the Party Boat). We also rented out kayaks and paddle boats and played mini golf with no wait or cost. At night, however, entertainment was limited. There was a nightly show, but for the most part, they failed to entertain. They did try hard tho... so i give them props... somewhat :)The week went by fast - the service was excellent and everyone was really friendly. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this resort. It was easy to get to the other sister resorts as well - by walking on the beach or taking the trolly.

<Content>Very Disappointing When I first arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a receptionist that wasn't very friendly at all. Then the nightmare began. I had two rooms booked, my family's room was fine, however mine smelled so musty that I asked to have it changed. They only had a room available the following day, which would be located by the hotel they're building, which meant I would hear pounding from the construction every day. When I asked for an upgrade. perhaps an oceanview, after the inconvience of inhaling the musty odor, the receptionist said, I would have to pay an extra $35.00. That's a shame! The hotel is supposed to be a five-stars, but it was like a 2 1/2 stars. The food was less than average, I even tried the buffet at the other hotels to see if the food was better. No, it wasn't, it was even worse. I only wish that someone would write to the hotel's headquarters to let them know, what is going on. The staff makes you feel like they are doing you a huge favor by serving you, some of them were nice, like two or three of them, but the majority of them need to take a refresher course in customer service.The positive thing about the hotel, is the bavaro train, which runs every 20 minutes to transport you to and from the other hotels.The casino was nice, especially the pond where tropical fish and flamingo's are located. The beach is fabulous, and the white, powdery sand was amazing , crowded with palm trees. I refused to believe about the one-star reviews, however I do now. I woild never go back to that hotel again. If the palace is supposed to be the best, I can't imagine the sisters.

<Content>IT WAS A GREAT TRIP!! Read this REVIEW before BOOKING!!! Ok, first off i would like to say i've NEVER seen so many COMPLAINERS in my LIFE!!! Whoever is thinking about going to BBP in punta cana, please read this review before going and NOT the rest. I can't believe how many negative, depressing people there are. Ok first, my boyfriend and i and 2 other couples went to BBP July 13-July 20. Seriously, guys, it was a blast!! I was a little scared to book the trip because of all the horrible reviews but I just came to realize some people just go down there with a negative attitude and a closed mind that hey did you ever think of being SO NEGATIVE everything BAD will happen to you??? I just wanna say we range from 23-30 in age which might be helpful to some people because when I was reading reviews I wasnt sure if it was older couples or younger peopleWe arrived at the resort at 2 o clock i wanna say. We went right to the desk and had no problem checking in. My boyfriend and I were placed in one block and the other 2 couples were in another, we asked to be changed closer and it was not a problem at all and we got a room. So check in was easy. Obviously if your going on a day that a lot of people are checking in, hey, GUESS WHAT your GOING to wait just like you would wait at ANY other place. Our rooms were huge, cleaned and fine. Did have a smell but nothing that was out of control and unable to handle. AC was ALWAYS on and worked, in both rooms, with a stocked mini bar and always got clean towels. People complain that the maids turn the AC off well hey if it's 100 degrees out wouldn't you want to come in to AC??!! I would...Getting a drink at the bar was always easy. If your pleasent and a happy person, GUESS WHAT your going to want to be takin care of. If i was a bartender and dealing with drunks and people all day, i wouldn't want to go to someone who was miserable and out with issues i would go to someone who looks happy!! I must say becareful on the drinking. Let me just say they put more then half of the alcohol in the cup so one drink you're already feeling it. You definately get your moneys worth.Beaches are ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. The resort is very well kept. It's a resort, SO GUESS WHAT, there are going to be other people on there. If you don't want noise and entertainment, go to someplace where you'll be all by yourself. The people who put on contests and doing water aerobics etc are so friendly and fun. they try to get everyone invovled. Both at the beach and at the pool. Because it is a chain of sister resorts you have the option of leaving and checking out the other resorts. We tried a different place to eat every night. You can never go hungry cause there is ALWAYS someplace open. One place i don't recommend eating was La Brisa, unless you like sea food. They dont' cook the food like Americans do so you might feel it. On the 5th day we were there i started to have really bad stomach pains but it passed.. My boyfriend got it too. I'm a Nurse, so heres a little lesson for you people. Your eating food that is being prepared DIFFERENTLY then you would normally prepare it so OBVIOUSLY your body is going to have a reaction towards it. There is so much to choose from, I can't understand how someone could go hungry!!!There is a show EVERYNIGHT and there is plenty to do. We went to the discoteca (club) where they play both latin and american music ,and that is open till 5 am. The casino is open 24 hours, and places to eat are open late so there is something to do. It's not that bad and people are very friendly. If you go down there with an attitude and negative, your going to have an awful time. I wouldn't want to deal with any attitude or negativity so I don't blame them for being rude to some people. Remember, this is a poor country, your not going to get the Hilton hotel... if you want that then dont' bother leaving the states! These people work 11 days straight and have 1 day off, put yourself in their shoes!Overall it was a great time and fun trip. You meet so many people and do alot. I recommend this place to anyone! I'm glad i went with my gut feeling and booked the trip here and not listen to the reviews. We had a blast and I would go back again!

<Content>Terrible service I visited this hotel 5 years ago while attending this convention and I hated it. I had to return for the same reason and I decided to give it another opportunity because in 5 years things might have changed. Wrong! Everything was the same or worse.First of all, I must say I'm Latinamerican. Therefore, I speak Spanish. So the bad service wasn't just addressed to Americans. I arrived at the hotel at 1 pm and they told me I had to wait 2 hours because the check-in time is at 3 pm. I understand and I'm fine with that. What I don't understand is that a big hotel like this one (more than 500 rooms) doesn't have a bathroom with a changing room so people can go to the beach while waiting for their room. I mean, it's not that I arrived in a private flight! There were many flights arriving during the day. Besides, even though nobody was checking in at that time, they took 30 minutes to look for my reservation.The room - it was huge and clean, but it had a musty smell. The air conditioning was really bad. I couldn't sleep well because it was turning off and on (you can control that) and I was feeling hot, even though I'm usually cold everywhere.The beach is beautiful, but too noisy for me. If you like crowded places, maybe you won't mind. Too many wave runners, families screaming, hotel photographers (who then will sell you the pictures). The worst part was getting internet service. In the room, there is a card with an extension that you should call to get wi-fi. I called and the person told me I had to go to the lobby to buy a password (first time ever I hear something like this). And since this resort is so big, is even worse because you have to walk a lot. I got there and I asked the boy how much was the service. He told me $25 for 24 hours. I told him I need the service for 4 days. He answered he only had $60 for a week, and I agreed. I asked him to charge it to my room and he said he couldn't, since his service wasn't part of the hotel. He neither accepts credit cards, only cash. I asked where was the ATM and he told me there wasn't any at the hotel and that I had to take the train's hotel and go to another plaza, 2 stops from there. I took the train (that only passes every 15 minutes and it's veeeeery slow) and went to the plaza. The ATM was out of service.I asked where could I find another ATM and nobody knew (I needed to check my e-mails, because I was in a convention, not in vacation. I mean there is a convention center over there!). I thought the casino might have one. I asked and everybody told me it didn't. I couldn't believe it, so I went to the casino and there was an ATM. I got the money and went back to my hotel. I left at 5:30 pm and came back at 7 just in time for the boy's dinner break! He was supposed to return at 8.I decided to complain to the Public Relations service. The lady was very unfriendly and she told me it was my fault because when I made the reservation the hotel might have told me how was their internet service. I complained about not having the option to charge the service to the room and that's when she tells me they have another option: they can connect a modem and charge you $8 daily. I requested that service and it took 30 minutes for them. Finally I got internet! The following day another person tells me that the 24 hours for the wi-fi doesn't expire after a day so I could use the 24 hours during the 4 days I was going to spend there. And the boy didn't tell me this, so I looked for the ATM without needing it.The food wasn't good at all. Specially the breads (any kind) were awfull. It's like they left them outside and they became mushy. We had a party that we host during the convention at La Uva restaurant and that was great. The service over there at that time was very good, good music, beautiful decoration.At the palace, I agree the only good option to eat was the grill La Pina close to the 6th block.When leaving the hotel, we decided to have lunch at 12, because our bus was going to pick us up at 1 pm. Well, ALL restaurants are close at that time. They all open at 12:30. There were more than 30 people waiting at the entrance of one of these restaurantes!There are better options in the Caribbean to visit. For great service, I would recommend to visit Cancun or Aruba. Mexicans really know how to treat tourists.

<Content>Deception... I read in Trip Advisor some comments that eventually the water on the hotel it finished.... but, I did not believe... what a BIG mistake...Just on the first day, the water finished on my room.... I had to call the reception... more than a hour...Later, the air condition stopped... another call to the reception... then, I had to change the room...Two days later, what a coincidence: the water finished again... so, I had to call again the reception, and wait to the staff come to my room and spent more that two hours to finished the problem...Never again!!!

<Content>Worst vacation ever! My fiance and I stayed 7 nights at the BBP in June of 2006. First, let me start of by saying I'm writing this review now because I only discovered TA 6 months ago and seeing the importance of travelers reviews in helping others plan a great vacation.The Positive:I will start off by saying that Punta Cana and the Bavoro beaches are beautiful. One of the best beaches I have seen. Beautiful sugar white sand and clear blue water. Absolutley gorgeous!!Before I get to the negative I want you to know where we are coming from before hearing my story. Let me just say that I'm not a picky person and am always easy to please on vacation. I don't care about the having the best liquors or if the food isn't all that. I can pretty much always find something to eat at any of the resorts I stay at. I don't sweat the little things like outdated rooms or musty smells. These things are minor and never interfere with having a great vacation. All we really care about is staying somewhere with friendly service and feeling welcomed. We also want to stay somewhere clean and that doesn't mean it has to be a 4 or 5 star resort and have a fantastic beach. We have stayed in 2 - 3 stars before and they were fine. We have stayed at several All Inclusive and Non Inclusive resorts as well as cruises all over the Caribbean, Mexico, North Africia and so on before. I'm definitley not bragging just trying to explain that we have never experienced anything like we did at the BBP at anyplace we have ever been.With all these things bieng said, I wanted everyone know first what kind of person I am before you decide whether my review was helpful to you.The Negative:When we arrived at the resort to Check in there was a huge line. Which didn't stress us too much cause this can happen at any hotel. After about a 4 hour wait we finally got to our room. The room was fine and didn't have any problems there. So we went down to get something to eat and the only thing that was opened at that time was the Grill. There was a long line there to but we didn't let that bother us. After waiting 45 min we were finally seated and starved to death by the way. Anyway, we sit at the table and waited for our server who we though was never going to come. We noticed there were several workers standing by talking to each other and ignoring the people waiting to be served. Finally she arrived after a 15min wait and looked like she was mad about taking our order. She couldn't speak English very well and we can only speak very little spanish but that was fine we knew we were in another country so expected to have language barriers. Which I'm ok with. I just pointed at the item I wanted on the menu and smiled. Of course she never smiled back and about 10 min later she brings our food with that same pissed off look on her face. It wasn't what we had ordered but we really didn't mind. We are not picky eaters at all so we ate all of it while dieing of thirst even though we had asked twice for a refill. We pretty much stayed dehydrated our entire stay. The rest of the week only got worse. When we would go to the bar area to get a bottle of water or soda we would get completley ignored. There were other people sitting at the bar getting waited on. Some come up after we had been standing there forever unwaited on and they would wait on them. It's like we were completely invisible. It was like this everytime we were waited on in the Bar or any of the Restuarants and no matter how much you tip didn't change anything. Sometimes we would finally walk off and sometimes we starving or thirsty and waited it out. At one of the Restuarants one night we waited an hour before being seated. Although they were people just walking up and they were seated right away. The only reason why all of these people were getting waited on before us was because they were Non Americans or someone who spoke spanish. It was like this the whole time. The staff at the BBP were by far the ruddest people I have seen in my entire life. I felt unwanted there and that they disliked Americans. One time that I did recieve a bottle of water at the bar it has been opened. The bartender could have cared less and didn't offer to give me another.Anyway, one our 3rd day I got extremely ill. Now getting sick wouldn't keep me from returning back to a certain place because anytime you travel out of the country and eat food your not use to eating there is always the chance of getting sick. Anyway I ended up having to see the so called Dr. at the resort. I had been throwing up non stop for over 24 hours along with a fever and diarrhea. This Dr.'s office/ hospital clinic didn't have any blankets or pillows or even something I could vomit in. My fiance went and picked up a small garbage can in the waitng room for me to use. After recieving iv fluids and give med. I was finally released. My fiance asked about the bill and whether it was billed to our room liked it normally would have been at any other resort. The Dr. told my fiance to come by tomorrow and pay. Finally went back to the room around 2:00 am and am still very sick so I lay down to try to rest and about 8:00 the phone rings in the room and I had very little sleep from still bieng in the BR all night , my fiance answers it and no one says anything and just hangs up. 5 min later we here a banging on the door and he goes and answers and there standing was the Dr. and nurse who we had seen only 6 hours before. I though maybe just maybe she could have just been checking to see how i was. What a joke, she didn't ask anything about me she wanted her $400 bucks right then. This is the resorts medical center and they had all our creditcard info on file but it didn't matter. Even though the Dr. told us to come by the office the next day to pay she hunted us down like we were thieves and called the room to see if we were in it and hung up and came banging on the door. Only six hours after leaving. We were once again blown away by the way these people had treated us our entire stay. We meet several American families while we were there and all of them were experiencing the same treatment. Several were very ill. Some of them left the resort after the first couple of days. Everyone was trying to leave early. We were planning on going home after the 2nd day and I got so sick I couldn't travel. So I had to wait it out miserably. It really does shock me that anyone could give this place even a decent review. It's like there not taking about the same place. You can be the judge but I would hope that writing this review would keep other travelers from having a horrible vacation like we did.. I wish I knew about TA before booking that trip..Goodluck and happy vacationing!!!

<Content>Will not come back I'm staying here for a convention in Barcelo Convention Center which is adjacent to the hotel. I would never ever stay her again if not for the same reason.The hotel staff is not happy at all. They are very rude and never show a smile. They hate their job. At least that is what you get if you don't tip. BTW all-inclusive says tips included. Do not enforce that provision. You must tip if you want a smile.Nightly shows are very unprofesional. Not that I'm expecting a broadway performance, but have been to many properties alike and shows are far far better.There's good food, but the selection is not enough if you are looking for something healty or a kid's meals. Beverages take from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to arrive, you may be lucky... Or not. My wife also got a stomach-ache (read about this in another review). Got yogurth and veggies. Went to the farmacy for some pills. 10 pills of a basic stomach-ache drug that normally cost 3 USD were sold at 19 USD.This is not the only case. Forgot your deodorant? 2oz deodorant for 12USD. And the classic the farmacy is not associated with the hotel. Come on! They rent the space from you. You must enforce fair prices at your premises! Not wal-mart prices but double at most, not 7 to 10 times more expensive.We got a nice, clean room. Beach is great. Service does not exist. They do not care about guests. There's noone to complain about anything. Noone would listen. They just don't care.Will never come back.

<Content>Buyer Beware!!!!! Arrival- This was my first all-inclusive vacation. My past vacation鈥檚 has included Myrtle Beach, several locations in Florida, and two Caribbean Cruises. After we booked the Palace I read several questionable reviews that made me nervous but I thought the author鈥檚 must have been hard to please. I owe the author鈥檚 an apology because they hit the nail on the head. This trip was booked with a total of 14 people who helped contribute to this review.I was anxious to arrive at the resort and have a week full of fun and relaxation. We arrived at the front desk to an unfriendly staff who did not want to honor the upgrades we paid for. They were not very welcoming at all. We were stuck in a cheaper room for 36 hours before we were finally upgraded. Our travel agent spent several hours working to resolve this situation before we were upgraded. The customer service was lacking in all aspects!Food 鈥?Most of the restaurants are included when you stay at the Palace. The best food I found was the small grill next to the ocean (Next to the 6000 building). The cooks were friendly and the seafood and steaks were grilled while you watched. The steakhouse was also good. The buffet was an open concept and birds would fly in and eat off of the buffet and your plate if you鈥檙e not close enough to detour them. Besides the ice cream and cheese cake, the dairy products had a lot to be desired. The ham, burgers, sausage, and hot dogs had a weird taste. I have a tough stomach but I am still having cramping after being home for two weeks.Service 鈥?The housekeeper was polite and did an excellent job. The wait and bar staff had about 5 people who were pleasant throughout the whole week. Service was typically slow and unfriendly. The same items ordered from a menu would be completely different when served. It was nearly impossible to get refills as you ate and be prepared to spend one hour each time you have a meal because they are slow. The bar drinks were good when you could get service and they do not skimp on the alcohol. The premium liquor upgrade was a sham, do not waste your money!Rooms 鈥?Clean but outdated. Reminded me more of a mid class hotel than a resort. My room had a funny smell and 3 nights our room was infested by several flying ants that enjoyed crawling on us while we were trying to sleep.Pool 鈥?Awesome and very cleanBeach 鈥?Beautiful powdery sand and gorgeous turquoise Caribbean water.Golf 鈥?The course was OK and 3 rounds of golf were included in our package. I would rate the course a 5 out of 10. The green fees were included but the cart costs 30.00 per person. The fee was high for the quality of the course.I assure you that I am not hard to please but I was very disappointed in this trip. I am used to the friendly servant style service of a cruise but I felt unwelcome at this resort. If you are undecided I would definitely stay away from this resort and may reconsider the Dominican all together!The El Presidente beer is good!The next group trip will be in Mexico!!!

<Content>A Travel Agent's Perspective I have been a travel agent for 11 years and have traveled all over the Caribbean. I have been to the DR several times, several different resorts in different regions. I have stayed in Punta Cana three times. Every time I leave, I tell myself that I am never going back there but a few years later, I soften my harsh attitude, forget how poorly I was treated as an American and head back there, optimistically hoping that THIS time will be different. Unfortunately, my hopes have been dashed each time.I booked BBP as a family trip to celebrate my niece's high school graduation. As our departure date grew closer, the reviews here got more negative, focusing mostly on the lack of customer service. I still ventured on this vacation with an open mind, thinking that these travelers were exaggerating and it couldn't possibly be as bad as they were saying. Well, let me tell you......every word they write, about the poor treatment that the hotel staff gave them, is true.From the moment my family and I checked in, we were made to feel like our presence was not wanted and that we were a nuisance. With a few minutes of getting to the room, I was called and told that my credit card receipt was missing. The card was swiped for incidentals and had my card number, expiration date and signature. I then spent the next hour at the front desk on the phone with Amex, canceling the card. While waiting at the front desk, my sister came to me and said the kids' room had a waterfall of a leak in the bathroom which flooded the hallway and was running out the front door. So while I was dealing with Amex, I was trying to get the kids another room close by. I was told there were no rooms close by and they would have to move 3 buildings away. That was not acceptable. In the clerks' conversations back and forth with each other, I understood that the room the kids were assigned to should not have been given out in the first place. I was told there was nothing they could do. After more discussion and arguing, 3 rooms suddenly appeared. After that, we dealt with ongoing shunning and ignorance. The wait staff in the restaurants made us feel like we were inconveniencing them because we had to have 2 or 3 tables together for the group. Sometimes they brought you what you ordered, sometimes they did not. Many times, what we ordered did not look like what fellow foreign diners had ordered. They got bigger portions or were told about different specials. There was one time when we all ordered sundaes and we got the smallest ice cream dishes when the table next to us got huge parfait glasses. I will say that we had one pleasant dining experience at the seafood restaurant. Marisol was our waitress and she was very pleasant and friendly towards us. What a difference that made!Over the first few days, we tipped everyone....housekeeping, bartenders and wait staff. When housekeeping didn't restock the fridge, towels or amenities after asking several times (and having left tips a few days in a row), I told everyone to stop tipping. If it meant no better service, why do it? Likewise with the bartenders and wait staff. We would be standing at the bar and be completely ignored or they would take our order and then take a few other orders and serve the others first. One waitress dumped a glass of soda down one of the kids' backs and didn't even say she was sorry. The day before our departure. I stopped by the front desk to ask if we could keep one room until 2:30 the day we were leaving because the shuttle wasn't picking us up until 2:45. I was initially told no, then I was told that I'd have to pay $35. I went back the next morning and asked for a front desk manager and made my request again. I explained what I had gone thru with the credit card the first day and that keeping the room 2 1/2 hours after checkout shouldn't be the much to ask considering the inconvenience I had to deal with at check in. I was told I could only have the room until 2. What is 30 more minutes???We spent the morning at the pool and beach and we all headed back to the one room we had kept to freshen up before we went to lunch. Apparently they deactivated our card key so we were unable to get into the room. That was pretty much the straw that broke all of our backs.So that is my less than positive experience at BBP. Yes, the beach is beautiful, yes, the hotel has a lot to offer its guests (although very spread out and not always convenient), and yes, the food was not bad at all (desserts all tasted the same though and drinks were quite bad). But the lack of politeness and the obvious fact that they do not appreciate American tourism makes me never want to go back there and I will never send any of my clients there. You never really stop to think about how people treat you affecting your vacation, but it does. When you walk into a restaurant and nobody acknowledges you or they roll their eyes or they tell you they can't put 2 tables together, it gets very frustrating. I'm certainly not expecting anyone to roll out the red carpet for me but service with a sincere smile would be nice. I met a few people at the airport who stayed at other resorts and had similar experiences so I do not think this pertains only to BBP. Please feel free to contact me if you have any specific questions about this experience.

<Content>Loved Barcelo Bavaro Palce I just got back on the 1st and I had the Best experience in the Barcelo Bavaro Palace the workers were really nice and friendly , they had really good food if you like latin food really good shows and my kids loved it the have day care for you to leave you todlers while you experience the massages the pool and beach you can pay 15 american dollars to have your self a nanny for the day to take care of your children who are under 2 years old and from 4yrs old - 12 yrs they entertain your children with games actiities, train rides all types of activities I am sorry but everyone who has a bad review on this hotel are crazy. First of all you have to remember you are going to the caribbean to a Spanish Country were all the speak is spanish and were they speak very little english or no english if you go to another country or spain or where ever you know you are not going to under stand them if you want an english speaking vacation stay in AMERICA dont experience in other countries. Dominican people are known as very nice and with a funny caracter. and I am American but you see the worker are tierd that is because they work from 5 am till 12 pm straight wont you be tierd if that was you? BUT I DO RECOMMEND that if you are not a latin food lover or are a very grumpy person who only expect an english language and dont under stanf the fact that you are in a counrty where all they speak is spanish DONT GO STAY IN AMERICA.

<Content>FABULOUS, WONDERFUL, PARADISE Let me start by saying the Punta Cana airport is very hot but a nice experience. We did not have a hard time gettting our luggage. We got to the resort check in lasted about 10 minutes. The room was beautiful my room number was 2070 bloque 1. The air conditioner was ice cold when we walked in the room. The room was very clean and smelled good. The mini bar was stocked with everything. The food was great and a big selection. Do take imodium ad or pepto bismol. The beach is beautiful and the pool was awesome it feels as if the pools is on the beach that's how close the beach is. The staff is great hard working people they are there when you wake up and when you go to sleep. The resort is super clean and huge. The night entertainment is wonderful make sure you go to see the shows. This resort was great for me and my family. Both my daughters loved it ages 11, 6. I would go back in a minute. Those of you who like the pool make sure you wake up early by 7:45a.m. to go put towels on the pool chairs they go really fast. No need to worry in the beach always chairs they have plenty. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews it appears some people just can't be pleased. THIS RESORT IS TRULY PARADISE GO AND HAVE FUN YOU WILL NOT REGRET AND DON'T FORGET TO POST YOUR POSTIVE FEEDBACK THIS RESORT DESERVES IT ESPECIALLY THE STAFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>treated terribly at the barcelo bavaro palace I stayed at the barcelo bavaro palace from 6-07-08 to 06-14-08. I took this trip with my two sisters. I have to say I wanted to leave after the first night.  Never in my life have I been treated so terrrible. I was made to feel like an outsider for being an american. The staff at the hotel were extremely rude if you do not speak spanish. They made comments like  Americans and no familia. I was with my family.The staff ignored you and pretty much pretended you were not there. No help at all. We attended a show at the tropicalismo. were not waited on at all. I had to get up leave the show and go get bottled water from the bar in the lobby. All other latin americans were served no problem. I paid the same amount of money as they did. The beach was the nicest part of the whole trip. The hotel itself smelled of mold. The food was so so. But then again we ordered and we were brought some thing totally different. The buffet was disgusting, birds and bugs everywhere. Right on the buffet tables.I was sick almost my entire trip. I lost 5 lbs. Our room had three people in it, we only had two of everything. towels, coffee mugs, etc, It was as if the staff was put out to bring us one more towel. Our apple vacation rep at the hotelwas not helpful with this issue either. He gladly took our money for excursions but that was about it. If I had known, I would have called apple to request to move to another place. Apple should take this hotel off their website. One other big issue was the maid staff would leave our sliding glass doors unlocked after they cleaned, We had it locked and the pin in the bolt. We were missing items. I almost wanted to not have my room clean so they did not come in.  Tips to future travelers: Do not stay here if you are american. They make you feel terribly unwanted.

<Content>terrible trip for americans Just returned from dominican republic, The beaches were great and a couple of tours were good. I would not stay at the barcelo bavaro palace ever again. The rooms are smelly ( bring candles) and alot of mosquito's in rooms and tiny ants. They say the crime rate is low there but I think it is because they dont get caught . We caught a cleaning person going thru our drawers. we also have missing items. our apple representive booked us this trip, but failed to tell us that no one spoke very good english and it was mostly spanish and latin american resort. We felt discriminated against. everytime we turned around people were making comments like  americanas and other rude remarks. The all inclusive trips say gratuties included but if you dont tip the people ignore you. This trip has made me not want to leave our great country . our buffets -also shared with the birds. The birds just take a seat right at the buffet and peck at eat the cheese and meats. all the bread and rolls always stale. the staff mostly never smiles they all look so tired . I would do alot of reserch before your trip, and ask your rep. how many other americans are going to same hotel. Out of the entire plane we were the only ones going to this hotel . I knew this was a bad sign.  bad taste in mouth.............

<Content>Go somewhere else, this place sucks! We returned from Barcelo Bavaro, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic on 5/20/08. On 6/1/08 I got a call from my credit card company when fraudulant charges started appearing for gas in both Texas and Florida gas stations (we live in PA). I still have possession of the cards, they were either on my person or in the room safe during our trip and I only used them on the Barcelo Bavaro hotel grounds. The hotel required us to scan the card at check in (which is standard) so hard to avoid. BEWARE!!! Take travelers checks and cash only. The small inconvenience getting them is much less than the process I now have to go through to get the charges removed and disruption of all my existing accounts.

<Content>very nice I just finished reading some of the other reviews and it seems as though we did not go to the same place. My friend and I truly enjoyed our experience. We went here in may for a week. We spent the entire time on the beach. We are usually very adventurous on our vacations but this year just wanted to relax. The language barrier was a little bit tough, but to be honest, it makes the experience more real when you can enjoy all of the culture that comes with the country that you go to. All of the staff understands what you are saying if you use simple words. Sometimes you do have to repeat yourself but your the one going to their coutry so what do you expect? The beach was amazingly beautiful. The rooms were very very nice, no complaints. Of course there are some birds flying around the food area but its all open. The weather was wonderful as well. Very close to the airport as well. I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Gross!!!!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 days...and by day 2 we were ready to leave!! The beach itself is AMAZING, one of the nicest beaches we have ever been to. However, the hotel is the most disgusting trashy hotel I have ever stepped foot in. It is worse than an Econo Lodge. The rooms are dirty and gross. The staff acts like they do not understand English. The line to check in/out was chaos. The food was THE WORST I have ever tasted. I honestly lost about 6 pounds that week. The buffets have flies and birds all over the food. It was the dirtiest thing I have ever seen. The only restaurant with OK food was the Mexican and we did not even discover that until the last night. Please, please, please if you are at all classy and enjoy good food/service, do yourself a favor and do not book this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Don't Go We were unwelcomed in this hotel, hospitality is not the greatest, actually there was no hoapitality. Waiters and waitresses were very rude, they did not give us a friendly smile nor ever say enjoy your dinner. Drinks came to us when we finished our dinner. Since there are other barcelo hotels nearby we were able to take the trolley there and experience other restaurants, big mistake the service was still the same and the staff still miserable. Our room had a few cockroaches and so did the restaurants. We don't know how we continued our stay there but we did. We took it upon ourselves to take a walk to Paradisus Palma Real, and the resort is gorgeous, I regret not staying there, that place is definitely a Palace not Barcelo!!! Please, please do not stay in Barcelo it is old and ghetto. Spend a few extra bucks on Paradidsus Palma Real, you'll get your monies worth.DEF. NOT GOING BACK

<Author>TROUBLE6623
<Content>Best Vacation, beautiful beaches! We (My husband and I) booked our vacation thru Apple Vacations for our 20th anniversary and did the all-inclusive. (we are 41/40)The Palace was recommended by a co-worker who stayed there about 2 years ago. The Phila. Eagles Cheerleaders were doing their photo shoot for a calendar down there and shared our flight to and from Punta Cana. (Of course my husband liked that!) We didn't check into our hotel until around 8pm, reception was fairly quick on that and we were given a complimentary fruity drink with a pineapple garnish while waiting. (very tasty) The bellboy took our luggage to our room and inside we found a guide/map of the facilities and surrounding area. We were on bloque 5. (I believe there are 6 bloques, with reception and the buffet area being central on block 3, the La Pina beach grill was at block 5 or 6 along with the local shop area and watersports on the beach) Block 1 had La Brisa (Seafood restaurant, excellent)The room was clean (a little on the older side) and it had a stocked mini bar/refrigerator with bottled water, coke, sprite, brama beer (local stuff) and hazelnut wafer bars. We also noticed a 4 cup coffee maker and coffee packets, complimentary shampoo, conditioner, combs etc.. The counter tops were a little scuffed up but very clean in the bathroom, everything worked great, the shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water, the plumbing worked fine. The bed was on the older side but had a mattress topper and was comfy to sleep on. We found 2 additional pillows in the closet along with a velour blanket. The air conditioner was cold, there were no windows just the balcony door (it didn't have a sliding screen) so sleeping with door open wasn't an option. We found if we turned the air off, the maids turned it back on, so we left if on during the day and shut it off at night. The only negative thing about the room was some dust on the lampshades and on the bedboard (rattan weave holds it) Everything else was spotless.The T.V. only had 2 American channels (CNN both of them, you could pay for more but we didn't spend much time in our room, so didn't see the point)First night we had dinner at La Brisa and had the broiled lobster and seafood salad. It was the only night I had a little acid reflux, most likely from eating dinner at 9 and going to bed right after. All the food was great, we did not have any stomach issues. We also did not see mosquitos, flies or any other bugs. So all the bug spray and immodium came back home with us. We were not scheduled to meet our Apple rep until 6pm so we just went to breakfast around 930 at the buffet. They had so much food! I stuck with light meal of scrambled eggs and a croissant and a slice of cantaloupe, my hubby had eggs, bacon and sausage links and pineapple. We were not sure about the water so we stuck with coca cola at first, but soon learned the bottled water is really bottled water (we read some bad reviews on some places, this wasn't the case here, they have treated water and it was safe to brush your teeth etc and get mixed drinks with ice.. but we still drank the bottled stuff for drinking water) The beach is gorgeous, they rake any washed up seagrass everyday, there are no annoying bugs (like the greenheads on the Jersey beaches here) or no seeums. I heard May was the rainy season but we only had 2 minute quick rain the first day and the rest of the week was sunny, air temp ranged from 82 to about 88 and water temp was around 77 to 80's, the pool I would say was 77-78. The pool was also very clean, the swim up bar was great. The local drink is coco-loco's and they are yummy. We spent most of our days on the beach and here and there at the pool. We did the marinarium excursion (Half day) to snorkel with nurse sharks and stingrays. First time snorkeling and we loved it. Then we went to natural pool area to swim, party and drink more coco-locos. Mr Sharky and his crew were very entertaining and we had a good time. Because they don't do daylight savings, even though we are on same time zone in Maryland, it got dark at 7pm and the sunrise was before 6am. There was a tram train that came around every 15-20 min to go to other Bavaro hotels or the casino. We choose to stay at the Palace, we didn't see any reason to go anywhere else. For the most part even if you don't know spanish (I know a little from high school) they can figure out what you want. I did bring a Eng/Span dictionary just in case. Oh they give you a towel card (one per person) where you get fresh beach towels each day near the pool area. Some people did save chairs in the pool area, but the beach area was no problem finding chairs in the sun or the shade. The water was great, so clear and no shells or stones to hurt your feet. You don't need aqua socks unless your are going near the coral reefs on an excursion. Our favorite restaurant for dinner was La Brisa - broiled lobster and seafood salad, they also have good pizza (thin crust) and calamari. El Bohio was also good, we had a crab special with rice and fried sweet potatoes. La Pina was good for quick bite to eat (they have steaks, various fish, hot dogs, burgers and chicken - too cook to order) with rice, veggies, french fries and salad stuff.The buffet always had so much food (we stayed away from the lunchmeats to be safe) but the salads and everything else was fine. Yes there were one or two birds that flew into buffet area but the staffed shooed them away and removed any item (usually rolls) that the birds touched. The staff was usually on top of things. Once in awhile they were slow getting back drinks, but 90% they were quick. If you go on any excursions, they drive a little like Nascar drivers so don't be shocked. We got were we needed to go without incident. Even though it was an all-inclusive, we did tip the maids and the mini-bar guy every day (they are 2 different people) and bar tenders.If you want clean towels all you have to do it place them on edge of the tub. We used our coffee maker (TRY the coffee- it is great!) we used the bottle water of course. The best place for coffee is the bar right next to reception area. Fresh ground. Oh definately bring SPF 30 to 50 if you normally wear SPF15. And reapply everytime you get out of the water. I did get my nose fried the first day and did get burnt on shoulders- that turned tan, my nose peeled down there at end of week. Our shower also had shower gel, shampoo and conditioner dispenser along with the complimentary bottles. So don't worry if you forgot them. Yes they did have topless women sunbathers, and men in speedos, but only in beach area (not the pool, well except the speedo guys) which wasn't a big deal. There were not many kids around in May and it seemed the natural thing in that setting. This was our first trip out of the country and we had a great experience. Would go again in a minute! The hotel was well worth it.Our Apple rep (Raluka) booked our excursion and was very helpful on all our questions.

<Content>Relaxing Vacation We returned from the Palace on April 11th 2008. When checking in the front desk could use some help. The service is very slow. When checking in they were aware that we needed a pool side room since my husband can only walk a short distance. They put us in building 4 which was to far from the pool We needed to go back to the front desk go get another room. They moved us to building 3 which was much better. Come to find out that was the room we were suppose to have in the first place. If you have a disability the service is not the best. We tried to get a wheelchair and that never happened.The rooms are old. It was clean and comfortable. The maid service is was very good. We did tip everyday and that does make a differance. One day we left a note on what we wanted., When we returned from the pool the maid came to our door. She did not understand our note and she wanted to make sure we got what we needed.The pool was very nice and we enjoyed the swim up bar. Again we did tip the bartender and it does help. If you want a chair at the pool you need to get out very early to save one. (7:00 am) The beach was beautifu. We travel every year and we usually say the food is just ok. We felt the food was very good. The buffet had a large selection everyday. We always sat in the same area and we had the same waiter. His name was David and he was great. The Steak House also was very good. The evening shows were terrible. It was a waste of time to go. We enjoyed the train ride at night to the other Bavaro resorts. We would go to Punta Cana again but try another resort. This resort is average to above average. We did not have a hard time and we only spoke English.

<Content>The real load down at the palace Just got back from a one week stay at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. The trip was done through USAir so everything was included in our price. Check-in was fabulous and smooth. We were put into building 5 on the third floor. The room was being cleaned when we arrived so we were quickly able to develop a relationship with our maid. We were with another couple( good friends of ours), and their room was down the hall from us. We first noticed how big our room was. Once we got our AC running at the temperature we wanted, everything was fine. OK first off, this hotel is quite a few years old and in some cases it shows it and in some others it doesn't. The rooms, and the gounds of this resort are cleaned every single day. We tipped our maid well, which for us meant plenty of towels and sundries. Our mini bar was always well stocked with water, soda and beer. Our king size bed was comfortable. From an accomdation point of view, the Palace served us well. Other reviews talked of mildewy smell,or uncomfortable beds, lack of hot water, low pressure in the water,etc. not an issue here. I figured that most bad reviews started from any bad experiences at the check-in or some weak stomaches. Allright lets get to the beach and the pool. From an aesthitics point of view, your not going to find much prettier beaches. The ugly side of the beach was the swim wear being worn by some people or the lack of swim wear by some others. Hey this is a place where people bring children with them, but again our friends from across the pond continue with using their idiotic judgement when it comes to their beachwear. I am a 52 year old man who is in reasonable shape and I am certainly nobody's prude. Come on now, men for heaven sake stop with the speedos, for the vast majority you look like buffooons at best and morons at your worst. Get a decent pair of swimming trunks and stop looking like jackasses. I donot even want to start with the topless women at these beaches. Just throw them in with the guys in speedos and you get my drift. Thank the good lord that at least the woman topless scene does not occur at the pool, can't say the same for the speedos. Food- my friends, my wife and I will never say no to a meal. We eat like nobody's business and we eat well. We are entering an area of expertise for us. So what did we think of the food? It was ok. Hey We are at an all inclusive so it is what it is. Favorite places- La Pina grill, Mexico Lindo, Caribe buffet, Steak House and La Brisa(seafood). Disappointments- Los Pinos Italian restaurant and Bohio. La Pina was outdoor grill by a flea market that served some good steaks, shrimps, and lobster tails. Mexico Linda had a great appetizer bar, the other ones speak for themselves. Los Pinos giving me a piece of chicken leg for the chicken cacciatore was an insult. The spaghetti in meat sauce though was very good. Oh yeah, this place needs to find out what hamburgrer and hot dog buns look like. And yes, make all the restaurants smoke free please, or send the smokers to Haiti if they insist on smoking.Beverages- plentiful and good. Presidente beer was very good, where's the Presidente LIght? Casino -ok, golf course- muni at best. Chickens at the tee box on the 6th hole was fantastic, watch out though for the wasps.Would I go there again? Yes but I like to try other resorts first in Punta Cana.

<Content>7 nights turned into 3 ( we wanted to go home) First off let me start by saying that PUNTA CANA is a beautiful place after get off the streets and into your Resort.I am sorry to say but that is the only thing good about my trip to Punta Cana. My Girlfriend and I paid for a beachfront room, with a clear view of the ocean...When we get there we are sent to a room towards the back of the hotel next to a little garden area, with not even a glimpse of the beach or ocean. It felt like we were staying in a Quality inn...THE FOOD: Our first day we got there around 2pm and were hungry. The Buffet had just opened up and we decided to go have lunch..This is the first day so we are excited and ready to have a great time..The moment we stepped into the Buffet area I knew this trip was doomed..I go str8 for the fruit line and as I am about to grab a slice of watermelon a bird comes crawling out with a mouthful of melon. The birds are there constantly the whole time the buffet is open..None of the staff even attempted to get the birds away...All of the cheese is thick Goat Cheese, that smelled like the ZOO. The Hamburgers were horrible.( I don't even think it was real beef) The staff at the little restaurant, to the left of the pool were horrible..My girlfriend ordered a burger and when it was delivered it was delivered str8 to her lap. The waitress actually dropped the plate on the table so hard that the burger flew up and landed in her lap..THE BEACH: Beautiful, but way too many people for a relaxing trip...Staff: Horrible, we went walking down the beach on our 2nd day and visited the little shops on the beach, and after looking at all of them we turned back and headed back to our chairs. As we made our way back a gentleman ran up to us asking come to our shop come to our shop,, I replied that we had already been there, and that we would return later...Then he replied in his exact words IT's because were Black and your White..That sent my girlfriend into tears...She has never been so humiliated in her life..This man not knowing that she is the Aunt of 3 mixed kids....All in all the service was terrible. If you only speak English, I would'nt advise going to the Bar or Restuarant and try ordering. The staff did'nt understand a word I was saying when I ordered..They would still give you a drink(but it would be the wrong thing..A Jim Beam and Coke is'nt Blue in color.......ALthough the trip and resort was horrible, our guide with Vacation express was outstanding..After we had enough of the birds, the smells, the rude staff, and other things, Jose' from Vacation Express helped us get a flight home 5 days earlier than our scheduled departure time...Oh I almost forgot..Do not touch, take pictures or get close to the monkeys that the guys walk up and down the beach with...My GF recieved a nasy rash/scab type thing on her neck a day after she took a picture with the monkey on her shoulder...

<Content>Wonderful vacarion I travelled to Punta Cana with my husband. We are both in our early 30's and had a wonderful vacation. After reading the reviews we was really nervous. we decided that we wont go with an open mind and make up our own minds. As soon as we arrived at the resort we knew we were in paradise. we were actually booked at the Beach resort but when we got there they didnt have any rooms available so we were upgraded to the palce at no extra cost. when we got to the check-in desk, i realized i had not printed out the voucher from my travel agent for the hotel. the first receptionist di not know what to do and pretty much ignored us but then i went to the guest relations desk and they were able to get my e-mail open and e-mailed it to the front desk. the second receptionist we dealt with was wonderful. She told us we could just use our credit card and worry about it later but we got everything sorted out and we got our room no problem. we gave them a BIG tip and they were grateful. Room: honestly, it had a bit of a smell when we first walked in but once we got in and got some air in the room it was wonderful. the air conditioning worked great. the air blew right onto the bed!!!! our room overlooked beautiful gardens and walkways. our mini bar was stocked everyday with beer, pop and water. the first night our water pressure wasnt good, there was a lot of air in the pipes but it got better after that.Pool: absolutely beautiful. the bartenders at the swim up bar were amazing. the only downside was that if you wanted a chair by the pool you had to go at 7am but the beach is literally seconds from the pool so you can get a chair there.Beach: Gorgeous white sand as far as you can see. there were areas with a lot of seaweed but if you move done the beach a bit it is wonderful. there is lots of chairs for everyone. There are topless women on the beachEntertainment: the shows were alright. it was pretty much the same thing every night though, singing and dancing. It was a little upscale for our liking but it was good. We found the entertainment at the Beach resort was the best as it had audience involvement and the host was very entertaining. We dont speak any spanish but we still had a great time.Food: staying at the palace you have a lot more food options. the buffet was alright. lots of choices. we had luch at La Pina, down the beach near the flea market. yu have lunch literally on the sand. The steak house was our favorite. there is a line to get in but it move pretty quickly. The italian restaurant was good too. I have a sensitive stomach so i did have some stomach issues but i brought Immidium and i was fine. i didnt let it put a damper on my vacationService: WONDERFUL!!!!! WE tipped out waiters/waitresses a few bucks on the first day and we got great service the entire time we were there. We would also tip them throughout the day. they work very hard for little money but they are always smiling.Overall, we had a wonderful vacation and miss it already.

<Content>Couldn't ask for more This resort fit our needs to a T. Golf, great food, lots to do at both the pool and beach and a casino for 'extra' entertainment!Having stayed at Melia Caribe last year - I would go back to Barcelo Bavaro Palace in a heart beat - maybe next year! Much more to do and the food was much better than Royal Service @ Melia CaribeThe resort was very well maintained. The food was great. Obviously staying in the Palace - we were able to eat at all the other restaurants that were included.Our rooms were comfortable and nice, service was great everywhere! We did have some young spring breakers who made for good entertainment when their manners were in place.Nothing bad to say about this place.....great value in every category - especially at the golf course where water and beer are included!

<Content>GREAT Place to Stay We stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana the second week of March, 2008 and absolutely loved it there. We had full access to 4 other resorts: the BBBeach, BBCaribe, BBGolf  Spa,  the BBCasino. The other resorts could not use our facilities, as the Palace is the top of that chain; which was nice because our resort was never over-crowded. BEACH: 5* there are miles of sugar soft white sand and plenty of beach chairs, and palm trees for shade. ROOMS 4*: spacious, 2 sinks, coffeemaker, v. comfortable bed; however, the workmanship is not what we鈥檙e used to in Canada, especially since my family is in the construction business; but you鈥檙e in the Carribean, and it鈥檚 hot and beautiful. Tipping $1/day each or gifts from the $ Store for the maid and the guy who stocked the fridge allowed us extra towels and lots of beverages. FOOD 4.5*: lots of food at the Buffet, you can get freshly made breakfast, or fresh grilled meats and fish; even a soft ice cream machine. The outdoor restaurant next to the Flea Market had all you can eat fresh shrimp and calamari and even pizza until 5 pm. Steakhouse was yummy, and so was the Seafood restaurant. I usually get sick at these places鈥?but I sure didn鈥檛 at this resort. POOL looked nice, v. clean, but never used it. SERVICE 4.5*: well-spoken English staff and helpful. GROUNDS 5*: very clean, and well laid out. All the rooms are very close to the beach. ENTERTAINMENT 3.5*: costumes  dancers were great, but it was pretty much the same thing every night; you need to go to other resorts for a change; as well everything was in Spanish or French. We also found there weren鈥檛 that many English speaking people there; lots of people from Europe and S. America. CAUTION: don鈥檛 forget your essentials as they charge a mint at the shops in your hotel for things like Immodium (which I didn鈥檛 need anyways.) $3.00 for 1 pill and you need a few if you get diaherrea.

<Content>Won't Go Back This resort (Barcelo Hotel Group) is large (5 Hotels) and has many amenities, but this does not make up for the drawbacks. Let me first say that I vacationed at the Palladium in 2007 and loved it so much wanted to go back to Punta Cana. The group I went with wanted to try a different resort for a different experience. One of the largest drawbacks were the rooms. The rooms were run down and in need of some major repairs. The mattresses were worn out and had a mattress pillow covering them to compensate (which didn't help). The rooms were smelly and got worse when the air conditioner was running. We choose to turn it off and open the doors. The mini frig was barely working and was always filled with water from condensation. The bathroom toilet ran constantly and we had to keep giggling the handle to get the tank to refill. On our 3rd day, the hot water tank died and we had to forego showers until later that night when they finally fixed it. The in room coffee maker did not work and I asked the front desk for a replacement with no response. I finally had to chase down the maid and request a replacement. Our friends did the same with their in room iron - I finally gave them ours. Next was the food. The buffet was about 1/3 of the size of the Pallaidum's and was the same everyday. The menu seemed to be island cuisine. Two out of group were sick (stomach problems) by the second day. Since their buffet is an open air style room - we were visited each meal by the local birds flying above and landing on the buffet tables and eating what they wanted. The staff seemed okay with this and didn't bother to get rid of them. At one meal - a bird landed on a lady's plate that she had set downt on the table so she could go get her juice. This totaly turned us off the food buffet. We tried a couple of the other resturants (Italian/Mexican/Seafood) and the food was tolerable. I didn't find the entertainment staff to be as active or inviting as the Pallaidum either. The scheduled events never seemed to be happening as the schedule stated. We also questioned the large amounts of security roaming the buidlings at night. Our building had 2 to 4 guards roaming all night long, constantly talking and keeping you awake (if you leave the sliders open for air). The redeeming qualities were the beach and casino. We will go back to Punta Cana, but not this resort chain.

<Content>Good Value/Nice Resort My husband, myself and our 2 kids stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace from Mar 6 - Mar 20 2008. Our kids (ages 22 and 27 were with us the first week). I was wondering what we'd find after reading mixed reviews. We were happy with the accomodations and the resort as a whole. We are not picky people, but want value for what we pay. We have been to Mexico 5 times and stayed in resorts rated 4 to 5.5*. Here is an honest, straight up review.Booking  Flight: We booked through Air Canada Vacations, direct flight from Edmonton to Punta Cana. The flight was 7+ hours with 2 movies, snacks, drinks (non-alcohol otherwise you had to pay), and a sandwich (either Harvey's or Quiznos). They provided head sets at no cost, which you could keep if you wanted to. Stewardesses were friendly and helpful. Pleasant flight, which we found long.Airport: Punta Cana airport is an open air terminal with thatched roofs. You de-plane on the tarmac, and when you first arrive in the terminal, your picture is taken (which you can buy for $8 US when you leave Punta Cana airport going home). The customs and baggage claim was fairly fast and easy, then you are bussed to your resort. You do not have to pay the $20 US arrival/departure tax if booking in 2008. Ours was included in our package. If you are not sure, ask your booking agent. The Palace was only 20 minutes from the airport, so a short ride.Check in: Check in at the resort was fast and efficient. There were only about 8 couples arriving at the resort the same time with us, so not much of a line up. There were no welcome drinks, as I had read, but not a big deal. Make sure to verify if you have 2 double beds or 1 king size bed before you leave the front desk. We didn't and when we arrived at our room, we had 2 double beds, so had to get the room switched, which they did right away. We were told there are no non-smoking rooms available (which we requested). Rooms: My kids room smelled musty but ours did not. Their room was on the ground floor, we were on the 3rd (top) floor of Block 5. I gave them a glade plug in for their room, which helped with the smell. The rooms are older with some patched/fixed areas, but were clean and big. We had a fan, and the air conditioning was awesome. There was a huge closet, iron board and iron, safe, minibar, clock/radio, coffee maker, dresser, hutch to put your suitcase on, table with 2 chairs in the room, and a small table and 2 chairs on a small terrace/balcony. The closet and fridge cabinet were crudely finshed with unfinished wood/plywood. The bathroom had an area with 2 sinks and lots of counter space, a scale, stool and a hair dryer. Do not drink the tap water, but it is ok for adults to use to brush your teeth. The toilet and bath tub/shower were in a separate area with a door. Over all the room was outdated, but fine. We don't spend much time in our room, but when we did, it was comfortable. Everything worked and had no problems. TV only had 2 English channels CNN and one other one. We paid $20/week to have movie channels, TBS, etc. You could order room service, but was a cost. The beds were older, but did have a topper which made them more comfortable than beds at other resorts.Maid Service: Our maid was consistent and did a fair job. The room was cleaned daily, but not exceptionally cleaned. The service was the same when we tipped or not. There was no towel art (no big deal to us) as I had read on other reviews. I'm thinking that the towel art and the bathrobe a slippers that others talked about might have been if you booked the upgrade Club Premium which we did not. The minibar was stocked daily by someone other than the maid. We always had sufficient bottled water, pop, and beer. A couple times we ran out of faceclothes, but when we asked for them, the maid found some for us.Beach/Pool: The beach was awesome - white powder sand -which went for miles. Water was clear - aqua/green color. Beautiful! There were lots of chairs, lots of shade. If you walked right side down the beach, you passed the Eden resort and some others we couldn't see from the beach. If you walked left side down the beach, you passed the beach market (where you barter for a deal) and rentals/excursions that are not part of the hotel. Farther was the Jelly Fish Restaurant and more resorts such as Melia Caribe, Paradisus. We took our snorkelling gear and did see some fish out from the beach, but nothing compared to Mayan Mexico. You would need to book an excursion in order to see more I'm sure.The pool had a swim up bar with pretty good service, bartenders are friendly. The pool had various areas, all connected. An ok size. Water was cooler than the temperature in the ocean. If you wanted chairs at the pool, you had to put your towel out early, as they were all taken by the time we were done breakfast (especially if you wanted some shade under an umbrella). It gets very hot by the pool as there is not as much of a breeze as there is by the ocean/beach.Grounds: Grounds are well kept. There is some garbage and dead leaves/branches laying around, but with a resort this size it cannot be helped. Beautiful trees of all kinds, flowers, vegetation, walking paths, ponds, bridges. There is a train that you can ride to get to other hotels in the resort if you don't want to walk. In the evening the train's music was extremely loud and uncomfortable. I'm sure if we would have brought it to the drivers attention he would have adjusted it.There are lots of security guards posted throughout the resort which was great. They were friendly and always had an Hola for you if you acknowledged them. Staff: We found mostly all workers/waiters/maids to be happy and lots of times singing as they worked. I didn't see many people tipping. It was our choice to do so, as I know I'd like it if I were working there. I tipped the train driver, and he was so very greateful. What about the people who mop the floors, clean the wash rooms, collect garbage, trim the trees? I'm sure they'd appreciate some recognition as well. Very hard to communicate with most of the staff as they only speak Spanish. Food: We were looking for familiar food, but soon realized there was lots to choose from if we just looked. The buffet had some variety (but also had lots of the same things every day). We tried the buffet at the other hotels (Beach and Caribe) which had new/different items on the menu. There were fruit smoothies, omletes, pasta, meat/seafood stations that prepared your food on the spot. Wine was ok, found the Roso (blush) wine in the buffet to be the best. There were some flies in the buffet, mostly at noon. The La Pina Grill on the beach was good with hamburgers, fish, hot dogs, pizza, and seafood that was cooked upon your request. Keep in mind that you are not at home, and that different tasting food is to be expected. Have an open mind. My kids had sensitive stomachs after some meals, but found the food to be good. The a la carte restaurants we tried were great - Italian, Steakhouse and Seafood. Make sure to ask for meat /seafood well done, and we found all was good. There were 2 good take out pizza places on the resort. They put the pizza in a box and you could take it wherever you wanted to eat it on the resort. In the evenings, we found baskets of popcorn in the lobby lounge, which you could have with your drinks there or you could take the basket back to your room (as long as you returned the basket).Activities/Entertainment: We did not participate in the activities, but there seemed to be lots going on all the time. They have a schedule board up in the lobby with lots of things you could participate in. There were games at the pool, music, dancing, beach vollyball, etc. We played mini-golf which was fun. Some of the water sports equipment was worn and in need of repair. Massages on the beach were $25/half hour, which were relaxing. We only went to 1 night show, which was ok, but we found we were so tired after supper that we wanted to turn in early. We wanted to be up early as we didn't want to waste sunshine. We had family pictures taken by a photographer on the beach, which cost $8 for a 4x6.Excursions: Deep Sea Fishing booked at the resort - my husband and son went out for the morning, but found it to be terribly rough that all they did was hang on to the boat so they wouldn't be tossed out. It cost $109 each for 4 hours, which they regret booking - waste of money. There were 6 tourists on the boat, no fish caught. The boat was in poor shape and had fuel line troubles causing bad gas fumes.Golfing - was ok, but not great. Now we can say we golfed in Punta Cana. It cost $60 for the cart and $30 ea for club rental. Green frees were free.Outback Safari - Would recommentd this full day tour of the Dominican country, coconut/cocoa plantations, home life, cigar making, rum/mamjuana, BBQ lunch, boogie boarding at a public beach. Cost was $89 per person. Louis, our tour guide, was incredibly knowledgeable with the history of the island and kept us entertained with facts and humor.Weather/Bugs: Temperature was awesome, I found warmer than Mexico at night especially. Only saw 4 mosquitos, did get bit a couple times. No bugs, saw some dragon flies. Was windy most of the time, even at night, except a couple days/nights that were pretty calm. Most times we were thankful for the breeze. We did not have trouble with any sand flies as stated by other reviews.Check Out: We asked the cost of an extended check out - extra $35 to have the room until 6:00. We could check out at 1:00, instead of 12:00, which we did. Our bags were kept out front in the lobby tied together with rope to a post. There was always an attendant present. We carried our important papers, etc in our carry on bag with us after 1:00. The bus was prompt to pick us up at the resort to take us to the airport. Checking our bags was fast, no issues.Overall I would say this resort would be rated a 4*. Big thing is not to get hung up on the small things. Enjoy the moment, the sun, the time off. It is what you make of it. We enjoyed our stay at the Palace and didn't want to leave. Others we talked to agreed with our evaluation.This is a lengthy review, but I thought it was important to share details and our experiences. Trip Advisor was an extremely helpful tool in making our resort decision and I appreciated all details in other reviews. If you have questions, email me and I'm happy to help if I can.FYI Note: We did talk with a guy on the plane going home who had gotten sick the 3rd day he was there, and ended up in the hospital for 2 days. He had extreme stomach cramps and diarreah. Apparently when he called his insurance, they were not surprised he washaving trouble in Punta Cana. There were 8(?) other tourists in the hospital the same time, with the same symptoms. We were lucky none of us were sick, and have never had bad stomach trouble any time we travel. It must be an individual/situational, hit or miss thing.

<Content>Im glad I got a free upgrade and didn't have to pay more I have to agree with a review from CaptnRamius that I read. I have also been traveling since I was very young and my husband and I are native Spanish speakers. We ended up staying at the Bavaro Palace as a free upgrade from our travel company.Im glad I didn't have to pay a difference b/c I would've been REALLY ticked off.First of all, the morning after we got there I got very ill. I believe it was the pasta I ate the night before. The pasta was made with crab which still had pieces of the shell in it!!! Not only did I get terribly ill but I also got very badly treated from the doctors there. Now, I want to explain that I have an extremely tough stomach. I have eaten in cafeterias in the street corners of Mexico City and never gotten sick. So, you can imagine how bad this must have been. After that first day, almost every time I ate I kept getting sick, though not as badly as on the first day. My husband got sick the second and third day. The only food that was worth eating at this place was anything that was prepared on a grill in front of you. So, we survived eating at the grill called La Pina.SERVICE: Except for a few very nice servers, for the most part, everyone seemed very annoyed to have to be serviceable. They had nasty looks, never refilled your drinks, would stand around, etc. I know for a FACT, that they some of them were quite bothered by the non-spanish speakers. I saw one American lady trying patiently and with a smile to ask for napkins, the server just looked at her and would nod her head no and made NO effort in understanding. Then she walked over to another server and I heard her ask in Spanish so, what does SHE want? . So, its not paranoia from the Americans, they really ARE mean.Public relations desk was also a disaster. One lday there was really nice but another guy was completely useless. I showed him the map the first day and I asked him where we were exactly and he said you're in the Bavaro Palace NO KIDDING!!!KIDS STUFF: I have to say this was the best part. Even though my daughter in only 20 months old she enjoyed the clown show they had every night at 800pm plus she sat down a few times with the bigger kids and the kids club counserlor to paint. The counselors were ALL very sweet and kid friendly. Engaged kids of all ages.BEACH: We found one remote corner away from the pool which was great and where we spent our days.

<Content>Barcelo Bavaro Palace - great beach! Overall we had an excellent experience at this hotel and would return here based on the quality and value for the price we paid.Resort. The Palace is the best of the 5 hotels at the Bavaro Beach resort and one of the 3 that are located directly on the beach. Guests at the Palace have dining privileges at all the other hotels, guests at the other hotels do not have privileges at the Palace. The resort is only 20 minutes from the airport which makes for smooth arrivals and departures and less time on the bus. Security is very obvious throughout the resort. The shuttle between hotels is very convenient. We were there during US college Spring Break and the Beach hotel seemed to be virtually full of late teen/early 20 aged guests and in the evening the noise and energy in the lobby and bar areas was quite high. The Palace was quiter and seemed to be occupied by an older clientelle and families.Room. Very good size, king size bed, small balcony. Bathroom is getting a bit dated.Beach. Excellent, clean, well maintained, shallow, gradually sloped and you really can't beat the location - literally a few steps outside the entrance to our building.Golf. Adequate. Good layout but conditioning is a bit tired. But since green fees are free plus a $30 cart fee if you stay at the Palace (green fee of $60 for non-guests and $30 for guests of othe Barcelo propertieslus the $30 cart fee) it is OK.Food. Very good for an all inclusive resort. At the Palace buffet you can select specific pieces of meat (steak, pork, chicken, fish, burgers, etc) and have them grilled to your liking while you watch - a benefit if you are concerned about the quality of the food. This same feature is also available at the beach bar/restaurant throughout the day which is a big surprise. A la carte restaurants are available for a $30 premium for dinner.Staff. Check in was smooth, bellman was efficient. Maid service was acceptable but not fantatsic. Staff at food and beverage locations were fairly attentive and friendly. Language is a bit of a problem as most staff other than reception desk and guest services speak almost no English. While I recognize that the DR is a Spanish speaking country and the Barcelo is a Spanish chain, 80% of tourist revenue in the DR comes from the US and a substantial additional amount comes from Canada so I would expect a few more folks capable of speaking English at the resort much as staff do in resorts in Mexico and Cuba.Entertainment. The Palace had a stage show every night. more than half of these shows were excellent with professional singers, musicians and dancers. The remainder invovled audienece participation and were not as good. There was also a more glitcy show at the Casino every night which was quite good but only an hour long and the drinks were not included.

<Content>Ola - Barcelo Bavaro Palace!! March 2008 - Our family just returned from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. We really enjoyed our March Break vacation. This trip was the first time I booked through Travelocity . We found the hotel and grounds very clean and well maintained. Our room was spacious (for 4 people) complete with a large bathroom area and separate bath/toilet area. Very good hot water for showers. Note: do not drink tap water and they provide bottled water in the rooms. Good ceiling fan and air conditioning in the room. Our room faced a lovely garden area. Bar fridge in room stocked with beer, Coke products and bottled water. (Tiles in bathroom shower area needed some attention.) Dining: There are numerous restaurants to choose from at the Palace. La Pina was great for lunch. Fresh fish, beef and chicken are grilled before you. The produce was fresh and crisp. There were cute 'grass huts' to sit under, nice tables and no floors....just sand!! The view was perfect - palm trees, white sand and gorgeous blue/aqua water. The Dominican restaurant was very good - it showcased Dominican food except the portions was at lunch were huge. The large buffet restaurant served breakfast, lunch and dinner - lots of variety - they had made to order omelets, pasta. If you stay at the Palace, you can dine at the other Barcelo hotels. Our family enjoyed the Italian Restaurant at the Beach Hotel. The Mexican was okay. We did not try the French or Spanish Restaurants - there was a charge to eat there. Drinks: Great!! The bar by the pool was very fun. Activities: The entertainment staff by day were great - to include kids and adults. They had smiles on their faces and danced spontaneously. They had different contests for the appropriate age levels. There was: tennis, volley ball, bocce ball, sandcastle making for kids, dance lessons, etc. We enjoyed the use of the Laser and Hobie sailboats, windsurfers and kayaks. We enjoyed the pool and/or the ocean complete with palm trees for shade. The beach is very clean and great for walking.... you can walk/run for miles. We rented Segways by the Casino. These are motorized stand-up scooters. The hour ride was plenty. The US dollar is the currency of choice. Note: I cashed a traveler's cheque at the front desk was given pesos, not US dollars. The safe in the room was a plus and easy to use. Be prepared to try to speak Spanish! English is hit and miss. There were little shops down the beach - hair braiding, henna tattoos, jewelry, t-shirts, etc. Be prepared to haggle...they all want you to visit their 'shop'. We went on a snorkeling excursion and the fish were fabulous. Note: Bring bread in a plastic water bottle to attract the fish. The Barvaro Beach was invaded by spring break young people...I recommend the Palace for families and couples.

<Content>Best Week of my Life This hotel and its staff made my first international vacation the greatest week of my life. The hotel was pristine; our room was clean, all appliances functioned properly, and our mini-fridge was restocked every day. The bathroom was clean, and the shower pressure was great!The food was very good, especially for an all-inclusive. We utilized the buffet the most, but thoroughly enjoyed the Italian restaurant and the seafood restaurant. Access to the other hotels in the complex was always readily available - a tram would come every 5 to 10 minutes to take visitors around the complex. We were a group of three 21 year old students, and found that most other people our age stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach. However, the vacationers at the Palace, while somewhat older than us, were fantastic and always having a great time. The staff was beyond friendly and was always in touch with the guests, especially the bartenders in the pool. By the second day they knew my favorite drinks, and as soon as they saw us coming towards the pool they had one ready. The front desk was very attentive and any questions or problems we had were dealt with immediately and always with a friendly smile. Even with the language barrier, the staff managed to make me feel as though I were home. I even brushed up on my Spanish. The beach area was gorgeous, the water perfect, and loungers were always available. Staff organized activities on the beach, in the ocean, or in the pool but were never too pushy. There were also photographers on the beach - I took two photos with parrots, and my family was blown away!By far one of the best vacations of my life, I'd go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Amazing time will go back next year!!!!!!! I just returned home from a week stay at the Barcelo Palace and loved every second of it and wanted to extend my stay!!! I was hesitant in booking this hotel after all the mixed reviews but i am glad that I did. People have to keep in mind that they are going on vacation in a very poor country so not everything is going to be the best of the best. I could find nitpicky things that I did not like about the hotel but nothing out of the ordinary that you could not find anywhere else.One thing that I will do different next time is take a direct flight there because it is so so so so worth it. So here goes my review:Hotel: The grounds were kept very clean and manicured. I always saw workers mopping the floors and trimming the palm trees. The premises were never dirty with any trash, leaves and if there was a mess the workers were right on top of things. There is a lot of security guards standing around each block of rooms which made me feel secure since it got very dark at night. My boyfriend and I took the Barcelo Express (shuttle trolley) to the other hotels on the property and the Palace had the best of everything (food/pool/atmosphere).Rooms: By no means are they five stars but I would say a three(?). The room is decorated in peach colors and brown wicker. King bed, balcony w/ place to sit, small table and chairs in room, TV and desk. The bed for me was uncomfortable but my boyfriend had no problem with it. I like my matress soft and he likes it more firm but not a big issue for me. The TV only had two english channels, CNN and a movie channel that played the same two movies over and over again. You could pay for more english channels but the only time we were in the room was to sleep and take naps. The bathroom was small but not a vacation killer.Food: Again your in a different country the food is going to be different from what you are used to. If something didn't look good to me or tasted funny I didn't eat it. Use your head and everything will be fine. I always found things that I could eat mostly grilled chicken, boiled vegetables and rice. The OJ was the best fresh, squeezed!!!!!Beach/Weather: The beach was beautiful, very much topless, but beautiful. I'm more of a pool person and spend most of my time there. The weather was 80-82 everyday and at night 74-76 with a cool breeze People: Not a lot of people speak english so it is best to learn some common phrases. I never had a problem with the staff at the hotel everyone was nice but there was one bartender that was annoyed that I was asking what each fruity drink was. Guess what......no tip for her......not a big deal. I do have to say at the casino the bartenders Maximo and Dolca make the best drinks and are extremely nice people I enjoyed talking with them.I really enjoyed my stay at the Palace and I hope this helps anyone else that is nervous about booking this place for their vacation.

<Content>very disappointing from louise, toronto, ontario canadafeb 14 to 21/08i chose this hotel after reading a review in the C.A.A. (AAA) travelmagazine. the writer raved about the luxurious resort, etc.as soon as we arrived in the front lobby, i suspected that this resort was not premium,  this was confirmed when we entered our room. as soon as we opened the door the musty smell was overwhelming - i wished i brought a candle/air freshner! also the room looked depressing as it was painted a dull taupy brown colour - at least we were in the 6 block so it was nice  quiet. the bathroom was pathetic - the toilet was so close to the tub  door that if you are a big person you would feel clausterphobic - the bathroom area really needs to be renovated  updated to be at a premium level. food was ok - was disappointed that there were only 3 a la carte  1 buffet at our resort (we could go the the ajoining properties but who wants to travel to get basically the same food?). the $60 charge at the french restaurant was a rip off don't bother going. the dominican a la carte was disgusting. buffet was ok (be careful they totally undercook hamburgers  sometimes the thicker cuts of fish)staff was not as friendly as we've encountered in other hotels around the carribean - some never even smiled once! be prepared to wait at front desk for anything even extra keys, money exchange  especially for the hospitality room key. we booked through signature vacations - our flight home was delayed  the signature people forgot to have their bus pick us up to take us to the airport- the rep. was not on duty but when we called her emergency cell# we got a recording.the hotel front desk wanted to charge us to have him call her. we had to take cabs to the airport  upon arrival found out our flight was further delayed.we took off at 2am, with a stopver in nassau to get fuel so arrived in toronto at 7am. i rate this trip a 3 out of 10  will not go back to d.r.  will never stay at a barcelo property.louise, toronto, ontariops i am also now suffering from traveller's sickness for over 1 week maybe a parasite(?)

<Content>Disappointment at the Palace Just back from a week at the Palace. I was, to say the least, disappointed with the resort. I'll start with the rooms. Ours was a partial ocean view. Building number 2, right next door to a construction zone that began digging, banging, and hammering at 6 A.M. The beds were old and very lumpy, the white terry bathrobes were at best dingy grey. Maid service, and we tipped, was below average. Throughout the week we had, on one occasion each, a dirty coffee pot, no face clothes, one bath towel, mini bar not replenished, and barely enough water to make a pot of coffee.The staff spoke very little to no english. The only conversation I had with any staff member was in French as he had come from Haiti.The beach was OK. I had to put on alot of bug spary after being bitten by sand fleas.There are so many palm trees, we had to move our lounge chairs 5 times a day to be in the sun. The pool was really nice. The food was tolerable. The best food was at the French restaurant. (Which is not included and averages $30.00 per person, without wine) We ate more often at the Barcelo Caribe and Barcelo Beach than at the Palace. The bartenders were great. They were always smiling and in a good mood. They were very happy to refill insulated mugs. A word of advice on bringing money.......bring lots. The ATM, located only at the Plaza, will only give you Dominican Dollars and the resorts will not change it to US $.There is a good size flea market just down the beach. They have a lot of vendors, who all want your business. Be prepared to bargain and don't pay more than one half of their asking price. Check out......if front desk tells you they will provide you with a courtesy room, don't believe it! Fortunately we left the resort at 1 P.M. so we could shower in our own room. However we had friends who left at 6P.M and 8 of them had no courtesy room. The 2 that did get the room, had no towels and had another couple barge in on them while they were still in the room.All in all it was an OK trip. I had to learn not to sweat the little things. But I will definately not be returning to the Palace.

<Content>My first review: why am I doing it? This is the first time ever I sit down to write a review. Why? The reason is simple: if I can help even one person stay away from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace, then my objective will have been met. I was lucky enough to be there on my company's dime, and I had read the reviews before going, so my expectations were rightfully adjusted. Even so, they did not prepare me for what I found. I am 37 and have been traveling internationally since I was 9, which means that I am enough of a seasoned traveler to know that this hotel offers bad food, poor housekeeping, and, for the most part, unsanitary conditions everywhere. You can doubt me as much as you want, and waste your money if you want (it鈥檚 yours, isn鈥檛 it?) but this was the first time I ever saw a hotel telephone label carry the usual instructions about room-to-room dialing, how to call international numbers collect, etc. followed by a 鈥淢edical Center鈥?number (dial 1000). There is obviously a reason why this is such a popular number at the Bavaro complex. I was lucky enough not to need the fine services of the in-house doctors, but several of my company convention colleagues were not as fortunate. BTW: their experience with the doctor was not only costly (USD 90, cash only, for the consultation, with medicines charged separately) but also highly ineffective. Therefore, take my advice and be prepared. Other caveats: the entire hotel had no water one morning, and the staff didn鈥檛 really care (their reaction was 鈥渘o llego鈥???鈥? or, 鈥渘ot there yet???鈥? No it wasn鈥檛, for nine hours. When there is water, it is known to transmit diseases, especially stomach illnesses such vomiting and diarrhea. There were ants in my room, and cockroaches in a colleague鈥檚. Bloque #6 is a sick building: I visited five rooms and they all smelled of mold like I鈥檝e never witnessed before. Just think of what you want to bring back in your clothes and luggage from your vacation鈥?In summary: I鈥檓 not being picky. I just want my readers to know that if you are spending hard-earned money in your vacation, and you want to have a great time (as opposed to being very, very flexible in your tolerance) you should definitely look elsewhere. I hold no grudge because, again, I did not spend a single dime of my own money there. But I thought my eight days at this dumpster should serve as a warning to other people. One of my workmates was from the Dominican Republic and he mentioned that Barcelo is one of the lowest paying resorts in Punta Cana. As a result, some employees work there for little more than food. If you don't believe this, no problem: just wait until you see what a fine selection of beverages they serve (the brand is Classic -- Classic Rhum, Classic Scotch, Classic Tequila -- the scotch is unforgettable, in the words of someone who tried it and spent the following day remembering the experience in graphic detail). An all-inclusive resort, with lowly paid employees, and tier 5 beverages . Think about it. P.S. The beach is great, but so what? The beach is great in many other places where you don't have to go through so much while paying for it.

<Content>Great holiday with teenage kids We have just returned from a vacation at Bavaro Palace. We were a little concerned prior to departure after having read some mixed reviews of the hotel. We spent 6 days there with our 2 children (12 and 16). We have travelled extensively internationally over the last 15 years and would say that this resort provided a great balance of relaxation, activities on offer, sun and beach. The food was above average and with all the restaurants in the complex you have adequate variety (4 star). The rooms are definitely not an international 5 star standard but are comfortable- our consensus a good 3 star. The beach and pool and sun (main reason we visited there) were great - ready access to loungers, towels, the all inclusive bars are all close at hand, the beach is private so you have no hawkers,etc. The resort is generally pretty clean and reasonably maintained.The staff are friendly and helpful although if you are unable to speak Spanish making sure you are understood is a bit of a challenge. We used the Spa - very basic but a good massage. The Casino is reasonably sized and surprisingly empty so combining to provide a very comfortable environment. We did not have a sea facing room but for a small amount extra per day changed to a sea facing room - good decision , the beach was 10 ft from our verandah.

<Content>Adjust your expectations a bit... I read all of these reveiws and was concerned about what I would experience myself. But I took all of the info in these reveiws and decided to use it to prepare myself for any bumps we might encounter. So I have a little advice. Step one....You are now on Island time! Things and people move slowly. They do not indulge in the hustle bustle that us Americans do. You are on vacation. Slow down yourself and you will enjoy it more.If you are arriving before 3 pm, pack your carry-on with a 3 oz. sunscreen. Bathing suit and cover up. Your room will most likely not be ready but they will hold your luggage and put your arm band on so that you can begin enjoying the facility including the bars and restaurants. Why not enjoy your wait instead of stewing and fuming?Take the time to learn a few words of Spanish. It is greatly appreciated and you will get a kick out of it too. I took Spanish for Dummies from the local library. It helped a good bit. As always, the most important words.....Por Favor (Please) and Gracias (Thank You). I was pleasantly surprised how much of my HIgh School Spanish I retained and it came in handy.We stayed at the Palace and had no issues with check in. We did book 9 months in advance thru Apple Tours. We got a king sized bed and a nice sized room. This hotel is on the beach and it is showing it's age just a bit. So be prepared for a musty smell. If you have never been to a beach hotel before it will be a surprise but ALL beach front hotels of age will smell like this. Take some incense or air freshener if you are sensitive to smells. I found NO mold or mildew, just a little rust. The room was very clean. The maids work from 7 am to 10 pm trying to get all the rooms done so be prepared that your room may not get cleaned up until late afternoon sometimes. I left a dollar and some candies for their children everyday for the maid . School supplies like pencils and crayons would be welcome as well.The person who stocks your fridge is a different person. I would leave a dollar and a note requesting extra water each day and always got what I asked for.For some reason they run short sometimes on wash clothes. If this is a biggie for you, take some of your own or some pre-packaged face cleaning cloths. No shortage of towels. They DO NOT change your sheets daily. So what.....You don't at home either and they are very energy conscious here as well. We did encounter some plumbing issues, but they were short lived and easily dealt with. This seems to be inherent through the whole island. There were water and plumbing issues at the airport when we were leaving too. We encountered no issues with Air Conditioning or bugs. The safe worked well if you take the time to read the instructions on it's use. There are a couple of English TV channels but who goes to an island paradise to watch TV in their rooms?The food was very good in my opinion. If you are looking for foods you recognize and are used to, you will find some of them but they are not exactly what you would expect. They do their best however. The buffet was great. Lots of choices at each meal. I would steer away from processed meats like sausage, lunch meats and hot dogs. They do not have the same standards for processing as we do. Same for milk. I made it a practice to eat something I had never tried before at each meal. I was usually happy that I did. I will warn you about the coffee in the restaurants. They have very strong coffee and it is their custom to pour 1/2 coffee and 1/2 milk. They don't know any other way. If your coffee is important to you, make it in your room and bring some extra powdered creamer with you. You can have it how you like that way. La Brisa is great for seafood, The Bohia has great Dominican food. Try the Mofongo as an appetizer. La Pina was a very nice lunch grill at the upper end of the resort. They grill your choice of meats for you. The Steak house and Italian Restaurant were both good. Pizza was good.I did notice in walking thru other hotels and beaches at the resort that the maintenance and cleanliness were not as good as at the Palace. I also noticed that the clientele was VERY prone to leave trash on the beach and their tables. The staff can only do so much. So be a little responsible and dispose of your trash. They provide plenty of receptacles. There is no place on the beach to snorkel. I don't care what the brochures or your travel agent told you, there is no reef that you can reach from the beach. You will have to charter an excursion for snorkeling. But the beach is beautiful and so is the water.We did the Marinarium trip to snorkel with nurse sharks and Sting Rays which was very good. I took my own snorkel gear but they have some for you and they clean it very well.We also did the Outback Excursion thru Apple Tours. Please try to do this. You will see true Dominican Life which is nothing like what you are seeing on the resort. You will visit a home, a coffee and chocolate plantation and a school. Much of the proceeds from this trip go to charity in supporting the schools and helping the host families improve their lives. Well worth the money and such an eye opening experience. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TRIP.Please treat the Dominicans with respect. They are a hard working people who are proud of their heritage and country. They will attempt to please you if you are respectful and patient. I saw many embarrassing behaviors from fellow Americans. Yelling and being abusive will get you nowhere with these people.Other travelers from other countries were less that polite. Be prepared to be ignored and pushed in front of by other visitors.If you are expecting perfection in accomodations, you will be a bit disappointed. If you are laid back, open minded and easy going, you will have a good time. I advise booking way in advance and with a large travel agent so you have some recourse and assistance if needed.Take Immodium and Pepto. Take Ibuprofen and lots of high powered sun block. Two of us used 3 lg bottles of sunblock for a 7 day trip. It is $20/bottle or more at the hotel. Take bug spray and after bite if you are prone to mosquitos. We had a few bites but nothing serious. A Tide stick was helpful if you are a sloppy eater (I am). Pre-packaged wash cloths. Powdered creamer for room coffee. LOTS of one dollar bills and candy or school supplies. Enjoy your trip.....We did.

<Content>Be reasonable! I have read many of the comments made about the Barcelo Palace, the staff of the resort, and the Dominian Republic in general.First, let me say that I have stayed at this resort and I can rate it as a 4 star and compare it with many of the other better known resorts in the Caribbean.I have read several comments regarding the fact that the staff only knows Spanish. Well duh! You are visiting a country in which Spanish is the national language. It is up to you, the visitor/tourist to learn some of the language of the country you are visiting. If you want for everything to be just like back home why did you not stay at the Ramada Inn around the corner from your house?You expect visitors to your country to try and communicate with you in YOUR language. Please!!! we all know why we visited this resort: A) Great beaches B) It is cheap to go there! Otherwise, I'm sure many of you would have booked else where.Bring a few dollar bills with you to tip these poor people, they make in one week what most of us make in a day! They will try to make your stay a great one and with a smile. Also, remember you are visiting a third world country, bring plenty of Pepto!!! Don't drink the water and try not to eat the veggies.Aside from these comments all I have to say is to be aware that the airport there is not like the one back home. Get ready for the crowds and the heat.I will be going back to this resort in May of this year.JoeMiami, Fla.

<Content>Please look elsewhere... My boyfriend and I arrived in Punta Cana on February 3, 2008 and were expecting to stay at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach resort where we had booked. We arrived at the front desk to complete chaos. We're not unreasonable people and have frequented several all inclusives, we realize that lineups and confusion are often a part of checking in. This experience however, was one I would not wish upon anyone. We first learned the hotel was over-booked and therefore we would be carted off to the Casino hotel, which requires you to take a trolly in order to get to the beach or any of the semi-good restaurants on the Barcelo property. We refused to accept this, as we had payed for a beach room and were not willing to take a down-grade...After 3 hours of getting no where, and having the staff at the hotel actually hide from us to avoid providing any information or help, and a mountan of frustration we were told that there was in fact an opening at the Palace, and for us to make our way over to that hotel and they would be expecting us at the front desk. So, we made our way (with luggage still in tow) to the Palace. When we arrived there, no one at the front desk knew what we were talking about. After waiting there for another 2 + hours, we were told there were no rooms anywhere but in the Casino hotel. At this point, we were hot, tired and tired of carting our luggage around with us. We made our way to the Casino room to shower and get ready for dinner. The room we were taken to was what I would refer to as below a 2 star - it was awful. The matresses had indents in them they were so old. The room smelled awful (almost like sewage) and I cannot even describe the bathroom - my skin crawls just thinking about it...After I stopped crying, we made our way (by trolly - as we were so far from everywhere) to the Palace, where we were told we were able to eat. Well, the food at the Palace was awful - so who knows what the other hotels on the Barcelo property had to offer, considering the Palace is supposed to be the nicest of them all....We unfortunately had to spend the night in the disgusting Casino hotel room - at this point, after having seen some people be sent away, we were actually happy to have a roof over our heads...The next day we continued our efforts to be placed in another hotel, we were still met with avoidance and little explanation. The staff at the hotel were terrible and acted as though there was something wrong with us for being angry about the situation we had found ourselves in. Finally, at about noon, our travel rep. advised us that they were going to send us to another hotel - an upgrade. We ended up at the Riu Bamboo - the complete opposite to the Barcelo. Barcelo Bavaro refused to accept any responsibility over what happened, and it is actually our travel agent that made this happen (with a lot of help from my thankfully relentless boyfriend, who refused to allow the Barcelo to walk all over us)... Our travel agent is also reimbursing us for the almost two days we spent trying to figure this all out - again, Barcelo refused to take any responsibility. If you are going to Punta Cana - do yourself a favour and stay as far away from this place as you can. As mentioned above, we ended up spending our remaining 5 1/2 days at the Riu Bamboo and is was truly paradise - the service was impecable, the food delicious and the accomodations perfect. I will be leaving a review on their site, but wanted to make mention of them here, they made this entire situation seem to be a blessing in disguise.

<Content>great cheap get-away with the best beach This was the first time we stayed in an all-inclusive hotel. We just wanted to relax on a beautiful beach with enough options for shade (bringing a newborn), expansive enough for long walks, and safe for running at 6 am. Our stay at Barcelo Palace offered all that and more. The hotel is simple but stylish and fits in with the surroundings. In that respect much better than what I've seen in Cancun, Jamaica, etc. Food is so-so, but once you know how to 'work the restaurants' it is not so bad. Fresh pasta station and the grill (lovely filet mignon) are good in the buffet restaurant. We loved the Dominican place (excellent service, very romantic) for dinner and the beach bar for lunch. The fact that there is an option to choose from so many restaurants (all of the Barcelo resorts) is a plus. The complimentary wine is undrinkable (to be expected) but you can order bottles for $10-$20 which will make dinners so much more enjoyable. We brought a mosquito net which was really useful. Didn't use the crib they provide, as it doesn't meet US safety standards. The personnel is very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful and very relaxing stay. We've done hours and hours of walking on the beach and checked out some of the other hotels. This one seems to be the best kept, with nice grounds, and most shade (palm trees) on the beach. If you want peace  quiet, ask for a room in building 1, 5 or 6. Some negatives (easy to overcome): The gym is a joke. Massage on the beach a rip-off. Noise pollution (Party boats with blaring merengue and screaming drunks. Helicopter tours. The party games near the pool. The evening 'entertainment'). AC is difficult to adjust (on = too cold, or off = too warm). Please note: upon arrival every person (including infants) entering the DR will have to pay $10 cash. Stroller will not be returned when coming off the plane but instead show up on luggage carrousel.

<Content>wonderful, except the food I came back to Bavaro Palace after 12 years, and had a great time. Beautiful beach, wonderful sea.One bad thing is the food. But please note that I am Italian and I like to eat good fresh food. Other guests didnt seem to have any problem. The buffet had the same plates, both at lunch and for dinner. Same plates meaning, what was left for lunch, appeared again at dinner, only presented in a different way. And then again at lunch the following day. Example, the asparagi of New Year's Eve dinner reappeared for 3 days on the buffet. Even dessert was recycled day after day.Most of the time the food was cold, no matter what time you had your meal. Sadly years ago, when it was not an all inclusive option, the food was fantastic. Now that the hotel has become all inclusive, it lost the quality; so dont expect lobster, or other gourmet fish. The option of grilled fish and meat.. well, if I were you, I wold not try. Both meat and fish sit outside for hours.. and then go back into the fridge and then out again. Unless you want to spend some jolly time in the bathroom...But again, other people were eating like ogres, like they have never eaten before...But we all know that not everybody knows what good food is...

<Content>Unexpedted Upgrade! We booked our trip before reading the reviews and we were a little concerned. That all changed once we got there. Initially we were supposed to stay at the Beach Hotel. We were celebrating a belated honeymoon and my husband told the Expedia rep that and when we arrived at the Beach we were told we were upgraded to the Palace. The propery is amazing and the room was nice. It did smell a little musty and I did forget to bring a candle or something, but it was bearable. Great hot water and water pressure. VERY cold A/C, we had to turn it off/down several times. There is more than one English channel. We found CNN, National Geographic and another one. The in-room fridge was very well stocked with beer, soda and water. We tipped the guy $5 the first day and he was very happy to give us plenty of everything. Tipped maid five also for extra towels and pillows. We thought the food was very good, not 5-star, but not bad by all means. EVERYONE that worked there was VERY nice from the waiters to the desk people. We would definitely go back! We took the advice of other posters and took along bug spray. My husband didn't need it, but mosquitos love me so I put it on everyday and only got 4 bites for the whole 7 days! There are a lot of fun free things to do such as watersports, mini-golf, tennis. Bring your own rackets and balls! There are also basketball courts. Great for people with kids/teens. The sunset is beautiful and the trolly that goes around the property is fun! Even if you don't stay at the Palace there are still PLENTY of places to eat and we thought they were ALL great! Tip these people, bring gifts, leave extra things that you don't want to take home. It is a third world country and the average person makes $2500 a year!

<Content>Bacelo Palace Need Tweaking Returned Friday Nov 30. Property has alot going for it but misses the mark on a few issues. This was trip number 10 for us and the the 8th hotel. First, do not go to Puna Cana for the food. You will not starve, but it's not the USA. And forget the beef, it's tough no matter how they serve it. However, stick with local dishes and fish and you will be fine. Go to Punta Cana if you love the beach and want to relax. If you are tour people, be prepared for a pricey time away from the resort you paid dearly for. Be patient with the staff, not rude. This resort is a Spanish brand and the majority of visitors recognise this and therefore the resort has a minority of US citizens. The staff work 11 days in a row, with 4 days off. They work long hours, and yes we would have liked to see more eye contact or smiles. They were there, just not in abundance. In other words, compared to the other hotels we have stayed, this property just lacked staff personality. That combined with a horrible check in left a bad first impression. It did start to grow on us once we located the beach bar and Las Brisas for the lobster. Won a little at the slots, weather was perfect, met some new friends. Can't ask for much more. Having only CNN as free tv left us a bit annoyed but, again, so tired after day in the sun, tv was not important. Remembering this hotel begain it's life in the late 80's will give you clue to it's condition. Would I go back? Yes, the value is there. But don't kid yourself, stay at the PALACE not the other properties if you want more food selection. There was a difference!Hope this helps.

<Content>Beautiful Place! WONDERFUL PUNTA CANA!, we stayed at the Palace so that we could enjoy all the hotels included. I would say that the pools and the beaches were outstanding! The employees were extremely nice. Our ocean front room on ground floor was perfect for us, however very musty. We knew to expect that with ocean view rooms on ground floor though. I would rate our stay right up there with Hawaii as far as peace and beauty goes. We did not need much money other then to play around in the casino. The only negatives were our bodies could not get used to theirfood, so bring pepto bismal, aleve, pepcid, etc. Thankfully we did! And we were not even drinking the water! The other draw back is the language barrier. Other then that, a great relaxing 8 days of mostly sunshine and rest! Also, only one English channel and that was CNN. Do not stay in blocks 2 and 3 due to close contact with nightly shows and loud music, we were in block 4, so 4-6 are great!

<Content>Cheap getaway!!!! If you are looking for a get away place that suits a cheap budget this is the place!! My husband and I just went for 4 nights to celebrate our anniversary. The beach there is fantastic!!! If you love beaches this is a great place to go. There are tons of palm trees right on the beach so if you need shade that won't be a problem. If you like to do excursions there are tons of folks on the beach you can barter with to snorkel, scuba party cruise or parasail. If you want to just relax and chill out (just what we did) just find a beach chair and do just that. The pool is huge and has a swim up bar. The food there is okay but not great. IF you really want a 5 star resort this isnt for you. We have been to Sandals in nassau and this comes no where near that for food or room but you do get what you pay for. The bar only serves 1 kind of beer, Presidente, in either tap or bottle. The mini bar in the room comes with only 2 beers, 2 cokes and 2 sprites. NEVER drink the water there, there is plenty of bottle water everywhere to use ie: brushing teeth etc. I did get a little stomach bug while I was there but nothing major. I did see folks taking sips of Peptobismo as procaution and wished I had. You want to stay at this Bavaro Palace resort not the other Barcelo resorts in Punta Cana. This resorts covers you for all meals at all of there facilities except 2 places. The pool is the best a this resort also. You can walk forever on the beach and there are 2 casino's you can play slots, video poker and they do have a few table games. As far as the liquor goes you will pay $2 a drink if you choose to get something other then house liquor. IF you are wanting a absolut vodka drink have you wallet ready. Also if your transportation is not included the taxi should be $23 each way. We got taken on the way there for $35 one way. Live and learn I guess.All and all this is a good place to go and chill out, I would recommend going with a group of people. It is a spanish speaking island so its activities, shows, music are all in spanish. However most workers do know a little english to help you out.Again if you are looking for a fancy place this won't be for you. One other thing if nudity bothers you this place isnt for you either. Lots of europeans go here so topless women are very common.Becky and JoelNaples Fl

<Content>Incompetent! This resort was rated pretty highly, but it shouldn't be. This was my first resort experience and it was awful. I am a Spanish speaker and a lover of foreign culture, so I was looking forward to a cultural experience, but this place is awful! First, the resort ATM ate my aunt's card and the resort made no effort to help her get it back. Then, the pipes broke and our room flooded. The response? These things happen! We did get a new room, after we rejected the 2nd one due to smells and lack of air, but the only compensation we got was a small bottle of rum. To boot, the food is mediocre and the service was awful. We waited for our food at the steak house for an hour! The island as a whole is incompetent! On the way home, our flight was delayed and they said nothing. We had to sit on the grass and wait for the plane! Don't go!!!

<Content>Had a great time! Well, I had the great experience to stay at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana, DR.Lets clear some things up. AMERICANS! You are not at Disney World, you are at a resort that caters to mostly Spanish clients! I had a girl who works with me teach me some key words in Spanish before I left on my trip, and I did great! I actually enjoyed trying (very poorly) to speak Spanish! Most of the resort staff had no problem helping me or the rest of my party along if we had a language issue, in fact almost all of the staff spoke English, or had a supervisor close by who could, you just had to smile and say  English if you did not understand. I thought the food was great, I enjoy trying new things. I have no idea how the pizza tasted (saw a bad review about that) because I never felt I could not find anything for myself at any of the restraunts or buffets. We made a point of eating at different places every meal, you have a all access pass with the Palace armband! I tried some of the mixed drinks, the were very weak! To remedy that I just asked the bartenders for more vodka, easy as that. Actually, as far as drinking was concerned, I discovered a affinity for El Presidente beer, really yummy.Now, remember to bring shampoo, lotion, SUNSCREEN, hairspray, Mylanta, ect... My Mom did not bring her hairspray so we went to the Palace gift shop, big mistake, she bought a tiny 10 oz bottle of some generic crap for $12 USD! The next day we both went to the beauty shop/massage parlor and she bought a HUGE bottle of RUSK hairspray for $15 USD, that'll learn us!The flea market was really cool, too. It is just off the beach at the Palace. You must haggle! I bought a painting for $30 that the guy was trying to get $120 at first! BTW, I was warned about using the debit machine at the flea market, I was told that a lot of times it has one of these swipers that can steal your info...Also, if you go on any of the side trips the resort offers, haggle with sellers you see on them too.Speaking of side trips, we shelled out the extra money to take the Jeep day trip. What a blast! You saw so much!!! If you take the Jeep trip and see a guy selling bags of candy in the parking lot, buy one, you will figure it out in due time. We did not and felt really bad after we did. How to avoid getting sick? Do not brush your teeth with the tap water! Do not drink the tap water! People told me on my last night not to eat the salads, too late! (I did not get sick)My room did smell musty, so I opened the windows. I spent so much time out and about, hardly not any time in the room anyway...I would go back! I went on kind of a girls trip, next summer I want to bring my husband.

<Content>Great time, acceptable place I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace with my family (mom 67, dad 77, husband and cousin in their 40's, brother 30 and me 37) the week of August 18 through 25, just got back last night. We all speak Spanish, we are Cubans from Miami. I can say we had a wonderful time at this place because at the end what counts is the people you go with and what you make out of it. This is definitely not a five star hotel, so if you are expecting the luxury and accomodations you would find at a top of the line place, then don't even bother. However, the hotel has everything you need and more. The rooms are big and comfortable with balconies and beautiful views even if you don't get the oceanfront, except for the beds, which are ROCK HARD! Checking in was a nightmare on Saturday 18th because they were having the Festival del Merengue that weekend, which is a huge deal there. On top of this we arrived as Hurricane Dean was passing by right to the South of DR. The hotel was filled with Dominicans screaming and yelling at the front desk demanding their rooms and arguing about what they were being charged, it was very hot and the rooms were not ready by 3pm. My brother and I had to push ourselves to the front desk and tip one of the ladies so that she could hurry up with our rooms, which were three in total. One of the rooms we were given had people inside when we opened the door, as it had already been assigned to another family. I read similar stories on reviews before I went and if it hadn't happened to me, I would have never believed it. This problem was quickly solved went I went back to the reception desk and told them outloud what had just happened to me. Thank God I speak Spanish! The grounds are beautiful and neatly mantained. I don't know how or when they do it but I never saw anyone working on the landscapes or cleaning the floors. The hotel is very clean, everywhere on the outside and inside the rooms, bathrooms, no complains about this and I am extremely picky about cleaning. The rooms need a little remodeling but other than that, no complains. This hotel definitely needs more bathrooms built eveywhere in the public areas as there are not enough!The food is definitely very good. I don't know how someone could go hungry staying here. You have lots of options to choose from and we tried all the restaurants in the complex, but at the end, I believe the best option is the Caribe buffet with pasta station, salad station, meat station where you can have any type of meat cooked to your liking in front of you, paellas made fresh every time, taco/fajita bar, dessert bar, crepes bar, natural ice creams, fantastic! We had breakfasts here every morning, they have a smoothie bar where you could have fresh fruits blended to your liking, with or without milk, unbelievable! We loved La Brisa restaurant by the beach where you can have all the grilled lobsters you can eat and more, the pescado croquetas here are fantastic! We also loved the Dominican restaurant, sancocho, mofongo, fish with coconut sauce, chicharrones de puerco y pollo, chivo en salsa (goat) fresh tostones, ohhhh my God, what can I say? If you go there, please don't leave without trying Dominican food! The steakhouse at the Beach hotel is not worth the line, you can have the same meat at the Caribe buffet and even better, the italian restaurant was good but too dark, the Mexican is great, just the taco bar is more than enough, don't even bother paying extra to eat at Chez Palace because it is definitely not worh it. I tried it because we were given complimentary meals there.The beach is beautiful, even with some erosion we encountered as a result of Hurricane Dean. There were enough beach chairs for everyone, and the beach has plenty of shade. They have beach aerobics every morning which is lots of fun, the animation staff does an excellent job trying to engage as many people as they can in these activities. The Tropicalissimo show was not what we expected. Having a music background, my father and I think that the singers could definitely use some music and singing trining. They don't sing, they scream! The audio is horrible as well, they either need some good sound technicians here or better equipments. The customs and coreography are beaufitul. The tables should be arranged in front of the stage and not sideways, very uncomfortable. Didn't try the casino so no comments about it. Night shows at the Palace were good, singers are better and no complains about the theater, is ample and you can even seat outside which is great with the night breeze. Overall the staff was very nice and attentive. The staff at the Dominican restaurants however, was not very friendly and they looked like they were mad or frustrated. It's incredible how many pregnant girls work here, it's like an epidemic, really, never seen so many pregnant women working so hard in the same place, we tipped them every day.Overall we had a wonderful time as we are a very closed bonded family, we enjoy each other's presence each and every time and are constantly joking and laughing. At the end you will have the experience you choose to have if you don't let yourself be bothered by the small disappointments you will encounter.

<Content>Whether you like it or not...depends on what you look for in a vacation! I just came back today from a 5 day stay at the Barcelo Palace. I must admit that for me a vacation is not just laying in the sun and eating all day long and drinking all you can [Also known as ALL INCLUSIVE!]. if this is what you look for in a vacation then this is the place for you. A multitude of restaurants and all the drinking your stomack can handle. I was happy I went but no more. I enjoy going and seeing the people, learning a bit of history and getting in contact with nature/small cities. So for me this is fine to relax but after the second day I needed to get out. Also one thing this place needs to work at is the entertainment part. The shows were mediocre to say the least.

<Content>Relax - Enjoy. That's what DR is all about. We went to the Palace on our honeymoon in January 2007. It was the first time my husband had been to the Caribbean or an all inclusive ever. For me, this was my second time to DR and I unknowingly booked almost the EXACT spot I went to before. Fortunately, we both LOVED it. The only reason we didn't give this a 5 rating was because we didn't take advantage of everything we could have (tours, food, shopping, gambling, watersports, massages etc...) To book again, I probably would be just as happy not spending the extra to stay at the Palace, but this was our honeymoon and I wanted that little extra that it gives. The Caribe is almost as nice, just smaller. The Palace is not the party crowd. They're at the Barcelo Beach and Caribe resorts. BEACH - The beach is awesome. Protected by a reef so it's not too rough, beautiful white sand and, at the palace, lots of chairs and palm trees for shade. 3 of the 5 resorts in the complex front the beach, so it's a nice walk. Lots of watersports to be had, we just didn't take advantage. Once you're past the 3 resorts, there is a flea market where you can barter for items. Shirts, jewellery, rum....pretty much anything. They aren't allowed on the beach, but when you step across that line it's Cheapy!! Cheapy!!!, Almost free!, Cheaper than Walmart! So don't carry a purse and be ready to haggle. (Purses imply wallets - you'll get bugged non-stop.)HOTEL ROOM - Gorgeous. The facilities were very clean and well kept. The bathroom seemed to have the usual wear and tear that comes with multiple visits - worn tile, residue in the sinks, a little discoloration on the faucets, but the drapes, bed, desk, floor, bedding etc. was all very clean and fresh. It had that caribbean dampness, but that's the caribbean. The only thing was that the electronic safe in our room got a little possessed. We weren't really worried about using it, but we did try to let them know using one of the door hangers they provided. Problem didn't get solved, but the safe seemed to heal thyself the day before we left.We did see some rooms that had pipes burst and were drying out. I'm sure there were people during that week that will have very poor reviews of their stay for that reason. ACTIVITIES (GOLF) - We didn't take advantage of everything. (The only thing we really did was golf.) When you stay at the Palace you can play and eat at all of them. Some things, like the golf, you pay extra for. The course is decent. It's not Glen Abbey or Augusta, but it's okay. And HOT. If you don't like to golf in the heat, book EARLY. Half of the course is fairly well protected by trees, so the wind does get through much. The other half is much better and more open. We rented clubs down there and while they weren't too bad, I'll be taking my own clubs next time. All along the course there are guys on carts coming up to you to ask if you want to buy balls. That was a little annoying, but it's still a lovely course. The Casino isn't bad, but I'm not much of a gambler. It's always open it seemed, but got very busy at night. Blackjack, slots, and I think roulette were the main games. I don't remember seeing craps.There is a little plaza to shop in the complex as well. I would have loved to pick up some art, but we couldn't agree on anything. I'm not sure if you can barter, but you can get smokes, snacks and some essentials. Warning: bring your own snacks and chocolate. $40 doesn't go far when you're buying chocolate bars down there. The clothes were lovely, but I'm cheap. I thought they were expensive.FOOD - We mainly ate at the Palace buffet although there are other snack stands and specialty restaurants also. I heard the pizza was excellent and there was always a line up. I would have loved to try the seafood place on the beach, but just didn't get to it. (Hubby hates seafood...*sigh*) The quality of the buffet was excellent. Lots of variety, very fresh - especially if you like seafood. My only complaint was that after 10 days of the SAME STUFF, I got sick of it. Not their fault, I had lots of other restaurants to choose from and didn't.SERVICE - All the staff was polite and friendly. It was like home. People say hello to you as you pass. They did speak some english, but it really wasn't perfect except for some staff at the golf course and the markets. Take a good spanish phrase book with you. I used the Rough Guide Spanish and it was great. You'll get a lot further if you make an effort to use some spanish. They appreciate the effort and even if you're not bang on, they'll get the idea and give you the right words and help you. I learned more Spanish from them than anywhere else (and I took Spanish in school!)

<Content>What a wonderful vacation! I will start my review by saying I'm glad I kept an open mind and took most of the reviews with a grain of salt.Reviews with helpful information are wonderful but like movie reviews it really is all about personal preference. If you are used to staying in a 5 star hotel in North America and are planning to compare this hotel to that than you might be disappointed. Our family of 6 stayed at the Palace May 19-26. Before I begin (and this is something I didn't see on any other reviews) I will fore warn you that depending on where you are from, you will either have to pay a fee to enter the country or a fee to leave it. Coming from the US we had to pay $10 per person at the airport so we could enter the country. Not a huge amount but definitely something we didn't expect. Check in was very quick and easy - we didn't even have time to finish our welcome drinks before we were taken to our rooms. My husband and I upgraded to a suite which was a benefit with 4 kids who spent a lot of time in our room before heading out to excursions or meals. The extra living room area was used a lot! Unfortunately when we upgraded we were told we would get extras that in fact were not included. It seems that not everyone is aware of exactly what really is included so be careful. ROOMS: We had no problems at all with our rooms except the beds were very hard.POOL/BEACH: Like most reviews said, both the pool and the beach were AWESOME! I can't find a thing to complain about. The pool bar staff was great and Henry is the best! It is very easy to tell where our beach ended - the neighboring resorts weren't as good at keeping theirs groomed in our opinion.FOOD: Well now - the food can be a little (my daughter says weird) but I'll say different. There are some dishes that you won't find anywhere else but there. We have a family of 1/2 picky and 1/2 not so picky. if you are a picky eater just stick to what you know. The Steakhouse was not our favorite, the Mexican place was hit and miss but probably our favorite. The Pizza place was good but don't eat the tuna pizza - sounds gross??? it was and it made my daughter very ill.EXCURSIONS: Let me say right away that the snorkeling in the DR is not as good as you will find in other Caribbean locales. If you are going and expecting to see great snorkeling you won't. That said, The Caribbean Festival was fun, the party after the snorkeling was the best part. They put on a great show and work really hard at getting everyone involved. The Segway tour ROCKED!!! Great time for a great price. We did the 3 hour tour for $50 per person. The speed boat tour also had some snorkeling it was better than the first tour. It was a good time.TIPS: #1 - All reviews were right - bring LOTS of sunscreen - the higher SPF the better, also bring aloe.#2 - Bring LOTS of singles for tipping we brought $300 for 6 of us (3 rooms for 7 days plus bar and restaurant tipping) and just had enough - a dollar goes a long way. Also be prepared to tip at the airport both ways as you are not allowed to carry your own luggage.#3 - Go prepared for anything, all pharmacy type items are extremely expensive (ie. feminine products ($15 a box)). #4 - Bring snacks#5 - This resort does not have a lot for teens and kids to do so come prepared - although the kids never complained of being bored (they weren't allowed to) they certainly had that look on occasion.#6 - like on most cruise ships the photos taken of you around the resort only cost you $$ if you decide to buy them later. Most of them are well worth the $8 they charge.All in all a very relaxing trip - by far the most relaxed I've been in a very long time. If you go with an open mind and don't let the little things upset you then you'll have a great time.Would we go back??? - absolutely!!!!!

<Content>A great time at the Barcelo Palace We spend a week at the Barcelo Palace from June 9 untill the 16.The arrival at the Airport was fast, we pay the $10.00 for the Visa Card, took the pictures with the 2 girls and went towards the bus provided for MK Tours, when we arrive at the Hotel they send us to the place where they do the shows every night to get our keys, I emailed the Hotel previously, plus know someone in the travel agencyand request a King size bed, they give us our keys. Our room was in block 5 #5048, I did not feel the smell that is always mentioned on that day, the room was clean, the AC on. The Palace is a beautiful property, the rooms are showing age and they need to be redecorated painted and all that, we tip the maid daily a dollar or two, also themini bar. We enjoyed our stay there but I like to mention that i tookmy MP3 player and on the second day left it in the room and when we come back the head phones were gone, the mp3 was there but no headphones, so no music for the rest of the week. The Lady clean the room daily and do a good job, the AC is controlled by the Resort, it was fresh never cold, we sleep without covers every night, on the daybefore our departure the AC broke in many buildings so we were moved to building 4 first floor 4007, this room really smell, the bed was horrible, the pillows on builging 5 were great the ones in blg 4 werehorrible.The Beach is just beautiful, I been told that the Palace complex has one of the nicest in Punta Cana. There were always chairs, I will say30 per person since the resort was 30% booked.The Pool- Very well kept, clean, we will see them working every morning cleaning and fixing everything.Entertaintment Team by Pool - The team is awesome, I read the reviews before and mentioned them to Anthony, he is a great kid , he was impressed that they mention them on Trip Advisor, he was so nice and the rest of them too, they do Aerobics, Dance lessons, play with the kids, he also was playing the Music, they help in the shows you name it. They play music every afternoon at 4:30 , we had so much fun. They did a beach party friday afternoon at 5 with the Palace Orchestra, drinks , it was nice.Entertainment Shows- Were boring, I like the ones with the Couples at the Palace Theatre , we did not go to Tropicalissimo and in the summer they have a Cuban Singer from Miami named Chirino performed at the Convention Center, it was good, once again not everyone mightlike him since is an Spanish Concert. Something that I like to mention and this is a personal comment, I had a hard time with the shows and diners outside with no AC, this is not affecting my opinion of the resort but I will like in our future stays to find a resort that have some A/C restaurants, lobby or Theathre. Couple of nights we just stay on the rooms after diner cause of the heat and we were not the only ones.Food: It was dissapointing, My husband like it, I am not a picky eater but i really was not impressed, this is our first AI, I am used to Cruises and the food cannot be compare, you will find something that you like, but is different, anyways I did not starve or anything, neither of us got sick.Buffett Caribe- It was Okay, in the morning you can have a smothie, they have omelets station(also be prepared to tip the ones that do the omelets, the pasta, the smothies) sometimes i will do it every other day, their panckakes and french toast were soggy to me, it all depends in taste, the omelets were really good and the orange juice is freash and delicious, i read once in TA that was Tang and thats not true, but the juice that they serve later in the day is horrible is a water down version of Minute Maid, even worst. Also the Buffet is open Air and I saw birds eating from the food, that was discussting, they have a variety of meats and fish at lunchtime and they do use the utencils to cook the raw meat to cook it, i mention it to my husband and he look at me like saying that I was too much, they will use the same Spatula to mixed the raw eggs and to cook them, also for the raw meats and fish, maybe those little things can explain some people getting sick in Punta Cana.Steak House- The best meals were there, try the tendeloin, they called Medallions, it was good , they even have A1 sauce, the service is the worst in the steak house but is a decent meal, also the Churrasco was good.Las Brisas- This is the seafood place at the Palace, they will serve you Lobster, as many as you want, they are small, the service was good there, Anabel was nice and she took care of us, the Pizza is just horrible, the Calamari was Okay, you can ask them to boil your lobster or do it with a spanish sauce, it was really good.Spanish Restaurant- located at the Casino, is a pay restaurant, it came included in our trip, it has AC, what a blessing. the apetizers were the best, I have the Paella and it was very good, my husband eat the duck and he like it.Italian Restaurant- Chez boy r dee. I read on TP that was like the Olive garden, in my opinion it was horrible, breadsticks were good, is located at the Caribe I think, I order the Lasagna and the ChickenCaccitori, it was a leg part of the chicken, they did not prepare it on white meat, everyone has a different taste with food so try it, myhusband had the fish and he love it.Dominican restaurant- Bad, bad, just my opinion, they do a goodmofongo is a dish made og green bananas, oil, garlic and pork rings, it was a good snack.French- Never visitedMexican- Never visitedReservations: not needed ,only in the pay ones.Service was so so, nothing special, is slow, very slow, and the resorts were 30% occupied, so the were no lines on the Restaurants, Ithink they can improve the service and we did tip everybody.Security_ Very good , they have 1 or 2 guards in every Building.always feel safeThe dominicans are super nice people, simple people, lovely, they wilalways greet us and many of them smiled, not all. Some seem very sad,overall they were nice.Excursions- went to the Macao Tour, is the motorcycle, the beach, which is just gorgeus, them a horse ride, it was 65.00 per person and it lasted 4 hours.Also we visit Higuey and the Church there La Basilica it was $75.00for the taxi and sort of like a waste of time, but we wanted to get out of the resort, if you do it, go with other people, the taxi charge 75 for up to 5 persons in the cab, it was only us, our friends went on an excursion on that day.Bars_ I am not a heavy drinker, the bahama mama was bad, pina colada okay, Presidentes good, I try the Anisette with Ice, My husband like the Mojitos. The sodas taste different that what t we are used to.Train_ They have a train that moves in the resorts, it was Okay, no guidance on the stops, you have to guess where to stop.Discos- Never visited, too hot.The property is well kept, very pretty, the rooms are showing age, the crowd was European and a lot of Cubans from Miami, some americans, mostly Europeans, Italians, Spaniards. Few toppless ladies, not many, on the beach.Overall we did have a great time, we are planning to comeback, my husband love the Palace, I will like to try the Majestic or Bahia Principe but we still dont know.Go with an open mind, take sun tan lotion and enjoy yourself. A good thing about this property is that you get to use all of the other resorts facilities, the other people can visit the palace but they cannot eat there or drink. is hot but is the Caribbean.

<Content>Family Vacation at the Palace My husband and our 2 boys just came back from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace on 6/10/07. Please keep reading the reviews, we learned so much from them.Overall the place was average, we had a few issues but nothing horrible.Checking in - we specifically asked for a room with a king sized bed and a room with 2 dbl beds for the boys in the same building. We were not given what we asked for and was rudely told that those were the only rooms they had and that there were no guarantees. Very quickly we noticed that the resort was empty (later found out that they were only at 30% capacity). I went back to front desk and pointed this out to manager who insisted that none of the buildings had both types of rooms in the same building. Our travel agent has been there numerous times and assured us that they did. After much discussion we were finally moved to bldg 5 and were given what we asked for. Apparently the rooms with the king sized beds face ocean and because we did not specifically pay for ocean view they were holding out. Rooms were clean. A/C in rooms very cold.Food - tolerable - we all felt nauseaus at times, one of the boys had diarrhea all week. It is very hot, none of the restaurants have a/c and food at buffet just sits there. I ate mostly fruit at meals. Steak house was good, Italian - fair, Mexican - fair. Great place for lunch next to bldg #6 - can eat in swimsuits with feet in sand - you can pick out your own meat/fish and they will cook while you wait. great steak sandwiches.When leaving to come home they had a Wendy's in the airport - boy were we glad to see it was the real deal. Burgers on resort looked nasty.Drinks - were ok, we are not big drinkers. Frozen drinks were watery. There was bottles water available at all bars. Mini bar stocked daily with beer, soda and water.Excursions/Activities - Definately recommed Safari trip - as stated in other reviews it was well worth the money ($80.00/pp). You are out from 0830 until 430p - visited home in countryside, school, coffee/cocoa planation. lunch on ranch and boogie boarding on beach where atlantic and carribean ocean meet (beautiful). The guys went scuba diving which they said was great ( 65.00/pp). Golf Course in need of work - great for 1st timers - have to rent clubs ($20.00), buy balls ($9.00) and rent cart ($30.00), greens fees included if you stay at palace.Security everywhere - felt very safe. Train to get around to other resorts on property and casino was fun but they often allowed it to be overcrowded. Kids get rowdy at night. Disco open until 4am (never saw it myself - boys enjoyed)Not sure we would stay there again. Would like something more upscale with better service. Satff very slow, didn't speak much english. That high school spanish came in handy.

<Content>Great place. Dont let reviews scare you. I read countless reviews before leaving and started getting scared. Dont let people judge your trip for you. Everyone has their own likesand dislikes.BEACH: Best I have ever seen. Had family with us who has been to hawaii, several cruises and They say This was the best place by far. Gorgeous Sand, Crystal waters. People talk alot about topless woman and men in speedo's and being from chicago, I was a bit worried for my mid-teen son but its nothing at all. We saw maybe 6-8 all week andyou dont even really pay attention. Most have nothing much to look atanyhow, lol. There are lots of loungers, lots of shade under a gorgeous palm tree or under a nice shade tree or grass hut.FOOD: Was a bit disappointing but there were several good things hereand there. Ate at the steak house, tenderloin was the only thing thatwas very tender. T-bone and strip was good, just a bit more chewy.. La Brisa was good for the Lobster.. Mexican restaurant was not very good. Dont let reviews stop you though, everyone has their own tastes.. My husband got sick (diareha, some cramps) for several days but with taking pepto and imodium together, its helped to be able to still do things during the day. He got this is jamaica last year and all we had was pepto and he could not leave the room for 3 days... I got sick here and there as did my son. We are thinking, it is more likely to be the diary products. We love cheese,etc...and we ate lotsthe first day. Diary isnt processed like it is in the U.S. Lots of food, like at the caribe buffet at the Palace is sitting out for sometime in the heat and humidity....Flys here and there but nothing too bothersome. POOL: Pool was great. Drinks ready for you when asked. Pool bar was good, just didnt like that it came up to like 1 foot to sit at the pool bar. Very clean and Water was great. Just tip at times.Weather was Amazing. Last day was very humid and cloudy. It rained a few days for a little bit. Couple days were very sunny til about 11 am then got cloudy the rest of the day, which was a treat from the hot blazing sun...We saw a few shows at the palace, Nothing really great but nice to sit, enjoy with a drink. A bit hard to understand at times, Being from chicago and not knowing much spanish..Everyone there was great. People are very friendly to us, and not knowing much english wasnt much of a problem..Frankie, at the go/go vacation-prieto tours desk was fantastic..If you get the chance let him work with you during your vacation. He books anything you want. And will answer any questions.Pool team was great, Dance lessons were fun. ANTHONY is the best. He dances, does water aerobics,helps in the nightly shows. If you go soon, Tell ANTHONY that ANTHONY from Chicago says hello. (My son liked him alot)We did the parasailing the first day we arrived. I think we paid a bit much, $80.00 for 2. I heard someone say they got 2 for $40.00 I am not much of a talker so i didnt talk them down much. Parasailing was awesome but fast, ended in like 15 minutes.We did the Saona Island tour. Was fun, but the beach was disappointing. The palace beach was the best. The beach on Saona Island wad very beautiful but all the corals washed up on the shore and when you get in the water, it REALLY hurts your feet.. And the water they take you too on the boat ride back is nice but all you see is a few large starfish, no other fish around.. It was a nice trip though. About 1 hour on a bus to the Boat. Took catamaran there,which was maybe 1-2 hours. Had drinks and music along the way. Spent 2 hours on Saona Island, had drinks and food. Was a nice trip.. This ran about $ 90.00 per personWe did the aquamarine? You wear helmets and go under the water and walk along the sea floor looking at fish. That was nice too. Just paid alot of money and didnt last that long. We asked for the shark and stingray tour and were told we get that with this and was disappointed when we saw no stringrays to pet or interact with. You go to the aquamarine site, about 15-20 minutes from the hotel. You goby boat to the platform. You get your helmet on and walk along the bottom of the ocean, maybe about 15-20 ft under ( watch the pressure in your ears) if you never been scuba diving or did this before. It can hurt alot, pay attention to what the instructor tells you. You are only under water for maybe 15 minutes, if that. Than you throw ona life floater and snorkel gear and you swim to the shark cage. They only let you swim around for maybe 10 minutes. These are large nurse sharks ( no teeth) these are like Giant sucker fish, they are bottom feeders. So they stay close to the bottom of the ocean, you can see them but its not up close. Then you go back to shore to see a sea lion, you get a kiss with him, for a photo and pet him. You then havedrinks and dance  mingle for about an hour or so, then you go back to the hotel. This ran about $90.00 per person.Excursions are expensive. And you usually get offered the dvd of eachtrip for about $40.00Last trip, my husband and son did the Segways, you ride along the beach,horse ranch and gold course. They said was alot of fun. This is about $30.00 per person for an hour.Was worried about needing long pants for son and husband for restaurants, but did not need them... Only need to dress up for the 2 pay restaurants and did not go to them.. Everything about the resort was awesome.. Its like a whole little town, taking the train through the hotels..We left $2.00 a day for maid, $1.00 a day for fridge stock., left $1.00 each when we ate. Left bartenders tips here and there.We will definatly go back, But I want to say this. We originaly choose the Beach hotel but my sister wanted to upgrade and we wanted it for the restuarants at the palace and the pool bar.. Since we know the food isnt nothing special and the pool was very nice but you can still use the pool if staying at another hotel. We are definatly going to stay at one of the other hotels. The palace had nice big rooms and the other hotels room are just a bit smaller but you can still use the pool, beach,etc..at the palace. Save the $500. per person and stay at another hotel...This is what we will do for sure.. You can still eat at the 4 other hotels and their are tonf of restaurants...We did not get a chance to go to the casino. Rooms were very nice. Only saw a couple cockroaches in the room in the week and 1 big one in the womans bathroom near the palace stage. But you are in a foreign country so that is expected. Fridge was stocked daily with a couple large waters, couple beers, few sodas and a couple candies..Maids cleaned rooms great and left towels daily. Water pressure and hot/cold water was great, never a problem..We had a few bites here and there but nothing major. We never used bug spray.You definatly need lots of high sunscreen or you well get fried if you stay in the sun too long. My husband usually never burns, he has the dark olive skin and he fired and was peeling bad when we left..Im not sure who can say the rooms and hotel were bad. They were Great. Sure theres little scuffs , cracks here and there but what do you expect. Its the the ritz.... Its a lovely place. We didnt want to leave..Any question, feel free to ask. Enjoy yourself.

<Content>Barcelo Bavaro Palace Trip The good the and the ugly We stayed at the Barcelo Palace on Bavaro Beach from May 5th to 15th of 2007. The Good. The beach at the Palace is beautiful and there is an abundance of clean, working lounge chairs both in the sun and under palm/pine trees in the beach area. As you go down the beach to the two other Barcelo properties the beaches are not as well maintained nor are the lounge chairs as nice. At the Cribbe Hotel, the chairs were dirty and many were broken.. The pool areas at all three hotels are clean, with plenty of padded chairs, although there was no shade. The staff at all the food places were the best. The waitresses the Palace Buffet will go out of their way to help you. We tipped ours a couple dollars a day at breakfast and sat in her area every morning. The waitresses, as most of the staff live at the hotel and leave their families in Santo Domingo for long periods of tiem. Our waitress worked 28 days straight and got 4 days off. Pleasetip these ladies. We were in building 3, it was the closest to the pool area, but not bothered by noise. Our room although not the Ritz,was clean, air conditioned, and everything worked. No odors. Dispitethe moisture and heat of the DR there was not a sign of mildew anywhere. The food was ok nothing special but it was not bad. The a la carte restrarunts are the best, especially Las Brisisa. The Entertainment. The enteriners mainly spoke spanish but also spoke french and english to a lesser degree. The music was good by the poolbut it was on a loop and got to be a little old. The best night of entertainment is when they get 3 couples on stage to go different dances of the world. We went the the Tropicalismo at the Casino. That was BAD. It was more about showcasing the female Butts than dancing. I did not expect Vegas, but the show had no class. I felt sorry for the dancers to have to perform in the show. During the day the Animators,(a group of about 5 20 year olds) work very hard to entertain the guests. The hotel should give them more resources to work with, because they really try hard and are always smiling. Theyalso are part of the evening shows. There is a good assortment of nonmotorized water things to use, but if you take out a paddle boat, make sure it has all its paddles. Only one did. Now here is the ugly and I mean ugly. If you are from the United States, CHECK the Center for Disease Control web site and follow all their recommendations. While in the DR I contacted something--the blood results are not backyet. On the plane trip home I started shaking, sweating, and had a high fever. I was hospitalized for 4 days.. Use plenty of repellant especiallly in the jungle. We went on the Cave trip and it was great,but the doctors think the between jungle hike, eatting the food at the ranch, the cave water which had bat droppings which I hiked in wearing provided boots and clothing and at one point had to completely be submerged, I caught something. Just be careful. By the was if you are staying on Bavaro Beach, the Saona Island trip is a waste of time. The beach your at is better and 3 hours closer. Take small gifts for your housekeeper. If you really want to WALK on WATER with everyone...take anything RED SOX baseball. The Country is beautiful and the people are great. At the end of the complex there is a good place to buy stuff. Offer about 25% of what they ask and if your walk away when they counter, you will get it for what you want. Coffee $3 lb, Chocolate $3. lb. Have fun with them. Remember they wont' sell it if they are not amking a profit.

<Content>Torn Ride from airport to hotel was bumpy but actually fun. Checked in immediately. We were promised an ocean view room but wound up in a normal one instead. Room was spacious but had mold in bathroom and shower curtain stunk up the entire room. We found the grounds to be kept pretty well; staff always cleaning, painting, trimming etc. We did not have a problem with the taste of food, but we have been terribly ill for 5-days now. My husband is worse off and we may wind up going to the ER for dehydration! It's a miracle we were able to make the flight home we were so sick.Beach was beautiful, pool was okay. As for staff, we found the buffet employees to be friendliest. Bar employees cold and unfriendly (lots of pregnant women working the bars?) - no smiles - they don't even look at you in the eyes.Bring everything from the US!!!! Sunscreen, lotions, aspirin, imodium...everything! The gift shop staff will follow you around as if you were going to steal something and everything is outrageously priced. Example? $25 for 6 aspirins; $10 for a pack of cards and $9 for 1lb of coffee!!! Insaine.Markets on the beach were a trip! I've never been so hassled in my life. It broke my heart having to say no, no thank you over and over because those merchants must make close to nothing to feed their families.We were happy with the grounds and the beach which made our honeymoon memorable but I'm wondering if our stomach illnesses will overshadow everything!!

<Content>Disgusting, Horrible and would never go back in a million years Where do I begin ...Friends and I went to the Barcel贸 B谩varo Palace for a girls getaway for 5 days and had the worst experience. Our reservation was messed up from the beginning from the pont where they stated they took American express and then they would only take MC or Visa (luckily I had another card). We had to check in twice in order to keep our rooms. The front staff were not very friendly, the room was smelled of mildew and there was mold in and around the entire bathroom and tub. We arrived around 3:30-4pm so we wandered around the grounds. Based on a recomendation from the staff we ate at the seafood resturant La Brisa where the food was overcooked and taseless (we sent 90% of it back) and for our troubles I had food poisoning the first night there wishing for a plane ride home. Over the course of the next few days we had to scrounge for edible food and we most likely lost 10 lbs each. Customer service was poor or rude everytime we needed help or asked a question. All the drinks were watered down and it was hard to find a good drink at the various bars. The beach is beautiful and you can always find somewhere to lay which was the only saving grace of the trip. A few tips for those brave enough to still want to stay here;-Bring Lysol for the room-Bring plenty of Rolaids or Tums- Pay the $20 fo rthe American channels to watch TV but please note that 6 of the 18 will still be in Spanish.-Bring a deck of cards or something else to do in the evenings for entertainment is poor-Bring Neosporin or something for bug bites you will need it.-Get used to lukewarm water for ice is never offered.-Stay away from anything dairy if you want to survive. (Leche muy mal)-Try the Steakhouse for at least one decent meal-Bring a flashlight for there are only low lights or no lights every 20 feet on the property.- If you are not shy try the beach massage in the huts but you will be partially nude during your massage.-If you have older children, be prepared to know that partial nudity is allowed so don't be surprised at what you see.-bring a Spanish speaking friend, a handheld translator, learn some very key Spanish phrases.- Finally, kiss the soil of whatever county you come from when you make it back in one piece!

<Content>Stop reading all these reviews... If you are reading endless reviews of this resort...my advice is to stop right after reading this one. I worried myself sick reading all of these before our honeymoon...so much that I was holding my breath that our honeymoon would go well. Imagine being nervous and all worked up about going on vacation...it makes no sense at all! TripAdvisor is great...but reading all of these reviews will make you nervous as heck going into a vacation where you don't need to worry at all.1.) If you are from the US - don't act like you have attitude and derserve more than others. Use some Spanish words and say thank you and please in Spanish. Don't go up to the bar and mumble, Beer. Americans make up about 10% of the resort...Europeans make up about 70% of the resort.2.) Drinks - their local beer is Presidente and is the equivalent to Budweiser or Coors Light - it is good beer. I drank about 20 of them a day (they're smaller than US ones). Order them 2 at a time. Their rum is good, too. Mixed drinks will be watered down...so if you wanna get tanked...ask for just rum  coke or hit the hard liquors without all the fruit mixers. They have bottled water at all the bars  restaurants - it is fine! La Pina bar is the best...Carlos  Moises are the nicest dudes there. I often tipped the good service we had at all places.3.) Food - be smart and you'll be fine. Order the local Mahi  Dorado fish (because you're supposed to eat fish in the Caribbean) and have them grill it - tastes awesome! The fruit was all safe for us, as well. Don't go and eat at the pay restaurants...only advantage you get is the air conditioning. The other sitdown restaurants are all decent. If you are used to eating in 5-star NYC restaurants and expect that from this resort...then you should go somewhere else.4.) Rooms - we had an oceanfront room in Block 6 and it was really solid! Left a $1 in the mini bar each day and a $1 for housekeeping - with both we well taken care of. Couple of bugs here and there...but it's all part of the experience. We had some bug bites (didn't really feel them until we saw them) - bring some spray. We had a few problems with our room key/lock one night - but they fixed it right there.5.) Beach  Pools - both are real nice...especially the beaches. Best sand ever! Quiet around beach area and plenty of chairs in both sun  shade. Warm ocean water! Lots of topless European women and European dudes wearing meat hanger bathing suits...so don't be surprised at that.6.) Check In/Check Out - both were super easy! If you arrive before 3:00 or so...you may have to wait to get your room...but that happens in US hotels, too.7.) Other Bavaro Resorts - go check them out if you have time. Casino pool crowds was pretty slow so we went there a couple days. Actual Casino was ok - $5 BJ tables and not too crowded.8.) Spend the $20 for the week to get the English channels on the tv - there is always some downtime in the room and having those channels helps. I even got to watch the Yankee game 2 nights in a row...plus you get a bunch of free movie channels. Beach massage = $25 - it was decent. There are shops at the end of the resort - bargain like crazy with them - pretend you are in Chinatown - cigars  booze, t-shirts, jewelry, etc. You can usually get them down about 100% from their asking price. They will HOUND you, though, as soon as you get near them.Again - read enough of these reviews and eventually it'll make you sick! Go on your vacation knowing how to have a good time with your wife, friends, or family and you will be fine.

<Content>never again I just recently returned from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace Resort in Punta Cana. The staff was not helpful at all. No one speaks any English and don't appear like they ever would like to. God forbid, that you would like to accomodate your paying guests. All the entertainment was in Spanish as well as poor quality. I had a a steak one night where i developed TMJ after trying to chew the firstpiece. No one seemed to care as the waiter just came over and removed the plate without asking why 90% of the steak was still on the plate. Oh and i don't want to forget to mention the diarrhea feverand chills that we both got either from the frozen drinks or the food.If it wasn't for the nice weather and beautiful beach I would have lefton a flight for Florida. I didn't notice any difference staying at the palace as opposed to the beach or the caribe. It was the same foodthe same lousy service and same entertainment. Let's not forgetBINGO.......IN SPANISH of course.I should of stayed at the least expensive of the resorts and then maybe Iwouldn't feel like this was a big waste of money. I would never recommend this resort to anyone. Never again Sue from Mass.

<Content>Barcelo Bavaro Palace...Disappointed Barcelo Bavaro PalaceDate of Stay..April 26 - May 3, 2007We really enjoy Punta Cana as this was our 3rd trip. We made the mistake of staying at Barcelo Bavaro Palace. We were told that this is the nicest property, unfortuanely they are all bad. The Palace is rundown and outdated..the rooms need to be redecorated. There was mold in the bathtub, the airconditioner in the entire building did not work the 2nd day and never really cooled. It had rained so hard prior to our visit that the ground floor rooms were flooded and the smell was terrible. We tried the seafood restaurant the first night, the lobster and grouper were overcooked and the waiters seemed to rush you through dinner. I was served my appetizer and salad at the same time and within 5 minutes the entree was out. The buffet is where we ended up eating breakfast and lunch, nice selection and the staff were very eager to please. A few dollars goes a long way! Upon check-in, the registration staff were not very friendly and even worse was the customer service desk. the evening entertainment was little to be desired. The most enjoyable evening was when they had a piano player at the lobby bar for an hour. The pool area is dirty and the pool itself needs some attention. No premium liquor is available at the pool, only lobby bar at $2 per drink. Other resorts I have stayed at in Punta Cana did not charge for premium liquor. We golfed at the resort course, it is okay for resort golf. You do have to pay $30 per person for a cart. We will go back to Punta Cana but will try the new Paradisus or the Riu Palace.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was outstanding when you compare it to Latin American hotels...if you are going to compare it to hotels in Vienna, Munich etc u may be disappointed....the food was good and the availability of 15 restaurants and 18 bars was outstanding...staff was always courteous and friendly...the only down side to the hotel were some of the guests esp. a loudmouth and his girlfriend or wife who knows, by the pool. I read mixed reviews on the hotel but the grounds and beach are nice, rooms are ok and the service is great...people get upset that the staff doesn鈥檛 speak English but there were Germans, Russians, Czech鈥檚, Spaniards, Canadians and French Canadian at the hotel...I heard at least 12 different languages spoken by guests and it is the absurd Archie bunker mentality that every one in the world should speak English...I speak three languages and understand some others and these people try to satisfy every one...I am a Dominican who has lived there in the us and Europe and understand the cultural differences that occur in the world...when in Rome.........

<Content>We made the best of a potential disaster Our check in process was futile, the lady there laughed at us , then gave us a wristband, said our room was not ready, come back 3 -clock! we asked a man why, he shot back- ISSS NOT REY-EEE come bag 3 clock! go eat lunch, this was 1230. We walked aimlessly up the resort, nobody would direct us to a buffet or bar, and found caribe buffet by accident, we got plates and gathered some edible looking selections, hit or miss totally! about 30% was decent, got beverages from a disgruntled waitress who shot back correct pronunciations of what we ordered if not said properly! IT ES SODA CON LIMON! say it right, she said, classy huh? after 2 1/2 hours of wandering we went back to the desk, the same lady handed us another card to fill out! even though she had given us the wristbands a while ago! we shook them at her, she laughed and said you wait a minute.320 we got our room assigned. (when we got there they said; no resrvation! go away!, they had listed it under my first name!) the food AI would rate a 3, drinks a 2, staff a 2, rooms a 1, service a 1, hostlity a 7, ignorance an 8, and we both got sick and my wife fell on an unlit path and was told go to clinic! which cost us $830 for nothing! we were told go to clinic, sign credit card bill or we won't help you! same at the clinic, sign or walk back to resort! 20 miles....trapped by thieves, huh?room smelled, our back door lock was broken , never fixed, the tv went on and off at will, power failures every few hours shut our clocks off. shows..lol....tropicalissimo was like a comedy bit on saturday night live! amateur dancers, bad singers and sex was shoved down our throats by butts shaken in our faces all show. one guy tried to sing in english...! what a joke...sang LET IT BE by the Beatles....I think...whisper on a window...letter B,  Mothra Mair he comes to see, me whisper on a window, let me see, letter B. FOR REAL! the train express was a safety risk, we were on a full train returning from the casino, but when the train came to a posted stop, over 100 people were waiting, and allowed to climb over people seated and on the roof, and just grab onto it, and nobody said a word! it could barely move, they started jumping up and down too, trying to scare us off the train. IT was like watching the news of terrorists in the middle east. I drank 15-25 drinks per day, never got a buzz! one night had 12 draft beers and 5 bottles, nothing! wide awake!the coffee is not drinkable, the fruit warm and sour, they had creamed broccoli marked as cauliflower with cheese! don't eat the meat, any of it, it looks somewhat like taylor ham, but tastes like nothing in the pork or beef category, dog...cat perhaps? wild boar? porcupine? they eat them all!noise level of guests was obnoxious, food at la uva on the beach was described by our tour guide at prieto tours as THE BEST at the resort, it was found to be the worst, by far....grilled, unpealed shrimp were tasteless and came with ice cold french fries and a wilted leaf of lettuce, you could not get a drink from the bar there either, no requests were aknowledged, only warm water from a plastic bottle. we went up to the bar stood there 25 minutes and were ignored after dinner/lunch...finally left in disgust, we did see a bartender cry after being confronted by a local , he must have owed a debt to them , a group of well dressed thugs who took him out of the bar area, never seen again.I could go on forever, but in a word...NO! ..STAY AWAY! ....DIRTY, MOLDY PLACE,,,beautiful beach, some nice people, but it ends there...not even a 1 star , the barcelo bavaro palace is a dump! adios siempre , I SAID ALOUD AS WE WERE DRIVEN OFF, I was never so glad for my vacation to end, or to get back to my house, which is 50 times more palacial than the palace we were stuck in for 4 nights.

<Content>Viva La Barcelo Bavaro Palace My husband and I along with another couple booked this trip back in January of this year for travel from April 21 through April 25. This gave me ample opportunity to read reviews and do some investigating.Boy was I apprehensive. But from the moment we arrived, I was in lovewith it. From the people to the grounds of the facility and yes - even the food. Staying at the Palace gives you the opportunity to visit the 4 other sister hotels, the Casino, the Beach, the Caribe and the Golf (we did not see the Golf so can't speak for that one). The best food was at La Brisa (seafood) at the Palace, hats off to Rosie our server there, great person. Rooms were average, service excellent. Kudos to our maid and stock person, they did their jobs well and kept our refrigerator stocked and room spotless. Worst meal we had was at the Steakhouse. Weather was good. Catamaran excursion was great, definitely for people who want to have a good time. A lot of dancing, drinking and sun. Bargain for everything. Some topless bathing, but not too much if that sort of thing bothers you. The Beach and The Caribe seemed to be a younger crowd - not sure why maybe the time of year we went.Oh, make sure you ask for liquor in your drinks, if not you may just get a virgin drink. Learn a few spanish words and it goes far. Join in the activites, the shows at night and you just might be surprised how much fun Punta Cana can be.Anyone that complains must be very difficult to please in the first place. Keep an open mind, smile alot, tip well and you'll have a great time. All in all wonderful vacation. We are seriously considering returningnext year.

<Content>would visit again If you are looking for a nice quick inexpensive get away. This is it. The palace was not crowded like the other places on the resort and less rowdy.We enjoyed the fact that because we were palace occupants, we had our choice of any of the eateries on the property, free of charge with the exception of 2.(ps. the steak house is a waist of time. and dont order the bisque at the seafood place...nasty! DO order the lobster DEEEEElisious! )we never had to fight for a seat at the bar. the ride from the airport was quick and smooth, check-in was quick. check out was quicker.The service was good and the people were friendly. My boyfriend loved the buffet, while i couldnt get enough of the lobster and vegetables at the seafood rest. we stayed in the 6000 buliding, the last buliding before the flea market. The beach outside of the buliding was nice and quiet. the room cleaning service was adequate. we had fresh clean towels and sheets everyday, and they restocked the mini bar (which is free at the palace). FYI for americans traveling with children.....( i direct this to americans because we dont see this at all on our beaches...i think it may be illegal?)This resort (like many in DR) is frequented by euro travelers who like to sunbathe topless Old, young, perky  saggy, you name it you will see it. Also you will get an eye full of speedos. While i was enjoying my lunch at the lovely buffet looking out at the beautiful scenery....i spied something that ive never seen before and would not like to see again. a man as old as my grandpa in man thongs with a hariry derriere. Needless to say my diet was back in full swing at that point..... Thanks who ever you are!

<Content>Totally Not a 5-star resort This is my first time writing a hotel review. I feel that I owe it to future travelers to let them know what they are getting at this resort, because the information on the hotel website is misleading and not completely accruate. First the good points - the beach is nice and the weather in Punta Cana is beautiful. The beach grill had good seafood.Now the bad points (need much more space for this)1. The rooms are run down and in great need of rennovation. There is mould throughout the bathrooms and ceilings.2. The food at this hotel is mediocre at best. The buffet is comprised of low quality, poorly prepared food. The one good restuarant on property (Chez Palace) is NOT part of the all inclusive. You have to pay $30 US pp to eat there, and although the food was good we didn't think that it was worth the money we spent. Plus at an all inclusive you don't expect to have to pay to eat at the restaurants.3. The alcohol was absolutely horrible - the wine was the worst we have ever tried, and the vodka and beer were not much better. 4. There were no waiters serving drinks around the pool or beach...it was all self-serve. Service was slow and not friendly.5. The servers did not speak hardly any English and the overall attitude was not service oriented. 6. The towels are worn out and in need of replacement.7. The TV's and phones do not work reliably in the rooms.8. The entertainment was poor and there was no disco on site. We were very disappointed with the quality, service and overall experience at this hotel and would not ever stay there again, nor would we recommend it to others. We have stayed at other 5-star resorts in the Dominican and would rate the Barcelo Palace as a 3-star at best.

<Content>Not feeling so well My husband, children and I have just returned and we have to see the doctor today. I don't know if it was the buffet (in an outside environment - cheeses were sweaty etc. - at one point we saw a bird helping itself to the buffet - god knows what it had left behind).......I'm hoping that it was because our bodies weren't used to the food...but diarehea, chills, dizziness have continued now for 4 days even though we have Canadian food back in our system. We spent 3 days fighting for the toilet ....thank god we had immodium for our airplane ride home... BRING IMMODIUM!!!!!!Other than that the resort was big and the gardens were beautiful...the beaches breathtaking.....but we most definately won't go back.

<Content>Great Place and great value We were at the Bavaro Palace from March 24 - 31 and have nothing but great things to say about it. The food was terrific, the staff courteous and knowledgeable just don't expect good service if you're going to be rude as we saw from quite a few people. The only complaint I would have was the music by the pool just about deafens you but if you grab a lawn chair away from the swim up bar it'll save your ears.The activity staff by the pool are quite entertaining and really get the gets involved in the action.We tried almost all the restaurants but the Mexican and Italian were by far our favourites and neither of us got sick.I would definitely go back to this hotel again.

<Content>A nice value vacation but manage your expectations The rating system is a little difficult when applied to the Palace. Some aspects would be considered 5 star, others 2 to 3. We were a group of 13, 2 families of 4, one of 3 and a couple with no kids. Kids ranged in age from 9 months to 7 years.The good stuff: the pool and beach are beautiful and the grounds are well maintained. Combined, the 5 hotels can hold 7,000 guests. There are 3,000 employees. An amazing ratio. The Palace is clean, clean, clean, but showing signs of age. The staff keeps your room very clean, but again the rooms are getting tired. We stayed in a suite, so that we could put our kids to sleep and have a place to socialize with our friends or just watch TV. The suites are very nice and have the best views. I read a review that said there are no channels in English. You can get 20 English channels for $20 for the week.The staff is very friendly. Using bad Spanish and tipping go a long way. I brought $100 on one dollar bills and tipped for everything. It is a small price to pay to get great service. We also generously tipped the general manager upon arrival. When we got to our room, it only had one bed, not the two requested. I called the GM and within 20 minutes a full queen side showed up with headboard, etc. He then personally called to see if our room had any other deficiencies that he could take care of.The food: hit or miss. 9 of the 12 people eating the food developed a GI problem at one time or another. That is a significant attrition rate, even for a third world country. Pack your medical kit accordingly. I did not eat anything that came out of a steamer tray. You can, however, get delicious food prepared for you ranging from lamb to fish to steaks. The rule of thumb is that if looks bad, or tastes bad, it probably is bad. Move onto something else. Consistency is also a problem. The lobster in the seafood restaurant ranged from inedible one night to very good another.Excursions: significant bus time is required for many of the excursions. The diving at Catalina was good, two hours each way, the four wheeler adventure was fun, a little over regulated and the equipment fairly beat up. Bus ride 1.5 hours each way. The horseback riding and spelunking adventure, very good excursion 鈥?bus ride 3 to 4 hours each way. Santa Domingo, 3 hours each way. The segway rides were at the hotel and a blast. The golf course was nice. Greens and fairways in good shape, sand traps like hitting off a parking lot. In short, there is very little outside the grounds of the hotel complex.The clientele is very diverse with Americans making up the minority. If topless sunbathing and bathing suites that the more conservative would consider inadequate bother you, then it could be problematic. We found the people we met to be gracious and interesting.In general, it was a very nice vacation, but I don鈥檛 know that I would go back to this hotel. There are many options in the competitive all inclusive market, and we like to try new places. A few tweaks could make the hotel truly wonderful.

<Content>Loved the Beach at the Palace This was our first visit to Punta Cana and our first experience with an all-inclusive vacation. Before our vacation, I was concerned about the wide range of reviews on this website. The facilities were upscale, beautiful pool and beach areas, Plenty of beach chairs available on the beach and even around the pool area most of the week. We arrived on Wednesday and it was not crowded at all until Saturday night. However, the size of the rooms and beds for a 5 star resort were disappointing.We found the service at the Palace to be very good, Upon arrival, we requested a rollaway bed and it was delivered promptly. The information desk personnel were very professional and helpful. I think that a smile and our attempts to speak Spanish were appreciated by the staff.I am glad we opted for the premium hotel and were able to dine at any of the restaurants on the premises giving us more choices for a sit down dinner rather than the buffets. The La Brisa was my favorite restaurant due to the service, location and atmosphere. The steakhouse restaurant was a disappointment - poor service and mediocre food. One difficulty we had was receiving coffee after dinner. The service at the restaurants at the Palace was noticeably better than the other resort properties.We enjoyed the ping-pong, giant chess, min-golf, tennis and golf as well as relaxing around the pool or on the beach.Best feature: BeachNeeds Improvement: Rooms

<Content>2nd time at the Palace better than the first My husband and I went to the Palace last year and had a rough time at the beginning of our trip due to the hotel being way overbooked - make sure there are no major conventions during your stay. Long story short, we pleaded our case when we got home and they gave us our trip over again this year (9 days!) and they treated us really well...delivering rum, fruit plates and flowers to our room. We're a married couple, early 30's from NY...not particularly demanding travelers but I expect the room to be immaculate after it has been cleaned.We've been to Mexico and the USVI and BVI and while the DR still has a long way to go in terms of reaching those standards of hospitality they are getting there. We speak a little Spanish which definitely helps - if you make an effort they WILL be nice to you. Leave a note with some singles for the maid/mini-bar guy they will totally take care of you. Our room was cleaned immediately every morning (no problems with mildew/mosquitoes or anything else) and the mini-bar was always overflowing. You can get basic phrases from a spanish dictionary...they will appreciate it.The beach/pool at the Palace are immaculate - they rake the beach every day! You don't have to fight for chairs and if you want to be left alone you can always find a quiet spot on the beach. The palm trees provide nice shade b/c the sun is deadly! Pack extra sunblock b/c the hotel shop charges a ton for it. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from and while it's not like home, you should always be able to find something basic to eat if nothing appeals to you. No problems with the food but we brushed our teeth with bottled water and avoided the salad as we figured it would be washed in tap water.They have a new thing this year where you can pay $20 for the week and get 30 English channels on the TV - it's worth it! Otherwise you are left with CNN and the Bible Network.Not a whole lot in terms of nightlife...the shows are pretty boring, but the casino can definitely keep you entertained a few nights. The last night they were showing Borat but not sure what language it was in.If you are expecting the Four Seasons this is not the place for you but it's clean, reasonable and the beach is spectacular. We had a great time - very relaxing which is just what we wanted. We are considering going back again next March. It rained the last day of our trip as we were on our way to the airport - other than that it was perfect weather!

<Content>Here's the real deal on the Palace... Want to make sense of the wide range of reviews of the Palace? Read on, for here's the real deal. The Barcelo Bavaro Palace is a slightly upscaled version of the many all inclusive resorts on DR and throughout the Caribbean. As an all inclusive that means: large buffets of mainly mediocre food, watered down drinks, basic caribbean service (meaning slow, especially at check in and check out). Second, the DR is a poor country. That means: watch your belongings, use the safe, bring some US $ for tips and other items. Third, the complex is spanish owned, and caters mainly to Europeans, not Americans, so don't expect staff to speak much English, don't expect super high-end rooms and facilities, etc. The good parts of the Bavaro Palace: the beach is spectacular (among the best in the Caribbean), and the Palace is situated on the best part of the beach, with many, many palm trees for shade, lots of chairs, gentle surf. This is by far the best feature of this property. The pool is also very nice, large and nicely laid out, also lots of chairs (you don't have to worry about getting up at 6 am to reserve your spot). The layout is fun for kids, and the swim-up bar is fun for grownups. They do not have a hot tub, though-just a bubbler in part of the pool. Also, the staff are friendly and helpful, especially if you smile, speak a little spanish, and give a US $ or 2 for tips. The grounds are well maintained and lush. The hotel and complex have a good security service. The shuttle tram to other properties is fun and works fine. The hotel in late March was fairly quiet, not full (may be good or bad, depending). They have some fun pool and water aerobics. The male staff like to flirt (also may be good or bad, depending). Beach hut massages are great and not expensive. The not-so-good parts: the rooms are not particularly luxurious, and the walls are paper thin. If you have a problem with your room, don't expect it to be fixed very quickly. The water is not drinkable, so expect to drink bottled water. The gof course is passable, nothing special. The special restaurants--aren't. If you get bored at the hotel, there are excursions, but most aren't worth the time and $. The shows, casino and other aspects of the resort are merely OK. A note on turista: It is easy to get sick from the food and water. We had several people in our group come down with GI problems. To reduce your risk: eat food freshly prepared (they have excellent grilled fish, steak, chicken, made to order omlettes, etc); avoid fruit, lettuce, mayo; eat dishes as they come out of the kitchen, not those sitting around for four hours. Don't eat the ice or let it melt much in your drink. (beer was popular with our group). Bring Pepto Bismol, Immodium, and Purel. Bottom line: The Palace (and Punta Cana) is a reasonable place to spend a week relaxing at the beach and pool. If your expectations match the reality, you can have a fine time at the Palace. If you want real luxury, go somewhere else (I jogged up the beach to the Paradisus, which looks much more upscale, but actually a bit out of place in the DR). If you want to do a lot of sightseeing and activities, think about going somewhere besides Punta Cana.

<Content>barcelo palace nightmare Our room on the ground floor was broken into while we were out having lunch. The safe inside the room with all our valuable including passports was pryed open with a crow bar this happened within the first 15 hours of our arrival. This faciliity is not safe, the management left us without any aid and for three day with only the 10 dollars we had left. We were on our own. With no ID we were unable to have money wired to us American Express Don't Leave Home With Out US, well forget about DR they considerate it a security risk. We are still being billed by these crooks for our stay they have refuse a refund and compensation. I have no doubt this crime was committed by a hotel staff member.

<Content>Great time...was worth the back pain! This was our first Carribean vacation as a family. We travel from February 17-24, 2007. Travel agent recommended the resort when we told her our price range and that we wanted golf included. Ended up being upgraded to the Palace due to an industry contact. Weather was great for four of our seven days. We called the good days Dominican Days. The beach and water were fantastic. Spent countless hours on the beach. Prefer it to the pool, but that was nice too. Really like the swim up bar.Our room was in block 2 and we over looked the beach...simply beautiful view. Had a king size bed in our room and the kids (17 and 21 yrs.) were next door in two doubles. If I slept on the ceramic tile floor I think it would have been softer. Beds were far too hard and I found myself waking in the middle of the night and ending up sleeping in the arm chair with foot rest. Back suffered badly as a result, but warm ocean help me recover.We tried all the eateries at the Palace but spent most meals at the main buffet. Wasn't too adventurous and stayed with known foods. Had a little diariah on the first couple of days, but it passed. Suffered from constant heartburn, but I am sure it had more to do with the rum. Food was good, but not outstanding.Avoid the gift shop in the lobby. Way too expensive!!!I found it rare to locate an outwardly friendly staff member other than our mini-bar attendant and maid, however, we were tipping them daily. Couldn't find a smiling waiter or waitress if my life depended on it. Their smiles seemed reserved to other staff and not guests. I felt like I was an necessary inconvenience to them and never felt like they were happy to have me as a guest in their hotel. Found one bartender (Henry) who actually showed a sense of humor and I tipped him a lot and he kept me drinks full.This poor attitude was visible even at the golf course. We played four rounds of golf during the week and I found the cost of the power carts to be excessive. Cost me $120 US each time we played. Good thing my green fees were included. I enjoyed the course but the condition was weak. We had fun though and that was the main thing.Of the four of us who took this trip, I am the only one who said he would go back to the Palace. Everyone else said they would try someplace else.

<Content>Had a Fab time Before our vacation I couldnt stop reading the reviews-which some were really bad, not so sure of our decision most of the group was worried. Party of eight, 29-46, we started at the Beach, but after 2 days we transfered to the Palace. Rooms were okay at the Beach, a little smaller than expected, but cleaned  serviced. We used preprinted Spanish requests for towels, soda, water with candies, gum  tips each day for the maid  the bar staff- fridge was overfilled. The waitstaff was very friendly, a little Spanish is helpful-please try to remember you are in a foreign country. The Beach resort is okay if you are 18-26 single, it felt alot like senior week or spring break, lots of young single european  lots of waiting at the bar for drinks. Beach was a 2-3 star resort.Once we transfered to the Palace, felt like a totally different place, larger rooms, bigger pool- with swim up bar. Only place we had slow service was at the paino bar. Food was amazing everywhere, again in a foreign country- stop expecting burgers  fries everywhere. The lobster was mushy  the bisque was more like a watery soup, other than that everything else was very good. Casino is an experience- pays out are really slow due to limited staffing. Its not Vegas, but it's fun. The beach is stunning-the sand was powdery, stark white against the clear warm water. Tons of watersports some included, others not worth the extra money, like the dolphin swim, your swim is 15 minutes but takes 2 hours to get out to the the tanks. See Jonathan to schedule your parasailing, scuba, scubadoo, or fishing expeditions, was really great to work with. Couple of things to pack:1. Fabreeze- rooms are musty due to the high humidity2. Extra sunblock  lotion, you'll need it3. beach towels-easier to find your chairs since all the resorts use the same color towels  loungers4. snacks for late night5. open mindGood luck and have a great time, we did.

<Content>Good Resort but bring some immodium The beach is beautiful. The pool and drinks were great. We had a great time but couldn't stray to far from a bathroom. The food made us both sick. Another couple we met were also sick.

<Content>Rained alot, but the hotel, staff and beach were all excellent My daughter and I stayed at the Palace during reading week. We were upgraded at the last minute from the Beach. We had a beautiful room, extremely clean although there was a bit of a musty smell, but not because it was dirty. The women keep it lovely and clean. The resort has 5 different hotels on the property that you have access to, at night there are security guards on duty at every corner who are very friendly. We went on the outback safari half day trip, booked with our Signature tour rep. What a great way to meet people, and see the villages. The tour guides were excellent, very knowledgeable about their country. If you are interested in buying rum or cigars, this is the place to do it. It's alot cheaper than in the hotel or at the beach shops. Very important, bring 45 sunscreen or you will get fried! You can buy sunscreen at the hotel if you don't mind paying $42US! It was somewhat cheaper at the beach pharmacy $20US. We went kayaking and played tennis a few times. The water is a gorgeous blue and about a mile out there's a huge reef, with giant waves that you can hear from your room at night, very soothing. We enjoyed the food in the Palace buffet, ate twice at the Steak house at the Beach Hotel but figured if the Palace is a 5 star we should stay there to eat, there was more selection at the Palace buffet as well. Dress at the restaurants is really whatever you like, just no bathing suits uncovered.Men must have shirts and pants.We went to the Tropicalissimo show at the casino but we were not impressed. We actually enjoyed the singers at the Palace much more and the dancers there were not bad; not broadway, but entertaining. For $3/15min you can access the internet in the hotel lobby. We only used the pool on the last day there, just to say we had. The beach is so beautiful and you can swim in a pool anywhere. Always lots of lounge chairs at the beach, never a problem finding one. We brought little gifts(stuffed animals, tennis balls, shoes, full pencil cases)and gave them to some children in the villages while on the safari. We gave the rest to the tourguides to distribute to people they knew. I had taken bugspray with us but never needed it. Service to and from the airport was excellent, desk service was fast and efficient. Try to get your picture taken by the photographer who has the little monkey. The pictures are posted in the lobby, cost $8US but are priceless!

<Content>Loved it! My group consisted of four single people in their 30's from Saskatchewan, Canada who stayed at the Palace from February 28th to March 1st and everyone absolutely loved it! We were originally booked in at the Barcelo Beach, but were upgraded to the Palace. The complex consists of five different hotels and the guests of the Palace could go anywhere (as opposed to the others who could come to our beach and pool, but could not drink or eat at our facilities). There is a train that runs from 8 or 9 in the morning to 4 a.m. and takes you all over the resort (however, it was easily walkable if you preferred that). The food was fantastic - especially the Seafood, Mexican and Italian restaurants. The latino disco (Las Canas) was much better than the other disco, which hardly played any latin music, although it did stay open later (5 am). We spent most of our time during the day at the Palace pool/ beach so can't really comment on the other hotels - although we heard the pool/beach at the Barcelo Beach was the place to go if you liked activities. I was surprised to read some poor reviews about the service - i found the service to be above average in each restaurant and bar that we went to. The only thing i noticed is that some of the bartendars are so busy that sometimes you don't realize that they have heard your order since they don't always acknowledge it, but they usually have heard you and will serve you as soon as they can. All the people in my group are definitely planning to go back to the Dominican (it was the first time for all of us, but we've been to several places in Mexico) and we would gladly go back to the Palace.

<Content>Over priced for what you get, would not recommend Started out with our room, it was full of mosquito's and smelled musty. The refrigerator was not stocked. There was no liquor or robes like the web site said. The location was good, close to the pool.  The food at the buffets you had to pick and choose carefully what was cooked and not cooked like the bacon and eggs were not cooked. I was sick for two days, I quess I did not pick and choose carefuly. And so were alot of other people. The sit down resturants were hit and miss, One night the steak house was good, went back the next night and it was bad. The golf coarse was in very bad shape the greens were awfull. Only golfed one day, not worth hauling the golf clubs. My son got hurt playing Valleyball. Try to get him help, but noone spoke english, we finally had to contact our MLT agent to get him crutches and a brace. Then our air conditioning stopped working in our room, it got very damp, the floors had condensation on them, hard to get around on crutches. Also due to this our cell phone, watch and mp3 player stopped working. Bottom line is we travel alot and I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Vicky's Group Super Time March 3, 2007 was the end of a wounderful vacation at the Bararo Palace. Traveled with a group of 18 and all had a great fun filled time. After reading many rewiews both pro and con, I was a little nervous about going to the resort. All my worries ended by the second day. The language barrier was a little hard at first, but learning a few Spanish words for the things (drinks,food,etc.) we wanted made life easier. The staff was wounderful, even thou they have their own pace. Management took care of most all our problems with little wait. Most of us stayed in Block 3. The rooms were nice and roomie and great views of the pool and gardens. After reading some horror stories about the restaurants and buffet. Found them all to be very good. Mexican was a blast, drinks and food were great. Service was just as good. Steak House was very good but the service was really slow. Palace buffet was super. Clean and good staffing. If you only like american coffee your in trouble. Found the coffee to be rough to tackle first thing in the AM. French Restaurant ok, but not worth the extra money to me. The sea food Rest. La Brisa was good. The all you can eat lobter is true. They were small (some very) lobsters cut in half and grilled. It was hit and miss some were way over cooked and others were perfest. Mine happen to be perfect and were very tasty. Smaller eatting spots were pretty good. Each to their own taste on them. I didn't travel to a all-inclusive resort for pizza and burgers. We didn't stray to far from the pool bar. Plenty of lounge chairs around the pool and on the beach. All the raves about the beach are on the money. The property itself was beautiful. Got to know the bartenders very well and they treated us great. Bring singles a tip is remembered and very appreiciated. The nightly shows were so so usual local talent and loud. The casino was the pits. Slots were old and in need of a major over haul. Table games were ok. Hand payouts were real slow and getting someone to take care of a problem with the slot was slower. They were getting ready to open a mini casino slots only at the Palace. They looked like new machines. The tram system for travel around the resort was excellent. This resort is huge.The largest I was ever at. There is just so much to do some free and some cost you. The goods out weighed the few bad 10 to 1 . We been to other all in-clusive in Jamacia (Sandals Whighthouse), Bahamas (Breezes 6 times) Aruba (Divi Divi) Plus Cruises. All in All Very Good Place and we would return. On closing this is a multi nationality resort and american's are a minority. It didn't hamper our vacation a bit. Found most vacationers to be friendly and helpfull.

<Content>Solid Trip I visited this resort with in a group of 4 university students on a graduation trip. We were initially booked in the Barcelo Bavaro Beach hotel, so the upgrade to a 5 star was welcome. When we arrived, we discovered that the Barcelo Resort is actually sectioned into 5 parts - Beach, Beach Caribe, Golf, Casino, and Palace. You can use any of the facilities in any of the resorts, except Palace. Palace people get exclusive restaurants and facilities. So, I guess parts of this review will encompass the whole Barcelo complex, because really you should know about it all before going. Note, the resort really is only 20 mins from the airport, so the quick transfer times are AMAZING. First off and most importantly, the food. I actually thought the food was above average for resorts that I have been to. The buffet was fairly standard, but there were special stations that always had something good - a pasta station, an asian food station, a mexican food station and a grill where they let you choose whatever beef, chicken, fish you want and they cook it in front of you to your liking. This was available for lunch and dinner. The resort complex overall has many a la carte restaurants - Dominican, Steak, Italian, Mexican, Grill, French (not inclusive) and Sea Food. We ate at the Dominican, Steak, Italian and Mexican. We could eat at so many since they do not use a reservation system. its first come, first served. Lines were never THAT long and they moved pretty fast. Each meal was pretty solid, although the Steakhouse undercooked each of my party's pieces of meat. Overall, the combination of buffet and lunch and then a la carte at dinner kept enough variety in the meals to keep me and my party happy.The facilities at the resort were good, especially in the Palace area. The beach all along is gorgeous white sand that is so fine grained. The water is lovely, clear and blue. I brought a snorkel (although the resort has them too) and I was able to see schools of fish while snorkeling. I am 6'2 and i was able to go on my tip toes all the way out into the water to the barrier for swimming. On the beach, there were always lounge chairs open. The beach volleyball, bocci, horseshoes etc were all good fun. The pool at the Palace is great too, although it was a little cold. It is large, free form and has a nice swim up bar with good service. The rooms at the Palace were nice, but maybe nothing too fancy. We had a ground floor room, with a nice little patio area. Our mini fridge was always stocked, and we placed a dollar in it to get more beers than normal. The Palace lobby bar has comfy chairs and a nice atmosphere. I thought it was definitely the nicest of the lobby bars in the complex. To get around the complex, there is a shuttle that comes around ever 20 mins or so. Its a good way to get to the Casino or Disco, which are pretty far from the Palace. The Palace lobby bar is also right beside the stage area. There was plenty of seating (all covered out of the rain) and the shows were excellent. Lots of great singing, dancing and humor. Hotel staff served drinks to the crowd throughout the show. Also, on a random note, I just remembered that the mini golf was a lot of good fun.We went on one excursion - a catamaran ride to Saona Island in the Carribean Sea. The catamaran was lovely and large, and teh staff keep your rum and coke filled all day. The island is gorgeous - sand and water like in the Corona commercials on tv. Then after a few hours on the beach, speed boats took us to a shallow spot in the sea waaaay off shore. It was waist deep, and you can just relax or if you have snorkeling gear, check out the wild life. I saw starfish, blowfish, random fish and a string ray. Very very cool stuff.So, I've been pretty positive so far and I guess thats because I had a great trip. Um, trying to think of some negative points.......I didn't really like the Disco. It was very crowded, men had to wear pants in the sweltering heat and there were long lines for drinks. To be honest, it felt just like any club here in Canada - certainly not something you need to go to Punta Cana for. Another negative would be that the water sports center is wayyyyy down at the other end of the beach from the Palace. So, to get a canoe, snorkel etc you had to walk some ways. Well, I've rambled on enough. Overall, the resort is solid and I would recommend it for sure.

<Content>A Great Time at the Palace Hotel My husband (fluent in Spanish) and I and our two sons aged 12 and 15 booked a vacation at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Hotel from Feb. 7-14. The day before we left, our travel agent informed us that we could have a free upgrade to the Palace Hotel, which we did. This was our first trip to a location of this nature so I am not able to compare it to anything similar, but I did tour Europe many years ago so I can compare the trip to something other than a vacation in North America. I believe this is where the problem lies in many reviews. People are comparing this third world country resort to a Hilton in the U.S. Having lived in Canada all my life I would have to say nothing compares to the food or standards of excellence of North America. I remember how happy I was to find a McDonald's in any European city that I visited. I am obviously not very adventurous in that regard. That said, I will give you an honest review of the Palace Hotel . RESORT - The complex is beautiful - lush greenery, well maintained, huge, very safe - well guarded. We saw more than one train transporting people at one time, but you never knew when they would come. Every 20 - 30 minutes would be my guess. They were certainly very safe. We checked out the disco one night. It's quite small and very much an early 20's crowd. The music was what you'd hear in North America. We do not golf or gamble so cannot comment on those things.ROOM - Our room on the main floor was always very clean, totally quiet, no bugs at all, supplies always provided. I would say it would be like a Super 8 or Days Inn type of hotel room in North America but larger. We informed someone that a lightbulb was burned out in the morning and by afternoon it was replaced. When we first arrived there was a definite musty smell but we didn't notice it much after that. My son who is allergic to dust and mold had absolutely no problems at all. Our TV remote control stopped working so we handed it in and never did get a replacement. Also the room had very dim lighting and no bathroom fan. To us these were minor annoyances and not something worth giving the hotel a negative review about or ruining our vacation. We found we never even needed all the drinks in the fridge because we were always outside. This hotel does have a more spacious, elegant look and feel to it as compared to the others. FOOD - My kids are among the fussiest eaters in the world but they never went hungry. The variety at the buffet was unbelievable. It was beautifully displayed and very gourmet looking. I, however, wouldn't eat most of it. People are at this resort from not just Canada and the U.S. but from Chile, Argentina, Italy - you name it. These people have a right to eat food that they are accustomed to as well. To say the food was bad is a very unfair judgement in my opinion. It was different. We enjoyed the stir-fries and pasta made to order, every kind of meat fried up for you ( my son loved the lamb), flambeed crepes with your choice of fruit, etc. There was enough personal choice in these things that you didn't have to try the weird looking foods. Breakfast included ham, bacon, quiche, pancakes, french toast, yogurt, muffins, oatmeal, dry cereal, fruit smoothies and omelettes or eggs made to order besides the many unique things tailored to a European taste. We tried the Steak House, Mexican, Italian, Dominican, and Seafood Restaurants and really didn't find much difference in quality from one to the other. The meals are more traditional - meat, rice, potato, or fries and vegetable. Again, do not expect North American quality but I think they really do try. We liked the calamari and lobster. My son found the pizza to be okay. The boys loved the fried chicken pieces at the Dominican Restaurant. The burgers and fries there were similar to what we are used to in North America. We never tried the hotdogs or sandwhiches. We always found everything to be clean and elegant looking. At the buffet the hot things were kept boiling hot and the cold things were kept well chilled. There are no reservations so we went early to avoid lineups and to make it to the evening entertainment on time. The service was slow in general but you're on vacation so why be in a hurry - just relax and don't stress if your drink doesn't come. Men did not require long pants, just shirts with sleeves. DRINKS - We are not big drinkers so cannot comment too much on the quality of drinks but whenever we ordered an alcoholic drink we got it. Our problem was that we sometimes got drinks with alcohol when we just asked for a coke or had specified no alcohol. We enjoyed the hot chocolate, espressos, and the popcorn available at the bar. ENTERTAINMENT - We really enjoyed the evening entertainment. Here again we are not comparing this to Vegas, but I would say the dancers were very energetic, enthusiastic, and skilled and the singers were very talented. The costumes looked great. The nights when there was audience participation were a lot of fun.INSECTS - Virtually no bugs at all although we felt the odd bite now and then. Never needed bug spray. No insects on the food even though almost every restaurant is open air.EXCURSIONS - We took the Jurassic Safari tour and the Caribbean Festival Cruise. I would absolutely recommend some kind of safari tour to see what life is really like for the Dominican people. You may end up complaining less. We had brought a bit of candy, hats, toys, baseball cards of Dominican players, etc. along on the safari and had lots of opportunity to give them away to children. They get lots of candy - probably not good if they don't have good dental care - but based on the surroundings I'd say these kids are certainly needy of anything you can give. They like hats which are light to pack but take up space that you can use on the way home for your souvenirs. Our guide even asked for one to give to his son so we also gave him a baseball jacket we had brought to give away. The cruise was great to go snorkeling and see underwater creatures - bring a disposable underwater camera along. I was very scared at first but one of the staff stayed with me the whole time which I really appreciated. Bring cash for tips and if you want to buy a DVD.ILLNESS AND MEDICATIONS - My younger son and I took Dukoral beforehand. I had one bout of diarrahea and a day of not having an appetite so I was very glad I had packed every medication under the sun. My husband also had a mild stomach upset one day. CHECK-IN, CHECK-OUT - Check-in went very quickly. We had a long stay from check-out to departure. We were allowed to enjoy the facility as though we were checked in and were given use of a room for a half hour prior to leaving in order to shower.BEACH AND POOLS - Both were great. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs for four at any time of day. There is a fair bit of toplessness, some thongs including on overweight old men.WEATHER - Excellent. Perfectly hot - not at all unbearable - with a slight breeze. Evenings would cool down slightly so that I would wear long pants and a sweater but the guys never changed out of shorts.ACTIVITIES - We thought there would be pedal boats or sailing or other such water activities but nothing for free. There was tennis and basketball as well as beach volleyball. There were group dance lessons beside the pool and water polo in the afternoon. The guys loved the water polo but their feet were scraped pretty badly by the pool floor.SHOPPING - I loved the selection. The market just past the Palace Hotel is the best place to get the cheapest stuff. There are boutique types of shops in the complex as well for those who don't like bartering. I couldn't believe how much variety there was at the market. There was clothing - shoes, bathing suits, wraps, t-shirts, hats; jewelry, cigars, rum, coffee, vanilla, beach bags, carved wooden items, paintings, and every kind of souvenir trinket you can imagine. The vendors may start off asking for $35 for an item but you can get it for $7. Don't feel bad - they won't sell you something if they think the price isn't right for them. You can often get something for way under 50%.SUMMARY - We all had a great time and we would recommend this place to others who have an open mind about not expecting excellence in every little thing. We were very happy with the cleanliness, safetly, beauty, and classiness of the place. In my opinion, this is not a place for drunken partiers or ratty t-shirts. We saw people of all ages. We spoke to some Americans who were very friendly, satisfied, and well travelled and they felt this was a great place. We would agree.

<Content>Big, BIg, BIG Mistake - Please go somewhere else! From Memphis, TN - USA - Stayed February 3 - 10, 2007.**Bottom-line 鈥?if you want to pay $1000鈥檚 for the view only 鈥?then go here 鈥?it is spectacular. That is the only thing they couldn鈥檛 mess up or lie about. The staff, service, food, amenities, rooms, etc..etc..etc.. HORRIBLE. In nutshell, the Barcelona Bavaro Resort puts a whole new meaning to the term 鈥渁ll-inclusive鈥?- this place is great if you do not need or ask for anything.I would have to write a novel in order to provide all the negatives for you of our experience at this place. Therefore, I will just touch on the highlights:*Room at check in was missing, a safe door, a remote to the TV, robes, shampoo's/lotions, lights did not work and no beer. The stocked mini-bar is as mini as you can get (two beers, two waters, a couple weird beverages 鈥?that is it 鈥?no liquor). After SEVERAL visits to the front desk and SEVERAL phone calls - our room issues were resolved around 11:30PM!!! *Restaurant and bar staff is un-attentive, disrespectful and unappreciative. We had to flag them down when we needed anything (i.e. coffee, water or any thing) and they acted as if we were a bother to them. By the way, tipping does NOT help...you are wasting your money. *Food 鈥?Blah鈥?The steak house didn't serve steak - go figure? The buffet food is very questionable 鈥?very bland. If you enjoy running eggs in the AM and raw bacon 鈥?this is for you! Dinner buffet is pretty much the same 鈥?no service, bland and undercooked food. The Italian restaurant served cold food and I got food poisoning from the pork at the Mexican restaurant. Hint鈥hen ordering at the restaurants 鈥?order several entrees at once (4 or 5) 鈥?you are bound to get one thing that is eatable.*Drinks - HORRIBLE would be putting it lightly. If you HAVE to go here - always ask for double liquor and make sure you ask for the specific type of liquor per drink. If not you will get rum. For example, if you ask for a martini - you will get a martini with rum (no vodka) and if you ask for a margarita - you will get a margarita with rum (no tequila). Red wine is NOT part of the all-inclusive, only some terrible white or blush wine. We had to find a local to go offsite to buy us bottled beer, red wine and real tequila. Also, do not expect friendly bartenders. *Resort transportation (the train). Mostly in the evening is when we had issues --there is only one train that runs about every 45 minutes (they advertise 10 to 20 minutes - NOT) and its way overcrowded and unsafe.*Amenities 鈥?I was especially looking forward to windsurfing 鈥?charge of $50 for lessons. Hobbie Cat 鈥?2 passenger only is included - $75 for 4 passenger 鈥?lessons $50. *Hotel Manager 鈥?Do not bother. She is obviously accustomed to her 鈥済uests鈥?complaining about the same things because she will yawn during your conversation (seriously) and choose to do nothing to resolve issues.*Transfers 鈥?the bus left our luggage at the hotel on the way to the airport. Even though we handed the driver our bags 鈥?they still were left. We waited for over an hour for our bags (which the hotel kept saying were on their way) 鈥?no bags. We finally demanded that our bags be put in a taxi and brought to the airport, the hotel would not pay for the taxi. *Cost 鈥?the cost to stay here is much, much higher than any other all-inclusive. PLEASE do not waste your money. Go somewhere else. If someone you know has stayed here 3+ years ago and said it was great 鈥?it was then. The management has changed 鈥?they are NOT the same. Please do not take this lightly. ***Many, many, many more!!!

<Content>Barcelo Bavaro Palace is worth the trip. Do not expect this to be an American resort; it's in a foreign country and at least 90% of the guests are not from the USA. That said, you can go and have a really great getaway. The beach is the most beautiful I've seen. Be prepared not to have much English spoken, and bring along your best Spanglish. Our room was lovely, the resort is very well maintained and has a large Spanish-speaking staff. The weakest area is the Front Desk, but once you've checked in, there's plenty to like. The food was definitely good. There are enough choices and dining options to keep you from getting bored. $1 tips at the bars get you extra attentive service. We only stayed 3 nights, so didn't even look into any excursions. We did take the trolley to a couple of the other hotels at the resort, and attended the Tropicalissimo show at the Casino, which was somewhat amateurish except for the dancing, which was excellent. We were the only Americans in an audience of about 200. Based on this experience, I would definitely consider staying at another Barcelo property.

<Content>In love at and with the Palace This was the first trip I took with my boyfriend Richard, and we had a fantastic time. We are both in our late 30's and went on vacation for sun/sea/r+r. He has been to other all inclusive resorts before in Mexico and Tahiti, this was my first experience at a resort. We both come from the west coast of Canada, and needed to escape for a week from the grey dull winter weather. We flew out of Vancouver (via SkyService-Avoid the plane food!!) early on Jan. 24th, with stop over in Calgary (only an hour) then direct to Punta Cana, arriving after sunset. From the Punta Cana airport we caught a cab to the Barcelo Resorts, and went to check into the Barcelo Beach as originally booked, but were told we had been upgraded and redirected to the Palace. A nice surprise! With suitcases in tow, and a quick train ride (the resort has a little train that guests can hop on and off of to get around the resort grounds) we made it over to the Palace. Check in there took only minutes, we had a friendly bellman take us up to our room-rm # 1099, top floor, back corner, only a short stroll from lobby, beach, and pool. The room was clean and fresh. And cool to walk into. Ceiling fan and airconditioning were welcomed. The room had everything you could need. The bathroom was split in two-bathtub/shower and toilet in small room off outer area with double sinks. A live orchid in a glass vase sat in the corner of the counter. Two queen size, comfortable bed. The balcony, at the opposite end of the room, had a table and chairs for two overlooking the tops of palm trees. The large patio door had black out curtains, making it easier to sleep in. I had the best night of sleep but better yet was waking up to paradise! Made coffee in the room and sat in awe of the views from the balcony that morning; it was like being in a dream. We discovered directly across from the balcony was a birds nest in the top of a palm. I watched them fly away and come back with bits of twigs, building their nest. The rest of our week was spent lounging in the sun, listening to the palm leaves in the breeze, strolling the length of the beach, people watching, chatting with other happy people, drinking strawberry margaritas and pina coladas, dining at the Caribe buffet for breakfast and lunch, and dinners at the various restaurants at the resort; Mexican, Steakhouse and Seafood restaurants each served great meals. Food Favourites: Roasted chicken, Calamari, ripe fruit at the buffet, Lobster at the Seafood restaurant, and the Tequilla shrimp, salsa and chips, and guacamole at Mexican restaurant!!! Delicious. We swam in the ocean daily and found that the water at the far end (towards long point) was the warment to swim in, and is a great, quiet area to get away and feel alone. It is also at this end of the beach where you'll find tiny beautiful seashells. So, anything worth mentioning that bothered us about the resort :*Cashing travelers cheques at the front desk will cost you. A substantial fee of $7 to cash $40. ( It will make things easier on you if you bring American currency or pick up Dominican currency-there is no back machine.) *In our room, we received 3 wrong number calls, once waking us up, must have phone problems, we just unplugged ours to avoid anymore. Good to know:Pack bug spray (mosquitos come out after the sun goes down), suntan lotion, and after sun aloe gel. All cost a fortune at the gift stores there. Pack any medicines, etc. Also very expensive.***Also, good to know, especially if you are flying out of Punta Cana late afternoon/evening; for a fee ($35) you can change your check out time to later in the day, so you can enjoy the beach and swim, go back to your room and shower, then check out. Check out time is regularily noon. ( I saw a couple who had to kill the afternoon on the beach with their carry-on bags.)Finally, I would go back in a heartbeat. It is the most beautiful place to see. The sandy beaches and clear, warm sea water, with blue, blue skies- I couldn't get enough of.Enjoy Punta Cana. Leave your worries at home. Make the most of your time there, it goes too quickly. And take lots of photos!! (If I can, I'll come back to this post and add in some of our pics soon)

<Content>The Good and Bad of the Bavaro Palace We stayed at the Bavaro Palace the 23-25 of January. My parents are living in Santo Domingo and go to Punta Cana when they can. I had read many reviews and was quite worried about the hotel - but my parents had stayed at the Bavaro Beach before and so I was not worried. Here's the positive about our trip:First of all we had our reservations at Bavaro Beach, and they overbooked, so they upgraded us to the Palace. The people were all very helpful and friendly. As most people say a tip helps - $1 to $2 is adequite. The rooms although musty smelling were clean. Sorry folks you're in high humidity on the beach, things are going to get musty smelling - no matter where you are. The beds were alittle hard, but with very clean sheets and a fun day, sleeping was not a problem. Our refrigerator was stocked everyday and our room kept clean. The food was average, but I've stayed at other resorts around the world and buffets are what they are - average. We always found good things to eat and they pasta bar and omelete bar were great. We ate at the Mexican food restaurant, and the steakhouse, both also good. The beach is very beautiful and clean, lots of seaweed though, not sure if it was the time of year or just our beach area. No vendors to bother you, but there was a shopping area just outside the hotel area, with great deals but very persistent vendors. Not sure on the quality of the drinks, as we do not drink, but the virgin Pina Colada's were great. We didn't go on any excursions, since we were only there 2 days. But I highly recommend getting out and seeing the countryside and the lifestyle of most of the dominican people, it will certainly make you appreciate where you live. But even though most of the people live in poverty, they are such a happy people, and so kind.Now for the negatives: We arrived early, so they checked us in and gave us our armbands and told us to come back at 3:00 p.m. to check into our rooms - not - we finally were able to get into one of our rooms at 4:30 p.m. and the other room by 5:30. We noticed at the time we checked in that their were two reservations for us under each of our parents names. Back in December my mother had cancelled one of the reservations and let her travel agent book our reservations, which were then prepaid. The girls checking us in looked confused so we asked if there was any problems and they said no, so we didn't give it another thought, until we found ourselves locked out of our rooms the 2nd night. When we went to the desk to find out if our keys weren't working they explained to us that we needed to pay for our rooms. We had our receipt showing we paid through Omni Tours, but they said that because we had first booked through their call center that those reservations were not cancellable - even though we had a cancellation number, and that we would need to get our money back from Omni Tours. Beware if this happens to you, as it was quite the nightmare - trying to explain to these people that we had cancelled, they kept saying you can't cancel reservations made through the call center! Anyway - we finally were able to secure a refund through Omni Tours - which I would highly recommend using, as they were quite fair and honest and had a refund in 2 days. Sadly this mess completely ruined our great time, and we would probably never stay at a Barcelo hotel again.Just beware when you give the hotel a credit card for incidentials that if they have a problem like they did with us - that they will charge your card and tell you later!!! Don't stay away from Punta Cana or the Dominican Republic it is a beautiful place with Beautiful people!

<Content>loved it! When i read the previous reviews, I have to admit that I wanted to cancel the trip. I felt that i had made a mistake by booking this trip. But I decided to go anyways and quite frankly, i loved it. It was the best experience of my life. I am not really sure what people want when they go to a resort, i mean, if what you want is a waiter that it's standing in the sun inside the beach while you you are in it, with drinkswaiting at your every command, then my friend you are wrong, what you need is a servant! I mean, it is all inclusive, you have several places that you can go to grab a bite! The drinks, well, if you go there to drink only then go to a bar in your town and save yourself all that money and other expenses. This is a place to have a romantic getaway or to relax. I mean, the beach it's the cleanest and most beautiful beach that you have ever seen. There it's even a bar inside the swimming pool. I don't know why people are so picky and say so many negative things. I have traveled a lot, and still i loved this place. The people are nice, and sincere, but even if they were not, i hope that people do not go there to make a best friend, you go there to enjoy and that can be done. People speak English, most of them, and i had a great time. I went with my husband of three years to our second honeymoon, it was great. The room was very romantic, with view to the beach and the buffets and restaurants were good too. I mean, everyone has a different taste, but no less than 4 stars i will give to this hotel. If you want inmmediate attention when you go there, and people after you all the time to clean after you and to serve you 24/7 then i don't recommend it!

<Content>Loved the Palace We were in a group of 12 and we all said we would go back. The people are so friendly and if you are nice to them they will give back much more. We were there Jan. 13-20th. and it rained in the middle of the night once. It was 85-90 and sunny every day. I am a picky eater and I enjoyed the food. The buffet had so much to pick from that it took us awhile to choose. We did eat at the little hut on the beach most lunches. My husband loved the lamb chops and steaks. Even the cooks were friendly.Our rooms were very nice and clean. We loved the double bathroom sinks. With 6 couples we were afraid we would not be together but we were all pretty much in a row. One of the girls and I had a massage on the beach and I highly recommend it. It was fantastic and only $25 for 1/2 hour.I feel bad for the people that wouldn't recommend this hotel and had a bad experience. We would go back again next week if we could.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay! Went with my wife end of March/06 for 1 week. Had awesome time.Beautiful beach, nice room, no problem with the food, room cleaned every day, fridge filled every day, great weather, golfed 3x, golf course wasn't in best shape but was still alot of fun. Lots of cold beers and was the first course I played with wild chickens running around. Had a great time. Called down to Pro shop and they sent a golf cart to room to pick us up. Stored our clubs @ the course and they even cleaned them after each round! Can't complain. Very relaxing. Thinking of going back this spring......

<Content>Why complain its a vacation! OK, first of all I found this site to be helpful and totally off base on some of the comments. Seems to me when people go on vacation they think that it should be just like home but with a million servants doing whatever you want. I had a great time this past week. Something to keep in mind is that it isn't like home. The food is different, the weather is different, and the people are different. People are right, I found the food to be not really anything that I would crave, but could always find something to make sure that I didn't starve. If you want food like you have at home then.... you get my drift. The overall atmosphere of the resort I felt was great! It was clean and the staff was excellent. Hint... A tip for the maid or wait staff can get you a long ways! I am talking $1/day. Put yourself in their shoes, when someone gives me a tip I seem to go above and beyond my normal job/personality to impress. A tip is not necessary as I felt they did an excellent job anyways but it doesn't hurt.The drinks were different, but by mid-trip I found my drink of choice. With the fresh sqeezed orange juice and a shot of vodka I was loving every minute of it.The beach was gorgeous and not full of people that are bothering you all day to buy trinkets to take home to your family. I went with a group of 10 and we did the snorkeling booze cruise excusion. VERY FUN! We ended up being the only people on the cruise. We snorkeled which included swimming with the sharks. After that we enjoyed drinks and fun, and one awesome seafood dinner. It was just excellent. It was only a 5 hour excursion but well worth it. We even had our own personal video guy that took footage of our whole trip. $35 for the DVD is a small price to pay for memories on tape that will last for ever.Staying at the Palace was an excellent choice for our group as it gave us access to all food and drinks, and some activites at all the resorts in the complex. My husband really enjoyed the golfing, for me the free mini golf was great. At night we hit the casino and then off to the disco. Something for everyone in our group!Maybe I just love going on vacations too much, but I love to try different things as that is part of the overall thought of getting away for me.

<Author>lovetotravel-TRIP
<Content>Good vacation I stayed at this hotel December 4 to December 8, 2006. It was my first time at this hotel, and second time in Punta Cana. I have travelled to other areas of the country.I am a woman, late 40's, and travelled solo.Upon arrival, I was the only person checking-in, and the agent that assisted me appeared pleasant. However, this area was very disorganized. The agent ran from one place to another, to pick up phones, etc., while trying to assist me, although there were other employees in that area. The room was large and clean. However, they had two very old, dingy bath robes hanging in the closet. Who in their right mind would where that? Just seeing it was a major turn off.The hotel ground, pool and beach were very nice.At the time of my visit the guests staying at the hotel were from Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Italy, and other countries.I had all my meals at the Buffet Restaurant. The first evening, the food was varied, but not all tasty or well-cooked. The second day there were many flies flying over the food during lunch time in the buffet, and that was a turn-off.However, the following days, I enjoyed eating a variety of good Dominican food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There were also International food. The desserts were also varied, and vey tasty, and they seemed to have brought the fly situation under control, as I did not see them again for the rest of my stay.Drinks served were also very good. I drank beer, and a variety of cocktails.I never got sick from eating the food or from the drinks, and did not hear of anyone else getting sick.In terms of the employees I observed that a few were pleasant and eager to serve, and there were another few that were not at all friendly, and outright rude. The latter surprised me, as that is not typical of most dominican people, especially those working in resorts. And it had nothing to do with a language barrier, as I speak Spanish. It was very obvious to me that those employees were very much lacking in experience, education, social and customer service skill and proper training.I also observed a situation one evening in the theater area that I found very disturbing. Two young boys sat alone at a table in front of me, one claimed to be 18 years of age, and said that his brother was four years younger than him (14). Those two boys were served alcohol by more than one waitress.The first waitress questioned the boy about his age when he ordered a Cuba Libre, and appeared not to believe him when he said that he was 18. However, she casually mentioned to me that people started drinking alcohol at an early age in D.R., and served him the drink. What followed disturbed me even more, the boy ordered another Cuba Libre, one for him, and another for his brother (the 14 year old), and the Waitress at first reacted, as if are you kidding me, but served both boys the drinks. I then informed her that this was not appropriate, and that the resort would be responsible, and she responded by stating that she went light with the alcohol. In summary, I saw alcohol served to those two boys on three occasions by more than one waitress.AGAIN, PROPER TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES, APPEAR TO BE LACKING HERE. The parents of those boys, joined them later on, and I overheard the oldest tell the parent that he only had one drink. This situation was observed with surprise, by other guests, sitting nearby. I think that this is a situation that the resort needs to remedy right away.I was able to catch one of the shows at the resort, and the performance was in English and Spanish, and good. I went to see the Tropicalisimo Show at the Casino, and was dissapointed to see that it was the same performers that performed at the resort, and that they started the show as if a tribute to Celia Cruz and/or Cuba, and it was not until the latter part that they brought on Dominican music. I have nothing against Cubans, but if I want to see something like that, I would go to Miami. When I go to D.R., I want to see a show typical of the country, as you would see when you go to any other country.Aside, from the above mentioned flaws, I can honestly say that I for the most part enjoyed my stay at the resort, and it appeared to me that the other guests were also enjoying themselves.Aside from the situation with the minors mentioned above, I did not observe any other inappropriate behavior on the parts of the other guests. Other guests were behaving very civilized during my stay.I would not go back to this resort, because I like to try new ones.P.S. massages at the beach $25 for 1/2 hour, $45 for an hour. I tried one, and was very pleased. Recommended.

<Content>Just OK. Not going back We took a Mother and Daughter trip in October 06' to Punta Cana and stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. There were a total of 7 of us. The view of the beach is awesome. The colors are unlike any I have seen before. The hotel and staff seemed very nice and were very helpful. They work hard and for a lot of hours. Other than that, nothing else to brag about. The bar by the pool had this smell all week that made all of us sick to our stomach. Kinda like someone broke a bottle of something sweet and didn't clean it up for a really long time. There are fleas in the beach sand so look out. I had to stay by the pool for most of the week. My bites took well over 1 month to heal. They actually left scars on my legs/arms. The food sucked!!!! By the last 2 days I was eating nothing but veggies. I couldn't wait to come home and have some normal food. We stayed at the Palace so we had the luxury of being able to try all of the resorts. All of the food was nasty. The buffet at the Casino made all of us sick with some kind of stomach bug. Don't eat the deviled eggs. The mexican restaurant at the Beach was really gross. We did win some money at the Casino however :0) There is not much to do while in Punta Cana. Our Apple Vacations rep told us not to do any of the excursions that were not offered by Apple as some visitors in the past had gotten hurt from inexperienced operatiors. Kinda scary. The resort grounds are nice but once you get off the resort grounds it's a totally different story. They plow their garbage on the streets like we would plow snow. I am happy that I went for the experience but I am never going back.

<Content>So Much Fun! We got upgraded to the Palace, and it was the best vacation ever! If you are in college and looking for a good time, go here! The alcohol is kinda nasty, but we didn't care, it got us drunk. The food was not the best, but there were so many different things that you can definitely find something. The beach was gorgeous and the pools were awesome. The rooms were great. We usually started drinking at our closest bar and then would maybe hit up our little disco at the Palace. Then we we would venture out to the other bars at the other hotels. The main disco was amazing especially if you are sufficiently drunk. They play loud music and they have ladies dancing on poles. It is sometimes hard to getr a drink, but you will eventually. EVERYONE goes to that disco, and you are pretty much guaranteed to get lucky because everyone is so blackout. One thing that kinda sucked was the booze cruise. Granted we were hungover from the night before, but we had to take this awful bus ride that was like 1 hour and then a boat ride that was like 1 hours again to finally get teh booze. The catamaran does note ven come until the way back. If you are not hungover and the weather is nice, go on this, but otherwise it was kinda ridiculous. The little island was pretty though where we went. GOOOOO HERRRRRRRE AND HAVE A BLAST AND GET VERYVERY DRUNK AND MAYBE INAPPROPRIATE!

<Content>extremely disappointing we have stayed in punta can three times at three different resorts and this by far was the worstwe liked the area enough that we recommended it to our son who went with my nephew and their girlfriends and they greatly enjoyed itso imagine our surprise when my son decided to get married on the beach at the palace and we were treated like we were bothering the staff my son and his bride were given great rooms for the cock fights (or whatever) in the back of the hotelthe staff acted as if we were bothering them and it seemed that tips were expectedwe experinced none of this at the other resorts (Secrets and the caribe princess)the apple rep was good the one time we met him AND the kicker is there is no place to bring these deficiencies to Apple's attentionfinally, we won't be back to the DR and we will probably not use Apple again

<Content>Paradise at the Palace We just got back from 7 exquisite days at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. Where do I begin? First, let me say that the beach was breathtaking, really, I was not prepared for anything of such beauty. It was so difficult for us to leave it behind. We know beaches as we live in a coastal resort area....this one is absolutely spectacular in every way. The sand is so fine, there are no rocks and the beach is swept clean each morning by the fine workers who are courteous, friendly and efficient. The room was fine, very clean. I wasn't crazy about the room I was initially given so I asked for a different room and was given a lovely oceanfront room with no problem. These people are unbelievable. The food was acceptable. I did not go on vacation to eat, I went to enjoy myself on the beach and I did. There is plenty to eat, lots of fresh fruit and such and that is fine with me. It is clear that they do not have the same refridgeration standard that we have but I ate meat each day and never got sick. Some of the people on our plane did get sick. I think you have to watch what you eat and use common sense. Also I think people drink too much and mix drinks because it is free and they contributes to their nausea/diarrea. The drinks are so strong you have to tell them to lighten up on them. The hobie cat was fun and it is free. The sights are beautiful except when you ride from the airport to the hotel. It is very clear that these people are simply trying to survive. It was shocking to me. In spite of this, they are the kindest, friendliest people I have ever met. They loved us and we loved them! At every opportunity they will try to help you any way they can, and not just in situations where tipping is a possibility. They are truly kind people. The shopping center outside the resort on the beach is fun also. Just remember you can drop 75% off at least of what they want to charge you and you will do great on some decent silver jewelry and T shirts. The only negative thing I could say is that we don't speak any spanish, which is not their fault, but it was difficult because everyone who works there doesn't speak english. There were several people who did, enough that we could communicate with them any problems we would have had. But I enjoyed the maids. They were some very lovely women; hardworking and pleasant. We left them a couple of dollars each day and some chocolate and they made swans out of towels and put fresh flowers on our bed. The hotel is all inclusive but it is clear that a couple of dollars is a big help to these people and they certainly deserve it and more. It is a far cry from the service you get in the states. When we ate, we left a couple of bucks for good service and it was appreciated. Also, the other tourists were mostly foreigners from Germany and Cuba and Spain, I think. They also spoke spanish and didn't seem to be so kind to the workers. These workers work from morning to night 7 days a week in shoes that don't fit and never complain. They are always very pleasant. If you go, count your blessings and have a wonderful time because it will be over too soon!

<Content>Excellent for sun soaking, but that's it! Barcelo Bavaro Palace Hotel is located on a beautiful beach and has a really nice pool. The hotel itself is also nice and clean. But, if you want to do more than enjoy the sun and the all inclusive drinks, you may want to think twice before staying here. The food was not good, not to mention that everyone in our party got the Dominican trots (if you know what I mean). There is very little shopping to be done. The casino is a far cry from the casinos of Las Vegas, or even Western New York for that matter. Golf may be all inclusive but if you want a cart it is $30/person extra and the course is in rough shape. And overall, if you have little patience for communicating with people that hardly speak any English, this is definately not the place for you.

<Content>Another Great Trip to the Palace First off this was our third time to the Palace all were in October. We were there in October 2002 and 2003. This trip was October 14 -21.Check in: We got there at 2:15 pm, had to wait till 3 pm to get our room. We had requested a specific room number that we had on our prior visits. We got the room requested.Room: The room was fine nothing fancy. It had just been repainted. The phone didn't work, we left a note and it was fixed. The beds are a little hard, but we slept very well after a long day on the beach. Mini fridge always full of beer and water. Air conditioned worked well for us.Beach: Just GREAT, white sand, palm trees and more palm treess, plenty of chairs, very little waves.Weather: Had some rain, more this week than in the past. Rained almost all day Monday, made the most of it (went shopping and etc.). The other times it rained, it would rain 10 to 15 minutes and it would pass. Plenty of sun otherwise, we got got good tans.Food: Plenty of food to be had in every part of the resort from the buffets to the specialty restaurants. Nothing super fancy or great, plenty of selections. Our favorite place is the La Pina Grill at the far end of the resort by the straw market. You can eat with your swim suits on and feet in the sand. Wilson, one of the cooks and all of the employees at the grill are very nice.Resort: It is just huge, the tram will take you all over the place. Casino was fun, won a little money. Tried out 4 out of 5 pools, 1 was closed (Caribe - remodeling).Comments: We snorkeled off the beach, saw a few fish, eels, lobsters and a ton of star fish. Straw market is fun to deal with the shop owners (it is at the far end of the resort). Went on glass bottom boat/snorkel cruise, deep sea fishing and para-sailing by the straw market, we felt like they gave us a better deal than you can get on the resort. The beach is great for long walks. You can e-mail from the lobby $3 for 15 minutes on the internet. Take your lotions, chap stick and etc, you can get them in the gift shop but, it is costly.Closing Comments: We love this place, we would return again and again. Some people complain alot. We have traveled throughout the Carribean. We always go in with open minds. We expect a few bumps here and there. We don't know much spanish, but we try speak a little spanish the employees and they seem to try to communicate back with you.

<Content>Awful Awful Awful!!! This was the worst vacation ever. The food was terrible the service was something that needs improvement. The only positive thing was the beach was wonderful and the pool was nice. This would be a vacation to go on if you want to get sick from the food and be treated as though you were a second class citizen.My husband and I spent eight nights at this resort wanting to go home. We will not be returning to Punta Cana any time soon that is we may never go back because it was that awful....

<Content>Great Place-People-Price Wow.. We were at the Palace from Sept.24-30th. and I wouldn't complain about a thing.I was worried about the weather...HURRICANE SEASON It couldn't have been more beautiful. I will definetly come back this time of year. The weather was sunny, hot, not overly humid and just the perfect ocean breeze. Just fabulous. Not a drop of rain during any day we were there.The resort. We love it. It was our second trip in 16 months and it was great both times. Not a thing to complain about. The staff are courteous and helpful. Some are more friendly then others, but tell me where that isn't the norm...We ate well, all the restaurants were great, the SteakHouse, The Mexican Restaurant, The buffett, La Brisis-Seafood, and our favorite for lunch..La Pina. Barefoot in the sand, pick and cook to order, fresh seafood, burgers, porkchops and more.Rooms in building #6 were large, well kept, looked a little newer. Housekeeping does a great job, with the mini bar stocked to order. The staff will try to accomadate you any way they can.There are definetly few Americans there, we speak no Spanish and have no trouble communicating. They enjoy our attemps at their lanquage. We have stayed at other more expensive resorts in the DR..and yes, maybe they were a little fancier. But, we love this place especially for the price.Everyone has different standards, and what they expect. We always have a great time and think if you understand traveling out of the USA is a little different, you should enjoy yourself.Eveyone just moves at a much slower pace, but, after all....Isn't that why we go on vacation?Ready to go again. Can't wait to get back to the DR.

<Content>Second time in Palace Yes we had a great time at the palace, was ore seconde time.You will finde a quiet resort this time of the year (was same last year in Sept.)At the beach you will have for each 20 seats, same at the pool site.Between 2 and 16 Sept. we had 30 minuts rain on the beach and 30 minutes during one excursion.Food: very good lots off choice on the buffet, and there are more places toe eat tryout La Pina on the beach.Service: we hade a problem with safe, went to PR. and problem was solved in 15 minutes.PR. sits in reception area she is dressed in red, easy to find.Room: ask for block 5 or 6 the are very quiet, newer and close to the beach.If you miss a towel or whatever in the room ask the cleaning lady you find them whole day working in your block.Mini bar filled every day.Cleaning room鈥?.I give 8/10.Beach鈥? You want belief what you are seeing, and very clean, water is warm if there is not to much wind, bring snorkel whit you.Getting sick:I know you can get sick from tap water.If you get sick of the food it das not mean that the food is bad, it means that your stomach or intestines are not used to the food at your vacation country. People do eat things on vacation that the not eat at home becors the want to try it, and mostly the eat to much of it.Same problem with drinks I never have coconut at home , in DC we drink gallons of it together with other drinks.Think also about the ice cubes, the fruit ,snack, the temperature, climate etcetera......My wife is sick every year for 2 or 3 days wherever we go on vacation,she has week intestines. So don鈥檛 blame always your hotel.Of course if the hotel serves only tomato with sprout and you have to eat it for 2 weeks you will get sick.My advice, eat everything the serve but eat or drink not too much and do not get stressed, stress works on your stomach.Don鈥檛 mind my writing errors, English is not my mother tongue (its Dutch)

<Content>I don't understand the negative reveiws I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace back in January with a group of about 12 people, ranging in age from 23-55. I have traveled to many Carribean resorts, and had been to Punta Cana before (different resort). Because we travel with a large group we always stay at places that are all-inclusive so I have a good deal of experience with these types of resorts. We are thinking about going back this January because we liked it so much, and that's when I ran across all the negative reveiws! I had to write a review of my own because I don't know what these people are talking about! This is a beautiful resort, with an absolutely perfect beach, and plenty of options for food! Yes, it is no five star resort, but no affordable all-inclusive ever is. That's why it's so affordable! If you don't go into the experience with unrealistic expectations, then you will have a great vacation. The staff- In a resort of this size, you are bound to run into an employee or two that isn't all sunshine and happiness. Let me let you in on a little service industry secrect....if you treat them with kindness, chances are they will reciprocate. And TIP for gosh sake! A dollar or two here or there will get you much faster service, I assure you. Also keep in mind that these people often work for weeks without a day off, and many of those shifts start at 6 in the morning and go until midnight or later! Everyone in my group found most of the staff to be pleasant and helpful, and we didn't feel as though not speaking spanish was a problem. The food- Yes, some of the food is repetitive, especially at the buffets. But with over 10 restaurants to choose from you are bound to find something you like. We had quite a few delicious meals! I definately recommond the beach grill restaurant for lunch. You can sit with your toes in the sand while eating a piece of steak or fish that was cooked right in front of you.The beach- PARADISE. Enough said. And it's large enough that no matter how many people there are at the resort you never feel like you're right on top of each other. Oh, and if you have snorkeling gear, bring it! It's no reef, but you can go out waist deep and see a decent amount of fish. We even saw a manta ray just on the border of the swimming area!The pools- clean and very nice. The pool at the Palace resort is a little more laid back and quiet, while the Beach pool always seemed to have something going on. We spent most of our time on the beach but in the late afternoon it was always nice to cool down at the pool bar with a drink. Be warned- around 4 or 5 o'clock they send out the activities coordinators to entertain people by organizing poolside basketball games or water polo. If you are drunk (or bored) this can be quite amusing, but if you're just looking to relax some more I suggest moving to the other side of the pool!The trolley- it comes every 15 minutes and is very easy to use. I highly recommend exploring the whole complex on your first day so you can figure out where all the restaurants are and see what each of the resorts has to offer. If you're looking for something to do after dinner and you don't feel like going to a show or the disco, the Beach resort has pool tables in thier front bar. I would definately return to this resort. Everyone in our group had a great time and I'm very glad we didn't let the negative reviews turn us away. If you've already booked your trip, rest easy! It's not as bad as they say!

<Content>The worst service I've ever had. If you are a non-hispanic white American, don't even waste your time. The people are the most rude, obnoxious, miserable, inconsiderate, and lazy people I've ever encountered. If you were from their part of the world, they would break a smile (barely), but non-hispanic Americans had no chance. Check-in was a nightmare. I was promised 2 rooms next to each other. One was ready and one wasn't. Not a problem until they gave the second room away and told me my kids would be elsewhere on the compound. When I made an issue about it, they looked at me like a troublemaker. So.... I started to tell people as they were checking in and waiting in a 4 hour line what they were doing to me and finaly a manager came to help me, but not willingly. Also, the food was horrible, with flies and birds sharing your meals. The rooms smelled of rancid beer. The A/C barely worked. Go to Jamaica instead!!!

<Content>Go Somewhere else Attended a conference, in Punta Cana, that was held at Barcelo Bavaro Resorts. (So I didn't have a choice) We stayed at the Palace while others were bumped to the Beach or Caribe. This made it difficult mingle and network with other conference attendees. The Convention Center was comfortable.As for our stay at the Palace.... I did not experience the problems with checking in as other people have. The room was clean but had a mildew smell. It did take a long time to get the rooms made up.The beach was great and clean, as was the pool area. Never a problem getting a lounge chair. This was the highlight of our stay but is not enough to make us want to return. The service was the worst I have seen on any vacation I have ever been on. The staff was slow, unfriendly and downright rude. There was actually a meal where the wait staff argued about taking our order (and not in a good way, neither wanted to do it). I attempted to speak basic Spanish, but that didn't help, It appeared that if you didn't speak fluent Spanish they wanted nothing to do with you. My girlfriend was the only person at a bar and was ignored, then a Spanish speaking patron arrived and was served promtly and then my girlfriend recieved the customary rude service.Food was better than I expected for an all inclusive resort. But the slow service and the flies made for unenjoyable meals.Had one experience with the tram, enough said.If you like air conditioning this not the place to be. The only air conditioned area are the guest rooms. All resturants and bars are open air.Our trip was not totally unenjoyable and we did have some good dining experiences and staff service but not enough to return or recommend to others.

<Content>Extremely Disappointed My husband and I with a group of 16 others stayed at the Bavara Barcelo Palace from July 11 -16, 2006. I have to say this was the worst vacation we have ever taken! Aalthough the beach was nice, it was not enough to make it worth the trip. The staff were extremely rude to us when they found we could not speak Spanish. The food was at most semi-edible. There was not one meal that we could rave about. When we checked into our rooms after hiking across the complex amongst dirty smelling water on the sidewalks and insects we found our room to be filled with mold and an odor even a skunk could not stand! We changed rooms, not much better, but we wiped the whole room down. While sleeping we were eaten by insects. The buffet was filled with flies on the food and birds flying and landing on food stands and tables. The train that took you from hotel to hotel was horrendous. The pushing and shoving was horrible. I have seen a herd of cattle behave better than these people. Most of our group suffered from some sort of stomach or intestinal problems throughout the week and continue 4 days after returning home. I also brought an eye infection home and my opthamologist told me I was not the first patient she treated with this infection that went to Punta Cana. The people at the resort were so rude, dropping their trash wherever they wished. The nightly shows were a joke, they consisted of the staff from the hotel trying to be funny or sing and dance stars. It does not work. I truly would discourage anyone from going to Punta Cana for any amount of time.

<Content>Stay away! This place was a total dump. The food was awful, it was overcrowded and it rained while we were there. Many members of our group were ill from food poisoning. The people who cleaned the rooms were very nice, but that was the highlight of the trip.

<Content>The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth It was very helpful to read all of the reviews before I left. I learned and prepared for our trip based on everyone's comments. I went from June 27 -July 3 with my husband and 2 kids. I brought one suitcase with all the necessities: My own water 10 (1 liter bottles), mosquito spray, calamine lotion, Fabreeze, Lysol, Raid and Immodium. I was prepared. My family never drank their water. We even brused our teeth with our water. My husband and I only got 2 mosquito bites each. We made sure we sprayed ourselves with OFF. The room was a little musty. I just sprayed everyday to make sure it was fresh. We used the Immodium. My husband, myself and 10 year old son got the runs on our 5th, 6th and 7th day there. The first 4 days were fine. I was picky what I ate but we still got it. We have been home for 3 days and my huband and son still have the runs. Food-Not very good. I do highly and I do say highly recommend the calamari at Las Brisas. It was the best all week long and the service was fast there (I was shocked). I ate it for a few days. We ate at the steak house. The tenderlion was very good but that was it. Too long to get our food. The buffet are nothing to write home about. One time per week is enough.Drinks-Not very good. I am not a big drinker but I do like an occassional good drink. I never found it and I tried a few of them. It doesn't even seem like they put in alcohol. Even when my husband said make it stronger it didn't do anything. I never saw anyone drunk. How could you the drinks tasted like Virgin drinks.Room-Ok. Big but the toliet and shower are too close to each other. I felt cramped when getting out of the shower. There was a little mildew but I guess expected in that Humidity. It is a 3 star hotel.Beach-The most beautiful. Water was warm. We were in there sometimes until 7:30 pm and it was nice and warm. Very green. Plenty of lounge chairs.Pool-Great. We loved it. Not crowded. It was clean and saw them putting chemicals in there. Entertainment-I didn't get into it. Very crowded. The action by the pool was great though.As you can see I am putting SERVICE last because that is where it belongs. It was the worst ever. We thought maybe if we give them tips it would help. But it doesn't I wouldn't give tips because they just put it in their pockets without a thank you. It was like it was expected. About 90% of them looked like they were smelling S_ _T. It took forever to get a menu. One time it took us 30 minutes to get a menu. One hint-Do not go to a restaurant hungry because you will starve. Go when you are getting hungry because by the time they seat you, get the menu, order and get your food, you will then be ready to eat. It is an average of 60 - 90 minutes. Go early about 7 or 7:30 pm to a restaurant or else you will have a long wait. We learned quickly. Hint only if you get good service. If you don't, do not give them a tip. Maybe they will learn. We did find out they make $7 a day for working 12 hours per day. One positive, we didn't have any problems when registering. We were in and out in 10 minutes.Try another hotel because they have the same beach.

<Content>Adjust Your Expectations We had the opportunity to read the reviews prior to our trip and were more or less prepared before we arrived. As most reviewers noted, check in is not efficient, just pick a line and hope for the best. Try to avoid arriving on Saturday if possible, that's when most of the rooms turn over. The property itself is beautiful, the landscaping is well kept, the beach is clean, plenty of shade, etc. The one exception is the restrooms, all of which were wet from leaks, condensation, etc.If you want to be near the action, choose building 2,3 or 4, but you may be impacted by the music, shows, etc. Buildings 1, 5 and 6 were on the quieter section of the property. Our room was fine, a little musty, but clean. Take a small candle. We left a few dollars every day for both housekeeping and the minibar guy and had no problems. You will be at a slight disadvanatage if you don't speak Spanish. Take the time to learn a few key phrases, excuse me, please, thank you, etc. The only place where we had any trouble being served was the lobby bar. They don't care if you're Colombian, American or Martian, dollar in hand or not. Bar service was fine everywhere else. One tip: Don't start barking at the staff in English, this guarantees that you will be ignored. Try to stick to the basics, beer, pina colada, etc. The house wines are awful, don't ask for a Margarita, you're not in Mexico. Don't forget those dollar bills, they do help.The casino is pretty lame, many of the slots were inoperable, the dealers were not friendly, resulting in a less than festive environment. The shows are cheesy, but are good for a few laughs. The shuttle service is a good way to get around the resort, but you can walk just as easily. Loading and unloading can get crazy, so be prepared.This resort has a lot of restaurants and we tried almost every one. Most restaurants are open air, so you may see bugs and the occasional bird. The buffets are decent, we recommend the cooking stations, pasta, omelets, grill, etc. The Steak place and the Mexican were our favorites. The pizza is not bad and the grill in La Pina has a good lunch, steak, burgers, seafood, right on the beach. The service standards are pretty low, so be patient. It can take a while to be seated, order and receive your food. The staff were also slow to remove plates, refill glasses, etc. The Barcelo is one of the larger resorts in Punta Cana and offers a lot of options, you can choose to be very active or do next to nothing, which is what we did. If you are used to the Four Seasons or JW Marriot, this is not the place for you. If you expect to be pampered and catered to, you will be disappointed. If you expect the entire world to speak English just because you do, you will be very disappointed.If you are looking to gear down and relax in a beautiful tropical setting and don't mind a few inconveniences, then give it a try. Just be sure to set your watch to Dominican time or better yet, don't wear a watch at all.

<Content>overcrowded This was my third time around and previously it had been fine. However, I found the hotel this time around to be overcrowded. There was nowhere to sit by the pool and the beach was not as well taken care of as before. I am a latin woman, however there were too many of us. As known, a lot of Cubans are undiciplined and loud. It felt as if people did not care about the world around them and only concentrated on what they wanted. The people were loud and intrusive. There was absoliutely no personal space. At the beach or poolside, you can hear people asking their husbands, etc., what drinks they wanted and the whole world needed to know. I started to think that safety could possibly be an issue in this hotel. Although there was security to keep the locals from coming in, noone refused drinks to the customers and at times if you tip well they actually put alcohol in the drinks. I noticed several people who appeared intoxicated. Another thing, since the Dominicans are very poor, they expect to be tiped for everything and I understand. I found almost all of them to be very nice however, tip or no tip. Also, my daughter became sick, but I had antibiotics and took care of this quickly, although we did not drink or eat anything containing dairy or drink the water. Finally, I believe that as the hotel has gained popularity, it has lost class, at least for me. I love the beaches in the D.R., but if I ever go again, I will surely stay at another hotel.

<Content>Terrible Service, Awful Food, and Sloppy Guests We went to Barcelo Palace Hotel for 5 days the weekend of July 4. Granted, we expected a full hotel because of the holiday weekend, but when we got there and discovered that 80% of the hotel guests were not American, we were a little surprised at the overcrowding. In any event, while the beach they owend was beautiful as was the pool, the unkempt manner of the resort bordered on unsanitary to completely uninhabitable. While at the pool on 2 occasions, I fished several empty plastic drink cups from beneath me while swimming. In addition, a used diaper, which had been left on one of the chairs by another guest, was left there all afternoon despite the presence of staff about 15 feet away in every direction. Although there was supposedly a designated child section and adult section of the pool, I saw no such thing and while in the swim up bar area which I presume was supposed to be for adults, I was splashed and swam into on several occasions by wild and unsupervised children. The Rooms - my room was ok, basically clean with the only exception being that the bed was more like a wood board with a mattress pad placed over it than anything else. I was there with a number of friends, and one couple had cockroaches in their room, 2 couples had toilet problems (i.e., the toilets just didn't work) and another couple was given a room key to a room that was already occupied by another guest. Absolutely ridiculous and unexplainable for a hotel that is supposed to be of 4 star calibre. The Service - by far the worst service ever experienced, expecially if you were american. The basic philosophy of the waitstaff was if I don't look at you then you can't see me. Unless you were spanish looking or speaking, you literally had to scream to get waitstaff attention to serve you a drink, and waiving american cash made little difference. Furthermore, half the time you did order, you never got served the entire order. I.e., when ordering several drinks for a group of people, the bartenders would come back with a couple of drinks and then walk away, leaving you thinking they were going to get the rest of the drinks when actually, they just decided to start serving someone else and ignored the rest of your order. The service by bellhops was also atrocious. When we checked out we needed to put our bags in storage which they said was fine. Storage, however, meant tying the bags together and leaving them unsupervised in the front lobby of the hotel until it was time to go. Then when it was time to go, not a soul appeared to help us put our things into the taxi, but when we all settled and ready to jump in, a bell hop appeared out of nowhere to take our checkout ticket which proved we had checked out of the hotel. The checkout process also was atrocious, since they had one person doing checkouts at 12 noon, when everyone was checking out. The Food - not that great. Breakfast buffet was decent, and fruit was fresh and good, but everything else was fair to poor. And you basically had to eat at the deisgnated times that were offered. There was no such thing as eating whenever you wanted. After 11, nothing was open except a single snack bar attached to one of the discotecas, far away from the palace hotel. And that snack bar was packed and it took about 45 minutes to get service. Finally, the minibar is a joke. It is stacked with a 2 chocolate wafers, 2 beers, a few sodas and a bottle of water. And they don't refill the wafers after the first night. Needless to say, if you were out drinking at the bars or in the casino until 2 or 3 in the morning (they are open until 4 or 5 am) you are pretty much screwed for food - so bring your own. That's all I can think of for now, but I would advise stay anywhere else but here if you want to go to Punta Cana. And if the employees at other resports are anything like those at the Palace, I would stay choose another destination altogether.

<Content>Not Going Back My wife and I just got back from our vacation to Punta Cana at the Barcelo Palace. Needless to say we will never go back to Punta Cana. This was our second trip to this resort our first was on our Honeymoon 4 years ago. What a change for the worse this place has taken. The food was horrible. We have been to third world contries almost exclusively, primarily in Latin America and never had such horrible food. The buffet always ran out of food at the Palace and it was the only place to get breakfast. But let's get to the real issues. First the check-in was chaios, no organized line and various hispanic families primariliy cuban, pushing and shoving to get to the counter etc..... I was really taken back by the peoples behavior. I myself am Puerto Rican, however I was extreemly embarassed by the behaviour of my fellow Latin Americans. They were rude, pushy, nasty, loud, and had no regards for the space and a total disregard of others. They quite simply ran the joint. It was very very suprising. Second, to further clarify the other observations on not getting served by not speaking spanish, they are unfortunately well founded and completely true. I am a non-native speaker and have had no problems getting around anywhere else in Latin America, but at what was supposed to be a 4 star resort I had several problems getting served. The native speakers basically overwhelm the staff and if your not a native speaker you are going to be at a disadvantage. We did hear of people getting sick however we did not. I did notice that at the buffet the cook at I think the Asian station was handling Chicken, Fish, and Beef with the same pair of tongs, this is a big no, no, and leads to cross contamination. We stayed away from that station the entire stay. Watch the cooks carefully and eat your lunch and dinners someplace other than the buffet.Getting on the trams to go from one part of the resort to another was worse than getting on a subway during rush hour. I can't tell you how many small children I took out trying to cut in front of my wife and I to get on the tram. After several attempts to be civil about the situation we started shoving them to the ground as they attempted to literally climb over or under as most of them could to get onto the tram in front of us. All this while the family watched and participated in the same manner. Whatever it took for them to get on that tram, they did it. The best day we had was when they all left on Saturday, but they all came back on Sunday. The Primary factor in all of this is MK tours. Almost all the Cubans, and few Puerto Ricans all used MK tours. It was a madhouse. We will never go back to Punta Cana and I unfortunately will never be the same for it. I am truely embarrased as my wife pointed out that these were my peoples and they were behaving in a manner unlike any I had ever seen. My family would never act like that in public and have absolutely no regards to the other people around them.

<Content>The Grizwalds We just returned from our vacation at Punta Cana yesterday. We were a group of 9 people and stayed for eight days. June 23rd 鈥?30th, which was all we could take, even though the beach was one of the best that I have been to, and the hotel had nice rooms that were clean. First off, we reserved three adjacent ocean front (close to the beach) rooms in March, but when we arrived we were told that they did not have our rooms together because the were full and they would switch us the next day. And 2 of the 3 were down grades to garden view. We I complained they said it鈥檚 just for one day. But I still paid for oceanfront. I felt ripped off.Next. The service was terrible. We would wait at the bar (especially in the lobby) 20 minutes without getting served while we watched others get served right away. It didn't take us long to figure out why. The pattern was quite obvious. We do not look or speak Spanish. We felt like they didn't want us there.Next. After a couple of days we saw a used sanitary napkin on the beach. We complain about it and that it was unsanitary. It stayed there for three days until they picked it up. As time went on we found it was not the only one. Also bottles, rusty bottle caps, band aids straws, and cups were also frequently seen on the beach. This garbage should be cleaned up daily. Actually, it shouldn't be there in the first place. But that goes to show you what kind customers they are attracting. Enough said about that.Next. The food was terrible. 5 of 9 of us got sick even with being cautious about the food and water. Vomiting and or diarrhea. Nothing can ruin a vacation like being sick.Next. The resort is huge so you need to take a trolley to some of the restaurants, the casino, and the shopping plaza. The trolley was frequently full and these uncivilized people do what ever they have to get on, and have no problem being rude.The gift shop in our hotel doesn鈥檛 have prices on the items, that mystery was also solved. One of the children from a group that was there bought a candy bar for $7 us currency. Immediately after that another child went in to by one too, he was only charged $2 us currency. The second child looked Spanish but he wasn't. Ooops! And the gift shop items were over priced, (example: $8 for a bag of chips that you could buy for 69 cents in America.)... I'm sorry that is unacceptable.Obviously we will not be returning to this resort.

<Content>Vomiting  What else can I say, the hasn't been mention in the other reviews.We arrived at the Hotel on Sunday June 18,2006. The weather was nice and HOT and we expected to be greated at the hotel with could drinks, as I had hear from friends who had visited de Dominican Republic before, but to my surprise, no one was there to offer us anything. We had to wait a couple of hours to be able to get a room.On the second day (monday 6/19), my wife got sick and there was were all hell broke lose. She started vomiting  diarrhea. The doctor;s visit was 150 + medicine (We spent $400) after the third day (Wednesday 6/21) my wife got better but we were afraid to eat anything. there was somekind of food poisoning and there were more than 50 people sick on the Hotel.We have an 8 month old baby girl and my wife was breast feeding her and giving her formula, but since she was taking medicine she couldn't breast feed her and by Thursday we has ran out of formula. Couldn't find it anywhere. We had to call a pharmacy outside the complex and have it delivered. (They charged and arm and a leg)Management did nothing about it.My ratings are:Food: TERRIBLE, DISCUSTINGService: Personal was rude, expected tips for everything. I believe they were been overworked. A regular person would work more than 12 hrs a day. 7 days a week.Room Service: Rooms were not clean on time and it a tip was not left, it would not be clean properly.Pool: Small, full of people.Entertaintment: Shows were TERRIBLE. Pool and beach activities (None)It was a terrible experience. WON'T VISIT AGAIN!!!!!

<Content>Just what we wanted! We went to Puerta Plata as a family of 4 at Christmas. Our trip was terrific! The beach could not have been nicer-the weather was perfection. We got to know our maid, Isobel, and she was a doll. Both of my boys spoke enough Spanish to carry on a conversation with her-she was a delight and kept our room spotless, and our fridge full of whatever we asked for. We tipped her daily-but when you think of how much $5 is to them-it's the least we could do! The 3 guys played golf twice, and enjoyed their time on the course. We also played at the casino and everyone of us won playing Black Jack. This is where we found the least friendly people. Maybe because we were winning, as they kept changing our dealers. We walked away with over $750 between us. It's great to be able to eat at any of the 5 hotels in the chain, and you can walk the lighted walkways or hop on the tram shuttle. The food was varied enough for all of us in the family to enjoy something-we especially liked the breakfasts and the pasta bar. We had no issues with our stomachs and we ate and drank everything. Their coconut drinks are yummy! Would we ever go back? We definitely would-except that we like to try new spots when we vacation...but we had a fabulous time there and the resort was maintained beautifully! We also met a lot of interesting people from all over the world. My sons are 19 and 22 and they had no problem meeting other young people at the disco. You would love it if you aren't expecting the Ritz!

<Content>Loved the Resort I enjoy traveling to the Dominican Republic; although, is a very poor country I happen to love the people from over there. During my 4th trip I decided to stay at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace and let me tell you I do not regret it鈥?br/>Rooms: The rooms were nice size; the bathroom was in good condition, not rusty, no mildew, nothing like that. The lady that cleaned our room always kept our bar fully stacked with mini Presidentes, Water, and Coca-Cola.Pool: The pool is huge, it was never packed and there are plenty of shady places to sit.Beach: The beach in Punta Cana is outrageously beautiful!Food: I have stayed at 3 different resorts prior to staying at the Palace. I have come to the conclusion that the food here is the best. It is true that you can have all the lobster you want. Just go to the Las Brisas Restaurant and you will see what I mean. The Rincon Dominicano was one of my favorite places to eat; I loved the Mofongo, and Chivo Dominicano. I hit the buffet every day for breakfast and I was pleased at all times. I also ate one night for dinner and I found it pretty good, they have crepes for dessert that are excellent (I hate like 3). I didn鈥檛 go to the French restaurant; I found it kind of odd to go to eat French food in the Dominican Republic so I stayed away from it. Drinks: The drinks are very, very good. I had Pi帽a Coladas, Caipiri帽a, Mojitos, and all were excellent!Shows: I didn鈥檛 really like the show too much but I give them A for effort.Casino: It is not Vegas but is ok.Club: HORRIBLE! Full of little kids, getto wanna be looking kids, terrible atmosphere. I did go to Mangu Disco which is 20 minutes away from the Resort, it will cost you about $15 to get there and $6 to get in. This club is very good, the music, better atmosphere, many locals come here but do not feel scared the security at this place is tight so they stay away from tourists.Tours: I took the Bavaro Runners tours; I found it pretty long for my tastes. It takes hours to get from one place to the next. Nevertheless it was an experience. Weather: This has nothing to do with the hotel but I would like to say I had the worst weather! It was cloudy and it rained all day the day before I came back so nope, no tan for me.Service: I have no complaints about the service. Dominicans are lovely people, they are hard workers and they try to give you EVERYTHING you want.I would like to say this to everyone since I did notice how CHEAP people can be. PLEASE, PLEASE REMEMBER THE D.R IS A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE RESORTS MAKE VERY LITTLE MONEY. TIPS ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED, YOU WILL GET A LOT OF GRATITUDE FROM THEM AS WELL. PLEASE TIP! YOU ARE ENJOYING AN ALL INCLUSIVE VACTION; HOWEVER, SERVICE IS NOT INCLUDED.The crowd at the Hotel: This hotel is full of Cubans from Miami (I am one of them myself) I just do not behave the way some of them did. Trust me; they can get a little out of hand and LOUD! They can be indiscipline too. Over all I had a great time, loved the resort, but unfortunately this is my last trip to the D.R as I would like to visit other countries.

<Content>For a great vomiting  This pass June 16 through June 23, my family and I left to Dominican Republic for a well deserve vacation. We were 11 in total, as we arrived we expected the best after all the talk and commotion regarding the place. As per my part, I had visited Barcelo Palace in July of 1999 and loved it. I also returned to Santo Domingo to another resort LTI on July 2003 and on July 28, 2005 to Paladium. So I hopped that to go back to Barcel贸 Palace was going to be great.As per my experience and my families鈥?expectation they all went down the drained. The place had change, the service was TERRIBLE. The people will serve expecting a 鈥淗IGH鈥?tip ($2 or $3 as tip for a drink server was not enough). If housekeeping did your room and you did not leave her some $$$, the next day your room was hardly cleaned and the mini bar empty (I am not a drinker but I did wanted my bottled water). As per the food, DISGUSTING, due to the heat and lack of A/C the hot food becomes sour quickly. There was a lack of employees (they cut on personnel due to new administration). The fried chicken and pork were raw in the middle. The first day we got there we were all happy but as soon as we had lunch my uncle started to feel bad. He ended up with diarrhea for the next 6 days. We all though it was nothing until the next day his wife had to run to the bathroom to vomit. We all started to worry. On the 3rd day my cousin and her husband became so sick that she had to be injected due to the vomiting and her husband could not get off from bed due to colic鈥檚 and dizzy spells. Well they both had to change their flight and leave to Miami. Not to mention that the resort does not take responsibility for the sickness, although they have a clinic and a doctor that is employed by the resort, my cousin had to pay $300 (US currency) for an injection and $100 (US currency) extra per tickets to change her flight. So far, out of the 11 people, 4 were sick and we still had 4 days to go.  My husband and I were taking all the precautions possible. We would order bottles of water unopened and the soda in the bottle unopened no ice, no prepare juice, no shapes or drinks, no milk. It was terrible; we paid so much money to have to go through hell. For the food we ate mostly breads in the morning with soda (in the bottle no ice), for lunch and dinner we ate white rice, banana that you have to peal yourself, bread and a meet that had to be pressure cooked or that at least had to be cooked for a long time. We staid away from seafood, pastries, ice-cream, vegetables, cheese and salads. We kept our ears open and spoke to the people around the resort, We found out that there were approximately 200 people sick and it was not a stomach virus as many thought, they did not know what it was, the administration was looking the other way and since there was no answer they kept calling it a stomach flue and blamed it on the tourist. In the building that we were staying next to us there was a couple and she had to have an IV put in. I just wanted for this vacation form hell to finish.On the 5 day my grandfather became ill and between vomits and diarrhea he could not get up from bed. The Imodium and Pepto-Bismol cost a total of $45(US currency). 5 people down 6 more to go. We change eating at different restaurant; you can say we ate at all of them always eating the same food, and extremely precautions. On the 6 day my uncles daughter 10 years old started vomiting and she was injected another $300 (US currency) and my sister along with her husband started with the diarrhea. 8 people down 3 more to go. The last day came. I felt I was a participant in a horror film with a deadly virus, I guess my husband, my grandmother and I were one of the lucky ones. Why did it happen? Could it have been lack of hygiene, uncooked food and the mixing or tap water with bottle water to save money? Maybe. Could it have been salmonella, amebas or other bacteria? Maybe, all I know is that to Barcel贸 Resort I will never visit again. If you still decide on visiting take all the precaution possible for you and your family especially if traveling with small children, take necessary medicine, speak with your doctor before you go, and make sure you take plenty of extra cash. Check out the other resorts, this one is infected with something terrible.

<Content>Beautiful beach, ok hotel, horrible food-unless you're a fly Spent June 19-23, 2006 at the Palace. If all you want is a clean room and a beautiful beach the Palace is fine. There are 4 or 5 different hotels on the Barcelo complex, the Palace is supposedly the premium one. By staying there you can use the pools and restaurants at all the hotels at the resort. First the good:- The grounds are beautiful and well kept. A lot of flowering bushes and beautiful palm trees. The tiled areas are mopped each morning. Pretty stone walkways connect different areas of the resort. (the resort is huge).- Large pool with a fountain, jacuzzi area, kiddie area and several bridges going over it. Pool is about 5 ft. at the deepest. Swim up bar is nice. Large number of lounge chairs, never had a problem finding empty chairs. The pool does close at 8 p.m. nightly for cleaning. - There are 6 groups or blocks of rooms. The blocks are U shaped facing the ocean but very few are what I'd call ocean front or view due to the palm trees on the beach. Our room was in block 6, the farthest from the pool and restaurants but not a far walk. Blocks 5 and 6 appeared to be the newest looking from the outside. We had a second floor room with a balconey overlooking a courtyard, could see the ocean a little through the trees. The balcony had a small table and 2 chairs, the room had a king bed, tile floor, TV, wicker table and chairs, a desk and a cabinet with a stocked refrigerator in it. The bathroom was a little outdated, (old tile), but clean, plenty of hot water and water pressure. There is a safe in the closet. The room was clean, smelled a little musty and everything felt a little damp but with the humidity there we expected that. The AC worked great. Room was cleaned daily, we left a note asking for extra towels because used ones never dried. Soap, shampoo, conditioner and hair dryer are provided. The fridge was stocked with beer, water, Coke and Sprite. We left a note asking for what we wanted in it. Several large bottles of water are provided daily.- A lot of security guards seen, especially at night. - The beach is beautiful! Seaweed was cleaned each morning. Plenty of lounge chairs. The water is very clear and calm, no waves, you can walk for a very long distance in either direction. No solicitation is allowed on the beach property but immediatly past Block 6 is public beach and you're constantly asked to buy something. The beach at this end was fairly empty, it was very crowded at the other end of the resort. Now the bad:- We found the majority of the staff unfriendly, even rude. The bartenders were the worst and tipping didn't improve the service. Did notice that those speaking Spanish were served first and with a smile. And what's with the stone faced dealers at the casino-they need to take a lesson from Vegas dealers and talk to the players, or at least smile.- You have a colored wrist band put on at check-in which identifies what hotel you're in. I don't wear jewelry to the beach but was stuck with that band the entire time. Don't know of a better way to do it tho, but it was annoying.- Unsupervised kids of all ages. A lot of 8-10 yr. olds at the pool running, yelling, climbing up and jumping off the bridges into the pool and no parents in site. Only once saw a staff member tell a kid to get off the bridge. No drinking age observed, (wouldn't want to be there at Spring Break). Several drunk teens and again, no parents in site. - The drinks. The alcohol can't be high proof, even if I saw them add the rum I couldn't taste it. Did ask for extra but even then couldn't tell. Tried to get a good margarita but one was worse then the other but the Bahama Mama's were good. Presidente is the only beer and we didn't care for it, kind of bitter tasting.- The tram that takes you around the resort. No fault of the resort, but other than Americans no one knows how to stand in line and wait their turn. There's some really rude people in the world!- The food. Didn't expect gourmet but it was bad. There was a huge selection at the main buffet but most was covered in flies. And I don't mean just a fly here and there, flies were all over the food. The only food covered were the muffins and rolls. Cold food was on ice but in that heat it melts fast and wasn't replaced. Raw meat was stacked on trays at the grills, ice melted and flies on it. The guy grilling uses the same tongs to put raw meat on the grill then pick up your cooked meat and put it on your plate, saw the guy making omlets wipe his face with a paper towel then use the same towel to wipe out the skillet, (no, it won't kill you but it's gross), the woman making smoothies opens the trash can then goes back to smoothies-no hand washing anywhere. The couple with us both started vomiting within 4 hrs. of eating several of the same foods at lunch and we spoke to several other people who were also sick. I know it's a Third World country but anyone can learn common food safety. We ate a lot of french fries and rolls! The steak and Mexican restaurants were ok, at least we didn't have to see how the food was prepared, the Italian place tasted like Chef Boyardee out of a can.Overall we had fun because of the beach and our friends. It was neat hearing different languages and kids switching back and forth between English and Spanish, fluent in both. We like having a good dinner and drinks while on vacation and didn't get that at the Palace, the fly thing was disgusting. I doubt if we'd go back to the Palace or Punta Cana. The beaches on the gulf coast of Florida are also beautiful, with a much lower chance of food poisoning.

<Content>Honeymooners :) We just returned from a week stay at the palace. I was leary of the reviews that I read before going. The following is what we experienced. CHECK IN/OUT- Not a problem, the people at the front desk speak a little english We did get a little frustrated a few times, we don;t speak any spanish.ROOMS- The rooms were okay. The beds were very uncomfortable, and the room did have slight smell of must. We put a few dollars in the mini fridge daily and we always had a packed fridge. Water, pop, and beer. The room was cleaned well. Our room was cold POOL- The pool was great!BEACH- WONDERFUL, this is the most beautiful beach I have ever saw. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair. The water is unbelievably clear. DO wear sunscreen, the sun is much more intense than it is here.FOOD :( The food was nasty. We did find that the Steakhouse is really good. We ate their three times. The buffet was decent and had a lot to offer. The beer (presidente) was never served to us very cold, more like room temperature, and this is the only beer offered there and it is not very tasty. We NEVER drank the water, not even when we brushed our teeth and my husband and I both had Diarhea most of the week, as did most of the people we spoke to. My husband vomited one night, and had the chills. Pepto was our best friend.Service- Overall the staff seemed friendly. I think because of the language barrier people think that they are rude. If you tip I think you will get better service. We did have a favorite bartender-Aida, she was great!If you have the money- go on an excursion. We went on the Kon-tiki party boat and had a blast!! Well worth the money. Do take some snacks, pepto/immodium, bug repellent, sunscreen, we wished that we would of brought a small collapsable cooler, the drinks were not very cold and got warm fast due to the extreme heat, and plenty of dollar bills. You dont want to have to purchase anything at the hotel, the prices were extremly high!! Overall we had a good time- We would go back- probably not this hotel. We spoke to group of twenty people that stayed at the Melia, and they said there hotel was great, and no one was sick out of thier entire party.Hello to ADAM and MELISSA if you are reading this!!

<Content>Great beach, great people...just bring your own food and water My wife and I, our daughter (3) and son (20 mos) just spent a week at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Palace. We had read most of the reviews on this site before going, so we went with our usual complement of first aid. Even so, we did--and are still, four days after we got back--experiencing some sort of unusual stomach flu.This being said, the beach was spectacular, the people were very helpful and generous, and the hotel was fine for what we expected. If you go expecting a Ritz Carlton or the like, then you will be disappointed. If you go expecting a typical type of all inclusive resort such as you find in Cancun, then your expectations will be met.We found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. Please do bring one dollar bills, as a little bit will greatly endear you to them. They work very hard and earn very little. And they do it with a smile. It is easy to make friends with the staff. Of course, there are exceptions, but you will find that anywhere you go. We found our experience with the staff to be quite satisfactory. They were very helpful and kind to our children, and to us. Beach: beautiful. Powder white sand, calm warm seas and a nice constant breeze.Check-in/out: no problems.Room: quite adequate. You will appreciate the air conditioning because it is quite hot. You can adjust it if you like. We live in Miami and are used to heat and humidity, but the DR is further south, so the sun does cook you quickly. There are mosquitos at night, so perhaps the idea previously posted about bug spray to knock them down isn't a bad idea. My daughter got bitten quite a bit during the night. If you want something extra in your mini bar, just ask--and give the mini bar man a few dollars. We found all you have to do is ask. The bathrooms are small, but suitable--european style.Food: palatable, but... The buffet has a large variety of items for every taste. I would avoid Las Brisas, though. The all you can eat lobster which is often billed is that: all you can stomach. They really aren't lobster, which would be unusual that far south, but langostinos. Unfortunately, we found them to be pretty awful. The best food and service we found was at the steak house at the Beach Hotel. Actually, the beef was very good. We would also say, if you go, to try Las Pinas grill for lunch. It is on the beach and they will cook what you like right there. The mero (grouper) was tasty. However, all this being said, we still cannot account for the stomach problems we (except for my daughter) all experienced about three to four days in. It is pretty bad and we still haven't been able to shake it. It also comes with stomach pain, leg pain, chills and a complete loss of appetite. If you want to go and diet in a pretty setting, then this is the place for you. We did not drink the tap water, nor even brush our teeth with it, but had to drink a lot of the bottled water because it was so hot. It is supposed to be purified, but had a distinctive chalky taste.Service: very good. We saw the same people work giving aerobics lessons, then watching kids at the mini club, then changing into a costume to perform in the show at night. They work at least 18 hours a day, with maybe one day off per week. Nobody forces you into group activities. The staff is extremely appreciative of any kindness. We saw some rude guests there and it made me embarrassed. While most of the staff speaks some english, remember that the language is spanish there. Even if you don't speak the language, it certainly wouldn't hurt to at least try to speak a little spanish. If you don't care to learn another language, then don't go the the Louvre and order food, either.  Overall, except for the extreme heat at Punta Cana airport, we were mostly pleased. Because of the stomach issues, though, I doubt we will go back. Apparently we are not alone in this. If they could solve that problem, then, for the price--we might well do so. It is only two hours from here and the Domincans are very nice people, and appreciate your help.

<Content>Great Beach, so/so hotel, service not that good We had a big group going together, for the most part, we had a great time, we must remember we are in a 3rd world country, their 5 star is our 2/3 star. The beds were hard, the rooms were warm and moldy, the food was being pecked by black crows, the sodas and water was hot. Most of the hotel was on immodium, the transporation train sucked, the service on those little transports to from other hotels sucked , dangerous, too full, and alot of drunk loud mouths. There were alot of low lives staying in big groups which made the stay almost unbearable, they thought they owned the place, but besides all that, the BEACH were we mainly hung out, was wonderful, awesome, best beach I have ever seen, the sand was white and beautiful, we did bannana boat, kayak, catamaran, everything, we loved every minute of that, but the beach lacked service. The drinks were delicious, the food was so/so, but very hot, only one air conditioned hotel. My room was clean, but we had to change due to a/c problems. But most of our group of 35 were sick. Something they are doing is just not sitting well. Would I go back to this hotel, probably not, I am Cuban but too routy for me, too many drunks, wanting to fight..no way, I wanted to relax saw my self on constant guard with my teenage daugther and son. The hotel service lacked friendlyness, but were not all that bad. It was a great vacation regardless because the beach made up for all the bad the hotel did. I stayed at Bavaro princess before which to me was 5 star, but, the beach area sucked. so here you go , do you want beach (wonderful beach) or do you want to stay in your room all day? You answer that. They have alot of changing to do, but overall it was a great vacation even with us being sick. (I did not get sick) but most of my group sure did !

<Content>Horrible Experience!! Stay Away!!! Where should I start? I was at this hotel for my birthday during the week of May 15 to May 22. Our best friends also decided to tag along to celebrate my birthday. I had read some negative reviews but was not prepared for the nightmare we were about to encounter. We thought the negative reviews might be the result of a languge barrier or just some people being picky. Boy, were we wrong!! Let me point out that we speak spanish and we are not picky people.Let me just list the negative things we encountered:1.The staff was primairly rude  unfriendly. They appeared to be upset that they were working there.2.Our room had a strong moldy smell. Mold and mildew was also visible on the air vents and the bathroom shower walls. Got pictures of this too!!3.The mattress was dirty and torn as well as HORRIBLE!! to sleep in. We tossed and turned all night long. We woke up exhausted and in pain everyday. The mattress looked like something they picked up from the trash. It was a disgusting feeling to sleep on this, so called bed. The sheets were not even the right size for the mattress. I have the pictures to prove it. I will be sending these pictures to the Barcelo Co. with my complaints.4.The food was below average and you had to fight off the flies while you were eating!! Not to mention that the food was sometimes cold from sitting out. Oh yeah and sometimes you would actually find the flies in your food!! A few times we asked for drinks and they never appeared. BAD SERVICE.5.Our friends were given a non-oceanview room when they paid for oceanview. When we politely asked if they could fix the problem, they were rude and made us feel like we were a bother. End of story, 3 room changes til' they got what they paid for and all rooms smelled moldy as well with bad mattresses.6.We all had a fever a least one day of our stay. Thank god I brought medicine from the U.S. And we all had some stomach issues which caused us to run to the bathroom a few times!! Our best friend got a mysterious rash all over his body which disappeared once we were home. WE DID NOT DRINK THEIR WATER AND STILL GOT SICK!!7.Went to get a massage on the beach to at least ease the pain from sleeping on the bad mattress and they tried to rip me off when it came time to pay. They tried to trick me on the exchange rate from U.S money to their pesos. I had to confront the owner to get things straightened out. I left more stressed out after the massage!! Horrible!!End of story is that this place is a dump and the service is horrible!!! Stay away no matter what you read!! I don't know how the majority of people are posting anything positive??MAYBE THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A BEACH  THINK THIS IS PARADISE?? DON'T KNOW?? We live in south Florida so we are used to seeing a tropical setting and eating a variety of foods from all cultures without being sick, this was not paradise!! TRUST ME. Our friends had booked 1 more day than us  ended up paying an extra $400.00 just to leave this place with us.8.Pool was o.k. but if you look close you will see mold and cracked tiles on it.THIS IS THE WORST VACATION WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!! WE SPENT OUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND TIME STRESSED OUT/SICK. We spent our hard earned money and time stressed out/sick. TThis is not a four star hotel!! Stay Away!! We are not picky people!! THIS WAS HORRIBLE!!

<Content>The food will kill you! The hotel was nice. The beach was beautiful, but beginning on day 1 my entire family (husband, myself and my son) became ill. My husband was vomiting and we had fever and major stomach issues. We came back home and my husband is having to go to the doctor because he is so violently ill. Of everyone we spoke to at the resort, everyone had experienced gastrointestional distress. When you go to the gift shop to buy Immodium, you cannot buy a box. They keep it under lock and key and sell it to you by the pill. Each pill is $5.00 apiece. It really makes you wonder if they are purposely making folks ill! I will never go back to this resort and would not recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Good Location, Excellent Staff, Food 'Fine' I was quite worried after seeing all the reviews on here....but it was unwarranted.If you're looking for the Four Seasons, St. Regis, Ritz Carlton, 'Heavenly' Beds or showers, five star cuisine...this is not your place and don't book it expecting it. However, this is a nice place but it is not four or five stars. That didn't reduce my enjoyment of the place. Checkin was smooth. The room is average 3 stars--perhaps low end three stars. It did smell musty but was very clean. Tipping here is very helpful in my experience...go to the bank and bring plenty of one dollar bills. I got excellent service and I am sure some of it was because of the tips. For example, drink requests on a paper wrapped around 2 one dollar bills placed in the minibar fridge and the mini-bar was full to the brim with requested goodies. One day I forgot and I got the 'standard refill'. The beach is nice. The food was 'fine'---not fantastic but I was always able to find good to eat. I have a very sensitive digestive system and I had no problems at all. Now I tended to primarily eat at the caribe buffet, the steak house, and the pina grill--focusing on food cooked in front of me as I was scared to death by all these reviews. At the caribe buffet they always have meats, seafoods, chicken that they will cook up for you. I tended to shy away from uncooked things too. As someone on here said, they are a little heavy handed with the olive oil and salt too. I would go back if I could get a good price---however, I'd probably try somewhere else if they were priced similarly to other places as I like to try new places.

<Content>Nice place nothing special I just returned from my 11 day vacation, half of which was spent at Barcelo B. Palace. Being that I am a Tripadvisor reader I knew from the reviews that my expectations should not be high or else I would be very disappointed. I believe that was a wise choice as I planned to simply relax at this place and enjoy the beach. The pluses of this place, the beach is wonderful; with blue calm water and white sand, so if you're a beach person you'll be happy. Besides that there are tones of chairs so you never have to worry about not finding a lounge chair on the beach. The layout of the place is nice and I enjoyed walking around it and to the other Barcelo resorts next door. However, the room needed some repairs and maintenance to it. There always seem to be a moldy smell and every now and then I would see bugs in the room, not to mention that I got bitten a lot, but that's really not their fault. The food, what can I say, the buffet is not so great, average would be accurate; as you'll find some good things and some scary things. For example, the buffet attracts many flies and they sometimes end up in the food.....really. The quality of the food was not that great, but I am a picky eater so if you're not, you won't mind as much. Trust me, I still ate everyday,three times a day, it's just about taste. We did end up at the Mexican and Steakhouse next door for dinner at the Bavaro Beach and both I would recommend. The Palace has one place open for most of the day, near the swimming pool , I forget the name, but it's the worst place to eat..avoid!! When you're hungry and it's between 3-6pm go to the Bavaro Beach next door and get their take out pizza instead. There's also a place called La Pina( I think) that we would visit around 12:30pm for lunch, and they grilled yummy steaks.Next is the service. The service is sometimes friendly and sometimes not. What I mean by not is that some people will look at you and not smile or while you're ordering they look around like they have better things to do?. My boyfriend and I both tip and smile a lot, we're friendly but I would say it's 50/50 on how nice the workers are. I don't want people to go out of their way, but a simple smile or friendly jesture means something to me, us.All in all, we had a nice time, you probably will too, we just won't repeat.

<Content>Great Vacation!!!!! Unbelievable beach.....wish I were still there! We just got back from the Palace and I have to say we had a wonderful time. We travelled with our 20 year daughter and my husbands family. There was plenty to do, eat and drink. The beaches were amazing. I've never seen so many beautiful palms trees.Our room was a little shabby......they definately could use some updating.But we found the people to friendly and hard working. I was also fearful of getting sick from the food.....but no one in our party had a problem with that.We tipped everyone and they seemed to really appreciate it and were willing to get us anything we wanted.......I read that the service was slow but we did not experience that.Some of the shows were great that had the dancers and singers, however the other shows that tried to use the audience as participants........were pretty stupid. All is all we had a fantastic time for the price of the package at this resort!!!

<Content>Most beautiful beach ever I recently returned from the Palace which I visited with my husband and 8 year old twins. The beach was absolutely spectacular and the grounds were beautifully maintained. Our room did have a slight musty smell, but the room was otherwise very clean and the air conditioning worked well. We had a ground floor room which backed up to the pool and the theatre, which wasn't a problem for us, but I see where it could be if you were light sleepers or had very young children. The staff was (almost without exception) very pleasant and helpful; a smile and my feeble attempts at Spanish were much appreciated. We loved the beach and the pool and took the half-day snorkeling excursion (Caribbean festival) which was wonderful. We had a rainy day and a half, and there really was not much else to do besides read or play cards. Perhaps they could have more activities for the 8 - 12 year old tweens - not ready for the disco and too grown up for the preschool activities. The only drawback was having a hard time finding things that picky 8 year olds would eat - we found that our best bet was the buffet where there was something for everyone - pasta, grilled chicken and steak, rice and ice cream. Breakfasts were our best meal of the day with plenty of omelettes, fruit smoothies, cereal and baked goods. If I had to do it again, I would have brought some snacks for the kids (crackers, chips) to tide them over. I have read in other reviews that the food was poor; my experience was just that you had to be a little adventurous and persistent in looking for things that you liked. We had no stomach upset at all (but we took a preventative dose of doxycycline). Just drink bottled water and use it to brush your teeth. The ice is made with purified water and all the restaurants serve bottled water. The wait staff was very attentive and we had no trouble getting drinks at any of the bars, even though we visited during the very busy week before Easter. The water sports were great - kids loved the kayaks and pedal boats. We also had fun with the beach stretching, aerobics and dance lessons.All in all, it was a beautiful place, with friendly staff; just be a little adventurous with your eating. I definitely think it is the type of place that is more fun if you go in a group. There were not that many English speaking children the week we were there (April 9-16th) so if I were to go back, it would definitely be with built-in playmates for the little ones.

<Content>Terrible experience We arrived on Sunday March 19, 2006. Waited approximately 30 minutes for our room, and when we finally got to it...it was not an oceanview as paid for. We drug our things back to the front desk where I asked for our oceanview room. The person who I perceived was the front desk manager (as 2 other front desk personnel we going to him with questions) stated to me, oceanview is only granted upon availablity. Oh no, I demanded what we obviously paid for in our package, and also stated that I thought my request wasn't unreasonable because all I wanted was what I paid for! I stepped away to call Amercian Flyaway Vacations, (the call cost 77.00USD I might add) and the representative put me on hold to contact the hotel. All this time my husband stayed at the desk waiting for resolution. Finally the front desk manager Juan - gave us another key for building 6...and yes it did have a partial oceanview, blocked by palm trees. This entire episode took about 1 1/2 hours. Come to find out they had severely overbooked this hotel, I only found out after speaking to a man at one of the sister hotels that night, who was bumped from the Palace to the other Barcelo Bavaro Beach hotel. This was approximatly 8pm - and he was still waiting for a room at the new hotel! It was the worst service I have ever seen at any resort or hotel I have ever been to...and we are airline employees and travel a lot. Also, as a side note, my husband got deathly ill the day after we returned and I believe it was either the food or something like lettuce washed in water...I also had the runs for 5 days but wasn't as sick as my husband.

<Content>Much better than expected!!!! Our trip to the Palace Hotel in Punta Cana was a great trip. The travel party consisted of 2 familes with 4 young female adults ages 18,17,14, and 13. We were concerned going into the trip based on some of the negative responses we have read. Our experience was much different and I am ready to go back today. The check in was a bit unorganized. We had a bus load of about 50 people checking in at one time. They did not seem prepared and the staff would start and stop a check-in several times. This could be improved. Upon arrival at our rooms, they were very nice and clean. We were in building 2 and had no problems with water pressure or dirty rooms. Our were clean and nice. The staff was outstanding. They did a good job and always had a smile on their face. This was probably assisted with a tip every morning in the room and some small supplies (school, toothpase) type of supplies that kept them happy. We were very pleased with the beach and the facilities. It was well maintained and clean. They were always sweeping the sidewalks and the beach. You do not find that very often. The activites on the beach were good. The sailing and boats were there for your enjoyment. I would recommend that you use them. We did some scuba diving at Catalina Island and the bus trip over there was probably better than the diving. Just looking at the countryside and the people was well worth the trip. The diving was ok.The food was good. It is not 5 star, but it was different and actually pretty good. You have to be a bit adventuresome in your approach. We found the Buffet being very good and adequate. We ate all of the breakfasts there and several of the dinner meals. The seafood restaurant was excellent. The food was good and staff was great. We tried the Mexican, Steakhouse and the Italian restaurants. Again, would go with the food being ok. The young adults had a good time. They enjoyed the beach and the sun. They did the golf, and disco and entertainment. All in all, the trip was exactly what we were looking for. Nice, clean, and relaxing. We will return there again.

<Content>This place was great! We just returned from a trip April 1-8, 2006. We went with another family and there were 8 of us (four adults and 4 HS/MS aged daughters). I am glad I read all the recent negative reviews, because I went with lowered expectations. However, after spending a week there, I wondered鈥斺€渄id we go to the same place?鈥?Our experience was anything but negative. I also wonder what kind of place and service will make these people who wrote such horrible reviews happy. I will comment on the things that had poor reviews:Rooms-- Our rooms were nice and clean and well serviced. There were a couple of spots where the paint was discolored and a bit of mildew in our bathroom. However, this place is in tropical location and right on the beach. I would love to see how anyone can prevent that. There was a slightly musty smell when we moved in, but it went away and we brought scented candles to take care of any residual smell. They really weren鈥檛 needed. There were also complaints about the water pressure in the reviews. We didn鈥檛 have that experience. The showers are a bit tricky to operate but once you figure that out, there was no problem.Service鈥擶e never had any problems whether is was with staff at the desk, housekeeping or restaurant staff. Some people speak little to no English, but if they couldn鈥檛 they would find someone who could. It is amazing what a smile and a hola will do down there. I saw people who were ragging on the service and I think I know why. If you treat people like they are your indentured servants and look down and talk down on them, don鈥檛 be surprised if you aren鈥檛 treated with reverence. Anyone I saw getting poor service deserved it because they were treating people like dirt. We tipped a few bucks per day and left household items and school supplies for our maid and mini-bar stock person and they were greatly appreciated. Our experience with Dominican people was excellent. They really seemed glad that we were there since they know how important tourism is to their economy. Facilities鈥擳he place was very well maintained and the grounds were beautiful. They even rake the beaches every day. The beaches are gorgeous and the pool area was also very nice. All areas are open except for French restaurant. By open, I mean there are no walls or windows. The restaurants, bars and lobby areas are just covered with a roof and they have wind screens that can be used to shield from the wind which can blow the fine sand around. They are also used at night because it gets pretty chilly in the breeze. The only facility that I was disappointed in was the exercise facility. The equipment is very limited and because it is right on the beach it is fairly beat up from corrosion etc. Food鈥擳he buffet grills should suit everyone鈥檚 fancy. If you are expecting a five star dining experience, you probably have your expectations too high. We found as a general rule, the harder they try the less impressive the meals were. We went to the Steak House, Mexican and Italian restaurants and found the food on the buffet part of the restaurant to be better than the stuff we ordered from the menu. Our favorite restaurant was LaBrisa which is the seafood grill. The food and service there was outstanding. The main buffet grills were also quite good and the food changed enough each day to keep it from being boring. Half of us did have some digestive problems during the course of the week so be sure to pack Pepto Bismal or something similar. Drinks鈥擳he inclusive house wines were pretty nasty and each restaurant had the same wine list and it was pretty limited so if you go for the wine, you will be disappointed. Other drinks were great and readily available. The drinking age is 18, but there were plenty of high school aged kids getting access to booze and making complete [--] out of themselves. Check in鈥擳his is one area that was consistent with bad reviewers. If you check in with a group, you will wait and it will be frustrating. We checked in with a full bus load of people and it truly seemed like this was the first time that the staff had ever dealt with this situation before. Fortunately for us we were near the front of the bus and two of us went right to the desk while the others retrieved the luggage. Even though we were second in line it still took about 30 minutes to check in. It probably took well over an hour for our whole bus to get checked in. As a rule, the nastier you are with the check in people, the more you are ignored. We were polite and smiled and that seemed to help. Once we got past that part the rest was great.Activities and entertainment---We went to several shows and were impressed with the sheer effort in terms of costume changes, number of entertainers and their energy. They won鈥檛 give Vegas or Broadway a run for the money, but they were better than what you see on a cruise ship. The Tropicosimo (sp) was the one they really pimped from the in house promotion, but we did not care for it. The room had poor acoustics and they made you pay for drinks there. The casino was fairly dingy but people seemed to like it. The kids loved the disco. Some of us booked the scuba trip to Catalina Island and the diving there was much better than what is available from the resort. The complementary Hobie Cats and kayaks were lots of fun. Make sure you bring lots of sun block and Aloe Vera (lots of it). You go through it quickly and they charge $30+ for it down there.Bottom line for us was it was a great place. We had lots of fun and plan on going back. If you are looking for a relaxing, clean safe place, you should like the Palace. If you are not somewhat adventurous or if you feel you should be worshipped by all around you, than go somewhere else.

<Content>Loved it We stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace during Feb. school vacation week, 2006. We were with our 16 yr old son and his friend. Check in was slow but they bring you drinks in the lobby- and our tour rep. was extremely helpful. Def. attend the orientation the first day; its worth hearing about the excursions and about the native culture.Every one speaks primarily Spanish and we highly reccommend learning some of the local greeting and pleasantries- they will appreciate it the way Americans appreciate English speaking tourists.They were also overbooked and the 16 yr olds ended up at the Bavaro Beach overlooking the ocean for the 1st night then eventually got moved to our building- but we never did end up with the adjoining rooms we had requested.Once settled in we had a wonderful ground floor room far from the pool area activities.Security is everywhere. The beach is beautiful and the water was gentle and clean. The food was very good. The fish and beef selections can be cooked to order, and we never got sick.The fresh fruit is delicious.The entertainment is great at night, and the casino was a blast.Follow directions about the drinking water, and stay on the properties. Rent the electric bikes, they are fun and don't make any noise. The bartering at the souvenier markets was a bit anoying and can frazzle you if you aren't used to the game. Also, the beach can get a bit noisy early afternoon with the helicopter tours overhead. We golfed - the places off the Barcelo resorts was the best we heard. We also attended a church for services on the Barcelo property and it was an interesting cultural mix in a beautiful setting.

<Content>Worst palace imaginable I stayed here the week of March20-25. Upon arival to check-in at the Palace we waited in line for 30 mis. finally we got some guy who spoke english good enough to tells us hell be right back and left, after 15 mins he came back out and ignored us while doing the same to others. Well after a while, guests started talking and we learned that the palace was overbooked by 250 rooms. We finally got our guy and asked if this was true and what where we to do, he was very sly in his answers and said to wait and hell be right back, well this went on for 3hrs.. Finally he came out and told us the truth that they where sending us to their Beaches hotel, and they will be expecting us. we got our bags and went to beaches and explained what the other guy told us and again he left behind the wall ignoring us after 30 mins he came out and said we only have one room and would have to wit for the other. I waited 4 hours more to finally get my room, which i dont know what other people expect who write good reviews about htis palce but the room was dingy, had bugs and smelled moldy.  THe following morning we went back to the Palace for our keys which they told us would be ready after we checked out of Beaches. Well again we waited over 2 hours for our rooms, they did upgrade my brothers room to ocean front but i still got a standard room, they also gave food vouchers for 2 of their rest. that are not included in the all-inclusove, the food here was not worth it at all. When i got to my room 6028 I noticed water coming down for the A?C vent above the bathroom sink, I called front desk and nothing happened untill thursday 2 days later, the room was also missing a clock, and smoke alarm. the front desk also lost my paper work that i recieved from my travel agency and gave me the run around on where it was. please people this place is pretty, but unless you want to spend hours of your vacation arguing with people who dont speak english go elsewhere, dont be fooled by these good reviews the place truely is about a 2 star resort with horrible service, remember you get what you pay for here. Never once did management appologize to us for anything that happened. I met another couple who happen to work for a airline and they recieved 4 free night to come back as well as a written letter. stay away

<Content>A Must Miss ......Beware of this place I want to know if when you returned from this place you showed up with bites on your legs? They did not show up until all five girls returned home. All the signs point to bed bugs. They have just arrived home and are going to doctors to comfirm. Lets hear from anyone who visited this place and got bites that swell up. They first look like raised white spots and then swell up on the legs. Stayed at the Palace AND ALL THE GIRLS got sick from the food.(NOT FUN) The service was non-existent. The help was rude. The pipes in our room burst and dozens of other rooms causing the rooms to become flooded. Yes they got rid of the water but it kept comming back. After days of yelling with the front desk, they moved us out of our flooded room, only to move new guests into our flooded room the same day. The security is great but the fact that there are so many guards made my group of friends feel unsafe. To any college students thinking about spring break, my word of advice ...GO TO ANOTHER PLACE...NOT HERE...NOT EVEN PUNTA CANA.....I especially was not impressed by the night life.....Wish we had read this review before we booked our trip.

<Content>Spring Break Hell! I just returned from 5 nights/6 days at Barcelo Bavaro Palace with two other friends. This was our 7th or 8th trip to this resort and our 3rd time at the Palace. We return every year at the same time for a girls weekend of rest and relaxation. Well, this year, it was far from it. The Palace is apparently now catering to spring breakers (see previous post by another recent guest) and needless to say, we got NO rest and it was NOT relaxing. We were kept up three of the five nights with all night parties going on in the building. Calling security did nothing and they refused to move our rooms. We found out that most of these guests were UPGRADED from the Barcelo Beach hotel (at no extra charge). Yet, we paid Premium prices! All I can say is if Barcelo continues this tradition of welcoming rowdy spring breakers at lower prices than full paying customers, they have lost at least three loyal customers and I am sure many more to come!

<Content>For the price it was wonderful!! Just returned from a week at the Palace - my husband, son and I plus 6 other families with kids the same age and I have to say we had a great time. We usually travel with 3 other families (in the past we have gone to a villa in Purto Vallarta, a Caribbean cruise, the Turks  Caicos, etc...)but since this was their senior year the group expanded. I have to say we all agreed that it was a great time. I admit I was nervous after reading the reviews but, perhaps as a result of them, I knew what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. We were all, for the most part, in buildings 3 and 4. Great location...parents booked ocean front and had great views. Check in went smoothly for such a large group BUT I can see how it might be difficult. Langueage is definately an issue but as long as I kept a smile on my face and acted in a pleasant manner things eventually happened. The room was clean (left the maid $3/day), fridge stocked ($5 to the guy at the beginning and $5 at the end)beach beautiful, weather great..... I will admit that the staff is not always smiling but a smile and a hola from me seemed to help. Food was not that good. We found the best place for lunch was the grill at the edge of the Palace grounds...steak, chicken, shrimp etc. grilled the way you want, some salad, french fries and a Presidente sitting at a table in the sand looking at the beautiful water - what more could you ask for. Just be vigilant after you order your food in watching the guy cook it - other guests were very happy to take your food when it was cooked! The buffet was good - lots of choices including freshely grilled food. Not gourmet but satisfying. The first night we ate at the Seafood restaurant and while there we some complaints, those of us who had the grilled lobster were very happy. However, 2 nights later even the lobster was mushy. House wine tastes like grape juice so we ordered bottles every night. Same wine list in every restaurant but some wines not avaialble in certain ones. Never ate the the steakhouse as the line was too long.....it couldn't have been worth it. I agree that the service was slow, but where was I going? Another glass of wine and everything was fine. Non local alcohol was $3 - not bad. Train was great if you didn't feel like walking. Casino was fun but the surliest people working there. Bring cash if you like to gamble - none of the ATM's worked and they only gave pesos. Getting a cash advance at the casino with credit cards is a nightmare (my friend finally made them reboot the computer - then it worked!) Here we were WANTING to throw money at them and that made it almost impossible. Not smart. Oh well, I saved a bundle. Bottom line is this place is not the Four Seasons...not even close. BUT, the beach is beautiful, grounds spotless, people friendly if you smile, be patient and remember you are on island time. Kids had a blast. By the way, there didn't seem to be a lot of small children, which wa great for us. LOTS of college kids (which was great for our kids..LOL) THe spring breakers were obviously having fun but not in an MTV sort of way. It was a fun vacation. Go, relax, smile.

<Content>Not quite a palace, but not bad either Just got back from a week at the Palace. Like some others, we were originally booked at the Beach and were upgraded to the Palace. Initially, we were quite upset about this, as they were so overbooked and I had visions of having no room, but everything endued up okay. We were actually thankful for this, as the resort was about 50% college spring breakers and at least the beach at the Palace was much quieter (the pool and bars....another story). Our room was fair-they are very dimly lit, but you get used to this after awhile. The linens and the shower seemed clean. The water pressure in the shower wasn't the best, and sometimes you didn't have a lot of hot water...warm showers bordering cool. We also tipped our maid a dollar a day and found that our rooms were made up promptly each day. We did however, have to change rooms early into our trip. We were unlucky enough to be right next to some kids that were partying ALL NIGHT LONG. They were blaring music until about 12:30 am, then we had a break, until 4am when the disco closed...at 4am, the music and chants of beer and no parents continued until close to 7am!!!!! During the night, we called security twice (don't even think they came), went over and knocked on their door (didn't help), and banged on the walls (again, fruitless effort). We told the front desk very bleary eyed the next morning and luckily, we had a new room by the afternoon. The grounds were amazing, very well maintained. The beach was very nice, always a nice breeze, at night I wish I had a light jacket at times. There was no trouble getting a chair on the beach, and you could always find a nice spot under a palm tree if you needed some shade. If you walk just past the palace on the beach you will find some flea markets...not sure if it is quite the bargain you are looking for, but fun to browse. If you walk all the way down past the Caribe there is a lovely secluded walk along the beach, great for taking pictures. We didn't spend as much time at the pool...overrun with binge drinking college coeds, but the pool at the Palace was by far the nicest, complete with swim up bar. Oh, but one thing, the hot tub...it wasn't hot, it is essentially a regular pool with jets. The food is below average in general, but we were able to find some stand bys that were good. We ate breakfast at the buffet every morning...the omelets made to order were fine, about what you'd find at any other island resort. They had a smoothie station which was fantastic. There were a lot of mystery meats on display, but that didn't bother us, as we'll try most anything and sometimes were pleasantly surprised. They had these little fried dough sticks (churros maybe?) and they were good, but maybe not everyday as they were rich. We ate lunch mostly at the grill on the beach at the Palace, this was one of the better food experiences if you know what to get. The grilled mahi mahi was excellent. The rice/beans, and paella were good too. You could also get burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, fries, shish kebabs, pizza, etc... These were all about average. As far as dinners go...AVOID THE STEAKHOUSE, the food is just plain bad and the line is insane. What we ordered at the italian wasn't the greatest (lasagna and carbanara), but other people's food around us looked better, we may have just picked wrong there. The fish place was average, that lobster bisque was gross-it was briny dirty water. The grilled lobster tails were fine, and any grilled fish was good. We ate at the Dominican restaurant twice, not because it was good, but because we took an extended nap after leaving the beach and it was the only place open for a late dinner. Again, rice and beans were good, so were the fried sweet potatoes. The rest of the stuff, questionable. By far, the best place to eat was the Mexican restaurant...we were sad we didn't eat there until our last night. The taco/burrito buffet was filled with good items, including a quesedilla station, and then you ordered dinner on top of all of that! It was the most palatable dinner food on the trip. The pizza snack was fine, not a NYC slice, but doable, we had this a few times on our stay. We never felt sick, but did spend ALOT of time in the bathroom. As far as drinks go, if you want a frozen drink, request rum, otherwise it will not be given to you. Presidente is a perfectly fine beer (ask for bottles if you can). The beach bar at the palace makes a shockingly good bloody mary. One big positive...there is plenty of bottled of water around. We never had a problem getting served. We went on one excursion...the Jurassic Safari. It was pretty fun, but a long day. You got an opportunity to see a lot about Dominican life, I'd recommended it.The casino was okay (most games, no craps), poor service at the bar and packed with spring breakers. The much talked about Tropicalissimo show at the casino is really just a glorified version of what you see at the regular hotels, in fact we noticed they were even the same people in some cases. BTW-drinks not included at this show (but you can walk outside to one of the bars and bring something in easily). The disco was fine...again a lot of spring breakers, I almost feel it would be empty if it hadn't been for them. We took the tram once just to check it out, but found it easier to walk most places.If you want to find a quieter place to relax at night, check out the pool bars at the casino or golf, it is an older crowd (meaning non spring breakers) and very laid back. All in all, the trip was average...we may have had a better time if there weren't as many spring breakers.

<Content>Horrible Service at Barcelo Bavaro My girlfriend and I along with some friends spent a week at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Palace hotel. The place is beautiful with a really nice white sand beach. However, I would highly recommend that you consider other vacation resorts before this one. The service at this resort is HORRIBLE. The staff is unfriendly and at times down right mean. I can count the number of smiles we saw from the staff on one hand. Not only are they miserable and angry, they often choose to ignore your order all together resulting in the patron standing around to get a drink for up to 15 minutes. And, this is when the bar is not very crowded.Also, If you do choose to stay at this resort, make sure you lock up ANYTHING of value in the safe, and I mean anything. The housekeeping staff rifled through both mine and my girlfriend's suitcases and stole upwards of $200. We later found out that two other rooms down the hall from us had a similar fate.If you can find a resort elsewhere with a pool and a nice beach, I suggest going there.

<Content>The Palace??????? aka The Dump!!!! We were at the Palace the week of Tue, Feb 28 til(unfortunatly) Tue, March 7, 2006.By Thursday of that week,we had had quite enouph and wanted to come home, but we were stuck!The hotel has seen many better days and is in major need of a redo! Our room which was ocean front and we paid extra for, was in ill shape with musty linens and moldy and leaking bath. The deadbolt was broken and all attempts to have it repaired failed. The air conditioner blows right on you in bed, so you need to turn it off and open the window which has no screen, and then the bugs come in and bite you while you sleep! The Major problem is the food!!!!!!!! The buffet is just awful with unrefrigerated platters of meats and cheeses and sliced fruits covered with fruit flies, cold eggs ,cold pancakes , leftover goat , stuffed pigs feet, greasy vegetables,unrecognizable dishes that had no tags and the servers didn't know what they were either! We never got to the steak restaurant! you must stand on line with your entire party and wait for your turn, for at least an hour and if you get out of line you, lose your turn! The Seafood restaurant was also terrible! The lobster Bisque was the same fish soup as the fish chouder and they were always out of Garlic shrimp! In the Dominican Restaurant they serve you leg of pork and fried pork nuggats which is really just fat fried and a bowl of bones in broth!!!!!I spent Two days hugging the bowl  and spent the rest of the time eating Bananas and low fat yogurt until they ran out of bananas and then I was out of luck! DO NOT eat any of the pasta sauces made with bacon and cream(Alfredo) you will be sorry!The bathrooms in the Casino were covered with excrement with no paper and soap and when I went to call someone's attention to it, They just shrugged!!! The drinks were terrible, the wine,worse! If you want to pay for a Stoli or a Sambuca or any call brand, go ahead, they will take your money, but you won't get what you paid for We wanted to buy some wine, but all the wine that was a reasonable price they were out of all week!We tried to get to talk to a manager, but one NEVER appeared. We also went to complain to the concigere, but he just handed us a form and told us to write to the address on the form,all the while never putting down the phone and giving us his attention. The walks are ill lit by the beach, many areas in complete darkness where one could trip, or God forbid, be attacked!! There are many other things, there is Nothing to do if it rains, the shoppes have no prices on the items and when you get them they are totaly overpriced! This Resort is not maintained. There may have been a time when the grounds were pretty, but not now! The beach is the only thing that is nice, the water clean. That's the best thing I can say about this dump! Also,it seems there is never anyone of authority in charge to speak to. I could go on and on about why we were totally dissapointed with our VACATION this year!Do yourself a favor, Do Not to this resort or any of this complex! It is a total waste of time and money ! Please go ANYWHERE else!!!!!!

<Content>Run... Run to Punta Cana now!! (Bavaro Beach Palace) My boyfriend and I just returned from Punta Cana 2 days ago. We stayed from the time period of 3.9-3.13. At first I was very hesitant due to all the negative reviews that I was reading but I knew when I got back to NYC I would need to write this review to share my opinion.We booked and confirmed for the Bavaro Beach but was upgraded to the Palace upon arrival. The experience was absolutely amazing. Please be open minded and remember that you are going to a Spanish speaking country and also a more slower pace environment. I have never been to a tropical island b4, I usually do European tours.. it was amazing, I came back with a smile on my face. We loved it! Hotel- The room was amazing. Everything was clean and well kept and with a little tip for the maid you can get extra perks.. There were at least 4 storage areas for clothing and a huge closet. There is a his/her sink, iron, bath robes, hair dryer, coffee maker and toiletry. The bathroom was a reasonable size. Water pressure was excellent but the toilet may need an extra flush. If you don鈥檛 like liquid soap, take your own There was also a mini fridge in the room which was stocked daily, with a dollar tip, you can request a little extra. Facilities- The garden and beach was cleaned everyday. The entire resort was well kept. The beach was beautiful. No need to get up early and save chairs at the pool or beach, if you can鈥檛 find one, just keep looking. Just remember to place your towel on the chairs if you decide to get up. I love the beach, the water was clean, blue but a little cold. AMAZING! The pools were also amazing. They are not that deep. Food- We are vegetarians so our options were not as selective as meat eaters. The rice and beans were good. Yes the food was bland but we made the best of the experience. The breakfast buffet at the palace was good along with lunch and dinner. There is an excellent dessert made with crepe, fried bananas and melted sugar. SO GOOD! One night we went to the ITALIAN restaurant, I thought it wasn鈥檛 the best and service was lacking. PLEASE NOTE BRING SNACKS, they are too expensive to buy there. You can get Pizza up to 12 in the night by either the steakhouse or Italian restaurants. The drinks are abundantly filled with liquor. To a point that it may be too much. I think it all depends who your bartender is. So if you want a lot of RUM- MUCH RUM POR FAVOR. I had the pina colada and it was excellent w/o liquor. My boyfriend drank President everyday.Activities- There are many activities for the family and kids that are free, you just have to set sail and look for them. You can canoe, kayak, learn to scuba and so forth. There are dance classes offered on the beach, there is also volley ball games offered, the pool side has activities such as water and regular aerobics. There are many more鈥asketball, tennis, miniature golf鈥?br/>There is a local 鈥渢rain鈥?that runs until 4 in the morning which takes you from one resort to the next. My boyfriend and I would ride around in the night because it was so romantic.EXTRA- Bring sunblock too expensive to buy there, If you need go to the market off the beach. I used bug repellant once, bring a lot of singles to tip (it is appreciated and helps) There were times that some ppl, did not take the tip just because they wanted to help. A smile and hola can get you a long way. Be patient, this is not NYC. Bring snacks. If you can bring school supplies for the kids there, take the OUTBACK SAFARI TOUR鈥?I wanted to go on that tour but my boyfriend wanted to drive his own Jeep 鈥?in the Jeep Safari鈥?so not worth it! Reminder it is not a safari, we did not see one wild animal except for stray dogs! Save your money! If you want to buy stuff.. bargain and don鈥檛 give in.. Walk away and they will come back always bid the lowest price possible.Warning 鈥?you may want to leave real early for the airport or be late. The service is slow and it takes forever for check in. There not organized and slow paced. So get ready for along wait but its okay. You may want to take beverages from the hotel to the airport with you. Once you ckin and clear security there is food upstairs.We enjoyed our experience and hope to visit again

<Content>Despised this Hotel I found this hotel to be the absolute worst I have ever stayed. I found a lot of the the staff surly, the food mediocre, the drinks cheap and unpalatable. My room smelled, the furniture ugly, the lighting dismal (I had to unscrew the lampshades in order to get more light!). The curtains were six inches too long for the window and were haphazardly hung. My only positive comment is that the pool was large and well maintained. The beach was lovely (but that is Mother Nature's doing! Overall, I was so thoroughly disappointed with my stay - hadn't been on vacation for over 2 years and this experience was a total disaster. I have recommended to my friends and co-workers to avoid this place like the plague!

<Content>Mixed review leaning towards disappointment My husband and I stayed at the Palace from March 4-11th. We have both travelled extensively and have visited many all inclusive resorts. We know that standards are somewhat different in the Caribbean and we adjust are expectations accordingly. That being said, we felt let down by several aspects of the Palace.Some of the staff seem to work really hard and are friendly and I think they ultimately get screwed because the vast majority of the staff are rather unpleasant. Just be prepared to check any preconceived notions you have regarding customer service at the door and you'll be okay. Our a/c in our room didn't work at all during our trip despite our numerous requests to have it repaired or our room changed. The wait at the bar for a drink is typically long and some of the staff have a way of appearing to look right through you. There is a wide variety of food from which to choose at the buffet but bring some pepto because this in combination with drinking all day in the sun can be a recipe for trouble. Prices in the shop on the resort will make you do a double take and you will swear you heard the cashier wrong--you didn't. Bring your ownsnacks for the room for this reason if you're so inclined. Mexican and steakhouse restaurants are worth checking out for a change. Line up at the steakhouse by 6:10 or so and make the first seating otherwise prepare to wait in line for an hour or more. You can grab some pizza from the place next door if you're starving which I recommend doing at some point during your stay. Coffee at the resort is fine but bring your own if you are a snobby addict like me. The open air train that takes you around the resort to the Casino etc. is a great way to get your bearings and helps when you can't walk in your heals. You can easily walk around too which is good after all the alcohol and food you'll be consuming.Our room was noisy--we could hear loud noises from the room above us at all hours and were woken up several times. Again, our a/c didn't work and might have helped to drown out the noise. I found our bathroom to be gross. It appeared clean enough on the surface but the ceiling dripped and it had some mold. Use the clothesline in the bathtub if you need to hang stuff up. I didn't notice it until the last day. We were located in block 5. No view to speak of but the gardens are nice and the gounds well maintained.Bring a scrabble board or cards or something to occupy you when you get tired of the evening shows or they are not your cup of tea. I generally go through a couple of books and some magazines too so bring them if you enjoy this type of thing.I have to say, I did find some of the other patrons to be annoying during our stay and this might actually be my biggest complaint. I can see why some of the staff aren't motivated to go out of their way to them. The weather was perfect and the beaches gorgeous. The beach can get windy but the pool was quiet and a nice alternative. Just get there before 9 am or so or you might not get a chair.Oh yeah, brings some one dollar bills for tipping. When staff does go out of their way for you, you will want the option of showing your appreciation.Have a safe trip!!

<Content>March 6th week My wife and I just returned from a week at the Palace. The weather was beautiful.Pros-Right on the beach-Water and sand were beautiful-Close to the airport-Grounds kept very clean-The beach grill on the far left of the Palace was great-The steakhouse is worth the wait in line (be there at 5.50 pm)-The food was good, you just have to be selective. I always found something to eat, they have quite a bit of selectionCons-Language barrier if you don't know Spanish-Staff, especially bar staff will serve you potentially if you wave $$. It got really frustrating waiting to be served-Felt at times we were being a burden-No priority with the staff, our a/c didn't work the whole week. Complained twice, no one came-Over-priced snacks--$7 for Pringles, $3 for a small pack of MM's-Beach was really windy, not sure if it is alwaysWould I go back? Probably not. I'd like to try somewhere else.

<Content>Bavaro Palace A group of 10 just returned from the Bavaro Complex, for my husband and myself it was out 2nd trip to this resort. We were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded from the Beach Resort to the Palace. All in all, the complex is nice, the beaches are wonderful and the food is pretty good. One word of caution - drink lots of bottled water and watch the food preparation, making sure your food has been cooked all the way. We found the staff to be friendly and plenty of activities for everyone in our group to enjoy.

<Content>Palace Bavaro- Not as good as expected I just came back from 4 nights at the Bavaro Palace Punta Cana. I was dissapointed with the installations, the room and specially the bath really need an update. The service was good with the exception of the front desk. The food OK nothing special, and the drinks often look like diluted with some water. The best thing the beach, crystal and blue water with white sand.

<Content>Ultimate relaxation We got back a week ago from our second time to the Palace. Last year we only went for 5 days, and did not get to really experience it all. Let me first say that when you check in and your room is not ready, don't worry about your luggage. Even though it is sitting in the open, it is very safe. You get your wrist band immediately, so you have access to the bars and resturants. We prefer building #4 or 5. Our room both years has been very clean. They mop the floor daily. I agree with other reviews that the buffet is where you want to eat. Mornings, get fresh omelets- just remember to tell them no oil or very little. Everything is made with olive oil. That can get a little old after a while. For dinner, you can choose your own chicken breast, pork chop, burger or steak for the cook to prepare. Only takes a few minutes and it will be done well and be hot. Also, for lunch, the best is La Pina grill, located next to building #6. Again, fresh meat to order, salads, and even french fries!! Next to the grill (not on the Palace grounds) is a marketplace. It is all bartering. Be prepaired to have everyone want you to come to their booth. The ones we dealt with were very nice. Whatever they are asking, offer 1/2 and then go from there. No one at the hotel seemed to know how many cigarettes we could bring back to the states. As long as they are for your personal use it didn't matter. Marlboros for $18 per carton.! If you are a snacker, bring along your own. Also, we discovered last year bring ketchup and maybe taco sauce. We also brought our own thermal coffee mugs. Great way to keep your drinks cold! The beach was fantastic. Long walks 2-3 times daily. We have not done many other Carribean trips, but we would deffinitely do this again.

<Content>what a disapointment Where do I begin? To rate the check in,dining room,rooms, service,food,drinks, entertainment,language?We booked through SunQuest tours in May for the wedding in November.We were re-routed because of Katerina from Mexico to Punta Cana. The reason for the trip was a wedding and there were thirty six of us.First we stayed at the Barcelo Beach because of availibility.We caught a 6am flight(AIRPORT AT 4AM),arrived at nine and at 4o'clock we were still trying to check in...great start.The fact that the staff spoke little or NO English didn't help.We were assigned our rooms at 4;30 were refused entry to the dining room and we all went and slept. Next day,we changed hotels, same story.We went to our rooms at 4;30.Two days wasted with checking in.The rooms were large but there was mould everywhere,we couldn't sit on the balcony because it faced a garbage station, couldn't leave the patio door open because there was a bar 100 feet away from the room and the music was very loud,the beds were changed twice during our weeks stay.The wedding was to be on Monday and by then everyone was sick,the food was plentiful but basic hygiene was deplorable, birds flying around the dining room,a roasted turkey appeared on Monday, sat out all through lunch,in the heat and appeared wednesday as turkey a la king completely dried out.The meat for BBQ-ing sat out raw through lunch and supper and then was cooked the next day.The wedding planner was a disaster and everything the parents were promised(like flowers)didn't happen and everyone was upset.You also have to pay 2.50 us for one immodium tablet when you are sick. This is a place that 36 people would never recommend after spending a horrible week.

<Content>I wish I could go back right now! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace hotel from February 19th to the 26th. We are both 22 years old and overall we had an excellent vacation! We booked through redtag which is an online company located in Toronto ontario Canada. It was about $3600 for two people which occording to several other people we spoke to is way less then they paid. So if your Canadian check out redtag! We found the food in the buffet to be very good and we got the breakfast cooks to make us eggs over easy and omelettes fresh every morning which were fantastic! I recommend checking out the banana bread on the pastry/fresh bread table by the front gate. The main buffet restaurant is located across from the pool swim up bar. It is a beautiful open air tent setting with a magnificant view of the beach. We tried the mexican and steak house restaurants that are included in the package as well, which are located at the beach resort. I would say the mexican you can get at the buffet at the palace is better. They have an italian, asian and mexican station with cooks to serve you in addition to alot of prepared food to choose from. The mexican restaurant at the beach does not compare unless your looking for a mexican buffet with even more selection because the food you can order off the menu is not that great. I would say the steakhouse is worth going to but you should go right at 6:30 if you want to get in because its really busy. If there is a long line and your hungy there is a take away pizza window right beside the front of the steakhouse. You can take that to go after like only 10 minutes or eat it in line as an appetizer! a perfect portion for two. Our favourite restuarant was la brisas which was located right on the beach beside our section of the resort. They have good seafood like lobster, shrimp and squid. We stayed in room 2071. Which was beautiful and though it was a gardenview room did have a beautiful view of the beach when looking off the balcony to the right. We did find that there were a few ants in our room but only because they liked to get into the sugar for the coffee they provide with the coffeemaker. That was in the bathroom and basically in another room then were the bed is. I did find that I had itchy bites on my skin but my boyfriend didn't! I have quite sensitive skin and my parents warned me that I could get bites from sand fleas so if I go to the DR again I will remember to bring some calamine lotion. Such bugs are after all a part of running around in your bathing suit in the sand all day! The wonderful staff, especially the barcelo life staff who are so much fun and non stop entertainment, made the itching a minor irritation. We were both sick one day from being in the sun to long and drinking too many pina coladas. Pepto bismal helped alot and is a very important item to bring from home because the food and drinks are very different then what most people are used to. They hose you in the gift shop for such items so also remember to bring extra sunscreen because it was 28 American dollars for a small bottle and 8 American dollars for a large bag of Doritos or Sunchips. I did see several guests complaining about not getting exactly what they asked for and being really rude to the staff so I will just say that when on vacation you should lighten up and tip for good service, treat people with respect and enjoy! If we ever go back to the DR we would stay at the palace again but I like to try new things. I just hope the next resort can live up to or top my fond memories of the Palace! Happy Vacationing from Kingston, Ontario Canada

<Content>Just returned from Barcelo Palace My wife and I just returned from Barcelo Bavaro Palace. Overall we had a great time.The beach was beautiful and the ocean was clear and fairly warm. The beach was crowded but it was never a problem finding beach chairs before 11a.m. If you want to snorkel your better off going on a separate excursion as their isn't much to see near the resort. The resort was clean and the grounds were kept up very well. The rooms and especially the bathrooms needed some maintenance. This did surprise me since the resort was only about 7 years old. Our first room in building 6 overlooked the back of the beach grill/bar which had trash bins behind it. We got another room in building 5 relatively easy. The food was average. We didn't have any problems with the ice in our drinks. The staff was friendly and helpful. The 2 guys that ran the activities were hilarious. Do a couple of the activities. My wife won 2 bottles of rum. Come to think of it I didn't see many guys win. Hmmm! There's a great restaurant called Jellyfish if you're looking for a break from the resort food. It's about a 5-10 minute walk down the beach. Dinner was about $15-$25 but you can also just go for a drink.Your trip is what you make of it and we were satisfied with our vacation but we will stay somewhere else if we return to the DR.

<Content>Bugs! I will have to say the best thing about the resort is the beautiful beach and the grounds. They do an excellent job at presentation which helps the stay go much better. The rooms are musty which after reading the reviews on, it was what I was expecting. The thing I did not expect were bugs a lot of them. My legs were covered with bites, we even switched rooms which again had tiny crawly things all over. I can understand a bug or two but this was way more and I was bothered by a lot of itching which did not make the rest of the trip enjoyable.

<Content>Our most perfect vacation ever! We just came back from the most perfect vacation week we ever had. The servicewas great, peoples were nice, smiling, and always willing to do what you asked.I must say that when asking with a smile and trying to ask in spanish always gave us a smile and a pronounciation correction, witch was great! They reallyseems to apreciate our effort to speak their language. The food was just great!We had fresh juice every morning (they make it in front of you by using the fruitsyou choose). And every night, I had the pineapple and banana flambee. Everything was always fresh, the fruits were ripe and juicy. The service was constant, fast and efficient. The beach was beautiful and most of all,we never had to look for a chair or had to reserve it to keep one since there'splenty of them and never crowded (compare to other resort where you had to beon the beach before 8hrs to have a chance to get a chair!) Now for the not so great (witch is really not that bad!) First, the coffee is reallybad and since we knew about it, we brought our own! (there is a coffee machinein the room) we even brought our cream (with a little bit of imagination to howto keep it cold!) also, the humidity smeel was easy to fix with some Freebreeze!We are planning to go back next year to the same resort. We even chose our room to get the best view on the ocean (2083 or 2084).

<Content>I'd go back in a Heartbeat! My Positive Reactions: We just got back from Punta Cana Barcelo Bavaro Palace. The staff, service and food were all excellent with a huge variety to please all. The front desk personel spoke English ( and many other languages) very well. And most staff could understand the basics in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian. They always had a smile on their faces and were always ready to help and please. The accommodations are spacious and clean. The room temperarture and conditioning were fine. The room beverages were replaced every day. Daily activities were fun and yoga on the beach everyday was so relaxing! We made so many friends with the staff and other visitors from all over the globe. There was local music and dancing shows avery night. The grounds were impecable. The landscaping was beautiful. There were no pesky bugs at all during our stay. There were lots of beach chairs. At the Palace you can go, eat and play any where within the Barcelo resort which I think is less expensive than staying for less at the other Barcelo hotels and paying extra for certain restrants, beverages etc.Mildly negative comments: If anything here - is that the quickness of service at the bars is laid back, but everywhere I've been in the Caribbean is the same way. My sister and I did experience slight stomach cramps at the end of our stay, but again, that seem to happen every time we go to in areas south of North America. Parents of young families should be aware that some women sunbathe and walk the beaches topless. (10% or so)Overall - I reccomend the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. I would and will go again.

<Content>One of the worsts hotel in Punta Cana Well, after reading other reviews, I decided to choose this one since it was big, had a night club and my girlfriend and I are in our later twenties and wanted to party....First of all, noboday speaks any English at all!! I do speak some Spanish and really had to remember a lot just to get by. Our room was dark and had tacky flowery type curtains; the furniture was old and falling apart; the lighting in the bathroom was terrible and the shower/bath area was rotting....however, no one could prepare me for what happened next...I pulled off the covers from the bed ready to get a good nights rest and their were ants EVERYWHERE!! Now I did notice some on the ground when we first came in, but sometimes you see that in tropical environments..however, in my bed I could not deal with...so after about 30 minutes, they finally switched our room to a better room; a little brighter, but still not to live up to the name Palace. The food was not that great, it all tasted the same after the first couple of days...everyone was rude, especially the woman...I asked for syrup for the pancakes one morning and one of the girls at the hotel totally snapped at me...Bottom line, there are many other hotels that I researched while we were there that were 20x better; especially if you're young and single #1 would be Ocean Bavaro #2. Club Med #3. Sunscape on the Beach; top three best hotels w/great rooms, service and food as well as a great nightlife; I really hope this helps you decided on NOT staying at this hotel!!

<Content>Dec 20-Dec 27 Nice Place to Stay! When we first arrived to our hotel, we were put in building 4. The room was dark and really, really musty. Instead of complaining like all the others who have bad reviews, we had our room moved immediatly. We were placed in building 2 on the third floor overlooking the pool. The view was great and the room didn't smell at all. The lighting is a little dim but who stays in their room anyway? Temperature was a little difficult to control so we just left the air on with the balcony door open..no biggy.The food was great except for the red meat, which was goat. My partener and I did get sick. We think its because we ate the fruit thats washed with their water.The pool was great. Very clean. I always was able to get a chair. The staff was so nice and stock our fridge with water and beer every day. Not many people do speak English though.The nightly show was good the first time around but it got to be pretty repititious.I know it sounds like I'm complaining but really, when you go to a different country, you can't expect it to be the same in the USA. Goat is what they eat, the countries water isn't treated well, they don't have the best electrical systems, the people speak Spanish not English and its tropical so sometimes the room might smell. Actually, there were so many French people there when I went, I spoke French more than Spanish and English combined.

<Content>Wonderful family vacation Our children are in their early 20's and we went on our last family vacation at the Palace. We were originally booked for the Beach hotel, but were upgraded. We had a wonderful time. The beach front is the best maintained of any Carribean area I have ever been to. There are lot's of chairs available at the ocean, but chairs do become tight at poolside in the afternoon. The room's were clean and maid service was excellent. The entire resort was well maintained. Staff were polite and helpful when approached. I always felt safe as there were security people around in area's that were more secluded. There were activities available all the time that were appropriate for many age groups. The food was well prepared and the well varied. It was great to be able to use all the other resort hotels facilities also.

<Content>Heaven on Earth Heaven on Earth is the best way to describe the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. It is beyond five star in our opinion. I was a little worried about making the reservation after reading some of the other reviews. We stayed December 31-January 7 and this was the best trip we have ever taken, our room was very large, a stocked refrigerator with Sprite, Coke, water and beer that is included in the price. Everything was kept spotless. All of the employees work very hard to make sure you enjoy your stay and they always have a smile regardless of how many hours they work everyday. The beach was beautiful the water is so many different shades of blue and is so clear you can see you feet. Workers rake the beach everyday. There is a wonderful resteraunt at the far end of the beach by building 6 and they have wonderful food you just tell the chef which meat you would like from the cooler and they grill it fresh we had steak, shrimp and grouper daily for lunch and it was delicious and the best part is that it is on the beach you don't have to worry about getting all cleaned up to eat lunch just go in your bathing suit. There is a flea market next to the resteraunt and it is a blast bargaining with all of the locals they will tell you a price and then you can usually buy it for one third of that price. I bought ceramic domenican figurines three for $90 and in the gift shop they wanted $95 for one. The gift shop is very expensive on everything for example Pringles potato chips are $8 we took snacks with us after reading some of the reviews about the gift shop prices. We went to Manatee Park it was alot of fun and only $25 a person including transportation. We used Hotel Beds for our transportation they are wonderful!!! We made our reservation using Expedia and they had an option for round trip transportation to and from hotel for $38 for both of us and it was well worth the money when we arrived at Punta Cana airport they immediately took our luggage and we got in a nice airconditioned mini van and while at the hotel we received help from their representative about money exchange,and other excursion offers they speek English which is very nice when you have a question. I purchased a Spanish/English hand held interpreter at Walmart before we went for $18 and it was very helpful. Don't bother taking a lot of clothes we didn't use over half of the ones we had packed. When I first looked at the website I thought we would need alot of dress clothes and you don't. The pool is beautiful it has a swim up bar and fabulous drinks. Everything was perfect: the room, the food, service, the grounds, the beach and the nightly entertainment. If you are looking for the vacation of a lifetime this is the place!!!!

<Content>Got married at the Palace and loved it A little background, my wife and I are both professionals from Boston in our late 20's and we got married at the Palace in Feb 2005. We travelled there w/ her parents, 25yr old brother and my sister and brother-in-law and their 1yr old daughter.We really enjoyed our stay. We wanted a place w/ great weather, a great beach, clear water, a huge pool, a pool bar, and the less kids the better. We think the Palace was the right choice. Basically every day my wife's brother got up at the crack of dawn and reserved prime pool side chairs. Then we'd have a late breakfast and start sipping on cocktails by noon. We'd move freely back and forth between the pool and beach. We usually grabbed a light lunch at the buffet. We'd keep drinking all day, go back to our rooms and shower at 6-7pm, meet down in the lobby to play cards and have cocktails for another hour or so, and then proceed to dinner at about 9pm. We wanted to eat later to avoid the lines and crowds, which we generally did. I find if you cosume alcohol on vacation, you will have a better time. That's a little background on us.The beach was incredible, but you do need to get out there early to get a prime seat. The beach was somewhat windy in the morning, but the wind died down after lunch each day. The weather was absolutely perfect - it could not have been better. Every day would start out w/ bright sunshine, and then clouds would usually roll in from 11am-1pm, and then all of the clouds burned off. So if you are a sun lover, I'd recommend hitting the pool or beach early to maximize your sun time. The beach was everything that we hoped it would be.Regarding the pool, my wife thought that the water was a little cool, but nobody else had a problem w/ it. The pool was clean. There is a section that is geared for kids, so we didnt have to deal w/ little rugrats running around us, which was nice. The poolbar is decent, but more often than not we had to hop out of the pool to grab a drink. My brother-in-law and I participated in a spirited water polo game one day, which was fun. We made some friends at the resort, namely Al from Everett, and there definitely were some other people there w/ the same mindset as us.The gym is very small - limited free weights, a creaky bench, a couple bikes and stairclimbers, and that's about it. It's okay if you just want to stay loose, but if you are a hardcore weightlifter, it's not the best. We took paddleboats and kayaks out each day to get exercise. The kayaks are great.The beach was great for walking and running though. Very safe and clean. Flat.We were happy w/ the service we received as well. Our philosophy is that if you treat the staff w/ respect and smile, they will respond in kind. Regarding the room, our first night we were not happy w/ our room, but we were upgraded the second night to a room w/ a nice view of the water. A strong recommendation is to leave a note and $2-3 every day for the woman who cleans the room. Every day she would bring us a six pack of beer and 4 huge water bottles. So by the end of our stay, we had a stocked fridge.Regarding drinks, we didn't have a problem getting drinks anywhere at the resort. Sure, at some points we had to wait a minute or 5 minutes, but I am fine w/ that. El Presidente is the beer of choice. Regarding food, the breakfast and lunch at the Palace is fine - everyone can find something to eat. After 7 days you start to get sick of the food, but what can you do. Great fresh omlettes in the morning. I liked the french toast sticks. The orange juice is incredible, maybe the best I've ever had. My sister is a vegatarian and she always had options. When in doubt, go w/ the chicken. The food at the pool side restaurant was somewhat sketchy. All of the cheese that we had was pretty nasty, so we learned to stay away from it. The chicken fingers were good.There is another restaurant behind the pool, and we had a couple good meals there - all of the chicken dishes were good, especially the fried chicken. I like to try different foods, but don't order the goat, it's nasty.My favorite restaurant was the Steak House. When you order there, absolutely order at least 2 entrees, if not 3. My brother-in-law, father-in-law and myself all ordered 3 rib eyes for dinner one night. Then we went back and ordered the same thing for lunch a couple times later in the week. The onion rings are good there too. We had dinner at the Seafood place after our small beachside wedding, and it was good. The staff was very accomadating and very nice couple from WI sent us a bottle of champagne. We were able to play our wedding CD on the stereo, which was a big hit. We also really like the Mexican place - it was a fun place w/ a couple different things that everyone liked.We had lunch down at the beach side restaurant, and the steak and chicken were good. The pizza was kind of gross, again because the cheese down there is sketchy.In looking at the other Barcelo properties, the Palace is by far the nicest. We took a snorkeling trip one day, and that was the only time we left the Barcelo properties...

<Content>Mixed Reviews----Rooms close to beach but very smelly! Just returned,after a 5 night stay.Lovely setting! Large, stately resort + staying at the Palace permits use of all restaurants.January is a great time to visit, few bugs yet 80+ days to enjoy.First arrived into room + experienced the very bad musty odor. Wasn't hot weather in the 6 days, so high humidity wasn't an issue. Found the problem comes from the air conditioning unit! When air is off + door wide open, the odor disappears. Being a 3rd floor room, we slept with door open + air off, otherwise the bad smell was too intense. (This odor problem was in all rooms, not isolated to our building.) Clearly,a newer,efficient air conditioning system would resolve this, as the current system is original! Rooms + bathrooms could use updating, but are large.Food + service was very good, activities limited but the convenience of close beach access balanced all out. Learn some simple Spanish phrases before you go. We took along a small pocket dictionary.Stayed in building 2, away from noise yet close to activities. ***** Intend to write a letter to Barcello Corp. office, pertaining to poor air conditioning system as dampness/mold issues are serious health concerns. Hope other former guests will do the same, as more written letters will draw attention + contribute to changes being implemented!

<Content>Paradise We were there for two weeks. We stayed at the Palace Hotel. We enjoyed every second of it. The beaches haqve white sand, the ocean is crystal clear and the food is pretty good too. I am 22 yrs old and I went out every night to the local disco, got wasted off of the free booze (all inclusive), met a bunch of people from all over the world, and then came home between 3 and 6am. I forced myself to wake up early to get max. sun, then slept on the beach for a bit. The activities are great, the local people very friendly (a lot friendlier than in Mexico), and the there is always local music being played. I have to say that I did not want to leave. I came back to USA very depressed and want to go back asap! The people I met there will never be forgotten. I Love Bavaro Beach

<Content>Christmas at the Palace Just returned from the Palace Hotel. We were there from 24 Dec to 31 Dec. Overall we had a wonderful time and the staff bent over backward to help us.I have always found if you can say a few words in there language it will get a lot in return. The whole conplex was keep spotless. They raked the beach daily.Our hardest decision there was where we were going to eat. There was four in our party and not one of us got sick from eating. If you cannot find something you like to eat then it is because of you and not the hotel. Our only complaint is the air appears to be on a timer. It would run for 20 minutes then go off for 20 minutes. The room was not hot, but the cycle did make sleeping interesting. I would also recommend the Tiki half day reef tour. One of the best times I have had. Overall, I would strongly recommend the Palace.LW - Penscola FL

<Content>A very nice getaway, we will be back First of all, I would like to say that I am glad that I did not pay much attention to all of the negative feedback that I read before going. My husband and another couple spent the week of Dec. 4-9 at the Palace. I must say that the ride from the airport to the resort made us think that maybe we made a mistake. However, once we passed the gates into the resort, our fears were replaced with pleasure. At the desk where we checked in, we were greeted with smiles and was even given another room on the first floor which made it easier on my legs. On entering our room, I opened the curtain to reveal a view of the ocean, I was a happy woman. The room was clean, the vanity area had 2 sinks which is always nice. The refrigerator was stocked with beer and soda and restocked each and every day.  Most of the complaints that I read before we came here were mostly about the food and the staff. I wonder if those people stayed at the same place or that they are just negative people. If anyone can't find something good to eat in this resort, which consisted of many, many restaurants, then I don't know what thay were looking for. I am not saying that ALL the food was great, but for the most part, it was very good. Steaks and porkchops cooked while you waited at the buffet. Omeletts made fresh with any ingredients your little heart disired. A very nice steakhouse I believe in the Beach Resort, all sorts of desserts and ice cream. The list goes on. As for the staff, we had lots of fun with them. They always had a smile, and if they didn't, it was probably because they were up from the wee hours of the morning til late at night, making sure we were taken very good care of. The language barrier was almost fun. Let us not forget, we are in their country and they not only serve us Americans, they also cater to many,many differant nationalities. Should they be able to speak French, German, Italian and so on, I think not.  It would have been nice it the pool stayed opened later than 6 o'clock. I myself like swimming at night. The grounds were imaculate. All the palm trees were decorated with white Christmas lights. This was the most relaxing vacation and I loved the fact that we did not have to get all dressed up to go out to eat. My husband and I are already planning another trip back. If anyone is looking for a relaxing time, good food, friendly people, this is the place to go.

<Content>Not worth title Palace We have just returned from 2 weeks at the Palace. This was the first and the last time. This was the third time we were in Punta Cana. The only thing okay was the food. The service in the restaurants and bars is bad, they don't speak English, not trained waiters they have to learn the skills on the job, rude behaviour, headwaiter shouts at his waiters in front of the customers. We asked the frontdesk for a blanketand after 4 times asking and 10 days waiting we got it. The minibar was never refilled. The coffeemachine in the room did not work and after 3 times asking and4 days waiting it was replaced, but still it did not work well. The interior of the room/bathroom needs a real makeover. We asked seasight and third floor we got garden en first floor. In the other hotels the service was very friendly, frontdesk called us the next day if everything was okay and if not you could change to another room and at dinnertime a manager asked us if everything is okay. Because they were fully booked we choose the Barcelo Bavaro Palace Hotel, but not worth calling it a PALACE

<Content>Would never Go Back Stayed at the Palace 12/4/05-12/10/05. Our 3 rooms absolutely stunk of mold/dampness for our entire stay. Bathroom looked like something from the 1980's. The waiters, hotel staff, bartenders, casino personnel are the nastiest hotel employees we've ever encountered. We tipped liked crazy, not singles either, and you still cannot get a smile out of these people. Good luck getting a question answered- nobody speaks English. How do you check into a hotel, ask for directions, try to order a soda, try to get a cab when no one speaks English. Try ordering room service...they practically hang up on you and tell you to call back later. Turn on all the lights in your room and you're still in the dark. I know this sounds crazy but you can't believe how dim the room is at night. Then comes the construction...don't plan on sleeping past 9:01 because I promise you will be up from all the banging. We've done a great deal of traveling and have never experienced this. MANY others at the hotel were experiencing the same things. Save yourself alot of aggrevation.... go somewhere else.

<Content>Great Resort We just returned from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana. We were re-routed to the DR after Hurricane Wilma hit the Riviera Maya. There were 15 in our group, ranging in age from 68 - 4 years old. We have traveled to many places and I have to say the beach at the Barcelo is by far the most beautiful I have ever seen! Unlike many reviews written, I found the staff to be extremely accommodating and pleasant. The front desk re-arranged our pre-assigned rooms so we could be next to each other. We don't speak Spanish fluently, but I would agree that anything you can do to try speaking Spanish helps. I think the staff gets a kick out of our poor attempts, but they definitely appreciate the effort! The rooms were decent sized, bigger than those we had in Jamaica or the Riviera Maya previously. The maid service was exceptional, we had flowers in our room every day!The food was good, but not great. Once you figure out what the buffet has to offer you will be pleased. There are made to order omelets in the morning, pasta and grill items (including salmon, calamari, steak) each lunch and dinner. They also will prepare tacos which are actually more like fajitas during the day. They have wonderful rotisserie chicken by the grill, but you have to ask for it. On some days, they also had made to order stir fry. The bananas foster crepes for dessert were wonderful!Our favorite sit down restaurant was Las Brisas, the seafood restaurant. The staff was exceptional, bringing more lobster before you could even ask. Sure, sometimes they forgot to bring one appetizer, but you're on vacation and should have no worries, just simply remind them and they accommodate you.The drinks at the bar were okay. Most came without alcohol unless you requested it. This is not a problem, just something you need to remember.The activities were not as organized as previous resorts we have stayed at. The Iberostar Paraiso Beach in Riviera Maya definitely had more activities, however we always found something entertaining to do. There was beach volleyball every day, dance lessons, etc.The one thing about this resort that we loved was the fact that the coral reef sits just off the coastline, causing the waves to break out a ways in the ocean. This allowed the kids to be in the ocean playing every day because they waves were always very gentle at the shore line.No one in our group got sick from the water. We were careful to use only the bottled water, but had ice in our drinks, etc. and were fine. We did use the bottled water to brush our teeth, just to be cautious.We did tip our servers and maid every day. They are so appreciative of this. The poverty level in this country is amazing, so anything we can do to help them is wonderful. We also had taken some candy, gum and small gifts. These all brought smiles to the faces of everyone! Our kids commented on how good it felt to be able to help other people - what a wonderful lesson for our children!I would highly recommend this resort. Please keep in mind when you're on vacation anywhere in the Caribbean, relaxation is the key. If you expect the Ritz, you will be dissapointed no matter where you go.

<Content>Not Sure If I wouls Stay at this hotel My sister, mom and I just got back from vacation at Punta Cana, DR. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. Not much of entertainment. The people at the front desk are rude, they do not acknowledge you are speaking to them. The public relations desk and phone service Very Poor. Room service poorThe food was decent. The service in the restaurants,not all, but most of the waitress seemed very unhappy and rude. POOR!!We enjoyed our Tour company assigned to us, Prieto Tours, our guide Esequiel, Very informative and professional and friendly. The tours he recommended was good. The casino was small and dirty. Most of the machines didn't work. We informed an employee, nobody came to fix. No beverage service. not pleased.The Mexico Lindo restaurant, over rated. Didn't like it at all. The wait to be seated was way too much and the food was terrible. Not worth the wait.I may come back Punta Cana or other island at DR However, I don't think I would stay at this hotel. It seems they cater to European people more than the USA people. Its too bad, because I don't think I will recommend this hotel to any one I know. Its really too bad, because our stay at the hotel help the city's economy.Cristy

<Content>Very Beautiful Resort First off I would advise all visitors to this island to spend a little time and money to obtain a small workable Spanish language knowledge. The hotel was beautiful and the staff did their best to accommodate us. We went there with a group of 19. Originally schedlued to stay in Playa del Carmen. When the hurricane hit, our travel agent went to work to obtain us an alternate site. We had deluxe accommodations, every one of us. We had eight doubles and one triple. All of us were given suites. The bartenders seemed to be a bit overworked, and were not over friendly, but we learned to deal with it. The restaurants served a large variety of food. Under stand we are Americans staying in an international resort. It took us a couple of days to learn where everything was regarding the hours of the restaurants etc. After we knew where and when, everything was OK. The food was above average. The only restaurant that most felt was below average was the mexican restaurant. Some of us were a little squeamish after our meal and the next day. We asked everyone in our group if they would come back to the resort and unanimously Yes they would.

<Content>Had the best time of our lives!!! My husband and I went to Barcelo Bavaro Palace in August for our honeymoon and had the greatest time ever. When we arrived, we were greeted with an ice cold beer (which was so refreshing in the heat!). The front desk people were so nice and accomodating - they gave us a room that was practically on the beach. The weather was perfect the entire time we were there - it was warm, but a cool breeze was always blowing. We had plans to do so many activities, but ended up just hanging around the resort, we loved it so much. The beach is unbelievably gorgeous - we were in awe every time we walked outside. The people that work there couldn't be nicer - by the end of our trip, we felt like we had new friends! It does help to speak a little Spanish (I spoke a little at the beginning of our trip, and my husband was able to speak a little by the end!). We practically want to live in Punta Cana now - we just couldn't say anything nicer about it. We normally go to Hawaii, and while it will always be dear to our hearts, Dominican is the most beautiful place we have ever been. And the food was very good, by the way. It's definitely different, but delicious. We will definitely go back (with friends and family!!).

<Content>Will never return or recommend!!!!! Where do I start? The service was terrible, the employees are not happy to be working there nevertheless are they happy to attend your needs, the hotel is way to over crowded, it takes forever just to even get a bottle of water by the pool and if you want a beer or drink it takes twice as long, there is no service provided while you are at the beach and if you want something to drink you need to get up yourself and go get it at the pool bar where there is always a ridiculous line to wait!!!, the food was nothing to be excited about I eat better at home, the lines to eat at night at the different rest. are super long (we would wait an average of 25minutes to over 1 hour), the food areas feel dirty and not fresh, the show at the casino was horrible (we got up and left after about 25 minutes along with half the theatre), we were at the beah hotel in line for the mexican rest. and there was a huge fight between two very large groups of over 30 peolple so I went to the front desk to call security to handle the situation and no one ever bothered to come and the front desk seemed bothered by the fact that I asked them to take care of the problem, I can go on and on but the bottom line is that it was a waste of time and money to go here on vacation. The hotel is extremely overated and overpriced don't waste your time!!!!!!!!

<Content>I loved this place I read a ton of reviews by people and all i can say is you people have no idea what your talking about....Everyone complains they dont cater to Americans....Well I'm a white male from New York and i would def. go back in a heart beat.... the food was great, to people who say they cant find anything, obviosuly you didn't eat at the caribe buffet... they have italian, mexican, japanese and a meat stand... you can get all the hamburgers, fries, steak and chicken your heart desires, or you can pick from 10 different pastas, 5 different sauces and mulitple toppings(garlic, onions, bacon)... the steakhouse was excellent, steak was always cooked the way i wanted it.... the seafood place was hit or miss, one night was great, the 2nd nite was bad....there are 15 restaurants, including pizza stands you can eat at, buffets always include roasted chicken, rice, pork chops, so for a person to say they had a hard time finding food, then they must be picky.....the beach was absoutely beautiful, perfect weather, beautiful white sand beaches with a ton of activities....banana boats are only $7 a person, and parasailing is $65 for two people(well worth it, and very cheap)now on to the language barriers.....people if your so concerned about people speaking english, then go to miami for beaches, your visiting a foreign country, thats what traveling to another country is about.... if your worked in a hotel in North Carolina and a guest who only spoke spanish approaches the desk, would that person be fair in saying the hotel stinks because nobody there speaks spanish?.... i understand your paying good money, but dont forget your a VISITOR in their country.... And then americans wonder why the rest of the world frowns down on us, we expect everybody to cater to us no matter where we are.... how many of you fellow americans would say to somebody speaking spanish, this is american speak english? well say thing goes for DR, learn a little spanish and adapt to your surroundings, experiencing the culture and learning is what makes traveling the world great....people complain about the heat.... if you want AC in lobby's and cant stand humidity go to Alaska.... the whole point of going to a DR is to visit a caribean island, newsflash, it's going to be hot....and many of the guests there are either american, european(spain, germany, poland, england) and brazalian....one other thing, i must say, their are a ton of topless women on the beaches....within the last year and half i've traveled to Las Vegas, Jamaica(mongeto bay), San Fransisco, Orlando, Baltimore....I stayed in top hotels in all those places and this place by far was the most enjoyable place....

<Content>What a costly disappointment!!! This is a lengthy review that I hope will discourage you to book your vacation at this resort. I wish I had listened to others and not stayed here.I'll first start with the positives - as they are fewer in number!The beach is beautiful - the ocean water is shallow for about 20 feet, and has a completely sandy bottom. The water is warm and the 'seaweed' is not the slimy stuff usually found elsewhere, and it is raked away all day by a crew of workers.The sand is white and soft and not so hot that you burn your feet. The beach loungers are plentifuly and comfortable. There is some shaded areas for those who prefer to stay in the shade, but they're taken fairly early in the day, so plan accordingly.Now, on to the not-so-positive:The resort is nice enough - maybe a 5 star in Dominican standards, but definitely no more than a 3+ by most standards.The rooms are average in size and upkeep - the musty smell must be a by-product of the 70 - 100 % humidity. The air conditioner worked well, but was hard to regulate to the ideal temperature (either way too cold or too warm).And finally, on to the negative:This resort most definitely caters to its own!! I would not say they are anti any particular nationality but more that they are pro their own (or at least all those that spoke spanish or any derivative i.e. cuban). We went out of our way, especially after reading some of the comments here, to attempt to communicate in spanish from the moment we arrived at the resort. The staff at the reception desk was less than welcoming to say the least. They could barely be bothered to check us in. As a matter of fact, we were passed over 2x by staff until a gentlemen half-heartedly checked us in. The females at the front desk were rude!!! beyond belief. I even asked if speaking Italian would be helpful, since I couldn't speak that much Spanish and the two languages are similar. Other than for 1 staff member, that was met with complete hostility too.Our first room was a joke! It was in building 1 (along with building 3) which is the worst building to stay in. The balconies on all the rooms other than those that directly face the ocean (oceanfront only, not oceanview) are half-balconies. They are a small traingular shape!! After pressing the guy at reception 3 x more the next day, we were moved to an oceanfront room in building 2. Same room setup, but full rectangular balcony right on the beach (same money - go figure).The food - very disappointing!! The Palace is considered the best of the resorts, yet the food left a lot to be desired. We thought that breakfast was the best meal offered at the palace - unless you are really into Dominican food all the way. The buffet at the Beach Resort was fairly well rounded. The Steak House was decent - ask for your steak no more than medium, otherwise its very chewy. And definitely get there by 6:30 or so, otherwise you'll be waiting in line a long time. P.S. There were a couple of spanish speaking groups that came in the restaurant from the beach looking to scoop a table or two without having to wait in line. The Italian restaurant at the Caribe was OK. La Brisas, the seafood restaurant, was OK. Don't know what all the rave was about re: the lobster they serve. Mine and my husband's lobsters were small and overly grilled, and the garlic shrimp I ordered on the side were no bigger than salad shrimp and were very chewy. Drinks - they may be tasty, but for those of you who like to drink and get a buzz be warned - don't bother with mixed drinks because they have next to no alcohol in them. I only drink for taste, so this was OK because I could drink several Pina Coladas and not feel in the least bit tipsy. On the whole, you pay a lot of money for an all inclusive meal plan that is very dissatisfying.The staff - rude, condescending, inconsiderate, unaccomodating, and totally ok with you watching them treat 'their own' like kings and queens. In the 8 days and 7 nights that we were there, and in the 5 resorts that make up the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort, we encountered only 3 staff who were pleasant, kind, helpful and courteous. The rest, in the bars, restaurants, shops, public relations, tour desks etc. were pathetic. Especially the female staff - they didn't even try to hide the fact that they would look you up and down once or twice first before deciding if they were going to even speak to you. Keep in mind, these same staff were smiling and serving spanish speaking guests all around us at the same time that we sat and waited 10 minutes for cutlery so we could eat our food, or 20 minutes before having a glass of water poured, or our drink order taken.Lastly - Tropicalissimo - they say its like a Vegas show! pleeaasse!! If you like raunchy, over sexed, untalented people - by all means, go to the show. Vegas offers beauty, talent and barely dressed showgirls. Tropicalissimo offeres very barely dressed girls.All in all, by the 2nd day I was wishing I had gone somewhere (anywhere) else, by the 5th day I couldn't wait to go home, by my final day I started getting downright rude right back!!!Please, look at another resort!!!

<Content>Needs improvements I just got back from my trip to Punta Cana (July 9th - July 16th). This is my second trip to Punta Cana - this time we stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. I must say that it was a disappointment. The beach was nice, but the hotel room needs great improvement. The smell of humidity was sometimes unbearable. The entertainment cannot be compared to what it was last year. No much music - compared to last year where the merengue music was constantly. The service at the restaurants is really bad. The hotel was short on personnel. The waiting was long at the restaurants and in addition to that, we had to ask for napkins, silverware and water all the time because the waiters and waitresses did not placed them on the table or simply forgot and we had to ask. In overall, this year the Palace has really gone downhill. I do not plan to go back next year. It really needs to be improved.

<Content>Terrific getaway My husband and I decided last minute to take a trip to the DR in Feb. We booked through Unitedvacations and after a few mishaps with that we were a little worried (also with reading some of the postings). But when we arrived we were thrilled!! It was so beautiful. The year before we stayed at Casa de Campo in La Romana and this was so much better. We are experienced travelers who stay at some of the best hotels in Vegas and we could not find much to complain about regarding the rooms. Yes, the bathrooms were a little outdated and musty but this is the tropics and humidity is a problem. The staff was very friendly and given the fact that neither of us speak ANY Spanish and we are visiting ANOTHER country we got along just fine. The food overall was fine. We did the buffet for breakfast and a few times for lunch and for dinner we mainly ate at the seafood resturant. We did not experience any stomach problems at all (bottled water to drink and brush teeth). The best part of staying at the Palace is that you have access to ALL of the other resorts. I would not even consider staying at the other locations because of that. My husband and I were looking to get away for a few days and just relax without any hassles and we were able to achieve that at the Palace. The beach was great and the pool was so beautiful. We will be going back hopefully in January.As with any vacation, the time of the year makes a huge difference in the experience. We have been to the DR twice now, once in Feb and the other in March and both times the weather was great. No bugs at all!!!I would highly recommend this resort and this comes from someone who is very hard to please when it comes to sleeping accomadations!!

<Content>Stay at another Hotel The Barcelo Bavaro Palace had some good and bad. First, let me say we have been to several other all-inclusive hotels and never had any issues. This hotel is not for Americans if you do not speak Spanish! The front desk only speaks a little English and it was tough finding waitstaff who knew English. In one restaurant we were asking for the bathroom, restroom, toilet, etc... and the waitress had no idea what we were saying! This is not a 5 Star Hotel - 2 maybe 3 Star! We stayed in Block 6 and had an ocean view room. The room was large and the air conditioning worked like a charm! We left small gifts for the maid and had a clean room and stocked mini bar everyday. We also had an alarm clock (many others did not) and a modern TV. The bathroom was a little worn looking. Nice and quiet even though we were right next to the stairs!If you are a picky eater - you will lose weight here! We loved the Mexican restaurant located at the Beach - but get there before 7:00 p.m. or you will wait in a LONG line! The Steak place was also pretty good! We did the buffet for breakfast and the Dominican Restaurant for Lunch. The French Resturant (not-included) was also pretty good and had fantastic service! Not sure why, but we both ended up with diarhea (I even brought my own bottled water) - my husband still has it, 1 week after our return! Immodium hasn't helped at all! The doctor says it was food poisoning!The shopping at the flea market was nice and they spoke some good broken English! Be ready to barter! We also went on a Jeep Excursion and had a lot of fun. Be prepared if you go any tours - bring a large bag of candy to pass out to all the kids you pass. We had one 12 year old hop onto the back of our jeep and not get off until we gave him something (crakers from the buffet). The weather was gorgeous and the pool was great (quiet in comparison to the pools at the other hotels). The grounds were kept manicured as was the pool. We had a nice time in paradise but will not be returning to this Hotel or any Barcelo hotels. PS - At check out we were given one price in American Dollars but when the credit card statement came in, the amount was higher.

<Content>Ignorance is bliss  Okay pay attention.I am not arrogant or bigoted, or at least that is the way I percieve myself, but this place was and is the absolute PITS.80% rude service, or they just plain ignore you.Watch the tour operators attempt to rip you off on what is inclusive in the package.Nobody speaks English if they do it does not run pastDONT WORRY, TRUST MEFood good, on a good night...not consistent, actually saw a waiter pouring from a couple of drinking glasses (already used)...hence on reflection that is why I was sick for the majority of my stay.Families stay away actually saw pool entertainment having 4 year olds mimick stripper moves, I am not prudish by any stretch of the imagination, hello parents where were you, juiced up on a couple of rums!I was there a week three of those nights I was disturbed by hammering on my door of a drunk demanding entry, security with baseball bats...do me a favour.Apparently my sources tell me a couple of years ago Venezulans frequented this resort, along with a high % of Europeans.....they are now gone.The most popular group now are low class hispanic groups, who leer at anything below 60 in a bikini, who have a preponderence to scream at each other in normal conversation, and perceive themselves as D TRUMPS pushing ($1) bills across the bar..yeah I'm impressed.Loud obnoxious frequented by the niave and ill informed.No Euros frequenting the resort around the resort, tells story in itself.Note the infrastrucure of the ride to the resort its 3rd world status no other way to tell it, this island has been in the tourist industry for years, major corruption folks don't support it.I could go on but it would be futile, Mexico You get more bang for the US buck..if you are selective and know the Hotel group.Stay away from this nightmare.

<Content>Wonderful Place to Experience!!!!! We had visited Barcelo Palace for our honeymoon June 27-July 4 and We absolutely loved every minute. I have watched the forums for 6 months now so this review might be a little lengthy. Let me start off by saying that we traveled with vacationsexpress and they really took care of everything. We are both 24 years old and love being active.Check In/Out: Piece of cake. Vacation Express took care of everything for us. We checked in within 2 minutes ( which they took care of) and were in our rooms in 5 minutes. Check out we did ourselves but only took 5 mintues as well. Could not have been easier.Rooms: Wonderful. They are very large. I had emailed the resort 2 weeks before requesting an oceanview room and got it. Brand spanking new tv with english channels. The air conditioner was nice to come into after spending the day outside. The bathroom had 2 vanities which was great whne we were getting ready at the same time. Always had hot water, but again after being outside all day cool water was preferred which we had also. We tipped the maid $2 each day and she did a wonderful job. Stuck a dollar in the mini fridge each day and it was filled to our desire.Beach/Activities: The beach is the most amazing thing I have ever seen (way better than Cancun and Cancun's is very nice). The palm trees go out to the water. All the pools were nice too. There was a little more activity at the pool, but we preferred the breeze off the ocean. There was so much to do we didn't even get to do it all. We diid go on a excursion through Vacation Express called the Carribean Festival. Best thing ever for all ages. . You got to drink play games and dance. So much fun. The best past wa the snorkling of it though. You not only get to swim with fich, but also sharks and stringrays. Amazing. I watched the weather a month prior saying that it was going to rain. It rained once in 7 days for 5 minutes. The weather was awesome.. Hot but always a cool breeze. There was put put golf that was real fun and my husband also played golf while I drove the cart. Let me tell you bring your own balls and golve. Two things he forgot and cost $40 just for the two things. This is wear they get ya. At night there is a disco which is fun. There were all aged people here which was pretty cool seeing the older crowd shaking their rump. Remember you'll never see these people again. The casino is a waste of time. Little and boring. There is something called a Tropicanisma show at the casino that you get reservations for free. So cool. They sit rum and coke on the tables and you get to make your owe drinks.Staff: Very friendly. They were very polite and energetic. Of course we saw those guests that were used to the Ritz Hotel's and first class everything and thought the staff was being rude, but all they try to do is help everywas possible.Food: There are so many places to eat it is not even funny. There are so many choices of what to eat also. The steak and mexican both at the beach hotel were are favorite. The buffets were great for breakfast, but we tried to stay away from them at night. You never know how long the stuff has bee sitting out. We were fine until about the 5th day when our stomachs started to change and I was glad to have the immodium. They use a lot of oil when they cook so it tore out stomachs up. I wanted a candy bar so bad on the 5th day I paid $3 for a snickers at the shop. This was the only problem we really had ut again not until the 5th day. Bring snacks we did and we ate them all on the 6th and 7th day. All in all we had a blast. There were 2 other couples through the same tour on their honeymoon too. We all had a lot of fun, just again after about 5 days you want some McDonald's or a $3 candy bar. We would go here again in a heartbeat just for maybe 5 days though. Have fun and keep an open mind, you are in a third would county. This is why you traveled to find different authenic culture and excitement.

<Content>Had a great time. My family and I just returned from a fabulous week at the Bavarao Palace.I do agree that the rooms were humid and musty, however this is unavoidable due to the climate at this time of the year. The air conditioning was super cold and we turned it off when it got too cold. The room was poorly lit and could have used additional lights. The room was cleaned daily and the refrigerator was stocked daily with water, soda and beer. We never had a problem with our valuables and kept everything locked in the safe. We used tap water for brushing our teeth and never got sick.The food was only an issue for my 7 year old son. He did not like the milk as it was too warm. He survived on pancakes, cookies and french frys. The rest of my family always found something to eat at all of the resturants. We especially enjoyed the omlet and juice staions at breakfast and the Japanese station for dinner. We asked for maduros (ripe plantains) and the chef immediately grabbed some ripe plantains and made them for us. The steak house was also very good. The pizza was hot and delicious. I found the Italian resturant to be the worst place of all the resturants. I do agree that if you are not accustomed to eating latin food that your choices were limited. Plantains were a staple at every meal. We never had a problem finding something to eat. Speaking Spanish is definitely helpful. Fortunately my family speaks Spanish so we never had a problem. I found that many of the staff knew English and spoke in English and Spanish. Even the vendors in the shops at the end of the beach knew some English. The shows were entertaining and you didn't need to understand Spanish to enjoy the music. The beach and pool were great and chairs were always available. The drinks were good the tap beer was always cold. Overall, we had a great time and are planning to return.

<Content>Not the place for Non-Spanish speaking people The weather was gorgeous - even though the forecast showed a 60% chance of rain everyday we were there - We didn't get any rain! We were married on the beach with a beautiful background! The wedding coordinator (Franscesca) did a a fabulous job! That's where the praise ends! We arrived at 12:00 and were not allowed to check-in to our rooms until 3:00 p.m. (we had been up since 3:00 a.m.). We decided to walk the beach and have some lunch. When we returned at 3:00 - our rooms were still not ready and we were told there was no room available for my mom! No use complaining, since the front desk people speak almost no English! We located a manager who finally got everyone a room! We have been to MANY other all-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico and have never had any problems! The food was mediocre (The Mexican restaurant was pretty good), at best, and the service was terrible if you can't speak spanish - They ignored us if they couldn't understand us! We spoke with other couples staying at different resorts (Breezes) and there was no language barrier - The Palace (and all of Barcelo Bavaro) are Spanish owned and operated, which could explaing the lack of English! We had an OK time but will not be returning to this Hotel!

<Content>Not worth the price! I am 17 and recently went with my parents and little brother along with good family friends to the Barcelo Palace and I have never been so excited to come home from a vacation, although it was not THAT BAD. I was skeptical going after reading some of the reviews and unfortunately some of them were very true. This resort is simply not intended for Americans and I am sure there were other resorts in the area which cater to Americans more. This place advertised as a 5-Star but it was a 3, at bestCheck In-Took at least an hour to get it right and I can speak pretty good Spanish after taking 5 years of Spanish. Go figure!Rooms-Very big and spacious. Nice big TV with good channels. The fridge was always well stocked. However it seemed impossible to get a perfect temperature in the room but the air conditioner was very quiet. The beds were rock-hard which was an inconvenience. It really does not matter which block you stay in. We had rooms in blocks 4 and 6 which are ideal for peace and quiet. I must say I was not disturbed by the noise at all but that could be because I did not sleep until late every night. Overall, I can say that I have stayed in better rooms but this one was nice.Dining-This is were it gets wild and crazy. We basically lived off the fried rice, some seafood, and these chocolate things at the buffet. We all found the FEW things that were OK and lived off of them for a week. The Mexican place was probably the best restaurant on the property but it took a while for the food to come and the line was over an hour-long one night so we left. The seafood place was not that bad. My dad loved it and he is a huge seafood fan. I also like seafood but was a little dissappointed. Every other place is basically a joke and not worth the time. The drinks were nice and although the legal drinking age is 18 I could get whatever I wanted. Take some snacks from home unless if you want to pay $8 for a bag of Doritos or $9 for pringles.Pool/Beach-Everything relating to the pool/beach was immaculate. Everything was very clean and well-maintained. Also, the grounds of the complex were very clean. The guys in the green do a great job of keeping the place very nice. No complaints with cleanliness or the pool/beach.Entertainment-The crew that worked in the day worked hard to try and make it fun. There were lots of activities but sometimes they did not start on time. DO NOT waste your time with any of the shows. I guarantee you will leave in the middle of it. We went to the big show at the casino called Tropicalissimo and left after about 15 minutes. You could see other people walking out as well. By the end of the show, I could have safely said that all Americans had left the show. The disco clubs were non-existent as far as we were concerned. The big one was pretty much empty and the little one next to the lobby at the Palace had all of about two people in it on a good day. Also, I went during the NBA Finals and it took us 5 days to find out what channel it was going to be on and when we did find it there was no sound and poor picture quality.Other Activities-Everything not power-related is included in the package. I heard that the paddle-boating and kayaking were nice although i did not try it myself. The tennis courts seemed very nice but were wet at times although the rain was not a big problem. The golf course was worse than the local muni course and is not worth playing for free. Also, the cart costs $25 per person which is definitely not worth it.Recommendations:1. Tip! It will give you the best service. Bring lots and lots of singles.2. Go to the market next to the Block 6 to buy anything and bargain like your life depended on it or you will get ripped off worse than the gift shop. You can usually get th market people to drop their price by about 80%.3. There were more mosquitos than I expected. We all had at least 10-15 mosquito bites when we came back and the do not go away for like two weeks. My advice is to take Malaria pills.4. Take snacks so you are not ripped off and so you can experience the occassional good food.5. The sun and heat are big problems. Protect yourself accordingly with lots of sunscreen and hats. Try to stay inside during the peak hours. Also, the only two places I saw air-conditioned were the room and Mexican restaurant.6. Reservations are highly-recommended for the Mexican place and Steakhouse. Unless if you want to wait for an hour outside.Overall-This is not a place we would go back to or recommend to any of our friends. We even had some doubts on the destination as a whole but I am fairly confident there were other places nicer than this in the area. I definitely do not recommend this place to Americans. The language barrier can get to be too much at times. We usually take cruises for vacations but decided to go all-inclusive Caribbean this time and were dissappointed and bored after 7 days of the same thing. The 3-star rating I gave might be a little too nice but it seems appropriate. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

<Content>What an icky place to visit After much deliberation over where we should take our kids for a lovely, relaxing and luxurious vacaton, we decided the New Carribean hot-spot, Punta Cana would be a great choice. Having been to an all-inclusive resort in Cancun and not being completely satisfied, I did extensive research to decide which place to stay. The Barcelo Bavaro Palace Resort is one of the top rated/5-star resorts on the island. Additionally, it is the best resort of the 5 on the Barcelo grounds. Well, I have never been so disappointed in all my life. Whoever (Apple vacations) decided this is worthy of 5 stars is seriously deluded! I will break down the number of issues:1. The Domincan is way too humid to travel to in June. The dampness permeated everything, including the dank hotel suite (we even upgraded to a suite to ensure our vacation would be deluxe!) I do not know what it is like other times, but forget it in the summer. Don't waste your money.2. Hotel Suite - actually, the suite was a good sized 2 room with 2 full bathrooms. We had 2 nice sized T.V.'s with dish network and a lot of English speaking channels. It was kept a clean as possible daily, by the maid service. We had plenty of towels, etc. However, you could not get a comfortable room temp. (the humidity again was an issue). We froze in there. The bed was the hardest thing ever! I woke up at least 3 times a night because I was in pain (I am only 33). The bedspread stunk of dankness so badly that I had to kick it off the bed b/c/ it was all I could smell. The bathrooms were fine. Hot water and good pressure. The patio provided a beachfront view that was pretty, but again, it's not like you could sit out there (too hot).However, it would have been so nice to have a comfortable resting place to relax. 3. Service - check in was bedlam. There is no organization at the desk. You just saunter up - no line or anything. There is check out, check in and questions all occurring simultaneously. Good luck finding someone with a command of English - if you really need to make yourself understood. Most of the workers do not speak ANY English, just so you know. Also, you can't even walk through the general area without being hustled by the minions of excursion employees and various other people trying to take your picture for 8.00.4. Food - Oh my lord, this is by far and AWAY the BIGGEST problem. Of course, you expect some differences but the food was unedible. I actually lost 5 lbs. while I was there. If you have kids, as we do, there isn't much for them to eat. Plus, all of the restaurants are OUTSIDE. So, there are tons of fly's, mosquito's, etc. There are also ants crawling on the fruit carving displays. You could have some meats freshly cooked, which we stuck to - but remember- that gets old FAST. Since all the restaurants are outside, the smell of the food permeates the entire resorts. If you get the lest bit sick, as we did, the smell will turn your stomache the moment you step out the door of your room. The Steak House at the Beach Complex (right next door) was O.K. At least they had plain baked potatoes. There are no recognizable condiments. The ketchup, dressings, mayo, syrup is awful. If you insist on going there, hit McDonald's and stock up on those little packets. I wish I had.5. Activities/Amenities- The pool was very nice, clean, large, warm. You had to be in it every waking moment. There are plenty of beach chairs but the padding gets BLAZING HOT and you have to put a towel down or you'll hurt yourself. There are a lot of activites all day long. Lots of music and dancing going on. It is all in Spanish, so we were'nt sure what was going on. The fitness center was jst a room with free weights. We did not use the Kids Club. I am pretty sure it was not included (we were led to believe it was) and it didn't looked organized or fun. The tennis courts were nice. we did not golf. There was no mini-golf on the premise that I saw. There are some kayaks and paddle boats that you can use. Oneday, there was a man scuba diving in the pool - I think that was included, too. Everything else will cost ya. 6. Casino - They told my husband that there was Hold-Em Poker but it was just 5 card draw against the house. Boring. The casino was fine otherwise. 7. Medical Infirmary - Unfortunately, I was so sick that I had to use it. It was at the Beach Complex, next door - which I walked to because waiting for the tram and then beating the other guests to the seats was not for me. The doctors were nice but the rooms were scary. They had paint peeling off the ceiling, water dripping from the a/c, flies...ugh. I had to get an IV. They did not just stick me and hand a bag of fluids, oh no. She stuck me and then PUSHED the fluids over a 15 minutes torture session. Plus, they were trying to convince me that I needed to go the actual Hospital. I was like, no way.I just don't understand who thinks this place is nice. I will ntoe that there were a lot of Hispanic Americans there and they seemed to be having a lot of fun with their families. We all got diahrea, nausea and my daughter got a fever. This place is ideal for no one.

<Content>Stay Away from Barcelo Palace DR Total Disappointment would be the best way to describe my experiences at this resort, along with the other Barcelo's. Staff was rude and on several occasions verbally abusive! They are totally anti-American. Food was terrible, and even made my husband physically ill for one day. Room was OK and in need of light bulbs. Although, even when all lights were on, the lighting was extremely poor. Forget about it if you have even the slightest sight problem! Children were allowed to run rampant and wild with no disciplining from parents or staff. We came back to our room after dinner and found the safe wide open even though we're 95% sure we locked it before leaving. Although we suspect a small amount of money ($150.00-$200.00) missing, we could never prove it. Since this is an all-inclusive, we are positive that we did not spend this amount in 3 days! Because our camera, binoculars, and credit cards were still intact, and there was still a small amount of cash left, theft could not be proved and we took the loss. For the remainder of the week, however, we removed all valuables from the safe and took our chances with our locked luggage. The only positive things we found with this vacation were the beautiful beach and gorgeous ocean water. We will never return and will not recommend to others!!

<Content>loved Barcelo We just returned on 6-18 from a 7 nite stay at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace thru Apple Vacations. Our family loved it. We have stayed at the Barcelo Maya in Mexico and loved that too. Please disregard previous comments. You do need to drink bottled h20 and brush your teeth with bottled h20. We never were sick. We did bring Pepto Bismal with us and did not use it. The staff is friendly and always trying to please. Some know very little English especially the maids, grounds keepers, and restaurants. But with gestures and broken English they help you. Before we left, we practiced a little spanish with a computer disc. My husband and I know very little spanish and we survived. The grounds keepers are wonderful and will even chop down coconuts occasionally and give you a fresh coconut to drink.The beach is absolutely beautiful. A week before we left, I emailed requesting a beach front room, since Apple Vacations only provided garden view rooms .I even mentioned we would pay for the upgrade. Ireceived an email promptly back stating they would do what they could do pending availability.When we arrived, I brought the email note they sent me and they gave our family room 4019 which was only 10 yds from the beach. The view from our room was awesome. there was no extra charge for the upgrade. The sliding glass door was stiff but if you pushed at the bottom it closed securely. It was quiet at nite. It was humid until you turned on the air conditioner.The food was fine. Especially the oatmeal, oj, and smoothies in the morning. The buffet was fun to experience different foods. Snorkeling could have been better. Yet my husband found some sea anemomes that were beautiful off the beach.The speed boats got noisy at times. The sailboats were fun. My daughter and I loved the kayaks.There is a market nearbypast bldg 6 thatwas fun to go shopping. They had jewelry and souvenirs.We enjoyed our stay and the beach was beautiful

<Content>Beautiful Beach and Hotel but Wouldn't Go Back My husband and I just returned from a week trip at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort on June 1. The beaches and the resort itself were absolutely beautiful and we loved them both. Despite the beautiful view of the ocean, we probably wouldn鈥檛 go back. The staff, unlike a lot of the reviews, was pretty friendly (when they could understand you).This island is definitely not an English speaking island and we knew that when we booked the hotel. However, my husband and I thought only of communicating with staff in regards to the language barrier. The problem was all of the shows, pool activities, etc. were all in Spanish and we got so frustrated because we couldn鈥檛 understand what was going on that we didn鈥檛 hardly participate in any of them.My biggest complaint was by far the food. My husband and I saw the hotel pictures on expedia and thought that with all of these restaurants that surely we could find something to eat but we were wrong. We pretty much lived on fruits, vegetables, and desserts most of the week. My husband is one who can pretty much eat anything and there were a few times were he couldn鈥檛 stomach eating anything that he tasted and walked away hungry. It was awful! At least the weight I lost before the trip didn't go back on while I was there...gOur room was in Building 4 and we were so excited because it was close to the pool, lobby, and had a beautiful beach view. However, every afternoon and every night about 10 PM, the base from the microphone and music was blaring from the shows by the pool and the pool activities until around midnight every day. After two days it was starting to wear on my last nerve. I couldn鈥檛 even hear the TV in my room with the door shut due to the loudness and thumping of the noise and music coming from the pool area (let alone that all music was in Spanish and I couldn鈥檛 understand it). The gift shop by the lobby is ridiculously expensive. They sell magnets for $9 and sunscreen for $55. There is a flea market on the beach right past the Palace Hotel where you can get alcohol, cigars, shirts, sunscreen, and other items for tons cheaper. Use American dollars for more bargaining power. They will not give you good deals in pesos.Just a few recommendations from my experience:1. There are no clocks in the hotel or your room other than the lobby. Take an alarm clock and a waterproof watch to keep track of time.2. Take a raft to lie around the pool in. There are none provided and it is so hot you mostly want to be in the pool to keep cool. I bought a $3 raft for like $20 at the gift shop there.3. They do not automatically add rum to some of the all-inclusive drinks so you have to ask them to add it everytime you get a drink. I keep drinking banana coladas and wasn't getting a buzz and then I figured out why. Also, the island beer is the Presidente and you will have bottles of it in your mini fridge. However, the tap beer is a generic brand even though it does say Presidente on the outside. Put $3/day out with a list of what you want in the mini fridge and housekeeping will hook you up.4. Make sure to take plenty of 50+ sunscreen because you will need it. My husband put 15 on the first day and got so burnt he had to stay out of the sun for two more days.5. Take some type of hat (for girls and guys) so your head won鈥檛 get sunburned. I took a visor and both my husband鈥檚 heads and mine are peeling.6. Take plenty of ones and fives because ALL change is given back in pesos and they rip you off on the exchange rate. The only ATM is at the Dominican shopping center between the Caribe and the Beach and they charge $5 each time you get $$$ out even though they don鈥檛 tell you and the money is dispensed in pesos.7. We went to our family doctor and got a prescription of Cipro before our trip and took it while we were down there so we wouldn鈥檛 get sick and it worked awesome. Many other Americans we talked to had gotten the traveler鈥檚 diarrhea while they were there and they were miserable for at least one of the days they were there.8. Take snacks to eat so if you don鈥檛 like the food you have something else to eat. I bought a snack pack of 4 Chips Ahoy cookies and it cost me $4.9. Take bug spray and plenty of aloe or aftersun.We did an excursion called the Macao Crazy Wheels for $50/person and it was well worth the money. The excursion was 4-wheeler riding where it took us to a cave to swim, a beach, and to a ranch to try coconuts and their juice. My husband and I rode one together and it was a lot of fun. I am not the 4-wheeler type but it was nice seeing the Dominican countryside and how they live.The Barcelo Bavaro Hotel would have been nicer if more of the language was in some English and the food was somewhat tolerable. The view is something that is awesome and better than most places I have been in the Caribbean. If I spoke Spanish, it would definitely be a place that I would return.

<Content>Horrible Just back from this 5 Star resort mascarading as a Motel 6. The service is horrible but could be improved if they had a drink machine in the restaurant. Now if you ask for a coke the waiter/waitress has to go to the bar and wait for the bartender to serve them. Most of the personel is very rude and slow. The exceptions are Natan (correct spelling) at the front desk was very helpful and the pregnant waitress at the Steak restaurant also helped alot. The rooms are plain as a motel six and the beds are hard as nails. At the bar (by the pool) a good portion of the music deals with subjects my 9 year old does not need to hear or see. Lot of songs having improper language (ie cuss words, sex acts in detail. rape)The kids club is almost not existent and was of no help. They should not claim a kids club at all. VERY DISAPPOINTING.To all of those who are thinking of coming here, DON'T, CHANGE YOUR RESERVATIONS FOR ANOTHER RESORT.

<Content>Very Enjoyable - It's not the US - Be open minded to other cultures We just returned from the Barcelo Palace (May 20-23). This was our second time to The DR and we enjoyed it again. We stayed at Paradisus last time. If you are looking for a bit more inclusive (Premium Liquors, Snorkeling, Horseback) to the All inclusive and have a little more $$$...Stay at Paradisus. Otherwise sit back relax and enjoy the great Value of the Barcelo Palace.Rooms: Had a room mix-up initially. Others in the assigned room. After going to the front desk and laughing about it...We were assigned to a beach front suite within minutes (Be Nice...Mistakes happen). Rooms were humid due to the climate of the DR...Bring some scented candles and enjoy. Clean ..Well stocked Mini Bar..etc...Staff: Mostly friendly...Have fun with them...try a little Espanol they will treat you great!!! Staff are people too!!! Some of the women staff may be a little jealous if your ladies are tooooo cute, but we experience that at home too...Order the drinks when the ladies aren't around :-).Food: Marginal - But with 13 restaurants, you can find a few great treats. Mexican was great...Along with the opportunity to order 5 lobsters in one sitting as my buddy did at LaBrisa...The pizzas are wonderful as well.Snorkeling: I am picking about other used gear...Big Lots or Wlmart has smorkels for under $10 bucks, but them , pack them.. The trip was cool...Make sure your stop by the shark cage.Entertainment - The hardest work crew I have seen in a while the Espectacular was 2 hour of non-stop entertainment fun!!!Tips - Relax...Enjoy other cultures, tip a few bucks to your maid...Leave request for things En Espanol.Peace Out---

<Content>Disappointed Just returned from the Bavaro Palace (5/22-29, 2005). I'm not one for taking pen in hand (keyboard in this case) to share my experience, but felt compelled to do so. This place is so overrated it's not funny. When you sign up for an all inclusive you expect to get quality food and drinks. This is not the case. The food was subpar and the local beer and spirits were about the same. You can do something about the drinks if you want to pay more, but you're stuck with the food.We took all precautions to avoid that stomach thing to no avail. Didn't find one other tourist that fared any better. I read a lot of mixed reviews before I booked this trip but took a chance anyway. Would never go back.If you want to contact me:misterb124@optonline.net

<Content>It was nice but would'nt go back to any Barcelo Resort I just returned from my vacation from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana. I arrived on May 25th and left on the 30th. The weather was very nice and the view is spectacular but that is all I can say about it. I found that the workers there are very nice unlike some of the reviews. I don't speak very good spanish but I got by and I always recieved a smile. The food was awful I am sorry to say. If you eat there stick with the chicken. I ate at the bohio(near the pool) and had the grilled chicken breast with bbq sauce and the chicken fingers and the cuban sandwich. They were all good. DON'T EAT THE HOT DOGS and PIZZA it was awful. Don't go looking for a great meal cause you wont' find it there. We ate at the steak house on the beach resort and the italian place as well. I liked it. We ate at the La Brisa a lot. Didn't try the french place(cost extra and didn't sound appetizing the menu). Please ask the front desk which restaurants are closed on which days. Cause we found out the hard way. DO NOT BRING ANY BRAND NEW SNEAKERS WITH YOU.... I met a couple that had her husband's brand new sneakers stolen. She actually saw the guy on her balcony but didn't think it was her room. They were compted a night at the french place along with her family. BUT she ran into another family(wife, husband and two kids,girl and boy)and they each got a pair of sneakers stolen. Yes including the kids sneakesr. KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE SAFE.The rooms are ok. nothing specatular. I stayed in bldg 3 which I liked cause it was close to everything no need to walk far to get to a room. Just remember there is no A/C anywhere other than your room. All in all I wouldn't go back. it was nice but thats it.I hope it helps. Write me if you need more details. red_hot98@hotmail.comI hope this helps.

<Content>Great Place to relax Just got bace from a week long stay at the Bavaro Palace. It was our honeymoon and we had a wonderful time. The room was clean and the staff was very pleasant. We also enjoyed the beach volleyball and water polo. The only complaint that I might have is that the food made our stomachs a little upset. Make sure you bring some immodium or pepto. Also be sure to bring everything with you from sunscreen to bugspray. The hotel charges $25 US for sunscreen and other items that normally would cost $5. All in all we had a wonderful time enjoying the beautiful beach. I would recomend this hotel to my friends and family. One other note; be careful if you book a fishing charter. We did from Baracuda charters and they did not have the best fishing tackle available. We saw other boats with the appropriate takle and they all caught fish(white marlin). We did not catch anything! Good luck

<Content>Stay Away Its Bad Just returned May 21st 2005.Remember we traveled with two other couples and they had different problems with their rooms. In one room the toilet did not flush and they could not get it repaired properly. The volume on the TV in the other room kept going on an off and the sliding door did not slide. Their list of problems is longer but I don鈥檛 want this to be to many pages.I will list our complaints in no particular order. We requested a king size bed and we were given two doubles.We had to request maintenance to unclog the drain of our bath.We had a sliding patio door which did not slide instead it had to be muscled back and forth.We had to request wash cloths on more then one occasion.In general our room was old, worn bed spreads, bars of soap that stunk, damp cold sheets always.The tile floors throughout the resort when wet were a disaster and especially at the buffet. The floors were so slippery we could not walk we had to shuffle. Standing in one place I had to strain to hold my feet together if I relaxed they would slide apart. We saw many people with casts, braces, slings and in wheelchairs because of slips and falls.When we asked for alcoholic drinks at the buffet we were told we had to go to the bar and get them ourselves. It seemed the bartender at the pool had a look of disgust whenever we came to order drinks. Food and drink orders were rarely correct. We constantly had to ask for dishes or drinks that were ordered but not served including water.On a path that went through a restaurant and separated the cooking area from the seating area they moped the slop from the floor of the cooking area across the path and just left it. It made my wife gag. This happened twice and we did not eat at that restaurant or take that path again.A very large portion of the employees were rude. It appeared that the rudeness was directed at the very few Americans that were there.We requested masks and snorkels and were given one mask and one snorkel. We were told that鈥檚 all that was left. The weather was not nice that day and there were perhaps thirty people on the beach. I saw absolutely no one on the beach with any mask or snorkel. To top it off the snorkel we were given had the teeth grips chewed off.All inclusive did not include the French restaurant at our hotel nor the Italian restaurant at the Casino hotel. (At Melia there were no such restrictions) We gave up looking for any other nice restaurants. By default we ate the majority of our meals at the buffet. Not exactly what we had in mind when we read the property had 15 restaurants.We had to pay for what they considered premium alcohol. (Again at Melia there were no such restrictions) I do not consider Smirnoff to be a premium vodka but they did. We ordered and were charged for Absolut vodka shots and I can tell you we did not get Absolut but instead some very cheap house brand. At the airport one of our group was requested via the public address system to report to a gate 7 for identification. He and his wife left their carry on luggage and souvenirs with us and they went to gate 7. After about 15 minutes we became concerned that they did not return. We all carried our luggage and theirs to gate 7 to find out what the problem was. When we arrived at the gate his wife informed us that he was escorted away to the baggage area by military personnel carrying automatic weapons to search his luggage that he had checked in. His wife was very upset and after about another 15 minutes had passed we all became very nervous. When he returned he explained that they made him wait and then searched his luggage and then did not give him any explanation. We would never recommend the Barcelo Bavaro to anyone and the incident at the airport has made us decide never to return to the Dominican Republic.

<Content>Palace was great Just got back from the Palace on May 13th. We were there for 5 days. It is a beautiful place. Beaches and resort property are very nice. Hotel room was nice and clean, only complaint about the room, was the damp feeling of the sheets all the time(but it is because of the humidity, they do change sheets daily). The food- the best in my opinion were La Brisa(Palace) and the Steak House (Beach). The buffet at the Palace has a really good breakfast, but that is about it. The people at the Palace are very friendly and helpful. They made our stay very enjoyable. We went on two excersions- Santo Domingo- was not that enjoyable. Spending about 9 to 10 hours in a bus is never enjoyable. We just kind of whizzed by things and the Columbus museum was closed on the day we went which was a Wednesday. Would not recommend this day trip to anyone.Jurassic Safari- Was the best time. Our guides Roberto and Alex made this trip very intresting. We had such a great time and learned some also. The boogie boarding at Macao beach was the best ending for such a great day! Hope this helps! I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Barcelo Palace the best Just got back from a week at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace, in Punta Cana, and must join many others in allaying your fears about this place. Had one excellent week there. Beach and Pool phenomenal; service excellent all around; food very good at the free restaurants, i.e Bohia, Dominica Rincon, etc, but phenominal food and atmosphere at the French (Chez Palace), and the Spanish (La Fuente) in the Casino Hotel; yes, it costs $30 additional for the French restaurant and $20 additional for the Spanish one, but well worth it and really enhances your vacation to dine at these fine restaurants.Only went on a two hour snorkeling trip, which costs $25, and it was great fun; I heard that the 4 hour trip on the bigger boat was even better; shows at night in the Palace were fine; nothing much to rave out about but relaxing. Tropicalissimo Show at the Casino fairly good; If you like golf, great- played 3 rounds- cost me only $25 for the cart each round. The Bavaro Disco is great, particulary on Fri and Sat nights; the other discos like the one in the Palace is always dead with little action. The train gets you around the resort, fairly quickly, and, at night some of the trains play music, adding to a festive atmosphere. The casino dealers can be a little gruff and almost-un-pleasant, particularly, if you win; the best advice- just play the 25 cent slots and have some fun. There is no Spa at the Hotel, which I missed, but you can get a good massage, and other treatments at the Salon across from the Beach Hotel. As far as health goes, I did not see a mosquito, even on the golf course. The first day I did get a little sick, and spent some extra time in the bathroom but bring the Pepto; it will serve you well. I had drinks with the hotel ice in them and really had no problem; all the restaurants serve bottled water, and you can get extra bottled water in your room; just request from your maid. The rooms were beautiful, well air-conditioned, no creatures, and a nice view of the pool and beach, and nice balcony. Although rooms were quite nice, bathrooms were very plain; no jacuzzi's or hot tubs. I spoke with a lot of people who said that the best hotels were the Barcelo Bavaro Complex, Iberostar, and Paradisius Punta Cana; I did not see the latter two but that was the word. I took a cab ride to Plaza bavaro to do some shopping but you can also go to the west end of the property and there is a very diversified flea market there; offer the vendors 1/3 of what they're asking. One word of caution, - although the Palace is the best of the Barcelo hotels, it can be a little quiet, and a little older, but a saw plenty of families and singles, as well. All and all, this is a great spot for a very relaxing and fairly economical vacation.Happy traveling.

<Content>Great Place! We came back from the Palace hotel last Monday, April 25, 2005 and we had a great time!We were on our honeymoon, and it's an ideal place for (honeymoon) couples. We stayed at the palace for a week.The staff was all together very friendly and although they did not speak English very much we didn't have any problems.Rooms were OK, bit musty, but it is also very, very humid there. Airco was working fine and the room was very well cleaned every day. We also tipped the cleaning lady every day. Mini bar was also full every day with water, softdrinks and beer. Rooms do need a make over though.Food; I do not understand the complaints of a lot of reviewers. Food was great; lots of choice and well prepared. I can't imagine that nobody likes to eat lobster every day or fresh grilled shrimps and calamares at the beach. You should also remember that you are not at home, and that every country has it's own way of cooking. But if you do not find anything good to eat in all of those restaurants, you're really picky and you probably only eat in three star Michelin restaurants. We didn't get sick of the food by the way.Beach is awsome; palmtrees on a white beach, nice blue/green water. Perfect picture for a honeymoon.The Palace hotel was great and I would recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Beach great, food crap Just got back the 16th. We had a beautiful ocean view room in building 5 with king size bed. There was wash clothes, it was cleaned every morning, mini bar always stocked. Only complaint on room is that we could not regulate the air conditioner. With it off we were too hot, but on we froze at night. We never ever saw our housekeeper, but we did tip her every day. We did not tip the mini bar because at most we drank a couple of club sodas out of it. There was a safe in our room that was combination so we did not need key, there was hair dryer, coffee maker and iron and board. We like building 5 because it was away from all the noise around the pool area. We went golfing twice, the course is a little rough but since it was our first time of the year it was just nice to hit balls. Someone would pick you up at your building and bring you to the club house, where they would give you a cooler filled with water. It cost $50 for the cart, they let you store your clubs for free. There are guards along the whole front nine which is a little weird, and the workers drive by and try to sell you golf balls on the sly. You can only book your tee times 24 hours in advance. We never had a problem getting our early morning tee times and the course was never backed up. We only played twice because frankly it was just too hot and humid to play. We found that the long pants rule was never enforced for dinner. My husband wore pants the first night because I made him but after that he just wore shorts and boat shoes. I wore skorts or sun dresses, nothing fancy. Some of the people who worked there were friendly some were not. It was really hit or miss. We do not speak a word of spanish and had no problems. By far the biggest complaint was the food. It just was not that good. Even the ala carte restaurants were bad. Now don't get me wrong, I did not starve or anything. As I had read on another review the breakfast buffet was the best. Pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, how can you go wrong. My husband did have some trouble and had to take immodium which is surprising because he can eat anything. One thing we did was take thermal mugs for our cocktails and that was the best idea. Not one bartender had an issue filling our mugs and we did not tip every one all time either. If you do not have the thermal mug, they serve you in small plastic cups. By the time you get back to your seat from the bar the ice cubes would be melted, it also resulted in many trips to the bar.As far as excursions or shows, cannot help you with that. Our whole plan was to do a whole lot of nothing and that is just what we did. We started our day with breakfast buffet and then found our favorite spot on beach and just wallowed all day. The beach was beautiful, water clear and warm, sand white and smooth. Hot and sunny each day. We would take in the sun in the morning and then nap under the palm trees in the afternoon. It was heaven. The resort itself is clean and beautiful and you feel very safe. I would recommend it to anyone, just beware of the food and know that it could effect you, so make sure you have plenty of medicine.

<Content>I wouldn't go back. The actual hotel is beautiful, the pool is stunning and of course the beach is amazing. But the food is Terrible. They pour oil on everything, and nothing is fresh. Everything has that 'canned' taste. The fish is gross, the meat is gross, the vegetables (the few there are) are oiled up, and there is no variety, despite the 13 or so restuarants--it's pretty much all the same food. NO ONE speaks english. And they aren't very friendly. You will find one or two staff members that are sweethearts, but overall a very cold vibe. It could be the language barrier, but a few couples said that at other resorts down this same beach were 100 times friendlier and the food was 100 times better.If you are single, this is NOT the place for you. There are a few single people scattered here and there, but generally it's more of a couples/familyl place. If you are a couple, it's very romantic. If you have kids, particularly in their early teens, this is paradise for them. There are a TON of young teens there (they all speak spanish, however) and the place is very safe so you can let them roam, go to the disco, and enjoy total freedom without worry.If you are american, you are the minority (which is sort of cool), but you do need to know at least a little spanish b/c NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE speaks english.The guests are predominantly cuban, colombian and puerto rican--then comes the italians, then the french, then the germans, then dutch, and then american. I think there was one brit in there somewhere. Overall:Location and cleanliness: AThe Pool and the beach: A (swim-up bar is amazing)Entertainment: CThe Staff getting guests involved: C-The Food: FStaff Friendlyness: C-Singles Scene: DRomantic Getaway: BFun for young kids: DFun for young teens: BNightlife for adults: one disco that plays the same music and is overrun by the pre-teens and teens, DIf you have any more questions just email me, I'm happy to help

<Content>Had A Pretty Good Time!! HOLA!!!Gosh I've been reading reviews for the last months and now finally I get a chance to critique. Just arrived back April 8th - Vancouver - Punta Cana. Hmm if your flying air transat - please take my advice and pay the extra $20 bucks for a pre selected seat. We were packed like sardines both ways... Lets just leave it at that! I was quite disappointed with transat - not sure if I EVER want to fly charter. The attendants were quite rude and inconsiderate - probably just my luck. Well the hotel was great, we arrived early morning at 10 and received a gardenview room. We mentioned that we would be interested in an oceanview room, so the next day we were upgraded - free of no charge - in block 1 (closest to the main building) Try getting block 1, 2, 3 or 4.. Loved our room and our room attendant. Also note there was an earlier review by a trip advisor member that mentioned cochroaches - well lets say we looked for them and couldn't find them :). Room was spotless.. our mini bar was fully stocked at all times... defintely no complaints about the room. As for the food - we usually ate at the buffet every day. They have a great breakfast buffet. La Brisa was ok, Rinco Domico - as we nicknamed it was good, also tried the italian restaurant at the beach which was blah at its best. Remember to bring a can of pringles, snacks, and immodium - I heard someone mention that they were selling it for $60 us Please pick up a few phrases in spanish, you will NEED it.. Since education isn't mandatory many people who work there don't speak English. If you can speak french - you may be in luck since we found quite a few employees who could speak a little bit. Also note at the palace most of the guests are European or Spanish. I think there were a couple of Canadian families at the palace (max 3 including us) you'll find more Canadians and Americans through out the complex but we're still in the minority. The club was ok - full of 16  17 year olds. Tropicalisso was ok - left early. Really enjoyed the evening show at the Caribe. Just to give you an idea for budgeting, make sure you do the massages 30 mins for $20 US. Braids were $1 US a braid, banana boating $6 US, painting a souvenir $14 US. We did the Bavaro Runners ($81)  Saona Island Excursion ($89) Our favourite excursion was the Bavaro Runners, can't emphasize how much fun it was. I think it was partly because everyone we were with were English speaking and because Amos (our tour guide) was so entertaining. The only tips I have is to make sure you bring OFF (bug repellant) and lots of sunscreen. Our favourite highlights were horseback riding and hanging out at the beach right beside Secrets Excellence. The Saona Island excursion was average - we left the hotel at 8 am arrived back 7:45 pm .. make sure you take snacks and sunscreen. The Island itself was ok - the beach at the hotel was better. The highlights were taking the speed boat and the catamaran - nothing better than listening to bob marley and napping on the net. Oh and just a tip if you do decide on going on this excursion - do NOT buy the dvd - came home and it didn't work. Well just to summarize - the hotel was good. Would I stay there again -probably not. After the 5th day, you've seen everything. To sum it up the best - I miss the weather, beach, strawberry margaritas, and the breakfast buffet. If your thinking of spending the extra bucks to book at the Palace - do it! I literally became princess for a week. Cheers

<Content>Nice resort We went to the Palace Mar 23 - 30. Had read a lot of mixed reviews on this resort and wasn't sure what to expect. It was great! The beach was beautiful with a wide white powder sand dotted with palm trees. The water was calm with a easy flat entry into the water. We had no problem getting a beach chair and we were there during Easter. No one was getting up at 6 to play the towel game. Not many topless women on the beach,mainly older European women.The restaurants were great. We had the buffet breakfast with an omelet and smoothie bar. The fresh fruit was great. It was nice to be able to eat at the restaurants for lunch instead of having to eat at the buffet. We usually went to Las Brisas or La Pina for lunch, both on the beach. Las Brisas has lobster- grilled or thermador style. The thermador was great! The grilled lobster was good - just ask for melted butter and they will bring it to you, as it makes a big difference.You are allowed to have as many entrees as you wish, so you can have seconds or thirds if you want! They were very accomadating here. I asked for a pasta dish to be served as a half portion as an appietizer and they did without blinking an eye. At La Pina they have a grill. You pick your meat from a refrigerated case and they grill it for you. They had steak (one day it was ribeye,another T bone),chicken,fish,kebobs,and sometimes shrimp. They had a salad bar,french fries,beans rice, etc. They have shaded tables in the sand. I had read complaints about the beef being tough but didn't find that to be true. No, it's not an Outback steak but it was good. I could cut the steak with a butterknife while waiting for a steaknife, so you know it wasn't that tough! For dinner we went to the Steakhouse at the Beach Resort a few times,which was good. It's right on the beach and you can get a nice view of the moon rising.We ate at the Mexican restaurant once,which had a great appietizer buffet. We also went back to Las Brisas for dinner - same menu at lunch as at dinner.We found the service to be great,never having to wait long. Most of the staff spoke some English,some being very fluent. I was surprised to see many Americans here, probably about 1/3 of the guests were English speaking. The resort is extremely clean, with the staff working very hard.We saw few people tipping. We left tips and they sure seemed to remember you the next time. We paid $100 per person for the week to stay at the Palace instead of the Beach and felt it was worth it. The Beach Resort was more crowded.People staying at the other Barcelo resorts can't use the bars and restaurants at the Palace, so if they're going to hang out on the beach they're going to do so at the Beach Resort where they can eat and drink. The beach chairs are nicer at the Palace.All in all, a good time!

<Content>Wonderful! Our second visit and we loved it even more this time. Great service and rooms. A little noisy but this was more a result of college week than the fault of the hotel.

<Content>New Years in Punta Cana..... My wife and I were looking for a last minute getaway after Christmas, so we we booked one week here and spent New Years eve. As in any other all inclusive resort DO NOT go for the food or Watered down cheap drinks. Breakfast is alright for toast, croissant etc. but that is it. For dinner there is a wonderful restaurant called Capitan Cook, which is our favorite. You can sit on the beach and dine and all the fish is fresh. The rooms here are all basic and no great shakes, and the beach is nice but very noisy with constant jet skis, boats etc. whizzing by, you have little room to swim, so your better off leaving the compound, and finding your own quiet beach.You can always count on the weather in the DR, it seldom rains, but we would definitely NOT return to any Bavaro-this is their premier property.

<Content>Love it We just came back on March 19 2005.  Clean rooms, great food - lobsters, lamp chops ... (for those of you from Russia - even black caviar at buffet during lunch time :) Beach is clean, shallow water 鈥?great for small kids, white send - like in Rivera Maya in Mexico. Good size swimming pool (I prefer the ocean salty waters). I had a blast playing volleyball and eating seafood with my family I would come back 鈥?without hesitations.   Safe trip for all of u.

<Content>great beach, nice rooms, fair food This trip was an absolute last minute booking...booked on 3/02/05 left on 3/08/05...the Barcelo grounds and beach are immaculate and gorgeous...the Palace is newer and has better rooms and grounds, even the beach chaise lounges are better than at the Beach and Caribe, it seems worth the extra money to stay at the Palace. The Palace seems to attract more couples 30's, 40's and up from Europe, Canada and the U.S. A walk down the beach to the Beach resort seemed to have more families with kids, and college kids as spring break started. In the evening the Palace has latin oriented floor shows while the Beach had Club Med type audience participation shows. Also in the evening the guests at the Palace were more dressed up, white trousers and black or tropical shrts for the men, women dressed to the nines in casual but chic dresses or pants and tops. At the Beach and Caribe it seemed a more jeans, cargo pants or shorts and tee shirts crowd in the evening, even more so as the breakers arrived. If you still have the energy after a day at the beach or pool, unlimited drinking (although all inclusive you will pay extra for top shelf liquors) , after the evening meal and floor shows the Bavaro Disco starts up at 11PM and bombs until 5AM. Fortunately the disco is in a separate building across from the Beach lobby so guests are not bothered by the comings and goings. There is a Casino open 24 hrs, but, oddly, no 24hr restaraunts. The entire Barcelo complex is enormous with probably a mile of beach front, five hotels, each with its own pool and bars and food facilities, the casino, a golf course, etc. There is a bus/train to get you from one point to another, runs 24hrs., very handy to get back to your room at 3AM.  The stumbling point at this resort, for me, was the food, particularly the meats and seafood. By day three I resorted to a vegatarian diet rather than trim around the chicken and steaks and then gnaw the remaining 1/3 or so that I didn't discard. This is NOT Grade A USDA meats that we are used to in the states. This is no fault of the cook or wait staff, the raw materials simply aren't there. I've been to other all inclusives in cancun and the caribbean but these meats were the worse. Otherwise the buffets and restaraunts were good, with pastas, vegetables, fruits, the obligitory rice and beans, good breads and pastries, and good but very sweet desserts.  But, again, this resort complex is totally about the beach, gorgeous white sand, clear turquoise calm water, palm and pine groves for shade, an absolute treasure. Again, for me this was a last minute, get me out of the snow and onto the beach at a reasonable cost (and travelling alone, a relief, no single supplement) vacation. Under those terms I loved it, but I'd rather have gotten to Aruba, the Caymens, or St Martin where the meats weren't such a problem.

<Content>Nice and Relaxing We just returned from our 1 week stay last night, went by way to fastWe loved it all. it was very clean and well maintained expecially if you look around before you enter the resorts. The food is awsome, We go on a Trip every year and every year I get sick, we ate 6 out of 7 days at the La Brisa. You can have as much lobster as your little heart desires. The lobster thermadoir was so good its like strognoff with lobster. The buffet was amazing compaired to the other hotels in the resort. If you are going to pick anyone to stay at pick this hotel1. There is rarely any lineups more food and much better selection and you and go anywhere your little heart desires. 2. The staff are all so friendly. The entertainers durning the day are great they are always getting everybody up and having fun for volleyball, water areobics, yoga, dance lessons, bochie balls, water polo and the putting game to win a bottle or rum, which i think nobody actually got a hole in one, but we still had fun.The rooms we clean but i only have on complaint, the room we staying in was overwhelmed with cockroaches, after about the 9th or 10th one we seen or had crawing on our feet and toothbrushes, which i would suggest to keep in a plastic bag zipped shut, we had had enough. We went to the front dest at 2:00 in the morning and with in 10 mins we had a new room. The new had none at all, I still slept with the lights on for the next couple of nights though. Other then that dont let i scare you the staff was more then helpful in getting us a new room. As for everybody who finds it so bad that they staff dosen't speak english, what are you thinking, there language there is spanish and thats what they speak if you want to be able communicate maybe you should learn to speak spanish after all you are going to there country. I found nothing wrong with the language. Play cheraids if you have to. We leaned lots of spanish words from the workers. (Alfredo who works at the casino bar lobby) All the staff we friendly and very helpful.We rented a car one day which was actually quite cheep from avis. They came and picked us up and then we got our car. Becareful when you get gas make sure you alway have plenty for gas is hard to come by. We drove to Santa Domingo 200 km from the resort took about 4 hours or so youll see why once you drive on the skinny rough roads, youll see why you arnt insured for tires. As for Santa Domingo holy cow this city is crazy traffic every where horns honking, its just something you have to see i cant even explain it. But anyways I might say that this hotel is one of the best we have been to i liked it better then cuba where we went last year. We were in the domincan 2 years ago in purta plata this side is much better. I would fully recommend this hotel to anyone though we had a great time there is always something to do.

<Content>Had a great time! The Barcelo resort complex is well organized and the food choices are abundant. The beach is beautiful!!! We just returned Mar 5, 2005.Rooms-We stayed at the Beach resort for only one night as we found the rooms to be too small for our needs. They are Europeon sized rooms so if you are not used to this, it might be a bit of a shock. We upgraded to the Palace for the rest of our stay and had a regular sized room after that. It is only a 3 minute walk back to the Beach Resort for meals if you chose to eat there. I would reccommend the Palace for anyone as you get quite a few extra amenities if you stay there rather than the Beach Resort. The increase in cost was very minimal.Food-The mexican restaurant was very good. Also I would reccomend the steakhouse at the beach, both had great food. The Italian restaurant located at the Caribe (a 3 minute walk from the Beach resort) was also quite good-thou the service at this one was bad.Security-We were impressed with the security as we walked around quite a bit after dark that we found a guard posted every 100 yards or so keeping an eye out. I felt very safe walking around alone at night (which I did often).Hidden costs-As with any all-inclusive there is always stuff that's not free. But i found them to be pretty up front with most of it. All tour prices are posted and the tour rep was pretty honest about which ones were worth the money and which ones to pass on. We went snorkeling with rays/sharks (reccomend highly) and horseback riding (reccomend if you like that sort of thing, some people in our group bailed after less than 10 minutes because of the galloping horses--need to be aware that your body will get beat up-especially your backside). We very much enjoyed it even thou it hurt to sit the next day. Anything you may want to buy is EXPENSIVE!!! Bring as much stuff from home as possible. We brought all our own beach, pool toys. Thank goodness! It's highway robbery to buy it there. Also bring all your own toiletries. Sunscreen was 30.00 for regular old coppertone, aspirin was 20.00 a bottle, no joke. My son wanted some pringles as a snack, i sucked it up and paid 8.00 for a can! Language-Learn basic spanish, it will help you in the long run. The staff only knows broken english as it relates to their job, i.e-the names of drinks. Anything other than that and you are on your own. They will not understand when you ask the time or anything not related to their job. I taught my husband and son the basics like greetings, how to order food, how to ask directions to the bathroon (you know simple things) and they did fine for the week.Clothing-bring pleanty of bathing suits, and less clothing. You wear your suit from breakfast until sunset. Anything else will make you sweat to death while the sun is up. The only air conditioned room is your hotel room and you dont want to hang out there-its no fun, everything else is open air (inc'l all restaurants) and you can wear your suit everywhere during the day with a simple cover up. most people just changed for dinner and even then it was just shorts or a sundress. Even thou the sun was down, it was still quite warm at night from the humidity. Last thought-This is a europeon destination of choice so there are people from all over the world here. Everyone speaks some english so it was nice to talk to different people and hear their views. However europeons frequently go topless when at the pool or beach (even walking up to the bar to order a drink) If you have kids warn them so they are preparred. We had talked to our son and thou it was still a shock when he actually saw it he didnt make a big deal out of it. (but I wonder what he said when he got back to school?). My husband enjoyed this part as well as we played the real or not? game as they walked past. We are planning on returing to the Palace in 2007.

<Content>Paradise I just came back from a 5-night stay at the Palace (Feb. 24-March 1) and had the best time of my life! I was incredibly nervous about the trip from reading all the horrible reviews, but was so happy for them to have been wrong. True, there is a bit of a language barrier, but they also went out of their way to try and communicate with us. When all else failed, we resorted to hand signals and it always worked out in the end. Coming from a poverty-stricken country myself, I was a bit more understanding about the language barrier. Do keep in mind that the D.R. is a poor country and these people have more things to worry about than learning how to speak English! But anyway, if you're nice with them and patient enough, they truly are the sweetest and nicest people! I completely fell in love with them and with their country. So now, about the hotel:AIRPORT: so adorable. make sure you get your transfers taken care of ahead of time since that will make your trip that much easier. in and out within 10 mins.CHECK-IN: quick and painless.ROOM: unbelievably clean! D.R. is a humid place, so yes it might feel a bit damp at first then you'll adjust to it. do tip the chambermaid. she does so much and she'll organize everything and leave you a little surprise in the end (usually flowers or a swan towel arrangement).POOL: clean and cool. it's very hot there because there isn't really any wind in that area, so unless you like the feeling of burning, go for it. bake all you want.BEACH: postcard pretty! white powdery sand, turquoise blue water. there are plenty of beach chairs, so don't worry. but do watch out for the older French ladies with their saggy breasts. we noticed that they really didn't care otherwise and just let those babies hang out. you've been warned!FOOD: so here it is, bring immodium-ad! my stomach has always been sensitive. stay away from salads and raw foods (ie-ceviche). however, everything else was great. LA BRISA was the only restaurant we weren't too pleased with. if you really want that lobster, opt for it grilled. lobster thermidor is very rich and cheesy, unless you like it like that. LA PINA is set outdoors so you do have the fly problems with them. if you don't mind it, the food is so good there. CARIBE BUFFET is really good! the banana crepes are heaven especially with ice cream! STEAKHOUSE had the best beef loin! so tender and juicy! there are 15 restaurants on site, so with a great amount of selection, i'm sure you'll find one you'll like.STAFF: friendly and accomodating. like i said, if all else fails, the hand signals always worked. but they will go out of their way to try and understand you.ENTERTAINMENT: ok. not the best. bordering cheesy. disco bavaro was fun! EXCURSIONS: go for them. a million to choose from and so much fun.

<Content>Nice vacation spot We just returned from a weeks stay at the Bavaro Palace Feb. 11-18 and had a great time there. Our room was clean and nicely appointed, had a 27inch tv with satellite channels, and a balcony with a limited beach view. The furniture was not of very high quality and the beds were quite stiff, but we were very comfortable. Plumbing and electrical services were not very well installed and could be in poor repair, and the tile work was not very professionally done.We found that the facility is well designed, with easy access to all areas of the hotel and beach areas, after some orientation. Check in was fairly smooth, and the staff did try to communicate even if language was a barrier. The clientele were about 50% spanish-speaking, 25% english, and 25% french and assorted. The Latins seemed to get the best service. For a 5 star resort, we thought there should have been more service around the pool and beach areas. We were never served drinks other than in the lobby bar, you normally had to get them from the bars. I felt that a greater difference was required for the extra money, otherwise why not go the the Beach or Caribe resorts. It seemed that there was not a lot of value since the other resorts on site seemed to have all the same perks, except access to the Palace. The buffets were all good with many choices, but the Beach hotel buffet had the best salad bar. The a-la-carte restaurants were less classy than we had seen at other places, but the food quality was adequate and tasty as a rule. Personal preference will dictate where you decide to eat.The beach was incredible, with plenty of lawn chairs and shade. The pools and grounds were beautiful and well maintained, with no shoddy areas in view anywhere. The disco and salsa bar were lively and well set up, except they only opened very late in the evening. Entertainment was lame at the shows, but the Tropicalissimo show was well done. Getting around the site was easy on the shuttle trains, and there was always something to do. I think anyone could have a good vacation at this hotel, but if you demand a very high level of service and accomodation, you may be disappointed. Have a look at the other hotels onsite if you want a comparable experience for less cash.

<Content>Nice vacation... Just got back a few hours ago from my 7 night stay at the Palace with my friend. I really do not not know what people complain about at any of the 5 hotels of the Barcelo chain. I read reviews every week before I went and got a lot of truth out of them and many ridiculous comments.. Here is my review and tips: Airport: cute, quick to get luggage, and if you have a prepaid bus ride to the hotel, great.. got on the bus within 5 min. of getting luggage.Reception: a breeze, requested building 2 upper floor and got it. This is the best building, its quiet, not far from everything. Not like building 6 which is in tim buk tu.. You walk with the bellboy to your room.Room: true its outdated, light colored rattan furniture, pale colored tiles, dim light in the bathroom, but the double sinks and large mirrors are a plus. Closets was good with shelves, mirrors, and good working safe(included). Bed is poor, super hard. Sheets and spreads clean, so is the upkeep by the hard working maid (Ruth) you are a sweetheart. Bad: most of the time my room wasnt done til 3o'clock. Leave your maid a tip by her name card, a few dollars here and there is so much appreciated. Also we wanted extra beers in the room , so we put a note and a $5 bill for the fridge guy and he kept it up for 3 days fully stocked. Other days we just went down to the bar in the lobby and got bottles from them and gave the bartender $3-$5.  Food: El Rincon-- very good, typical dominican food.. Great fried chicken nuggets, sandwhich well prepared, fresh, good service. Buffet:. Breafast is the best.. So much variety, omlettes, typical island dishes, fresh tropical fruits, dried fruits, about 4 different kinds of healthy cereals, oatmeal, pasties that were so fresh, about 9 differnt kinds of breads and rolls,, coffee service was excellent, staff smiles constantly. Las Brisas: lobster themidor is out of this world, grilled shrimp is a bit over done and not alway devained. the almond torte is very good. so is the coffee ice cream.. by far the service at this resteraunt is of a 5-star resteraunt.. please tip them 1-2 dollars.. Steakhouse: excellent rib eye, great meal.. salad bar so so.. good service. Mexican: i liked the walk up buffet more than my served entree. super friendly cooks here. Los Pinos.. please dont bother with this italian resteraunt..mushy lasagna, never got the pizza i ordered.Pizza snack bar at the BEach hotel.. is very good.. friendly staff there too.Las Canas.. has excellent desserts..Beach: super clean, hardworking men. Pool: neer went in.. few swimming. Shoppin: dont go the the flea market on the beach alone.. Bring every med you can think of, bc if you need it , you will pay tripple price of the orig priceI had a great time.. relaxed, played games, kayaked and relaxed.. and questions email me.

<Content>Relaxing Like Royalty i just returned from a 7 day stay at bavaro palace on 02/5/05. The staff is extremely polite  friendly. The beach was magnificent, the food was great, drinks plentiful, and the property was remarkably clean and well maintained. Overall our group had a fantastic time, and were very satisfied with the bavaro palace. WOULD RETURN IN A HEARTBEAT!!!-

<Content>Great place to go I visited the Bavaro Palace resort in Nov. 2004 and had a glorious time. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind. The Dominican Republic is about as poor as Haiti is. Hearing a lot of people here complain about the lack of English is really saddens me- considering the conditions these people live in on a daily basis. If anyone actually takes a drive out to the city (Higuey) they would understand some of the inconsistencies with the hotel. Usually, if you take a small dictionary with you, you can get your point across just be nice and smile. The people at this resort were really quite nice and warm hearted if you didn't scoff or bark at them. I had some excellent service. I also tipped all of the staff very well since they make very little otherwise. The buffets always had hot food, although it didn't change very often. I never had a problem with any of the food but I did take lots of antacids and the like just in case. DON'T DRINK THE WATER. Be sure to brush your teeth with bottled water. Also, they aren't plentiful with towels so I would just go to the service closet and grab a couple every so often- I actually think it's hotel policy to try to give you as few towels as possible but I managed to find a way around that (Ha!). The beach is quite lovely and there were always plenty of beach chairs around. There was a lot of seaweed at some points, but honestly, the beaches in the Dominican Republic are plagued by this kind of thing and it never lasted for very long-- otherwise-- the sand was nice and warm and the palm trees were lovely to fall asleep under. The hotel staff was really good about making you comfortale out there. Try the salsa classes! Overall, I had a GREAT time-- you just have to go there with an open mind and understand that you're no longer in the 1st world so it's not like staying at the Four Season's in NYC.

<Content>Just OK Well, what can I say... we got back a week ago now and on reflection the holiday was just ok! I read the reviews on this site before we went and yes, it made me a little wary. I went optamistic and hoped that the majority of the reviews were wrong. All in all I think it was very half and half.Summing up the hotel really, it was trying to be a family place and a lovers retreat all in one and kinda got miss matched in the middle somewhere!The beach was amazing! If not a little busy, but hey where isn't these days?! The palace was exceptionally clean with little green men everywhere, at all times making sure the place was super tidy! 25 men litterally descended on the beach during the afternoon and cleaned it in one swoop! So yes, beach, fantastic!Rooms - were pretty good we found, very clean and tidy, spacious with a great TV with good movie channels! However, when we spoke with our tour rep a lot of people in the other hotels on the resort were as described in previous reports on this site - ie - smelly and damp. However the impression we got was the palace didn't suffer this problem.Food - nothing more than total rubbish! Yes, my better half got rather porley on the 3rd day we were there the pooeys and sickness. I'm not sure it was food related as he swilled his toothbrush with the tap water for two days, but he thought it was. The steak house didn't get the steaks quite right. If you like them well done, don't bother! I had two attempts and they both came more blood style than blue steak would! Chips and rice were good though! The buffets had flys everywhere, but had a great variety of food, but again after two attemps there and I came away with queasy tummy I didn't bother again. The seafood was very rich food but good and the 'rice' restaurant never served anything of the kind! However, the beef tenderloins were the best meal I had while we were there!Staff - Errrr, put it this way. We had to meet our tour rep at the Beach hotel on the second day (which is also in the same complex) I asked a lady on reception how to get there. She looked rather confused at me and said 'In spanish?'. I asked if she spoke English, too which she shook her head. I asked if anyone on reception did and she said no. When ordering food, point!! I made the mistake of not doing one night and ended up with squid instead of shrimps!! Tipping - DO IT! Shops - yes, they are expensive! A chocolate bar is 1 pounds 50. Suntan lotion is about 15 pounds per bottle, about $25 for you American folk. There is a very small shopping plaza, not advisable to go at a quite time as all you get is hassle from vendors following you from shop to shop with fake Louis Vuitton handbangs sold at $250 and some blue stone necklaces! I bought one, with matching earings to shut 'Mr Half Price Cheap Cheap' up.... just wait till you get there, that's what they ALL call themselves!Weather - was great, when it wasn't sunny it was hot and we went in there winter time.All in all it wasn't bad, we booked it three days before we went and didn't expect much. We just enjoyed spending time together, if that's why your going you should be ok, if your going as a family there is quite a bit to do but for a romantic adventure, don't bother!If anyone wants any advice on the resort etc please feel free to mail me, ill be more than happy to help!

<Content>Going back to Bavaro in 5 months Those people on this review board who have rated this a 1 or 2 must be out of their mind or just simply don't know how to have fun. If you think the service here is bad you must have no clue about culture. Some places it is customary to tip. Also understand that you're vacationing in a 3rd world country and these people get paid probably $30 a month (if that). With all the hard-earned money you make it's good to be charitable every once in a while.On a separate note, I visited in July 2003 and have to tell you it was one of the most relaxing and fun vacations I've had. I'll give you a synopsis of what one of my days was like.Get up at about 9:30AM and head straight over to the breakfast buffet. There you can make your own omelets as well as have bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles, and best of all CHURROS with powdered sugar.Next we would go back to the room and change and get ready to head out to the beach. There we would play volleball, tan, snorkel, etc. from about 11AM till 2PM. At 2PM it was time to go to Las Brisas for some lobster thermidore, ceviche, and Presidente beer.After lunch head back to the beach and enjoy the activities till around 6PM.Head back to the room, shower and change to go to dinner. The only place I ate at more than once was Las Brisas and the breakfast buffet. Other than that there are 12 RESTAURANTS for God's sake. If food tastes the same you should have your taste buds checked.After dinner go back to the room and freshen up to go to the club. Get back to the room around 4AM and repeat for a wonderful vacation.NOTE: If you do any excursion on this trip there is an all day excursion that takes you about 3 hours inland. There you have a mini-lunch upon arrival and then go horseback riding, hiking, and then you rapel about 75 feet into a cavern and walk through the cavern, ride horses back to the ranch where you'll have some of the best Dominican home-cooking you've ever had. Definitely worth the full day.I hope I've given you some insight as far as what to expect. The rooms may be a little small but nothing like the musky, moldy remarks seen on this board.

<Content>Relaxing vacation My girlfriend and I took a trip to Punta Cana in March 2004 and loved it. We stayed at the Barcelo Palace Hotel and felt it was a great deal for the money. The resort is well groomed, clean, and the staff are very friendly. The beaches are beautiful, you can snorkel and go horseback riding, and the drinks and meals were good. It helps to know some spanish. Most of the staff speak english, but there english is a little chopy. If you are looking for a vacation were you kick back on the beach all day and just relax, Punta Cana is a great choice. If you are looking for wild parties and nightlife, look elsewere.

<Content>Best Vacation Ever!!! After arriving in santo domingo on july 9th 2004, and a about 7 hrs on the road we finally ended up in punta cana, oh what a joy it was to finally relax, when we arrived we entered this beautiful resort which was very well kept together and belive me for the 5 days we were there we were livin' in lugxoury!!!! beautiful surroundings, comfortable rooms and delicious dominican cooked food which reminded me of home!!! the best part was the entertainment they provided while at the pool area which was spanish dance lessions of Bachata, Merengue, and of course Salsa!!!!the staff reminded me of family, very welcoming and willing to help out. This place had a dominican vibe to it and i guess some people just dont appreciate it, but as far as i am concerned this is one of the BEST PLACES i've ever been in my whole life and look forward to going back soon

<Content>Beautiful beach, poor service We just returned from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace on December 24th. Overall we had a wonderful time, thanks to the lovely beach but the hotel's service is poor... Check-inOK, but although we were the only ones checking in, it took quite some time and they didn't understand English (or pretended not to?). Make sure if you want a quiet room to ask for building 5 or 6 (6 is the closest to the beach). When doing so, ask for full frontal ocean view, since most rooms have side ocean view.StaffWith a few exceptions the staff is very indifferent and often rude. We tried to speak Spanish and we often tipped to please the staff, but nothing helped to improve their service. At a certain point we realized we were trying harder to please them whereas they did nothing to please us.When ordering a drink in the bars, they didn't look up, didn't say anything and deliberately made you wait for a considerable amount of time. On several occasions in restaurants we ordered drinks. At first no reaction, so we had to ask again. And again. And after a while a part of our order arrived, after the first course had already been taken away. They just don鈥檛 seem interested in servicing the guests. And these complaints are not incidents, they happened often every day.At one night (at 1AM) the alarm clock in the room next to us went off. Apparently the room was empty. As the noise was very loud and kept us and other neighbors awake, we called the reception. They promised to send somebody immediately. After 4 calls and 50 minutes later, nothing had happened, of course. So we had to go down to the reception, where we found the staff relaxing and asking How loud is it really...? With difficulty a staff member walked along with us to the room where the alarm was going off, but what a surprise, he brought the wrong key. After 1,5 - 2 hours they finally managed to switch the alarm off. No excuses, no understanding, just rudeness from the staff. Next night, same time, same alarm clock, same total lack of any service. It again took 2 hours to solve the problem. Can you believe it?RoomSpacious, quite basic, nice TV with several American movie channels and large balcony (if you have full frontal ocean view). The bathroom is outdated. From time to time our room was very most and a bit smelly. The room and in fact the entire hotel premises are ok, but not luxurious. HousekeepingFine. The rooms and premises (including the beach) are kept nice and clean. The minibar is stacked with beer, soda and some snacks daily.TippingWe often tipped, but this seemed of no use, as it didn鈥檛 seem to be appreciated nor did it improve the service.BeachExcellent. In beautiful bay. Lots of palm trees. Always easy to find a chair. Nice waters to swim. The beach is quite wide and excellent for strolling. We did some nice snorkeling. There is a reef (that runs from Punta Cana 30 km up north) about 800 mts from the shore, which is easily accessed by canoe. Although we heard that some coral is covered by sand, we saw a lot of very nice coral, as well as rays, murene eels, starfish and lots of tropical fish in all different sizes and colors. However, on some days there were a lot of motorized vehicles around (power boats, helicopters). This caused noise and a nasty smell.PoolFine.ActivitiesThe tennis and golf courts look nice and well kept (although we didn't play golf). The evening entertainment looked fine, although I could do without a Dominican version of 'Hotel California'. It is very easy to use a canoe or a sailing boat from the beach. Also here, the attitude of the staff could use some improvement.RestaurantFood is fine. There are a lot of restaurants. We preferred the Mexican restaurant and the Steak House. When going to the seafood restaurant La Brise, make sure, when ordering a lobster, you ask for a slightly grilled one, otherwise you'll get it burned. In all restaurants they serve good cappuccino, espresso and (aged) rum.ShopsThere are various shops at the hotel premises, which seem fine but are extremely expensive, e.g. $27 for a regular sun tan lotion, $38 for a certain cigar which is twice as much as at home. There is a little market at the North beach side of the resort, where the prices are lower, but the vendors there are pushy.We each paid 150 euros extra to stay in The Palace instead of The Beach Resort. We doubt that this is money well spent. The only benefit seems to be the seafood restaurant La Brise, which is not spectacular. Conclusion: Overall we had an excellent vacation, thanks to the beautiful beach, good snorkeling and nice excursion to Santa Domingo (3,5 hours one way, $67 each). Also fine were the restaurants, hotel premises and pool. However, we were disturbed by the poor service. We didn鈥檛 get the service you would expect from a 5 star hotel (or any hotel!). We kept a positive attitude, otherwise it could have spoiled our vacation.Finally, after we booked our vacation, we came across this website and read the reviews on this hotel which are often negative. At first we though the people were overreacting and couldn鈥檛 believe the hotel would be that bad, but in the end all the bad reviews appear to be true鈥?/p>

<Content>Good Time at the Bavaro Palace Resort Just got back from a 5 night vacay to Punta Cana. Overall we had a good time. My only somewhat negative experience was the food. It's not that the food was horrible or terrible.....it was just.....different than what we're used to (we live in Miami). We go out all of the time to eat (I don't like to cook), so I guess our standards were set a little high. The Bavaro resorts cater mostly to Europeans, so I guess they LOVED the food. Again, it's not bad food, just different. With that in mind, let's begin.Airport Arrival at Punta Cana: They take pictures of you arriving, so make sure to smile. And if you're really tall, you might want to squat down a little as they will chop off your head in the pictures. Ten paces later, make sure you have $10 US (per person) to buy the tourist card (unless of course your package already included it. We used Orbitz to book and it wasn't included). Proceed to pick up your luggage, and that's it! Beach, here we come!Check-In: Check in was a breeze. They bring you whatever you want to drink as you're checking in. Just twenty minutes into our stay at Bavaro and I was buzzed off Presidente beer. Oh Yeah!!!!! And if you are staying at the Palace hotel, you are entitled to go to any of the other 4 Bavaro resorts and eat and play there (at no extra charge). Staff: We never really encountered a bad experience with anyone at any of the resorts. The staff is very courteous and attentive. Yes, most of them do NOT speak English, but hey, we're visiting THEIR country, so what's the big deal? In reading some of the reviews, people are bothered by this. Don't understand why. You're on vacation, people, lighten up! Go buy a basic spanish book at Barnes and Noble and learn a few key phrases to speak in THEIR country.Room: The rooms are very clean and actually spotless. Yes, the furniture is a little outdated, but then again, you don't go on vacay to check out furniture nor spend all week in your room. Every room in the Palace resort received brand new T.V's on Wednesday. Better T.V's than what we have in our own house.Housekeeping: We stayed in Building number 5. We were very satisfied with our housekeeper. She kept our mini-bar stacked with beers, chocolates, and sodas. (Coke, Sprite, etc). We loved our building as it was far away from the pool (and noise).Tipping: We tipped a few bucks each day to the housekeeper. We also left her a few little presents (from the nearest Dollar store). She was super happy and very grateful. These people work 12 hour shifts and only make about $150 per month. They only get 3 days off every month, so a few bucks to the housekeeper or during your meals to the waitresses means the world to them. Beach: The beach is gorgeous. The sand is a whitish-beige color and cool to the touch at any time of the day. The water is a bluish-greenish color. Yes, there is seaweed, but what beach doesn't have it? There are men who come by during the day and rake it up.Pool: Great pool with swim-up bar. Never had a problem getting a towel. Check out the pool at the Caribe resort. It's nice. The Beach resort pool was very small, so skip it!Activities: There are daily activities where you can participate. They have dance lessons, yoga, beach volleyball, massages on the beach in little tiki huts (just $20 US dollars for 30 minutes...you can't beat that anywhere else and they are great!). They have lots of things to keep you busy if you like that. We are beach bums and love to nap for most of the day on the beach, so we didnt' really do much except join in on some beach volleyball. There are also contests you can join and you win prizes. Heck, you even get a prize just for participating. At night they have shows and it's your usual resort style audience participation shows. If you like it, then it's great, but after a two nights, it gets boring.Disco/Club: We tried to go one night and it was completely empty except for 5 totally drunk guys.....so we left.Restaurants: Okay, again, I don't mean to sound negative, but we just didn't enjoy the food. It was just okay, but not delicious. The ONE thing we found delicious was the roasted chicken from the lunch buffet. Let me explain what I mean....lobster at Las Brisas restaurant. I heard so much about it that I had high expectations. We literally RAN to Las Brisas our second day there. It was okay, but not what we're used to. We are used to a broiled lobster with melted butter. At the restaurant, they season the lobster with a ton of spices and then overcook it. It's so overcooked that it was too soft to even chew. The desserts, well, don't go there thinking that cheesecake is actually cheesecake.. It's not even close. The desserts are bland and NOT what you're going to expect. I love desserts and I was practically in tears every day because I missed my sugar rush. Our favorite place to eat was the Mexican restaurant at the Bavaro Beach resort. We still didn't like the dessert, but we LOVED their salad bar items....they were better than the items on the menu. Fresh tacos and refried beans. Yum...I'm still thinking about it. Had we known it was so good, we would have eaten there every night. Unfortunately, we waited till our last night to eat there. So just go there with an open mind and lower your expectations surrounding the food, and you'll do just fine.Oh, and you can have pizza 24 hours a day by going to the Beach resort(it's right next to the Parradilla restaurant). Again, it's not New York style pizza, but when you're starving after swimming for a couple of hours, anything is decent.El Rincon restaurant at the Palace resort--best Dominican food.La Parridalla restaurant at the Beach resort--they say it's grilled meat, but my churrassco was dripping in fat....they fried it.Los Pinos Italian restaurant at the Caribe resort--again, not what you're used to.......I'll say no more!Internet: The Palace hotel has one internet kiosk. It's about $5 US for 30 minutes of time. The Beach hotel has a cyber cafe and it runs about the same amount of money.Making calls to the US: I made a couple of calls during our stay and it was only about $20 US. (it was about a good 30 minutes). This was not with a calling card, this was a direct call placed from our room. I had a calling card (Tricom), but it ran out.Well, that's pretty much it. Just go with an open mind, remember that things run MUCH slower down there and you'll have a great time. I would go back to Punta Cana, but I think we'll try another resort....just to see if food is any better anywhere else! If you have any questions, email me at yuca799@yahoo.com and I'll be more than happy to help you out.

<Content>Don't use credit cards! Really nice place; beach was gorgeous, resort had a lot of activities, and the room was always clean! (Staff doesn't speak much English, so learn a little Spanish before you go.) HOWEVER, it is almost impossible to get American money; as a result of this, I used my credit card twice. Once to buy cigars, and once to book a snorkeling strip. The cigar place charged me twice ($90-once on a day after I had left the Dominican) and the snorkeling place called half an hour before we were supposed to leave, cancelled the trip, and (as I found out a week later) charged me for it anyway-$167. Overall, the resort itself is good, but be careful buying anything extra.

<Content>Best place ever!! This is one of the best places I have ever been. I have been to Hawaii and it is beautiful, but it is so far away and expensive. Here, everything is all inclusive, and it is very relaxing. I went a year ago and we are going back this December. We rested around the pool, where the guys would entertain us and keep us laughing most of the day. Don't believe all these horrible reviews. Last year we were worried for weeks about what it would be like. The only stomach problem I had was because I ate too much. Stayed in the pool most of the time and had a blast. I'm counting the days until we go back.

<Content>Definately coming back My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel the week of Oct 9-16th and what an amazing trip. Our initial hotel was damaged due to the hurricane and we ended up getting upgraded to this hotel. To our amazement, we were treated like royalty. I must admit it helped that he spoke spanish, as a lot of the staff speak little english. The food was great especially at La Pina, where we got treated to amazing meals and like royalty. We tried the Seafood restaurant and was disappointed, but the Steakhouse was good as well. The buffet seemed to serve a lot of the same food over and over again, but it was good for breakfast with the fruit drinks that they would make fresh for you. The hotel room was awesome. It was huge and spacious and was more like an apartment then anything. We were on the first floor and overlooked the gardens and were a 5 minute walk from the beach which was very handy. The hotel rooms and grounds are constantly being cleaned and due to the fact that we came right after a hurricane, we were amazed.If you decide to do any of the day trips we totally recommend the trip to Saona Island. It was something that neither one of us will ever forget. The beaches were beautiful and staff were very friendly. The water was aqua and I never could imagine standing in the middle of the ocean holding huge starfish. It was breaktaking.Overall this hotel was fantastic. We will definately go back, more then likely for our honeymoon.

<Content>A rip off!!! We paid extra to leave early!!! The only way I can describe this hotel is that it is a total rip off. We had a horrible stay. Lets begin with the room, we had a leaky roof, a leaky toilet, mold on an entire wall, a hole in the wall and ants all over the place. The food and drink was digusting- the place is not clean. The buffet always has bugs and flies swarming all over it. The staff is rude and not helpful at all. It seems to me that this place only gets good reviews from Europeans- It is certainly below American standards. We had a horrible time and the hotel was not helpful in getting any of our problems resolved. The water is not filtered so you have to get bottled water, but they ration the amount you can get at any time. We did not have enough bottled water for brushing our teeth and my husband ended up getting sick. We ended up paying extra (for the flight) for leaving early. This was a horrible vacation and I would strongly encourage anyone thinking of going to read these reviews and lose your deposit if you have to.

<Content>beach is paradise A little disappointing was our stay (my wife and me) at the Palace. Becuase of the storm many hotels and belonging restaurants were closed. Also was the golf course. When i walked down the course i still do not understand why the whole course was closed, Our room was spacious (#2017) and situated near the seafood restourant. The menu is very short so after 13 out of 16 days you have eaten it all several times. The waiters are very friendly and they even fefused to take tip because we tipped enough. The food in average was reasonable, staff is very friendly. Only at teh reception desk public affairs are not cmpetent for their jobs. I had to ask several times even in (Spanish languages) to fix things in the room, the lock, the lamp, and on leave to pick up the luckage but nothing happened exept for the door lock. The music at the theatre was loud and to be heard in almost every corner of the hotel, you could not escape from the merengue but to go to your room.very good, however, is the beach. It was cleaned every day by at least 10 workers. So during day time our stay was excellent, and during nighttime it was boring. Silly games, show ballet mostly the same and always the same loud merengue.

<Content>Loved It!! My family (husband, young child and baby) and I just returned from a wonderful vacation at the Palace (8/27 to 9/6). The service is terrific and the staff (very few speak English) is very friendly and helpful. Although not required, we tipped about $1 to $2 US Dollars. Bring about $150 in singles. They come in handy both at the airport and resort. The grounds are emaculate with crews constantly cleaning. The beach is beautiful with calm crystal clear water and powder white sand. There are enough lounge chairs for guests. However, you need to arrive early at the beach if you want to lounge in the shade. The pool is enormous with two kiddi pools, a large jacuzzi and swim up bar. Sometimes the wait at the swim up bar is a bit long... one bartender and a big crowd. Be aware that the floor tiles around the pool become very slippery when wet. Also, we were surpised that there were NO LIFEGUARDS either at the pool or the beach. The Palace has six restaurants, one of which is not included in the all inclusive plan... a French Restaurant costing $30 US Dollars per person. We stuck with the all inclusive restaurants. Breakfast was at the Buffet which had a very good selection of food. Although bountiful and enticing, we steered clear of non-cooked items (fruit, yogurt, cheese, cold cuts). That policy we adhered to for every meal and had no stomach problems. We also did not drink or use the tap water for anything, except showers. We brushed our teeth with the bottled water. We found that the Buffet had a good selection for Breakfast and Lunch only... dinner was a disappointment. We highly recommend Las Brisas restaurant which is beach side with a nice selection of seafood. Try the grilled Lobster and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce. Also, the beach side restaurant, Rincon Dominicano, has delicious food. We thought that La Pina beach side restaurant had good pizza and grilled chicken, nothing else. The pool side restaurant, El Bohio, had good appetizers and OK food. Overall the food selection was good, you could eat all day long.The adult nightly shows were fun. However, the nightly Kid's show was virtually non existent except for a lone Clown in a small disco dancing in circles with the children to the same three songs for 1/2 hour. My young child enjoyed it. However, some of the older children were bored. The daytime Mini Club was better... beach side arts, crafts and games. Our room was large enough for two adults, a child and a baby. Be aware that the cribs are old, some broken, and do not come with crib sheets! Bring your own crib sheets and some crib rail guards to prevent your baby from chewing on the rail. The room had a musty smell at first. We found the source of the smell to be the cabinet that stores the mini bar. Apparently, the freezer in the mini frig defosted and and water seeped into the cabinet. We had the cabinet and frig replaced... the smell was gone. Be sure to stay in buildings 2 or 4. Building 1 and 3 are too close to the pool and entertainment area... can be noisy. While buildings 5 and 6 are too far away. Also, be careful with the elevator doors they are extremely dangerous. The sensors are located at the bottom of the doors!!! In summary, we had a terrific time. Do not drink the tap water or consume any non-cooked foods. We did not have any problems adding ice to our drinks. We highly recommend this resort. It's a wonderful place to spend your vacation together with your family. We plan to return.

<Content>awesome place to vacation took a family vacation... all 18 of us...8 adults and 10 kids ages 3yrs to 17yrs and every single one of us had a fantastic time. Food was good, service was amazing, the grounds were beautiful. Went kayaking, snorkling, windsurfing... all included. Never a dull moment. The staff always organizing an activity like water aerobics or beach volleyball. The rooms were clean and roomy. Went for 5 days and wished we could've stayed longer. We could not have picked a better place for our vacation.

<Content>would not go back we stayed at the palace from 6/26th to july 3rd. was very disappointed with our rooms the smell was awful. smelled like my new england patriots team were in my room not the boys just all their smelly gym shorts etc.for the whole season. went to the desk and checked out another room in another building. as soon as you opened the door the smell hit you. the grounds were beautiful and staff were friendly and helpful. did have some what of a language barrier. the food was ok for the buffets. some restraurants were better than others. we enjoy the restraurant on the beach for lunch. the management should keep the ac on all the time and get rid of the heavydrapes and the heavy bedspreads. that may help with the smell of the rooms. we stayed in aruba the week before and woulf stay again but for 2weeks in aruba. was very disappointed with the rooms esp for the money we spent to get their and also we had 2 rooms.we would not go back again

<Content>For American eyes only! I say this is for American eyes only because I really don't know what kind of expectations people from other parts of the world may have, but I think I know what Americans like, and expect, for their hard earned vacation money.The GOOD: I've traveled the Bahamas and the Carribean, and the beach is beautiful here. Can't get much better. Water a clear light green; sand a powdery white; plenty of comfortable lounge chairs and shade if desired. The grounds also are impeccable. The staff is constantly raking, scrubbing, watering, sweeping, etc. The outside aesthetics are very pleasing. There really isn't anything to complain about when it comes to the outside. There's a very convenient shuttle train that picks up/drops off at the lobby of each of the five hotels on the entire complex which makes getting around a snap. Drinks were plentiful and even some top shelf liquor was used in the all inclusive drinks. The BAD: The room is small, musty/mildewy, with poorly controlled air conditioning. The bathroom has a stark halogen light that gives the effect of showering in a prison cell. Also, the bathroom is tiny. The mini bar in the room is poorly stocked. Your'e lucky if you get a Coke or two, and maybe a can of beer or two. And if you get two candy bars, you've hit the big time. Also, don't expect fresh glasses or coffee mugs each day; the ones that are there at the beginning of the trip are the same ones that will be there on your departure - except you've done a good job at rinsing them out each day. The UGLY: We'll American friends, there was more ugly than anything else. Where to begin: lets just start at the beginning. Upon leaving the airport after your arrival, be prepared with tip in hand for the eager beavers that grab your bags and head for the taxis to your hotel. Everyone, simply everyone, expects a tip. Upon reaching the hotel, expect rude, non-English speaking desk help. There's no rhyme or reason to the check in process. But be a little assertive if you don't want to stand around all afternoon. Our first room was downright disgusting. It smelled like an old dirty wash cloth. We asked for a room change and finally got one the next day, after asking for the general manager (they gave us a bottle of rum and tickets to a fancy restaurant, which was a very nice gesture) but we had to be obnoxious Americans to get it. The pillows were disgusting (will not go into detail so use your imagination - bring your own_. A few dollars left each day for the maid went a long way in keeping the towels flowing, if you know what I mean. The food at the buffets and the al a carte restaurants were at time unpalatable (goat, baked bananas, cuts of meat that were displayed under lights (eeeewwww), meats and cheeses that had a fine slick film covering them, moldy rolls, warm juices/milk, etc). I was craving McDonalds' when I got home. The staff ignored us, while our Central and South American guests got service with a smile. In fact, one day the staff had arranged guests to exercise in the ocean and one thing we did was to go around in a circle and say our name and where we were from. All countries were met with cheers when someone just ahead of me said their name and that they were from the US and everyone booed! Americans are not well tolerated here.In SUMMARY: If you simply desire a week in paradise without any other expectations, this is for you. If, like most Americans, you work hard for your vacation money, and want some good food and decent treatment along with the view, you will be unsatisfied. If you haven't booked yet, don't. There are plenty of other paradise spots that can offer food and personality to boot. If you have booked already and the trip is inevitable, please feel free to email me and I can make suggestions for a smoother trip and answer any other questions - lisaowens@comcast.net

<Content>Don't Go The food and drink was all watered down. Staff could hardly speak or understand english. Houskeeping was slim to none for 7 days . Spent most of my time at front desk tring to resolve room and staff problems. Had to move rooms 3 times due to housekeeping and mainteance problems. No padal boats or pedal bikes like stated. all inclusive equiment is in short supply and in need of replacement. Not All of the nonmotorized water equiment is included like stated. Staff is Tip driven. Don't bother calling for a wake up call you wont get one. We could not wait to leave. If you like watered down food and drinks including pop and like ants on your bathroom counter and don't mind being ignored because your American this is the place for you.

<Content>Not what we expected, It was even better! First of all, I would like to thank everyone who wrote reviews on this site, especially those that gave good useful tips and those that only had negative reviews to express. The good tips came in handy at all times and the negative reviews made me realize that there are people who will never be satisfied regardless of how good or how better. I am only writing this review for the simple reason that I only went for a few days (I planned 1 week, then changed it to 4 days, what a fool I was!)becuase I became apprehensive due to the negative reviews, and I do not want this to happen to anyone who reads the negative reviews and ends up cutting there trip short before they go. RESORT ROOM: We ended up staying about four days, what a fool! The resort was very big,very pretty and well kept, staff cleaning and preparing at all times of the day and night. The rooms (the least place we were in) were decent, not 5 star but decent. Mini-bar, bed, a bit hard compared to my $1,300. mattress, but I could'nt bring mine over, so I made the best of it. If you want a nice view ask for building 4,6 or 2 oceanfront. BEACHES: The beaches were clean and very nice. White soft cool sand not hot at all, calm water and ample in size. The resort was at full capacity yet it is so big that you can't tell and yet not crowded at all, empty beach chairs all over the place. Massage huts came in handy and so did the kayaks. The ocean breeze kept the day at the beach very pleasant and tolerable, not a break of sweat, especially for being August. FOOD: Yes it is true, you do get sick, I did, but its not the water or the food, Its the amount of food you eat. If you do like I did you will get sick, but boy did I enjoy it. Mornings, I would skip breakfast, in fact I only went once to the buffet. All I was interested in was lunch and dinner, if I was not sick by dinner time. I believe I not only got my moneys worth, but I perhaps gave the resort a loss in profit. For lunch it was to Las Brisas for a Lobster Fest  I had lobster in every form they could prepare them in. If I ate less than 6 whole lobsters at lunch each day, I would be telling you a lie. I kid you not you ask for one more plate (1 tail cut in two on the grill) the bring you four halves. And they were so soft and for those that dont know , the smaller the tail the more tender and juicier it is. I have a place in the Florida Keys and I really enjoy eating fresh lobster but for a hefty price, at about $25 per tail unless I get them myself (boat gas, oil etc.), it gets expensive, now you know why I call it Lobster Fest. That was my usual lunch every day, now you can figure out why anyone can get sick, just a bit of medicine and Alka-Seltzer and I was set to go. Dinner was also good at many of the restaurants in all of the resorts, lots to choose from. Overall the food was great, fresh and abundant, but if you are looking for gourmet, you will not find it here, go somewhere else so you dont come back writing a bad review. Throughout the vacation I just could not believe the people who wrote bad reviews about this place. DRINKS: all you can have, in the room, at the beach, in the lobby, at the restaurants, everywhere. The beer was always cold and good. The drinks were as good as you tip, thats all I have to say about that. In some occasions, I asked told the bartender to prepare the drink just as I would. Now if you want premium brand liquor and don't want to pay for it, just bring your own otherwise you can enjoy what they had which was not watered down and was good, in fact you can ask for a new bottle and keep it next to you or take it with you, just ask and they will give, but tip of course, you will get more. FRONT DESK: The front desk can be a pain especially for those that come in a loaded bus with 50 people ready to check-in and only four employees to do the check-in. I came in in a small bus and when I got in it was empty. If you need assistance at the front desk and its full, go to the bar get something to drink and wait for it to clear. CASINO: The casino was no Las Vegas, but it had just the right amount of tables and slots to spend a great time, winning or losing. SHOWS  ENTERTAINMENT: Again, the shows were not Las Vegas quality but after a few drinks you will believe it was. The entertainment was great especially for the kids at the beachside day care. The music as some people wrote is not all day and night, and it is not loud were you can't sleep if you are in building 3 or 4. The music was different depending where you were at and this is a huge resort. If you don't like loud music or music at all look for a place you cant here it. CONCLUSION: Go for the amount of time you originally planned or longer than that. But please don't do like I did and cut the trip short. Enjoy, make the best of it, if you know you get sick easily than take precasions, if you are like me and don't care and keep on eating and drinking, then have fun, you wont die. If you want to bring the family for a nice time just bring them, there is lots of space and activities. And most important, if you want to have a great time don't let the negative reviews change your attitude and perspective in what you originaly decided to do which was to go on a vacation and have a great time in a great place.

<Content>Pleasant but almost boring honeymoon My wife and I decided to spend the week of our honey moon, June 7th-14th, at the Palace after vewing pictures of the pool with the swim up bar, and the ocean. We discovered this web site after making our deposite and became a little discuraged with some of the reviews. My wife and I have concluded that if you are not extremely wealthy and used to having people answer to your beckon call and don't mind eating food other than a big mac and chicken, you can pretty much ignor the bad reviews of this resort. I will try and hit the good and the bad things quickly so you have time to read the rest of these fullfilling reviews. The very first thing we noticed when we got off the plane was the humidity. Man it was humid but you get used to it very quickly. Our travel agency provided a cab to and from the resort from the airport I suggest the same for you but hold on to your bippies cause those cab drivers are wreckless. I videoed the cab ride back to the airport just to show our friends how wreckless the drivers are oh, but they are very nice, just wreckless. When we arrived at the hotel there was no line at the front desk, we were welcomed immediatley and our lugage was exchanged for an awsome tropical punch drink. The rooms were just as described sort of musty and damp from being so very well airconditioned but you get used to that to, really you do the second day you hardly notice it unless you stay out of the room a long time. The rooms were clean but the bathrooms were a little run down. However there is a nice dressing area with sinks and mirrors. We used the safe a lot to. It held all of our valubles. The rooms were kept nice all week and the fridge was stocked and restocked. We gave small gifts to the maid such as coloring books and toys for children and allways a couple of bucks and didn't really notice any special treatment. We were in block 5 on the ground floor and we had an ocean front room. The blocks are staggered so if you want a close ocean front room you want block 6,4, or 2. You don't want anything other than an ocean front room. The food was good everywhere. It was different, not weird different but different. The cheese was the only thing that really bothered me. By the end of the week I didn't want to even look at it. The food on the menues have names that give you no hint as to what it is you are ordering so it was fun to see what you ended up with after you ordered. My least favorite place to eat was the little dinner right on the beach by the pool. We never got anything we liked there. The drinks were never watered down they were very strong,very strong. Be very explicit what type of drink you order. If the tender doesn't understand english well or doesn't know how to make what you want he/she will mix up anything and hand it to you. There are lots of activities if you have no spending limits. We were on a bit of a spending limit when it came to entertainment thats why we got a little bored and so by the end of four or five days we had done pretty much everything to do that was free. Thats why we got a little bored.We never tired of sitting in the sun. The beach is awsome. I have seen clearer water but it was really nice. Yes guys it is a topless beach but the Bavaro didn't seem to have as many taking part as the other resorts did. You can look but make sure your honey knows that you were making sure hers' were still the best. Not a lot to do at night. We never made the disco but wanted to. The casino was really fun. Use the train to ride from place to place. It saves a lot of walking time. We talked about going back to the Palace later in life but for a shorter stay. If you have any questions or want me to clerify something feel free to write an email.

<Content>AWESOME FAMILY VACATION I took my family, myself, wife, 19 yr old son, 14 year old daughter, 13 and 11 year old sons july 22 to 28. We had read some bad reviews and were a little skeptical, however, no one got sick, there were no insects, the service was out of this world. The people were so friendly and helpful. The grounds and beach were paradise. The food was incredible. There were so many restaurants to choose from. The kids were on their own safely traveling throughout the complex, eating at will. The beach was a dream. The pools were great, and there was a drink waiting for you everywhere. I cannot say enough about the barcelo palace and complex. Bring about $100 in singles. a dollar tip goes a very long way. If you have any questions, feel free to email me. I highly recommend it.

<Content>What a wonderful week My family just returned from a week at the Palace and although it started out a bit shaky we were pleased overall. We had 19 people in our group and we were supposed to stay at the Beach Resort. After waiting for an hour to check in (there was only 1 person working the desk) we were told that our travel agent had not booked our rooms and to please wait while they called. They then told us that it was their fault and they upgraded us to the Palace Hotel. The rooms were a bit musty but were a nice size. There was a refrigerator in the room and it was stocked daily. Even though it was all-inclusive, we tipped the boy that stocked the refrigerator $20.00 in the beginning, so he kept just what we wanted and however much we wanted stocked. I hope you like a firm mattress and a cold room. The air conditioner worked great. The grounds were immaculate, the pool was huge and beautiful and the beach was indescribable. There were trees on the beach, the water was crystal clear and the sand was white. I don't know if the water is different at different times of the year, but what little seaweed washed up was swept twice a day. There is no bar at the beach, so you have to walk to the pool to get drinks. I am not a drinker, so I can't really comment on that except to say that the only beer is El Presidente. Just know that this is not a resort that a lot of Americans visit. The majority of the guests are Spanish speaking. Since we had 19 people with us we always had someone to talk to, but I probably wouldn't have liked it as much if there had only been 2 of us. The staff speaks broken english, if at all, but the service could have been much better. We have been to Jamaica, Bermuda, and to Puerto Rico and I have to say the food here was better than any other place I have ever been. There was a good variety, and I have to say that it doesn't get any better than having lobster grilled for you on the beach. Of course, the food is not like it is in the U.S. and if you can't be a little adventurous then you probably don't need to go. All in all it was a great vacation,despite the small stuff, and I would definitely go back. Please e-mail me if you have any questions.

<Content>A Beautiful Beach And Nothing Else. Have just got back from this hotel - stayed 1 - 15 July 04. All I can say is NEVER AGAIN.Being British is definately a problem for this hotel. They do not cater for the British in any way, shape or form. Having travelled all over the Carribean and indeed to the North and the South of this Island - I can safely say this has got to be the second to worse hotel I have ever stayed at. (The worst was in Cuba). My advice is to go to Puerto Plata in the North.The staff speak very little, if any English. This is a big problem when you want to order a drink or even to get a bottle of water from the bar.The hotel is rated as 5 star. No Way. Absolulty No Way. I would rate it a very generous 3 star.The rooms are basic. They need a complete overhaul. The sheets and towels they provide are not very clean and are threadbare. We took our own towels with us.Everyone who works there expects a tip - from the guy who changes your beach towel to the reception desk where they check you in and out. So be prepared. Although you may tip - do not expect better treatment next time you go to the bar. They just expect another tip.Once you are inside this complex - there is no where else to go. So if you want a holiday that is in the sun on a beautiful beach (more on the beach later) and nothing else this is the holiday for you.The beach is stunning. however, it does get crowded - very crowded - think of a spanish beach and you are getting the picture. The only way we could get some peace from Spanish/Italian/and whatever other language was to go right and walk down to the end of the beach - there we found our little bit of paradise. The water is very clear and hot, the sand pure white and only a few couples around. The entertainment they provide is all in spanish/italian and german. Do not expect to be able to understand a word that is being said. Therefore, this meant that as we only speak English we could not enjoy the shows.Most people tend to go to this resort for a week only. Believe me a week is long enough.The food is awful. Could not even get toast in the morning as all the toaster did was warm the bread not toast it! The main buffet is rubbish. The food is covered with little black bugs. When I tried to point out to a waiter one evening that a bowl of tomatos was covered with these little black bugs - all he could reply to me was Tomato. I tried in vain to get him to understand - but in the end gave up.Yes I know that we were in the Dominican Republic where the national language is Spanish - but after visiting the North and South of the Island where they can speak fluent English and cater for the British all I can say is go there and you will not be disappointed. We were disapointed and will never go to Punta Cana ever again. Even if someone gave us a free holiday!!!

<Content>Beach  I would not go back simply because of the food.When I first arrived I was very excited. Check in started to give me a bad feeling, after finally being checked in the walk to the room was way to long. I had to rent a Golf cart ($150.00 for 3 days). The pool and the beach are beautiful. The staff is very freindly if you speak spanish. Very few speak spanish. The food in the restaurants are simply unedible. I had fruit salad for breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. I work in the hotel industry in the restaurant field and in 15 years have never encountered such poor quality in food prep and presentation. I would recommend to people who need to lose weight Travel days June 9, 2004 - June 12, 2004.

<Content>Better Than Expected My family and I visited the Palace from April 24th to May1st/04. I did read other peoples reviews prior to leaving for my vacation, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I am happy to say that we had a great time, the weather was beautiful, and I wish I could have stayed longer. The hotel is very clean, and there are always grounds keepers, and cleaning staff working around the clock. The beach was beautiful and you can always find shade if you need it. I don't have anything negative to say about my trip except for the food. A little disappointing but I was able to survive and find a few things I liked. We liked the restaraunt La Pina the best. You could choose from a variety of meats that were barbequed right in front of you. We did bring extra spending money so we could do some activities that the all inclusive didn't include. Such as parasailing, bannana boats, hair braiding, and we went on an all day excursion that was well worth the money. It was a trip to Saona Island--definetly go on this trip if you are looking for a little excitment. The island they take you to has the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. The Palace is alot nicer than the other resorts that surround it in the Barcelo complex. A great time was had by all. Nobody in my family got sick. Remember you are going on a vacation like this to relax, enjoy the sun and create many memories. Any vacationing trip is what you make of it, so enjoy yourself, ignore the negative reviews, and don't get burnt!! P.S. The AC in the rooms definetly works -- pants and a sweater was worn at bedtime by me. If you are going to this resort you will have a blast!

<Content>Nice wrapping Just got back (April 19-28). Normally we would have stayed at the Riu Palace Macao, but due to overbooking problems, we were transferred to this hotel. Everyone stated this was shurely an even match, if not better.What an illusion. As long as you remain outside the hotel, you're OK. The outside of the property (beach, gardens and pool) is well kept and wonderfull.But once you get inside (your room) or under a roof (the rest of the hotel is mostly open air), you ask yourself: is this a 5-star palace ???At arrival, the first impression is this of large building kit: green tubeframes all over the place from ground to roof. The variety of the food at the buffet-restaurant is very monotonous after 9 days. The quality of the food is mediocre. The cold dishes aren't even cold enough (we saw flies laying eggs on ham !!!). Most of the staff isn't very friendly (even when tipping).The all-inclusive is not all-inclusive: on our first day, my wife asked for a campari-orange. The waiter bluntly said: You have to pay. After changing the order to a pi帽a-colada, we got a banana-daiquiri instead!!! Just great service!!!The rooms are even worse. Our first room (2042 - first floor) had black mouldstains on the ceiling (!!), the chrome was nearly gone everywhere, the bathroom in general was outdated en not very enjoyable to visit. Due to noisy neighbours, we changed to another room (5091 - second and top floor) where there were no mouldstains. But for a 5-star palace hotel, you would expect much better noise insolation: we heard our neighbours walk in the room, open and close drawers, playing the TV. When you only sleep from 01:30 am till 06:30 am, your holiday is nothing like a relaxing vacation! Once we complained at 00:30 am about our selfish neigbours at the reception, but this remained unattended.One tip: if you have to stay at this hotel, make the most of it by having lunch at the restaurant La Brisa (sea-food): this is by far the best place to be at this resort. Good food, nice location at the beach with nice view and they let you enjoy your meal at your pace. We visited it once in the evening, but then it's more in a rush.5 star palace : NO WAY !!! (When I am in a good mood: a possible 4 stars and certainly forget the palace-attachment). Never had a worse vacation!!!

<Content>A great place to just relax First time I've been to this resort. This was a great place to relax and just eat, drink, and get a tan. I tried the golf but wasn't too impressed with the course, next time I'll leave my clubs at home. The food was ok, had several different restaurants to choose from. The drinks were ok, but I stayed with the local beer, el Presidente, it was a really good beer and always ice cold. The staff was always friendly and helpful, the language barrier was at times a little difficult but no real problem. The hotel itself was always kept clean, the beach was clean with soft white sand and clear water. The weather was great, sunny and warm every day. I would definitely go back, but probably for two weeks instead of only one.

<Content>Good Vacation Just returned from Barcelo Bavaro Palace. My 15 + 16 year old sons were with me, this is an excellent resort for kids that age. The resort complex is large and secure so, they were free to explore without any safety concerns on my part. They were NEVER bored. There were younger kids there too who seemed to be content but we never felt intruded on like you sometimes can with little ones running around! Though large (5 hotels with several bldgs each) I never felt crowded. It's good to get to the beach before 10:30 or so if you want a prime or shady spot and the pool area seating fills up fast. Overall the Dominican people were lovely, very polite but not as friendly/familiar as those I've met in Jamaica and the Bahamas. A little Spanish is almost essential as the staff speaks little English. (though there were a few here and there who were fluent).The buffet food was a little better than average but, as with all buffets, you have to choose your food wisely. Some things were just fresher than others--it was pretty easy to tell what would be good. Don't bother with the Italian restaurant (it wasn't), the Dominican restaurant was excellent. If you are deciding between the palace or another Barcelo Bavaro property, spend the extra $$ for the Palace. The rooms are bigger, food and services are better and you get priviliges at all of the hotels on the property. Rooms were very clean, grounds quite well maintained (no trash/cigarette butts etc ). Shop at the Plaza Dominica (on the resort property) or at the privately owned shops on the beach. My Husband paid the same price for on cigar in the hotel lobby shop as he did for a whole box of the same on the beach. Sunscreen in the hotel gift shop was $47 American! Be prepared to bargain with the private shop owners though and despite what they tell you, insist on getting your change in dollars (they will try to give you pesos alot of times!) All and all a very good trip though we did miss the friendliness that the staff at other resorts we've stayed at. I don't know if this is a cultural thing or because of the size of the resort.Either way, I would highly reccomend it--there really did seem to be something for everyone.

<Content>Great place The resort was just great, the food,the beach, the people,the service was outstanding. The only problem was the casino, the service was bad the dealers were rude and Black Jack was overly slanted to the house. if you want to gamble this is not the place for you. Take my advice donot go to the casino you will be very disappointed. Its to bad because everything else was just great,It kind of but a damper on everything, they might go to Aruba and find out how to run a friendly and fair casino. ,

<Content>Amazing vacation! The Palace was absolutly beautiful, but the people that lived and worked there were great! It is so much more laid back there and it makes your vacation so much more relaxing. The waitresses work long long hours, hard, non stop but u never see them complaining. They like their job and a lot of them have fun doing it. THe shows are really great w/ amazing dancers and the casino was a fun place to go to! The beaches are gorgeous with clear water and white sand and you can enjoy a day tanning or be adventurous and do water activities. So, overall I had a AMAZING time!

<Content>Bring the sunscreen!!! Having been to the Mayan Riviera the previous year, my sister and I were told that this resort would be very similiar. We did have an awesome time however this resort didn't quite live up to all the hype we received from the travel agent. The weather was gorgeous each and every single day for an entire week. And believe me, we've got the tan lines to prove it!! Yes, we are the prude type apparently, because I think we were the only two on the beach with bathing suits on!! Ok, let's move on. The staff was very pleasant,although very difficult to communicate with due to our lack of Spanish speaking skills. The beaches are not nearly as clean as in Mexico. Lots and lots of seaweed! We met some great people from all over the world while we were there. And talk about deals?? The guys at the flea market are hilarious. You'd be amazed how much you can buy for $10.00!! Make sure to bring small bills! Overall, it was a nice, sun-filled vacation but sorry folks, next year it's back to the Iberostar Quetzal for us!!

<Content>could be Great - But???? After being booked into the Palace we (a group of 19 ) were downgraded to the Beach Resort. The reason supposedly was so we could all have beachfront rooms. Not at all the case-when we arrived. the room I recieved was a moldy room in building 5 with a view of nothing at all. We all spent most of the day arguing with the manager about getting the rooms that we had reserved almost a year prior. we had also been promised Palace Bracelets for 2 days for the downgrade faux pas but had to spend much time chasing people down to get those as well.  This is a beautiful resort but the food is barely passable and the management very poor. Almost all of us had a stomach ailment either from the water or the food. ( even though we all drank only bottled water- even brushed our teeth in only bottled water ).  I will say that everything seems a little better at the Palace. The food was slightly better and the drinks far better there.  This was my second year at a Barcelo Resort ( last year at the Maya Beach) but it will probably be my last. It's too bad that such a beautiful place can't be better run and have better food without everyone in the group getting ill.

<Content>I would not go back A beatiful resort and lovely staff. But.... Went to Barcelo Bavaro Beach resort 12 years ago; got deathly sick (polluted water), swore I'd never go back. Memories fade with time..Went to the Bavaro Palace (5 star) in August 2003. After 1 day, the food all tasted the same. After 2 days, the drinks all tasted the same. After 3 days, couldn't leave my room. Imodium couldn't touch it. Diagnosed with a strain of e-coli upon return.My advice to tavellers: Get your shots before you go. I question the quality of the water used to wash the dishes, fruit and vegetables. But if you're ok with ingesting pollution....My understanding is that there is no water purification system anywhere on Bavaro Beach.My advice to the Barcelo organization: show your guests the courtesy of ensuring that safe (read: unpolluted) water is used at all times. Clearly in my opinion, this does not happen currently.Would I go back? Not in this lifetime.

<Content>The All Inclusive, 5 Star Resort that is Neither We have just returned from a week at the Bavarro Palace. The weather was wonderful and the grounds of the hotel were well maintained including the beautiful beach. The rooms were clean but a bit dated and certainly not in keeping with their self-rating of 5 star. The average Dominican working at the resort was a delight. Many speak English and all truly seemed to appreciate our attempts at Spanish.The resort is touted as all-inclusive, which it is not. At least in comparison to other all-inclusive resorts we have stayed in the Caribbean. For example, liquor was included but only local options. The wine served at meals is truly awful unless you purchase your own, which we did every evening. Golf is included in the fess but a golf cart is not and you must rent one for $50. They also charged for golf balls at the driving range ($5 for 25 balls) Although I do not like buffets, the food was the best we found in the entire resort. The Chez Palace even at $20 a person is a waste of time. The food is unimaginative and quite mediocre. The service was not up to par when compared to the buffet. The other restaurants are equally unimpressive and not worth the effort.The management of the hotel could take a few lessons from the staff. Guest services personnel appeared to be bothered by any inquiry and were curt to say the least. One gentleman actually ridiculed a guest while she was talking with him. Unfortunately for him, the guest spoke fluent Spanish. Attempts to speak to the hotel manager were rebuffed by both guest services and the front desk personnel.Don't make the mistake we did by either bringing Dominican Pesos or exchanging them at the hotel. Everything is priced in dollars and the hotel plays a 25% spread in the exchange (they exchanged at 40 pesos to the dollar and sold products at 50 pesos to the dollar)Despite all of this we did have a good vacation and met many wonderful people who worked at the resort. We will not likely ever return however. This is not a 5 star resort and is not all-inclusive. The management is aloof and not service oriented and the resort is grossly overpriced for the value. I have also learned to look more carefully at the materials in brochures provided by TNT. We will not likely use them in the future either.

<Content>not the best experience Not the best vacation. Rooms dark. Food was good. Services good. My mother fell down and broke her head while walking by the pool area. She was transported to the hospital and had 16 stiches. It took me, a threatening letter and ssome phone calls to be able to collect the money that we spent in doctor, ambulance,etc. I wanted my mother to be reimbursed for the total amount spent and I wanted all of us to be invited back. The general manager of the hotel was HIGHLY discourteus. We informed him that my mother fall because of some craks in the tiles. We took pictures and had witnessess. He actually negated everything. EXTREMELY RUDE and non-professional at all. He refused to invite us back and after many phone calls and long months of waiting, they finally sent the money after they collected it from their insurance company. POOR WAY OF DOING BUSSINESS.

<Content>Just got back 3/13/04 Well, there is a lot to tell. I could write a couple of pages on this place but I will make as short and detailed as I can.Good points. The beach is awesome. Powderlike sand and clear water. There is seaweed but you can see the areas where it is and it is grass like. The rest of the water has a sandy bottom like the beach. Plenty of beach chairs and places to sit. Drinks are good. Strong. Make sure you ask for rum in your drinks. I found if you didn't sometimes they wouldn't put it in. They have one kind of beer. Presidente. It is good. When in the lounge though ask for it in the bottle. There was a definate difference between the bottle and the draft. Not sure how often they clean the draft lines. The staff is helpful for the most part. By the end of the night you tell the waitresses are tired. The work non stop I swear. Nice grounds to walk around and they have a shopping market on the beach which is fun to bargain at. It is always 'happy hour' at these shops. You will see what I mean when your there.Bad points. The food. I know that is one of the main topics in these reviews and I can understand why. I had prepared myself after reading some of them so I wasn't going thinking I was eating anything American. For the most part the food wasn't bad. You definately need to try things you wouldn't at home. They use some kind of oil in everything they cook. The breakfast buffet is decent. The make eggs and omeletes to order. The dinner buffet wasn't bad either. They have chicken so if you picky you have that to fall back on. As far as the restaurants. Chez palace was excellent. It is $20 a head but worth it. Steak house sucked. Italian I can't even get into. It was awful. The service was terrible, the food was dreadful. The reuse the breadsticks from table to table. We saw them do it in front of us. The mexican restaurant was good and the seafood one wasn't bad, but don't expect lobster like it is from Maine. The pizza place at the Beach resort is good. Different then pizza here but good.  Ok the rooms. The rooms are nice but definatley need updating. Mostly the bathroom. But for what you're there for it is ok. What I noticed about the whole resort is that everything looks nice but when you really look at things up close the place isn't really that clean. One example was when sitting in th lounge I was looking at a lamp next to me and it was covered it dust and spiderwebs. Now you see people cleaning all day but there is still at lot of dust everywhere. So I was a litte confused with that. Now the good part. I was leaving a tip every couple of days for the maid because our room was kept up nice but on one of the days we got robbed from our room. There is a safe in each room which we were using. You put your own 4 digit code into for using. Well on one of the days my wife didn't shut it correctly and it was left open. When we got back to the room there was $150.00 missing from our money. We were quite upset. I talked to the Hotel director and basically there is nothing they can do about it. He said I could have filed a report with the police but he didn't recommend it due to the 'beauracracy' there in his words. So I dropped it after that. So make sure that when you use a safe you hold the door shut on it until it locks! We went on the shoping bonaza excursion. Quite the trip. We ended up at a Dominican Walmart. It was called the Jumbo. We went to a place where it was replica of a 15th century Italian village which was nice. they filmed Jurasic Park there too. It was on the 'bonanza' tour. So it kinda made up for the Jumbo. Overall it was a good trip. I wouldn't rush to go back I would like to see other islands first. I could write a lot more on some of the other things that happened but it would be too long. If you are into laying on the beach all day and having plently of drinks then this is the place. If you have any specific questions you can email me at jp682003@yahoo.com

<Content>on my way back Me and my family will be visiting the palace for the 2nd time this march. last year the weather wasnt the best but it still made for an awesome vacation. We didnt even have to leave the resort to go snorkeling. The snorkeling off the resort is much better than anything you will go out and see. We did have a few bad experiences with the food and the water. After eating some of the seafood and the beef the family had a few weak stomachs. nothign big but try to avoid it if possible. The problem wasnt drinking water it was the ocean. On a snorkeling trip outside the resort my brother stepped off the boat and sliced his foot very bad. WE were all pretty affraid because we were all imagining a 3rd world hospital. It turned out to be fine. The hospital had very good doctors that stiched up the foot. my advice is to stay around the resort. Theres a dock right down the beach and a water sports hut on the resort. i would recomend this place to anyone. By the way if anyone has kids around 16 and is going to be at the palace around march 16th email me please....

<Content>Amazing Experience- Its what you make it. Wow! We stayed last year April 2003 for 1 week. This was our first trip 'down south'. We were nervous, excited and scared all at the same time before we went. We were pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. We flew Air Transat and they were fantastic. The planes are crowed, but comfortable. The flight from Moncton is only 4 hours and you are way too exicted to care about how close you actually sit to one another. We arrived at the airport in Punta Cana and immediately could smell the warm air flooding into the plan cabin. It was like a big happy slap in the face. The customs check in was very easy - hand them your passport and travel card and you are stamped and waved though to collect your baggage. We waited and watched everyone push and shove their way to collect their baggage..why rush - we are on vacation and the air just makes you feel great - regardless if you are in an airport or not. By the time we got our baggage (maybe 15 mintues tops after arriving), we made it to the airport parking lot where all the shuttle buses from the Hotels are waiting to bring you to the resorts. We got on the last shuttle for our resort complex. We were booked into the Beach Caribe, but when we were on the road to the resort, the guide made an announcement that all the other shuttle buses had taken all the reservations for our resorts. We panicked. 30 seconds later the guide smiles and tells us that we are being upgraded to the Palace. No charge. WOW! Let's just say, I was excited. So, we arrived, BEAUTIFUL lobby with black marble everywhere and all kinds of amazing plants. Check in was painless - room key, numbers for the front desk, welcome to the resort.. usual stuff. We stayed in Block 3 which is the first block to the left of the reception desk. Directly in front of the main pool. You know what... who cares about Ocean view... we had a small terrace and we drank coffee there in the morning and watched the pool ripples and the beautiful palm trees. Weather - it rained 3 days out of 7 and was overcast for 2. We burned and tanned and still had a great time... The resort is just too beautiful to get all bent out of shape over things you can't control. This is your vacation and sitting around and pouting does no one any good.Staff - Great. Hard working and very friendly. Yes you see the same people serving you breakfast as you do as supper. I asked them about the long days, and their answer was they have 3 hours off during the day between shifts and they love their jobs and are proud to work at the Palace. Good enough answer. Besides... I would love to see anyone in Canada work an 18 hour day and still be smiling and dancing to the music while serving cranky Americans. People should just be thankful they get to take a vacation and suck it up.Rooms/Ground: Beautiful. I have never seen ground so beautiful in my life. We had a huge bunch of bananas growing in the courtyard of our block and the maids put fresh flowers in our room every day. The room was not fancy but clean. The bathrooms are cleaned every day with fresh towels usually by 3pm everyday. No worries, they leave lots so you should have more than enough for a shower in the morning and in the afternoon if you need one. The beds are a bit bigger than doubles and they are clean as well. Mini bar has a couple beer and some pop. Use and they replace it. If you want more, go ask a maid and they will give you more. No worries. Yes you smell something funny. It is called must and it doesn't hurt you. In fact, you don't notice by the second day. Honestly with the humidity... I am amazed it smells that great! With beautiful grounds and beautiful beach, why would spend any time other than sleeping in the room?Food: Good. The rotisserie chickens are just like home... and are really good after a long day. Tonnes of food you will always find something you like. I didn't get sick other than 1 hangover )self-induced) which lasted no more than a quick snooze for a couple of hours and some advil. The restaurants are good - Mexican was our favorite. No the food is not the same in all the restaurants. People who say this are on crack. I had faijitas and tacos and enchilladas all at the Mexican before I ate my meal. Maybe it wasn't hangover? Italian was fun... kinda romantic with small portions that are great with a couple of bread sticks and some wine. The Steakhouse was fun as well.. we had the filet mignon and it was fine. If you want more... please ask... salad bar was great.Beach - BEAUTIFUL- White Sand, Blue water. Nuff said.Beach chairs. Yes, people save them. If they don't come back for hours - take them. Simple. People need to share and maybe you need to teach them... they are actually plenty, but are too lazy to drag them from one spot on the beach to the other... so they complain. Towels are freely distributed.. so long as you leave your towel card. Pick it up when you are done for the day or want to do something else.One final comment... vacations are what you make them. If you want to get sick, not eat the fruit, be stupid and drink unpurified water and be cranky... suit yourself. We had crappy weather and still felt like a million bucks while we were there and when we returned. No e-mails, no pagers, no cell phones.. paradise anyone?

<Content>The Palace is Great We stayed at the Palace February 15-22, 2004m and had a great time. I would highly recommend it. Yes, it is true that the food was not as spectacular as a gourmet restaurant, but we all found something we enjoyed at the buffet. If you don't like steamtable foods, you can get fish, chicken, or meat grilled to order. There was plenty of fresh fruit, and a great softserve ice cream machine. The rooms and grounds were immaculate, and the beach was wonderful. No hotel is perfect, but the Palace makes for a great family vacation. As for many of the complaints voiced in some reviews, attitude is everything. Yes, few of the staff speak English, but that added to the charm of the vacation for us. Yes, it sometimes was hard to get a beach chair if you didn't put a towel down prior to lunch time, but I saw hotel staff bringing extra lounge chairs to the beach on several occasions. The beach in front of the Palace was far superior to anything else in sight in terms of shade from Palm trees and sand. I noticed numerous people from other hotels on the beach at the Palace, which may have contributed to the shortage of chairs. If you are the type of person who thinks the glass is half full, you will have a wonderful time. If you are the type of person who always thinks the glass is half empty, then you probably will find things to complain about. We can't wait to return to the Palace.

<Content>Hotel Synopsis The Barcelo Bavaro Palace Resrt is a beautiful hotel. We were there from Feb. 14 -21, 2004. The lobby, pool and beach are beautiful. The grounds are immaculate. They constantly clean and restock the mini bars throughout the entire day. The food was great, and if you get bored with the buffet you can go to many other restaurants. Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant. The seafood and steak restaurants were good. As well as the made to order pizzas. When I read other reviews about people hating the food I find it humorous. You are in the Dominican Republic and they don't make typical American food EXACTLY as we eat in America. You are not in America. However, they try and it is good. It is also nice to try other food that is more standard for their country. The room was not fancy, however, I didn't expect it to be. It was very spanish style with natural stone and ceramic tile on the floors. The workers were very nice and worked VERY hard. Most did not know a lot of English but if you knew a little, they appreciated it. They also greatly appreciated it when we gave them tips. I think that because it is an all inclusive resort, people do not feel obligated to give them tips. We just gave the diiferent workers a couple bucks each day and they really made an extra effort to please you. They make very little money and the tips mean so much to them. The only questionable area of the hotel was the front desk. They would litterally pretend they didn't hear you and ignore you if they did not understand you or could not give you want you were asking for. This did not happen to me personally, but I saw it happen to others. The night we checked in, there were two girls that had reservations, however, it was not in the hotels system and they were sold out so they were unable to give them a room. after hours (literally) the girls received a room at a sister hotel (that was not as nice) but they were able to use all the facilities as if they were staying at the palace. My brother-in-law was promised two cribs and only received one the first night. Over all no place is perfect. If we ever go back to D.R. we will definitely stay there again!!

<Content>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly The Good: We stayed at the palace from Feb9th-Feb16th 2004. The hotle is very clean, they are constantly mopping and sweeping the floors, the ashtrays are always clean and the room was very clean. We were in Block 4 and our room was very large and quiet. It only smelled musty on a few occasions but the air conditioner fixed that. The mini bar was always stocked w/ beer, water, soda and candy, what you used was replenished the next day. Most of the staff was friendly and was always trying to help you if they could. Some spoke excellent English, some spoke a little but enough to be understood and some spoke none at all. We learned some Spanish before we went so that helped A LOT! The transfer train was always on time so we were always able to go from hotel to hotel w/ ease. There were barely any bugs, a couple of flies and mosquitos but nothing to aggravate you. The beach was the absolute most beautiful beach I have ever seen on an island. Clean and white! The water was as clear as a pool, it was amazing, so blue and so warm. A little bit of seaweed, but it is to be expected as it is the sea, nothing to get in the way. The food was ok, not the best but you can find good stuff if you search hard. I will write more about the food later. The most important thing, we did not get sick at all! NO stomach aches, nothing. The Bad: Although the food was ok if you found the right thing to eat, over all I hated it but my husband liked some of it. The buffet had a roach near the fruit, that turned my stomach. The fruit looked like it had been left out for days. The food was the same every day. Some of it was a little too oily but not so bad although it was rarely hot. The buffet was always the same and the yogurt was never kept on ice it was all warm and runny. No matter which hotel resturant you went to, the food was all the same. The Mexican resturant had the same stuff as the buffet w/ the exception of some jalepenos and tortilla chips. The Italian resturant was like recycled buffet food. My husband ordered Chick Caccitore (Spelling) and got a piece of fried chicken and a side of rice. I ordered Mint Ravioli and got 3 small ravioi in a bowl w/ the same cheese and tomato sauce that they used for the take out pizzas, which I'll get to next. The pizzas were thin crust w/ barely any tomato sauce and tons of oily cheese that tasted kind of foul. We were not happy w/ the food. They only give you domestic alcohol so if you order wine, be ready to drink something that was brewed in someone's bathtub. It is like moonshine and it comes in a recycled water bottle or carrafe. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. If you do not ask for Rum in your tropical drink, they will not give it to you. There are NO ATM Machines anywhere except for one on the whole complex, you have to take the transfer train to the Plaza and it only pays in Pesos. The front desk nor will the Casino exchange the Pesos for American Cash, you must get a taxi to a bank in town, which will cost you about $24 USD. We wanted to go GO Cart Racing, we had NO cash on us and asked the guest relations person if the Go Cart people accept a credit card. They said in fact they did. When we got to the Go Carts the person in charge said they DID NOT accept credit cards, so we had to be driven back to the Plaza, 15 minute drive, get Pesos out of the ATM and go back to the GO Carts. A lot of time is wasted on your trip because of misinformation by way of the staff. We paid $140 to swim w/ the dolphins. There is a little desk in the lobby w/ a representative of Manati Park, we gave him the cash, he gave us the receipt and transfer ticket. When the day came to swim w/ the dolphins, the people at Manati park said the Rep. forgot to book our trip. Finally after waiting for 2 hours we were allowed to swim w/ the dolphins which lasted 5 minutes. Manati park was nice but be prepared to get screwed around. Use your cellphone for calls. If you use the room phone and dial out, even if the call does not connect, they charge you $25 USD per call. There is NO free snorkeling, unless you want to snorkel off the beach and there is little to see except the occasional fish or urchin. You must pay for snorkel trips or diving. People leave a towel on a beach chair all day, they get up and put the towel there and then leave for the day, it is rude and unfair, so we just moved the towels out of the way. A lot of the guests are rude in general, I don't know why but they shove you right out of the way. They are selfish and it made me really mad. The Ugly: Nasty, topless women. I don't think there is anything wrong w/ going topless if you have the body for it but these people were old, and wrinkly and saggy, it was hard to not notice, I am traumatized. Be prepared to see tons of very obese people squeezing into tiny bikinis and bathing suits. Overall, if it is your first vacation it will be hard to compare it so you may just love it, but we have been away before and stayed at Sandals, where EVERYTHING is included and the Chef's are multi international. At Sandals you pay for NOTHING and the staff is required to be nice to you and communicate. Also, Sandals is adults only so if you are looking to get away from your kids alone w/ your SO, stay away from resorts w/ children. There is nothing worse than arranging a sitter for the kids so you can get away, waking up to have breakfast at the palace and eating next to a family w/ a screaming baby, or laying on the beach and having kids run by yelling and kicking sand in your face!

<Content>Best trip EVER! Theirs just bad reviews from bad ppl. O.k. first of all, the staff on the resort was sooo friendly. It's also great bcuz their were a total of about 5-6 restaurants that were completely different. Theirs a steakhouse, a mexican place, a little awsome pizza hut on the side of the pool, that would make u ur own fresh pizza, a margarita (that's just cheeze 'n' pep.) Their was an awsome bar that would serve me liquor till i dropped and i was only 15 at the time. but thats o.k. The golf course was a little hurting, but it's still a golf course. The many gorgeous topless women of different nationalities. PERFECT VACATION

<Content>Can't wait to return We stayed at the Beach unit March 2003 and LOVED the staff - they were the greatest. They took good care of us when we requested a waterfront unit upon arrival. Can't wait to get back there but waiting for arrival of a new grandchild this February. Food was good and plenty of it. Water and facilities very clean and staff most pleasant and friendly.

<Content>Really enjoyed the Bavaro Beach Palace Hotel My wife and I just returned yesterday from the Barcelo Palace in Punta Cana. Last year we were in the Mayan Riviera (Mexico) and also stayed at a Barcelo Hotel. So far we have been more than pleased with this hotel chain. This year, we travelled with Air Transat Tours and were quite satisfied. Transfer to the hotel went without a hitch and we got our bracelet as soon as we reached the hotel. Our rooms were not ready and some people were complaining but what do you expect! How many hotels have your rooms ready at 12h30pm? We changed and enjoyed the pool and restaurant for an hour or two. Our room was exactly what we had requested, 3rd floor, balcony with an excellent ocean view, very clean and spacious.  I can't say enough about the Dominican workers at the Palace. They went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. We never and I mean Never had a problem communicating with the employees. We always tried to speak what little Spanish we knew and if we got stuck, we used hand gestures (it's all part of the experience of visiting a different country). But 95% of the time, the employees spoke Spanish, some English and some French. Come on people, this is a Spanish country. If you want everyone to speak English, stay home or visit England. The food is good and quite varied. For those who have complained (in previous evaluations) that there was no American food...I say go home and find a MacDonald. We ate in 7 restaurants and enjoyed unlimited lobster, shrimp, fish and Dominican food cooked right in front of you. The beach and pool are wonderful but it is a little too windy for my taste and the water (being on the Atlantic) is colder than I would have liked. No trip is perfect. At the Italian restaurant, we ordered a beer and glass of wine...which we never got. We asked 3 times for a candle like all the other tables...which we never got. We asked for 2 coffees with our deserts...which we never got. Instead of getting upset, we just laughed about it and left (no tip by the way). You just don't let a little thing like that spoil your vacation.All in all, a great vacation, beautiful hotel, gorgeous beach, good food and great people. I would go back any time.Forget all those negative reviews. If those persons are as negative as that on holidays, can you imagine how miserable they are at home?

<Content>The Palace was not a disappointment! We just returned from the Palace last night (January 30, 2004) from a one-week stay. We also were worried about the negative reviews we had read on the internet. We have travelled to many sunny locations and always stay at 5 star or 4.5 star. In our opinion this was not a top notch 5 star like some other places we have stayed. However, for the DR it probably was. Our room was on the top floor in building #6. It did not smell, it was very clean and it was large with a king size bed, table and chairs and plenty of dresser room and hangers for clothes.I am very fussy when it comes to food and cleanliness. While the food at the Buffet Restaurants was just OK, in terms of taste, I did not see flies all over the place etc. We may have seen the odd fly; I see the odd fly in Canada and I don't cook and eat outdoors everyday!! I agree with some of the other writers; if you want to speak and eat American stay home. We had no problem making ourselves understood. We also were never hungry. On the contrary we ate at the restaurants where the food was very good. The writer who said the La Pina bar-be-que on the beach was fantastic was not exaggerating.Another note on cleanliness - the public washrooms(lobby and pool areas) were extremely clean from first thing in the morning until late in the day.The Dominican is a very poor country. I am sure if I was educated enough to speak fluent English I would not work in an all inclusive hotel where tips are probably few and far between!The beach and the weather were both beautiful. You will see a fair number of topless women, but ladies nothing to get upset about. Most of these women must just like the sun because they are no beauty queens!!We went golfing and found the golf course was not much more than what we would consider a hackers course, but there seemed to be plenty of other people there enjoying themselves. Personally, we find it too hot to golf in tropical places. But to each there own.And I guess that is the thing to remember when you travel. Everyone likes something different and what I may think is great won't be for the next traveller.We wanted to visit the DR. We are glad we did and we were not disappointed with the Palace and what we paid for.By the way, the drinks are not watered down!!

<Content>Had a great week at the Palace!! We just returned from a week at the Palace and we had a great time. I'm glad that I didn't listen to all of these people complaining. The beach was the most beautiful that I've seen....and I've been to many places. I really can't say enough about it. The grounds/gardens were very nice also. I think that most of these complainers had set unrealistic expectations for themselves. This is not in the US! I guess I'd ask...when in the States do you expect visitors to speak english or should you understand their language? Sure many of the staff didn't speak much english, but none of our group of 5 had any trouble getting what we wanted. The food was good....of course not quite like home, but we ate at pretty much every restaurant on the resort and all of us found something that we enjoyed.....and we had one who can't eat dairy, and one vegetarian in our group. La Pina on the beach was awesome! Fish, chicken, burgers...it was great! The rooms were clean and nice, although ya they had a bit of a smell. We didn't spend too much time in the room though, and after the first day or so we didn't even really notice it. We played 3 rounds of golf and had no trouble booking tee-offs at all. We just phoned the day before (usually around 8am) to book. The course was in better shape than I expected, and it was challenging. If you are looking for great weather, incredible scenery, lying on the beach, and some relaxation this is a great place to go.

<Content>Stay home instead How do you build a resort from scratch that is this terrible? Awful food, untrained staff, damp dark rooms, broken beach chairs, watered down drinks, grostesquely obese tatooed guests and the list goes on indefinetely.The absolute worst hotel that I have ever been to. My wife and four children agree. We will never return.

<Content>If you like this place you haven't traveled much!!! Where do I begin? This place was a waste of money!!! My husband and I just got married and took 2 weeks to vacation here as a second honeymoon. Our travel agent listed honeymoon on our booking and I even mentioned it when we were checking in the room. They gave us an ocean view room....(that's what we paid for anyway!). Since this was the low season the capacity of the resort was 3/4 empty. we traveled in sept.2003. Our first night was freezing since the a/c is either on or off...no temp. control. We complained to the front desk and were told it would be fixed. We requested a non smoking room which we got, but we were woken up each night at 9:30 by the smokers in the room next door. The smoke went through our vents when the A/C was on. The resort said they had no other rooms available. The itinerary that was given to us re:restaurant hours/shows/drinkoptions etc was all wrong! The hours of the restaurants were not the same as on the sheet. They were changed to shorter hours since the holtel was not to full capacity...so breakfast ended at 10:30 (a continental breakfast was available for an hour after that...but if you miss that you had to wait til 12:30 noon to get something.) The attire was not specific for the restaurants. My husband had shorts on and a golf shirt for the buffet dinner and we were told we couldn't go in since he needed pants! My husband got very ill the 3rd day there(in bed for 2 full days)...I wanted to take some food back to the room for him....that was an ordeal since i wasn't allowed to take anything back to the room. No one speaks english! I'm not acting like a snobby american but this resort is in the people business and they have the I don't care attitude when you're asking questions! we booked a boat trip one day...waited and hour 1/2 the next afternoon to find out it was cancelled! I had to call apple tours myself and ask why they didn't notify us since they found out at 7a.m. that morning. Isn't that why we give our room numbers and names? Tried it twice more and they did the same thing! You may ask why we booked so many times? It's because we were staying there for 2 weeks and wanted to leave the resort! the markets were pushy...worse thatn other islands I have been to. Once they know you know what you're talking about they want nothing to do with you. The disco is fun for one night. After that each night the d.j. played I could tell you the next song that was coming up. He was horrible....the crowd would be dancing then he'd play a song that would clear the floor. I'm pretty to please...i've been in the restaurant business for 20years and have dealt with all kinds of people...you are supposed to make sure these people have a good time so they'll come back! I was in shock to see a staff so untrained for dealing with the public! Especially vacationers. Nothing was ever mentioned by a worker about our honeymoon... nothing was ever made special for us...none of the staff even tries to stike a conversation with you asking where you're from or your name. The same cd played at the poolbar all day everyday! My husband doesn't speak spanish but had to signal to the bartender to break the cd in 1/2! Then we offered our CD's so we could hear someting different! You would think that they would have a selection to play...nope! just 1 CD! They gym was alway under construction...so we never got to use that! One of our biggest complaint was the food...it sucked!!! Each day was a different combination from last nights food...no variety!!! Nothing was fresh. The bar choices got us angry also! When you list premium liquors as unlimited beverages it shouldn't change once you get there. They only offered the cheapest of vod/gin/tequilia. Even a whiskey sour had to be paid for! When you order a frozen drink you better ask for liquor in it or after the 3rd you'll wonder why you can't taste andy alcohol. Bartenders had personalties of rocks! overall...it was a waste of money. I'll never go back. These people act like they could care less that you're vacation stinks. Someone need to train the staff a lot more with dealing with the public!!! ADVICE: DON'T WASTE YOUR'E TIME!!!

<Content>Don't Listen to the Bad Reviews...Beautiful Hotel on a Beautiful Beach Let me just say, Punta Cana has the most magnificent beaches of anywhere in the Carribean. And I have been to MANY islands there...I stayed at the Barcelo on my first trip to Punta Cana and was pleased with the stay. The beaches were a bit crowded with the weater sports and swimmers, but the water was crystal clear and the sands pristine white. VERY well maintained. The timeshare people were a bit annoying but don't bother you much if you tell them you are not interested. As for the hotel- the rooms were pretty standard for a resort of its caliber...nothing extraordinary but definitely not run down at all. Maid staff was a bit slow, but did their jobs. Its the Carribean afterall! Food was OK....dessert was definitely the highlight at the buffets. Main courses were boring....same almost daily. Overall, the grounds of the hotel were well maintained and landscaped and the rooms were nice. Food could have been better but if you want a lovely beach escape, this is for you.

<Content>Prison in the Caribbean!! This place sucks!! I was there for a week with a pal attending the International Golf Conference last month. The term '5 star' is quite meaningless in these parts of the world and will give you no indication of quality. One point which keeps cropping up in reviews of this place is the musty damp feel and smell of the rooms. How true. In short this place is like prison; literally you cant get out if you want to no cr hire or even scooter hire. I have had too in to therapy since leaving. Please please dont go it's dreadful.

<Content>A teenagers review ( important to see) Hello....Do not disregard my review just because I am 17 years old. This review is very important if you have teenage children because there are things here that other people don't say. Well, I arrived to the Punta Cana Airport on Saturday december 27th, 2003.....Flight was fine..Then we got picked up by a bus and taken to the bavaro barcelo beach hotel...first night got stuck in a room without oceanview....the room smelled like mildew and the bed felt extremely damp so I wasnt able to sleep under the covers or use the pillows. The next day my friends parents requested that we be switched to a room that was ocean front, and that was much better. Plumbing was not that great and it took a while to flush everything down. Shower water went from hot to cold in one second without you even touching it ( but it was ok)...As most of you probably know you can not drink the tap water in the Dominican Republic, so we had to brush our teeth and wash our face with bottled water ( it makes you appreciate what you have at home). Every day our fridge was stocked with Water, sodas, and beer which was nice, and helped us enjoy our stay. The pool at our hotel was nice however if u didn't wake up to get a lounge chair at 7 there was no way u would find one till people starting leaving at 5 PM. My friend and I slept till 12 every day so we just ended up going to the pool at the casino which was much quieter and sunnier. We would lay on the edge of the pool with the sun directly on us which was nice. If you have younger kids make sure to cover their eyes( tons of topless women). The beach was gorgious however extremely windy. My friend and I werent able to sit on the beach without our hair blowing in our faces. Food was okay. Breakfast I never was able to wake up for but most of the restaurants have meals that are buffets. Tons of food. I am a vegitarian and most things were labeled which was nice. I had pasta for lunch and dinner mostly every day. The food tasted ok, nothing great, nothing horrible. I didn't like the desserts, however, the strawberry ice cream was delicious! I have a very sensitive stomach and I didin't get sick once which is a shocker for me. Also, another good thign about the hotel. There is a doctors office/infirmary for if your sick which is also very handy. I was also at the hotel for new years eve. In our rooms we all received a bottle of Dominican Republic rum and a gift basket and an invitation to come to dinner at any of the restaurants and a new years eve celebration. Everyone received a package of noisemakers and hats to celebrate. I went to the bavaro discoteca for new years and that was very wild. Now this is the part for teenagers...Ok so the drinking age in the dominican republic is 18. This means if u are not 18 you can not get into the disco. If you can not get into the disco there is absolutely nothing else for you to do at night.If your not 18 or dont have Id try to make friends wit the bouncer ( offer him the double kiss thing one on each cheeck) it worked for my friend and I and we got in every night..Even if u don't drink it's still nice to go and fun to meet ppl from all over the world. My friend and I met such cool kids, from places like, Venezuela, Holland, Spain, Israel, Germany, other places in the US, etc. Those friendships are ones that will last forever.The shops were nice and the flea market at the barcelo bavaro palace hotel was nice. I never got so much free jewelery in my life. The guys give it away to the girls in bathingsuits cuz they want you to buy stuff. A lot of people say that most people don;t speak spanish there however i know no spanish and I got by fine. Most of the workers and people there understand a lil english and you can get by. If you are ordering alcohol make sure you say that you want alcohol or else you wont get it. Well overall the trip was fun, but I don't know if I would go back to the same resort because there wasnt that many activities for teens/kids. Please consider all of this before you plan your vacation. Email me if you have any questions. Good luck Planning!

<Content>not worth it! Upon arriving at the 'Palace' we were notified in extremely broken english that our rooms were not ready and would be at least another half hour. Be advised this was at 10pm! The rooms were fine, not the 5 stars they were bragged to be, but clean - and with fridge full of all-included beer, soda, and bottled water. The lobby bar was slow - and the selection attrocious, even for my already low expectations. Be careful of Presidente Beer - its 6% alcohol and strange taste hit you hard!  The disco is smokey, and full of guys trying to pick up anything that moved. This made my girlfriend and sister very uncomfortable. The caino is small, smokey and the black jack tables are cruise ship rules (the dealer deals himslf one card then the last card on the table). The dealers are pretty bad too - I had to tell the dealer what I had more than once. Pay attention, this isn't Vegas, there are a lot of rookies here. Here's the kicker - the food was absolutely horrible. I don't want to sound like a stuck up American but I couldn't stomach much of anything. The one highlight was the French Restaurant - well worth the $20 extra. Stay away from the wine - including the stuff extra on the list - unless you're willing to shell out the extra $85 for Dom Perignon. I was dreaming of fast food by day 3. Off the resort, the island is poor, depressing, with little to offer as far as shopping, food, or anything. Save your cash and go to the virgin islands, bahamas, costa rica - anywhere...

<Content>Wonderful Honeymoon Spot! My husband and I went on our honeymoon to this resort in October '03. We stayed at the Palace which was definately worth it. We paid an upgrade of $99 for the entire trip (not per night!) through our travel agent and got an ocean front room, free trip on a glass-bottom boat out to the coral reefs and free dinner at the 5-star French restaurant - all definately worth it! It was a bargain. The resort was beautiful, beaches gorgeous and food unbelievable (so many different restaruants and so many choices). We truly felt like we were in paradise. It was very quiet while we were there - due to it being their low season. The rooms are nice, and the maids are great about cleaning the rooms and always keeping the minibar stocked with bottled water, beer, sodas and candy bars. The waiters NEVER let your glass get empty. They were all so friendly and attentive. I am amazed at the reviews complaining about no one speaking English, because this is a European resort! You will see tons of men in Speedos and topless women and very few of the tourist are American. That is part of the charm of this place. We don't speak Spanish, but were able to manage just fine. Don't expect everyone to know English, but many of the people there at least know a little or can direct you to someone who does know Engish. This is definately a place to veg-out. It is not a high energy resort. But you can find as little or as much to do there that wou want. There is a casino, shows, golf and mini-golf, etc. Great when you want to just get away to a beautiful tropical location. I can't say enough about it. We hope to return many more times! Hope this helps in your decision making!

<Content>Paradise.  Our family went to Punta Cana for five days. It was our first trip there and we loved it and can't wait to go back. The people are so warm and friendly. The food was excellent. The wait staff was so accomidating. Upon arrival, we were in a room with no view. We spoke to someone at the desk and the next day we were moved to an ocean view room which was always kept clean. The pool was clean

<Content>Nice beach, bad food The beach was very nice. The rooms were clean. The grounds were kept nice and clean. We had paid extra for an ocean view but it was not given to us and the people at the reception spoke little English so there was little to do. The staff there speaks virtually no English. That was the second to worst problem. The worst problem was that the food was bad. Lots of bad food to choose from. Lots of overcooked fish dishes for your eating pleasure. Lots of unbitable meats for fine dining. All the tasteless fruits you can imagine. You can pay extra ($20 per person) and go to a choice of a couple of restaurants where the food was good and the some of the staff actually spoke English. What a treat! Overall, it was nice, but disappointing.

<Content>Loved it. We recently travelled to Barcelo Bavaro Beach Hotel (December 1st, 2003 - December 8, 2003). From the begining of our vacation to the end, we had a great time. Please bare in mind that we have travelled to Saint Martin, Mexico - All Over, and Dominican Republic. This was our second time in DR.Punta Cana Airport: The main building is made of straws and bamboo and is very unique. DO NOT EXPECT THIS PLACE TO BE AIRCONDITIONED however the breeze keeps everything cool.Immigration: No issues. As long as you have proper documentation, rest assured that you will be through in 5 minutes.Baggage Collection: It takes about 20 minutes to retrieve your baggage. Once again, no issues.Transfer to the Hotel: We booked our 1 week All Inclusive trip thorugh a travel agency (Selloffvacations.com) and this package was offered through World of Vacations. Transfers to and from your resort are included in the package. We picked up our package from World of Vacations counter Terminal 3 Pearson International Airport. Make sure that the package includes all the appropriate vouchers, Tourist Cards, Air Plane Tickets etc. The transfer to our hotel took approximately 15 minutes and it was very well organized. There were only a couple of complainers - complaining about the heat. WAKE UP - YOU ARE IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.Hotel Check In: At our resort, there were only about 8 - 10 people checking-in. No problems checking in. Although Selloffvacations and World of Vacations failed to book this vacation as a honeymoon couple - as requested by me however the check in staff were somewhat accommodating and very professional. We did bring a little spanish book with us however we did not need it as the front desk staff spoke perfect English. We did try to speak Spanish anyway.Hotel Room: No complaints. Our room had the best oceanview (3213). The firdge was filled with pop, beer and Dasani Water Bottle (1L). The toliet was separated via a door from the main bathroom. Excellent idea. The safe is very easy to use - just punc in a four digit code and press lock (Make sure that the safe door locks are aligned with the safe frame properly). To unlock just press the four digit code and the safe will unlock. Good idea to keep all your important documents, cash, jewellery etc. in this spot.Beach: Beautiful. Not as clean as the Beach by RIU Resorts in Punta Cana but then again, we never got to see any fish on the beach by Riu. Beach chairs could use a face lift. I would rate this beach as 9.5/10. Lots of activities on the beach. We got pulled into some and really enjoyed them. Several topless women walk and sunbath in and around the beach.Shuttle: This is a huge resort (5 resorts in 1). The shuttles will tranfer you back and forth between all the resorts at no cost and run frequently (About every ten minutes) between 6:00 am - 4:00 am.Pool: Nice pool and very nice chairs. Pool is not as large as some of the other ones we have seen. Few pool activities and we brought our own flotation device and made a fool of ourselves trying to get on it. Pool at some of the other Barcelo Resorts are bigger. Few topless women in and around the pool area - not very attractive when you are eating by the pool area.Entertainment: The Animacion Team works hard and long days to keep the guests entertained. They are extremely polite. They have activities by the pool ( I won a couple of certificates even ) such as volleyball, stretching, waterball catching, dance lessons etc. They could incorporate other activities in the pool such as water aerobics and other sports in the pool. In the evening, the show takes place close to the lobby from 10:00 - 11:15 or so. Very entertaining. Once again, I was asked politely to join one show and I could not refuse. After the show is over, you could go to the Disco (There are 2), one of the Bars or to the neighboring casino. Definitely go and attend the Tropicallissimo show (Just let the PR Person at your front desk know that you would like to attend this show and they will give you a little receipt that will guarantee your entrance to the show. No reservations are required. It is alot of fun and lasts appro. 1.15 hours.Disco: Bavaro Disco is a decent sized place and is air conditioned. Music is very North American however they play a mix ranging from top 40's, 80's, hip hop, euro, techno and some latino. The other Disco is about 5 minutes walk from this one and plays mostly latino music. It is not air conditioned. We went to Bavaro Disco as often as we could (We are both into the club scene and had a great time). Bavaro Disco also has a fast food place attached to it where you could have hamburgers and hotdogs until 4:00 am.Restaurant: I just cannot say enough great things about the restaurants. Our hotel had Three main restaurants.Restaurant Lindo: Mexican Restaurant. Our number one choice. Superb Menu and Service. This is a la carte' however you can order as much from the menu as your stomach fancies. They also have a good choice of munchies (Tacos, salads etc.) as a buffet style that you can eat before the main course. Desset is buffet style. They only serve dinner. This hotel is airconditioned. No reservations are required.Steakhouse: This restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. This place is not air conditioned. It is also a la carte however you can order more then one item from the menu. They also have a good choice of salads, soups etc. before you can have your main course. Dessert is from a menu for lunch and dinner. For lunch, you do not have to be dressed up however at dinner time, it may be a good idea to dress casually but smartly. This restaurant also has a take out attached to it where you can order pizzas from 12:00 pm until 12:00 midnight.Ambar: This is the main restaurant and is located in the lobby area. It is all buffet style. Beachware is not allowed. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good variety of food and every evening, they have grilled lobster (No surcharge) and sometimes calamari as well. Good choice of desserts.La Uva: This hotel is located on the beach, app 5 minute walk from Beach Hotel. It is very casual and has pretty good menu.Mirador: Buffet style restaurant something like the Ambar restaurant however this one was located the the Golf  Casino Resort. Nice choice of items once again.Los Pinos: Italian restaurant however we eat Italian at home most days so we did not go there.All in all, you will not go hungry. I have gained some extra weight from eating a ton of lobster and calamari.ANY RESTAURANT NOT LOCTAED WITHIN YOUR OWN HOTEL REQUIRES THE GUESTS TO BRING A SMALL RECEIPT THAT GUESTS CAN REQUEST FROM THE FRONT DESK PR PERSON.Weather: This is something that no one can control. We had pretty good weather for a few days. One day, it rained all day and when I say rian - that is an understatement. We met Hurricane Odette or Audette. It poured non stop buckets of water. We did everything we normally did with the exception of sunbathing. We still went for a walk on the beach and went dancing at night.Transfer to the Airport: Excellent. no issues however to spend three hours on the airport is a bit too much.Other: Bring some insect repellant, advil and stomach remedies to be on the safe side. Doctor's office is located on the premise and have some kind of coverage (Residents of Onatrio are covered for US$55 physician fee which you have to pay locally and then claim it through OHIP. Visa Gold Card Holders do not need to purchase any medical insurance as they are fully covered for physician consultation and drugs. Your company's health benefits may also include out of Province coverage and cover both physician consultation and prescription drugs). Bring all the necessary lotions, creams, razors etc. as the prices in the gift shop are over priced. Feel free to tip the waiters, towel person, restaurant staff as they really appreciate it.I cannot think of anything else. We took about 500 pictures (Personal, beach, restaurant, shows, hotels, pool etc.). I would definitely return to this resort in a heartbeat but would like to stay for 10 or 11 days. 1 Week is not enouh and 2 weeks would be too much. For more specific information, feel free to email me and I will try to reply within a day or two.

<Content>Been there, done that, no need to visit again We were part of a large International Golf Travel Convention staying at the Palace from Dec. 8-12, 2003. We had visited the Melia Caribe first, and were looking forward to the Palace as we heard it would be superior. Not! While this resort is listed as a five-star, it would be 2 any else in the world, at best. The staff were not as friendly or as visable as we had elsewhere in the Dominican. Frankly, we were surprized by the I just don't care attitude of the staff here, as hadn't experienced it elsewhere in the Dominican.Check-in and check-out a disaster. Nearly 2 hours to check out, with a convention on property and noon check-out for all, you would think management would have thought to put more than 2 staff behind the desk to speed the process. It was a joke. Frazzeled nerves from all including staff, with bills wrong, credit card machine mal-functioning, etc.Upon being shown to our room and opening the door, we were literally hit in the face with a musty, moldy smell and dampness in the air which prevailed throughout our stay. The room and our clothes stank, we had to leave the terrace door open all night in order to sleep. Never got the room safe to work. TV didn't work either, finally on day three they replaced it.The beach was ok, but crowded at this vast property, and not nearly as lovely or clean as its neighbor, the Melia Caribe. The food slightly better at the buffets, but didn't have the great choices such as the Japanese or Mexican, or if they did we didn't find them. We did dine at the Spanish restaurant one evening and it was just o.k.The convention center was fine, but internet access a problem, and no or sporadic international cell phone access. While this property wishes to be in the convention biz, it has a long way to go staff/service wise.The disco was fun but totally techno music and loud. The casino small but fun if you plan on spending half an hour there there. You travel across the vast property from venue to venue via train.I changed my flight to depart a day early as frankly couldn't wait to leave.

<Content>Some noticeable disappointments... In a word.....  1) Nobody spoke English  2) Food selection good, but most food was of their cuisine (not American)  3) Hotel is 1 of 5 in a guarded complex. You have access to restaurants  other amenities but don't plan on seeing any other parts of Punta Cana.  4) Hotel rooms are very noisy. Constant sounds of metal doors slamming and wooden chairs dragging across the tile floors.  5) Numerous places around the complex smell like raw sewage.  6) If weather is bad, good luck finding something to do.  7) Steakhouse Restaurant always out of steak!  8) Bottled water galore!

<Content>Don't Go To The Palace With High Expectations Or You Will Be Disappointed My fiance and I just returned from a one-week stay (Dec. 6-13) at the Bavaro Beach Palace Resort in Punta Cana. For a quick, reasonably priced getaway from the cold weather in Toronto, the Palace suited us fine. A five-star in the DR would be like a 3-star in Toronto. The hotel grounds and gardens were immaculate and beautiful. The lobby, bar areas, entertainment section, dining areas and walkways in the hotel were very clean and spacious. The cleaning staff and waitstaff were very attentive and seemed friendly and accomodating. Their English was not very good but they always welcomed us with a big smile. Our room had a king-sized bed, we had requested ocean view but received a garden view. The walls of the room were very thin and we could hear the people in the rooms next door making all sorts of noise with their closet doors, moving furniture around, and thumping the bedpost against the wall! :) One morning, we awoke to find that our safe was malfunctioning. We called reception and were told there was a block of rooms experiencing the same problem with their safes. They were working on the problem. We spent a nervewracking day unable to access our safe or obtain any money that we had stored in the safe. Finally, after visiting reception four times during the day and placing numerous calls to reception from our room to find out WHEN the serviceman would arrive to fix our safe, they actually sent a technician from the hotel to drill a hole in the safe to open it! The safe was busted for the rest of our stay. They did not even bother to clean up the debris from the hole in the safe. There was no way we could lock the safe anymore since it was busted. Luckily, this happened on our second-last day of our vacation. We still had to carry our wallets, passports, money, etc. around with us because we could not leave them in an unsecure safe. We were disappointed that the hotel staff did not jump on this problem with the safes immediately. They should have been repaired as soon as possible, instead of keeping people waiting all day. This safe incident symbolized how inefficient and lackadaisacal the reception and management could be at the Palace hotel. The reception area in the lobby seemed very disorganized. They still do everything manually the old-fashioned way. At checkout, if you have charged anything to your room or placed any phone calls, the reception staff has to manually prepare invoices and call the credit card company for authorization. They also have an old-fashioned dot matrix printer that takes forever and makes an annoying racket that grated on our nerves as we stood in line to check out.Be prepared to spend at least 40 minutes waiting in line. My fiance and I did not have any charges and took all of one minute to check out, despite having waited in line for 40 minutes. The food at the Palace buffet was all right but nothing spectacular. We got tired of it within 3 days. The wine they serve at dinner is totally watered down and tastes awful. There is a grill at the front when you walk in with a selection of meats, plus a nice stir fry area. After a few lunches and dinners at the buffet, we were bored of red beans, rice, broccoli and some type of protein. When you stay at the Palace, you have access to all 15 restaurants at the Bavaro Beach complex. One night, we tried the Mexican. It was a pleasant surprise and nice change from the monotony of the Buffet. Another evening, we tried the Italian. It was one of the worst meals we have ever experienced. The service was terrible, the lighting in the Italian restaurant is so dim you cannot even read the menu properly, and the food was atrocious. They mixed up our orders, the chicken was stale and undercooked, and it was as if they just microwaved the plate. Avoid the Italian restaurant at all costs! This review must sound like I am totally trashing the Palace hotel but I am not. We enjoyed our stay very much and except for these few flaws I have indicated, I would suggest going to the Palace if you are looking for good value for your money ( we can't imagine what a 3 or 4 star at the Bavaro complex would be like if the Palace had this many little problems) on your vacation. This is not the place for honeymooners and it is not geared towards families, although they have childrens activities. Go to the Palace, have a great time but don't go there with high expectations or you will be disappointed.

<Content>A wonderful time, except for just ok food My family of 6 including 4 children of 10,15,18, and 20 spent 5 nights over Thanksgiving @ Barcelo Bavaro Palace. Overall, the vacation was splendid. With access to the entire property, there was plenty to do. Specifically, we did horseback riding and scuba diving (both addl charges), various water sports, a couple of shows at night, and just hanging out. My girls also did some crafts. The massages on the beach were a nice treat, but not great; try them once. There is a market down the beach that apparently is owned by the hotel. It does give you a local feel and you can some bargaining. The accomodations were fine. We had 2 rooms with 2 double beds. The maid service was good, perhaps helped by the couple dollars left each day. Service throughout the property was sometimes inconsistent, but oveall good. The pool and beach were outstanding; good swim up bar. Drinks were plentiful and fine. Buying stuff at the hotel is expensive so bring your supplies. The food was just adequate. While quantity was plentiful, quality was inconsistent. The local Dominican food was great. It was other food that was spotty. But, the good news is that no one got sick. Make sure you drink only bottled water; we also brushed our teeth that way. The ice is fine. Being from the U.S., we were in the minority. Many Europeans and many Latins; I liked the diversity. But, be prepared for much Espanol; helpful if you can speak a little, but not necessary. The Punta Cana airport is open air which was kind of neat. Weather was outstanding. Beaches are white sand, wide, and filled with palm trees; quite majestic. In addition to the Palace, there are the Beach and Caribe resorts on the beach, a casino, a convention center, and a golf course. There is a shuttle that runs throughout the property but not necessary to use. Ocean is a beautiful blue/green. We would return to the area but probably try a different hotel to see if we could do a bit better on the food. But, I think staying here you'll have a great time.

<Content>GOOD, not Great... Good, not great...we spent 3 days Dec 4-7. Have previously been to Iberostar and Secrets. Thought both were superior to BB Palace. The buildings housing the rooms look like barracks. Rooms were nice, food good, beach and pools good. The bar service adequate....was surprised and disapointed that they charged extra $$ if you wanted any type whiskey drink (Scotch or bourbon) about 5$per, which I had never experienced before...the A.I. included only clear alcohol drinks (vodka, gin etc). Also, they charged extra for their gourmet restaurant, which was a ripoff. Overall, it was OK, but I would not go back.

<Content>Wonderful Vacation! We stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace from November 22-29. It was amazing.ARRIVAL We booked through Funjet Vacations. Our charter flight left about 30 minutes early, which got us into Punta Cana early. Our $10.00 tourist card was included in our package. Our luggage was ready by the time we arrived at the baggage claim area. I felt it was very helpful to have a porter. The Funjet representative told us which bus to get on, but with 50 other busses in the parking lot, it would have been difficult to find the right one. The porter took us directly to our bus (which was quite a walk). We tipped him $1.00 per bag and he was very appreciative. The bus took us directly to the Palace. It took about 20-25 minutes. Check in was a little slow. Every person in your party had to go to the desk to get a wrist band, which made the front desk very crowded. We had a party of 11. I had emailed the hotel prior to our visit to request the building and room type we preferred. I received a return email stating they would try to accommodate. We had 2 rooms that needed to be on the first floor. When we were assigned our rooms at the front desk, we were in a different building than requested, and we didn't have 2 rooms on the first floor. We did ask them to change the 2 rooms to 1st floor, and they did. We were never asked for a credit card, but other guest checking in were asked for one.ROOM Our room was great. We were in building 1, 3rd floor. It faced the garden area. This building is off the main lobby. The room had 2 double beds (very small!!). There was a desk, table and chair. There was a door separating the bedroom from the bathroom vanity area. It was very nice to have a private changing area. The bathroom area was very large. There was a double sink vanity with a large counter top. There was a separate room with a door for the shower and toilet. The baloney had a small table and 2 chairs. There was a clothes rack on the baloney to hang your wet clothes on. Our room was cleaned daily. We never had a musty smell in our room, but the sheets did feel damp at times. Our mini bar was also stocked daily with water, pop, beer, and 2 chocolate bars. We left money for our maid everyday and a few gifts on the pillow. One day, we were still in our room when she came to clean. My husband told her we needed about 10 more minutes and we would be out. I don't think she understood, because she just walked right in and started cleaning and making the beds with us still in there. The surprising thing is she never thanked us for the gifts or the money.POOL The pool was beautiful. It was always clean. The tiles around and in the pool can be very slippery, so you have to be careful. We never had trouble finding a lounge chair. If you went to the pool after about 11am, you may not get a prime spot for a chair, but you can definitely find a chair. We didn't see a hot tub while we were there. They do have jets in an area of the pool, but it is pool temperature water. The dive shop brings equipment to the pool for guests to try scuba diving or snorkeling free of charge. They hope that you will enjoy it and book a scuba class and excursion.BEACH The beach was also very nice. Plenty of lounge chairs. There was some seaweed, but it didn't bother us. The ocean was very calm, not a lot of waves. There is a reef a few miles out that you can see protecting the beach area from big waves. We tried snorkeling off the beach area, but not a lot to see. There are many topless women on the beach- both sunbathing and many walking up and down the beach. We had talked to our 9 year old boy before we left to prepare him, but we didn't expect to see as much as we did. I thought it was a great way to teach him of different cultures. The hotel has paddleboats, kayaks, wind surfing, snorkeling equipment, and life jackets you can use with charge. They have a kids club that is located behind the watersports building. Our son only went once. They have board games and puzzles. I heard they have excursions that they go on around the resorts. While he was there, I noticed that he could leave any time he wanted. It is not like a cruise where you check the children in and check them out. Maybe it is different for younger children.MARKET The outdoor market was at the end of the Palace hotels. You must barter with them. We bought a few beaded necklaces and the vendors started their pricing at $40 USD- we paid $5 USD. We also bought some rum#8212;We paid $7 USD for 750ml. We paid about $15 USD for mamajuana. Mamajuana is a local drink. It is made from herbs, spices, honey, rum, and red wine. It is supposed to be a 'mood enhancer.' It states on the bottle it increases a man's vitality. When we went on a tour (more later) I could have bought the rum for about $4 or $5, and the mamajuana for about $10 in the village. If you buy Mamajuana, make sure you buy the kind that already has the rum in it. They sell just the roots and spices, but I heard you are not allowed back in the states with it- it would be considered plant or food material. You are allowed to bring it to the States with rum in it. We were never asked if we wanted to buy drugs, but my 23 year old brother was asked.FOOD We ate at all the specialty restaurants except for Chez Palace and La Fuente (these are $20.00 per person additional). Everything was good. I can't say the food was exceptional, but it was good. There was a large selection at each restaurant. The buffet was also good. In the morning they had made to order omelets, eggs, and fruit shakes. For lunch and dinner, they had made to order pasta, meats, stir-fry, and sometimes desserts. For breakfast, we sat in the same area everyday. Our waiter, Evan, was wonderful. He spoke English quite well. He made our son feel very special. He would always ask how our day was the previous day. He was friendly and always smiling. Our son is a very picky eater. We could always find him something to eat at the buffet, but not always at the restaurants. Out of our party of 11, 2 had stomach problems for a day or two. It didn't stop them from enjoying the trip. For a great meal off the resort, go to the Jellyfish. It is just North up the Beach from the Barcelo resorts. It was great! 2-3lb lobster tails for $20 USD.Excursions We did the Bavaro Runners tour. It was interesting. The first stop was to a sugar cane field and you could sample fresh sugar cane. Then we went to a cigar factory where they showed you how cigars were made. Everyone that wanted a cigar was given one. We went to a house in the mountains. Here we saw how they live. At this family's house, they make coffee and cocoa. They showed us how they made it and we sampled. Make sure you take your bug spray. This is the only place we had problems with bugs. My husband got bit a few times. They swelled up and turned black and blue. After that, we went to a ranch where we had lunch and went horseback riding for 30 minutes. The horseback riding wasn't very good. The horses were very thin and the ride wasn't good. The last stop was to a beach area near the Secrets Excellent hotel. This beach area had large waves and they provided boogie boards. This was an all day tour- 9am-5:30pm- they provided lunch and drinks all day. It was $75 USD adult and $37.50 child.My mom and brother took the water taxi outside our hotel to the reef to go snorkeling. They said there was beautiful fish, but not a lot of coral. This cost about $14 USD for 2 hours.My dad and a friend went scuba diving at Catalina Island. They said it was so so. Not the best diving compared to where they have dived in the past. But they said it was enjoyable. They did 2 tank dives through Neptuno Dive Shop and it was $150.00 USD. This also included transportation and lunch.We took a sunset horseback riding tour through our hotel. It was good. It toured the Golf resort and then went onto the beach. The guide stopped a few times and took pictures with your camera. The horses looked healthy, however, there coral was all mud- no grass. It cost $40 USD for a 2-hour private ride.MISC. The resort is huge. You are allowed to use any of the facilities at the Beach, Golf, Caribe, and Casino resorts. There are also shopping areas throughout the resort complex. There is a train that runs almost 24 hours a day throughout the resort. We only had to wait maximum 10 minutes for a train. There is an internet caf茅. It was $5.00 for 30 minutes of usage. I think there were large packages available. You could scan pictures for free. The disco was OK. It seemed to attract all ages. Drinks are included at the disco. It is open from 11pm-5am.We golfed a few times. We always golfed in the afternoon, so we never had a problem getting a tee time. We usually had 3 golfers. We only had 2 bags (but we had 2 putters, 2 wedges, and 2 drivers) - they didn't make us rent another bag. I think club rental was $30. The golf carts were $50 for 18 and $38 for 9. Again, let us go off with only 1 cart for 3 people. One just rode on the back with the clubs- we are in our 20's-early 30's so it didn't bother us. At the clubhouse, they will fill a cooler with beer and water to take on the course. The course seemed pretty wet on some holes. The course is also narrow. We lost many balls. The security guards and random workers will sell bags of used balls if you need them. There was security at most holes. Since we had 3 on a cart at times, we would give them beer or water. They were very appreciative.DEPARTURE Check out was smooth. We were charged $4 USD for using the phone a few times. We used a prepaid calling card from Sam's Club. Check out was at noon. We had a late flight, so they took care of our luggage while we went to the pool to enjoy the rest of our day. About an hour before we were leaving, they gave us a courtesy room to shower and change. At the airport, they search most of the luggage by hand. They took my son's batteries that were still in the package in his carry on. They said they would explode, however they didn't take the batteries in our camera or in the gameboy. Make sure you put extra batteries in your checked suitcase- maybe you can keep them. Our $20 exit fee was included in our package. Be sure to listen to the announcements. I was shopping at the duty free store and heard last call for our flight#8212;1 陆 hours early!! We actually took off about 30-45 minutes early. Feel free to email with any questions. Kimidz@aol.com

<Content>Do not believe any reviews about this resort, just GO you won't belive what you see!!! Just returned this morning at 1:30 Am from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace Resort, this place is a part of heaven. Six of us travelled together including 2 seniors and 2 kids ages 2 and 4, it wasn't our forst time in Puta Cana, had been to Iberostar B4. It was fantastic! we were upgraded to suites ocean-front, service was unbelievable, people are kind and courteous, place was spotless clean, people were cleaning day and night moving in lots of 10 cleaning the beach from palm tree leaves that had been blown by the wind. Beach was beautiful and the water amazing and warm. All I could say it's the trip of a lifetime, the people there are constantly doing their very very best to keep residents happy and I would definitely recommend it! PS food was well above average and variety was great!

<Content>Sick the whole time My Husband and I and our two children spent a week at the Palace in April 2002 and I would Not recommend it to anyone. We were sick the whole time, probably from the food. We met many people who were sick too, and we actually had to spend a couple of days in our room because we got so sick. We did not drink the water, but the food was terrible, with flies all over it all the time. People from other hotels actually came to our hotel looking for Immodium, which was sold out everywhere. Our hotel was one of five hotels in the Barcelo complex, and it appeared all the hotels had the same problem. I liked the hotel facilities, the pool area was beautiful and the beach was too. I found the staff friendly and nice although many do not speak English. (I learned some Spanish before we left and I was Glad I did.) This hotel, however has a serious problem with the food and bacteria---do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

<Content>fell in love Barcelo Palace was the best vacation that i have ever had.. I just got back on November 9th, my family and i stayed for one week. This is our 4th time back.. The staff was absolutly amazing. If you ever get the chance to meet Ruddy, Alexander and pauleno take it. They are the greatest and they will make your stay there heaven.. There is always something to do, if it is danceing, gambleing, eating or just laying around by the pool.. You will never be bored.. Of coarse not alot of them speak english but it is a different country what do you exspect.. Not every american knows spanish so why should every dominican know english and if you have a problem with them not knowing english stay in the usa.. but you will be missing out on the vacation of your dreams. if i had all the money in the world i would live at barcelo palace.. I cryed for hours when i had to leave. it is like a dream world. I have been treated like a queen every time i have been there.. And make sure to have Henry make you one of his special drinks.. I would do anything to go back right now.. a year is way to far away... Take it from me and don't live in regret, take a vacation to barcelo palace and make your dreams come true.

<Content>Honeymoon From Hell! Between my new wife and I, we have trraveled all over the U.S. and abroad. We have never had a worse experience than this. We were given an oceanfront suite which was beautiful...the door was broken and would'nt close when we got there and we could not leave our room until it was fixed. It took about an hour and a half! The Seafood restaurant was the only place that was edible, which isn't saying much. We were kicked out of our suite because the hotel made a mistake...they actually gave me a guilt trip...the pool which is beautiful was disgustingly filthy by the end of the week...we never received our honeymoon package, even after asking for it 4 times (which was included in our vacation package)! We did nothing but fight with hotel management who spoke perfectly fine English until they wanted to say something that they didn't want you to understand! We had cockroaches scurry under our dinner table on 3 seperate occasions. We both got sick to our stomachs during vacation...we've been back for a week and we are still sick! I'm so heated right now that I don't even want to finish telling you all of the stories! Besides, it would take about 5 days to complete our story of Hell! Do yourself a favor and go to Disney World!

<Content>Never Again My wife and I just returned from the Palace on Sept. 7, 2003. The week couldn't end quick enough. If you're thinking of going to the Palace, don't waste your time. If you can't speak spanish, you will have a huge problem. We were reduced to pointing to the things we needed (ie: food, drink etc.). No one there speaks English. If you don't mind having flies all over your food, than eating won't be a problem. I'm not kidding, flies everywhere. We were sick for 4 of the 7 days, from the bacteria no doubt. The best meal was at the Mexican Restaurant. The food was good and the building was enclosed. Please if you have not booked your trip, save your money and go somewhere else. If you already booked, then I wish you luck. Plan on being sick for atleast 3-4 days. If you have any questions, please contact me.

<Content>Great Honeymoon! Well, we just arrived back from our honeymoon trip and I'll say this, we did have a great time. There are some things that could use some polishing though. 1. Americans are by far the minority there, hence learn some Spanish before heading down. At least enough to speak and understand the basics. I knew almost none and found it tough to get around with the staff. 2. Be careful what you eat. Just use some common sense, i.e. picking the mystery meat from the buffet line that looks like it has been stewing for some time (pack the Immodium). 3. Some of the excursions are just a waist of time and money. One being the trip to Manati Park. What a gip! The zoo or whatever it was, was just a haven for local birds. The grounds weren't kept up and the dolphin show there was comical at best. The pool was the size of a backyard swimming pool and the handlers couldn't get them to do anything. 4. Bring some snack crackers and some paper towels. Outside of that, you'll have a great time. Definitely take the Bavaro Runners excursion. From the sugarcane fields w/ the poor Hatians working them, to the cigar shops, horseback riding, and visiting with a local family that grows everything and you get to taste it all. Good stuff! Strange walking through their house and bedrooms...while they're there. The beach you get to go to is Paradise! I mean it! We didn't want to leave. The beach at the resort is incredible as well. The resort has a lot to offer, but don't bother with the Dance Club unless you like to sweat! I wonder how many people fall out due to heat exhaustion there? Anyway, the food was very good, although we couldn't wait to get back to the states and get something different. Try the Mexican Restaraunt. Really good and they make a mean margerita! There is a nice golf course there that a friens said was great. He had the entire course to himself. The flea market there is worth visiting, but good luck fighting off everone. Hey friend...come here and give me 5! You can find some great deals if you can do battle. Also, the casino isn't much, but we had a good time...it was my first time and with a little guidance from some friends from Boston, I won some decent spending money. Anyway, we will be back at some point in the future, once I get done with my Spanish 101 course. Hope this helps!

<Content>Royal Treatment at the Palace!!! Just returned from a week in Punta Cana, at the beautiful Barcelo Bavaro Palace: August 16-22, 2003. The beach and the sea are the most beautiful of any I have ever seen! The setting could be used to depict Paradise! The Palace Resort (one of four within the same compound, and without a doubt the finest, most luxurious of the group!) was lovely. We are a family of 7, two parents, five children, ages 11, 14, 17, 19 and 21 (okay not all children, perhaps I should have said offspring!) Anyway, we encountered no problems at all. No stomach problems, no hotel problems, check-in (for our three rooms) took only five minutes in total. We declined to present a credit card when they asked for one (as we had read in a review that some people found charges to their card weeks later) and there was absolutely no problem with our declining to do so. Everyone enjoyed the fantasy pool, swim-up bar, unlimited food and drinks all day, everywhere you turned! The shows at night were a little corny but fun, and entertaining, if you have the right attitude. The beach was everyone's favorite! Absolutely beautiful! The kids enjoyed kayaking with their dad, and everyone loved swimming in the crystal blue-green tepid waters of the Caribbean Sea! The restaurants varied from good to very good, none were excellent, none were bad, we enjoyed every meal we had there! The service in the Domincan Republic is second to none! The people there are just a happy, friendly and very hospitable group! They cannot do enough for the hotel guests. Very few speak any English at all, but if you even make a little attempt to speak Spanish, they love it, and help you with pronunciation, and laugh with you, and are so kind and nice about everything! The captain at the Cafe Bavaro, the Buffet Restaurant at the Palace, named Julio, is the best. He makes every guest feel like a VIP, and smiley Porfirio always makes everyone feel like they are the only person in the restaurant! We enjoyed walking to the market down the beach a short distance, get ready to bargain. My daughter paid $10. for the same box of cigars my son bought for $20 the following day (they should have compared notes!.) My youngest had her hair braided, the asking price was $60, we countered with $30, ended up paying $40. It took them two hours to do it, so that was reasonable! Our rooms were beautiful, sparkling clean, and we were able to get 3 adjacent, ocean view rooms! The view was literally breathtaking, I could sit on the balcony and gaze at the sea all morning, my favorite time of day! The coffee there is STRONG! (And I loved it!) And the drinks are WEAK (ad that was fine with me too!, especially with the kids in our group!) And all in all, the trip was a huge success! Everyone enjoyed seeing a new place, learning about a new culture, and relaxing (for once!) in the scenic beauty of Punta Cana. Advice: SUNSCREEN (we all got burnt!) Bring Immodium, even if you won't need it, just in case! Don't give your credit card (they didn't care one way or the other) and don't expect to meet a lot of fellow american tourists, the predominant group were europeans, mostly from italy, france and germany, especially germany and italy actually. Some dominicans from the city, and some cubans, and miami/cubans. very few americans, which disappointed our kids, who always love other teens to be with, but it was fine with us, because it meant more time together as a family, which is why we went on the vacation in the first place. We heartily recomment the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. I would like to go back one day!

<Content>Me divierto mucho a Barcelo Bavaro Palace I had an awesome time at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. I stayed from July 21- July 28, 2003. The staff at the Palace are extremely nice. However, they speak very little English. Learn some Spanish before you go--essentials like el bano--bathroom. There is a little train, which is very cute that takes you from the Palace to the rest of the Bavaro hotels and the casino. The casino is the last stop (probably a five minute ride or less). The casino is very small. I played roulette and won $300.00. It is important that you do not convert into pesos bc you cannot convert the money back into dollars at the casino, hotel or airport. Bring lots of singles with you. It's not expected that you tip the waiters or waitresses. It is however expected that you tip the maids. I put a dollar or twoo dollars on my pillow every morning. The hotel workers make approximately $200.00 a week so a dollar or two is a big deal. Also, the hotel shops are expensive. When you get to the beach--make a left and you will see a flea market. BARGAIN and you will get excellent deals. For instance, at the flea market they wanted $80 for a box of cigars. I paid $20 and then I saw the same box at the airport for $75.00. Make sure you buy some Larimar jewelery. It is a blue stone that is only found in the Dominican Republic. Most of the people from our hotel were latinos--from Cuba, Spain, Venezuela and Puerto Rico. Some English, Dutch and Canadians. All in all, I had an excellent time. I didn't get sick because I stuck to bottled water. I did the Outback Safari Tour, which was worthwhile--you get to see some of the countryside. I truly recommend the Marinarium tour because you get to do some snorkelling and then swim with nurse sharks and sting rays. It was a really great experience--you should definitely do it. It was $75.00 per person. Food was okay--nothing special. I heard a latino couple rave that the Domincan food was the best they ever had. It didn't appeal to my tast buds though. The lobster was rock lobster, which wasn't as good as our lobster. Do not order a hot dog because it is foul. Stick with pastas. There is an Italian restaurant at the Bavaro Caribe. Do not order pizza while you are there. It is like cheese soaked in awful amounts of oil. Do not order it. I had the lasagna bolognese and the pesto and they were pretty good. The French restaurant and the Spanish restaurant costs and extra $20.00 to go to and believe me it isn't worth it. They are comparable to the other restaurants and the food tastes the same. Do not go. If it is someone's birthday --tell them in advance and they will bake you a cake. Make sure that you do not forget that there is a grill. When you get to the beach--make a left and it is right before the flea market. The shish kebobs and chicken and fried calamari are really good. Drinks are good. Try Coco Loco--AWESOME. Oh and when you go and they ask for your credit card--tell them that you don't have one. I did it after reading on here that someone had charges on their credit card in Punta Cana after they left. Just as a precautionary measure--tell them that you don't have one. There will be no problem. Oh--there is no jet skiing anywhere in the Dominican Republic bc they want to preserve the water. There are speed boats and other activities such as parasailing and the banana boat and that type of stuff. I don't think I have anything more to tell you . Oh, lastly, the tour guide at the Marinarium told me that 16 new hotels are being built on the island. HAVE AN AWESOME TIME. LATER.

<Content>Trip of a Lifetime  My wife and I were at the Palace for our honeymoon July 14-19. I can say after reading all of these reviews that we were scared and even considered changing our plans. THANK GOODNESS WE DIDNT!!!!! I have been all over Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. This was, without a doubt, the most enjoyable trip I have ever taken. We booked through Fun Jet and they were perfect. We were picked up at the airport by a mini van and taken directly to the hotel. Checked in immediately.ROOM the room was spacious, very clean and comfortably cold.FOOD - Our biggest fear was the food. Crazy! The food was great. Breakfast consists of any and everything you could want. We consistently ate lunch at the beach grill by building six, where we stayed. You walk up to a refrigerated glass case and make your pick from burgers, beef or pork kabobs, steak, pork chops, chicken, fish, calamari, etc and they cook it right in front of you. Best quality beef? Of course not its all grass fed and would likely grade select. Reminder youre not in a country where they grain feed their livestock. They also have salads, rice, beans, baked potatoes and fries. Flies and bugs??? Certainly no more than a backyard BBQ. All week, we ate any and everything. All beef was cooked med rare (as ordered). Neither of us ever had stomach problems. Nor did three other couples we spent a lot of time with. For dinner, we ate at the buffet, Spanish place by the pool, Mexican place (twice), and the steak house (medallions are as good as I have had in the states). One thing we learned is that the resort employs a food quality assurance firm from England to oversee all food safety. Keep in mind that coconut is a natural laxative. If you sit at the beach or pool all day drinking a dozen pina coladas, you will have problems whether in Punta Cana or your own house.BEACH incredibly beautiful, well kept, and topless. Palm trees all over the beach are pleasant and offer shade when desired.STAFF all Spanish speaking. Two years of high school Spanish did the trick. Most of them spoke more English than I do Spanish. They would bend over backwards for you (or us). I think it all has to do with how you treat them. The first morning, I left $4 on the dresser for the maid. It was there when we returned. She would not take it unless the little maid sign was on top of the cash.ACTIVITIES we went on the monster truck tour. It was wonderful and well worth the $80 per person. Takes you up into the mountains where you see the true culture and everyday life of the people. You end up at a lodge on the river where you eat a wonderful lunch and swim in the river. Note if you want to shop, wait and do so on this trip. The markets near the beach are all bad deals. You shouldnt pay more than $2 for a bag of coffee and $4-6 for a bottle of rum. We chartered an offshore boat for $550 for a half day. Only one strike very disappointing. We went on a horseback ride at a ranch not too far away ride through the ranch then along the beach where you stop and eat/drink fresh coconut. They let you run the horses all you care to.The trip was flawless until we got home and unpacked. A baggage handler in Punta Cana, San Juan, Dallas, or Austin stole my camcorder from my checked bag. I should have known better dont check what you dont want stolen. Lesson learned. When you get away from the resort, any and everyone will tell you that the Palace is by far the place to stay. I have to agree. If my review comes across as an advertisement, so be it. I just hate for such a wonderful resort to be portrayed as an insect-infested dump. Would it be 5 star in Hawaii nope. However, for the price and what you get out of it its a trip of a lifetime. If you have any questions at all, dont hesitate to e-mail me. Tex_Cattleman@yahoo.com.

<Content>A honeymoon to remember forever! We just returned from our honeymoon to Punta Cana. We can not say enough how great of a time we had. I was honestly worried with reading the reviews prior to leaving, but it turns out that for our honeymoon, and first real time out of the US, it was excellent. And like I had read before, your vacation is what you make of it. The first day we arrived there was a tropical storm. This worried us a little bit but we were so tired the first day, it didn't matter anyway. The next day and every day after we awoke to bright sunshine. The food was good. I was a little more daring than my husband. I tried a lot of the foods available while he stuck to pretty normal foods. We didn't have quite a problem with flies as everyone else. The only place I noticed flies was at the buffet, and we only ate there for breakfast. Do yourself a favor and try all of the many restaurants available. We loved the Steak House, Italian, and Mexico Lindo. Drinks were plentiful, we had no problems at all with the service. And if you feel that your drink might be a little weak, just ask for more rum, they will be glad to pour more in. And if you want a strong drink, try the margarita at Mexico Lindo. I couldn't taste anything but tequilla! The service was great. We never had a problem with our room getting cleaned, and our fridge was stocked every day. Knowing spanish will help a lot, however, we hardly knew more than the basics and we survived just fine. The staff is very friendly and they try very hard to communicate with you. Just be patient. Remember....... Have fun!! Do excursions (the party boat is a blast) and don't listen to all of thoes people who want to complain about everything. Like I said, this was our first real trip out of the US. It is different, but the palace is a beautiful, relaxing place to visit.

<Content>Wonderful honeymoon My husband and I (ages 45 and 40) spent eight very wonderful days at the Palace. Despite reading many negative reviews, our travel agent assured us tha the Palace was very nice. Our honeymoon was chartered through Vacation Express. Our flight was on time and our trip from the airport was quite comfortable and air-conditioned. There was absolutely no delay in getting our rooms. Checking in to the Palace didn't take five minutes. We arrived at the hotel at approximately 3:30 PM. Our room was clean, very tropical, and suprisingly facing the ocean. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  We spent most of the days on the beach. The beach was fantastic. There were plenty of chairs, and lots of palm trees to provide shade. Do bring insect repellant. You will need it. I even spent several nights at the casino. (I won some money.)  The food in the buffet was great. If you are expecting American food, stay in America. We experimented with a lot of the dishes and only suffered minor discomfort later. The workers in the buffet were very friendly and we even began looking for the same waiter each time we ate. Do remember to tip! OK the beer was different, but if you open your mind for new experiences, you can work with it. Our favorite restaraunt was the little grill on the beach, just outside of building six. The cooks prepared the food while you watched. The chicken breasts were great.  I even convinced my 250lb husband to go parasailing. It was far less expensive than on any other island I've visited. He loved it. Later he enjoyed a full body massage, right on the beach. It was also quite inexpensive when you consider how much you would pay for one at home.  Ok, this was our honeymoon so everything was rose colored. We decided before we checked out of the Palace, that we would be returning next year for our anniversary. Try learning a little Spanish before your go. Take lots of one dollar bills with you. If you make change, you will not get US dollars back. Like visiting anywhere else, if you are nice to the help, they will help you!

<Content>You'll love or hate the merengue for life !!! Just got back from my trip on July the 6th. Be prepared to listen to merengue music all day long. I am merengue out. Just kidding I happened to love merengue and got so hooked on it, had to rush to the music store, as soon as I got home, to buy a merengue CD which I listen to from the time I get up in the morning till the time I come to work in the evening. I am missing the pina coladas and the paella and of course the beer which is fabulous. The flies I don't miss although they had already become like part of our family. The bed I don't miss (hard as a park bench). The towels I don't miss (too heavy and not absorbent at all). I don't miss the toilet paper either. The beach is beautiful, the service in general good. Loved La Fuente the spanish restaurant. The solomillo or filet mignon excellent. The crema catalana or natilla as good as my own. Didn't like to stand on my feet for the entire Willie Chirino concert. Come on organizers, think a little harder and come up with a better idea ! Had to travel almost the entire resort to get mail stamps. Finally dropped my postcards in the mailbox near the reception area. Hello ??? Does anybody pick up the mail there ??? Today is July the 11th already and here I am back at work and this people are still waiting to hear from me. ! Will I go back ??? Oh Yeahhhh !!! (For you, in case you read this)

<Content>6 apple turned out to be a 3 apple Stayed 6-29-03 thru 7-6-03 Very difficult to communicate with the Spanish speaking help which made it difficult to share our disappointment. Our apple representative was a big help. We changed rooms three times, the first was for an ocean view which we had requested, the second because the safe didn't work. By the 6th night in our third room, the ceiling began to drop droplets of water on our heads on our queen size bed. At this point, we were too tired to change rooms again and stayed with wth water leaks for 2 nights. The food was average, the entertainment all in spanish and not much night life.

<Content>Not Too Bad We went on vacation June 30, 2 adults in mid 30's and our 8 years old boy. Transfer from hotel - was very good - Apple vacation reps pick us up in a bus and 25 minutes latter we were in the hotel. Check in was a breeze- however front desk asked for a credit card- we had it, but told them it was expired...I think it is real goof excuse to use! Accommodations were - good, not 5 stars, but definitely 4. Food- very good- plenty of seafood  service was also not bad. Bars- this is very the problem starts- this is an all-inclusive resort and you tip are all included, however unless you are waving a dollar bill and yelling to bartender in Spanish - you will be the last to be served. Beach was Very Good! But very little shade, so bring a lot of sun tan lotion. Before you make your mind whether to go to this hotel keep in mind that most of the guests are Spanish speaking Cuban-Americans from Miami who made this hotel their second home and there are not too many Europeans or non Spanish speaking Americans. You may consider that before deciding on going there.Mi govorim po ruski.

<Content>Very, Very Disappointed Recently, my husband and I and our neighbors spent 11 days in Punta Cana at the Bavaro Palace Resort. We had been there 3 years ago and were very pleased with the accommodations and were anxious to return. We would have been better off going somewhere else. Overall, we were very disappointed. We encountered one problem after another. Due to a flight cancellation, we didn't arrive until the next day. Our room wasn't ready, even though we were to arrive the previous day. We had to sit in the lobby 45 minutes until it was made up. The TV didn't work - had to be replaced. Light blub was missing in the bathroom. The last 5 days of our vacation, the ceiling leaked right above the bed. The food in the various restaruants, as well as the service, wasn't up to par. The only restaurant where the food was good and service excellent was the buffet at the Bavaro Palace. Service at the Mexican Restaurant was practically non-existant. Young people, 6 or more in a golf cart (especially in the evening) would go speeding by on the streets. If you were walking, it was like an accident waiting to happen. There was no supervision. The safe in the closet was put in backwards - you practically had to crawl in the closet to put articles in and out. The drapes didn't close in the room. Seeing wer were on the first floor, we needed the drapes to close. Someone came and did the best they could to remedy this. The smoke alarm beeped every 45 seconds the enire time we were there. Upon mentioning this, they told us this was normal. Everyone else we talked to didn't have this problem. I can't believe that this is considered a 5 star resort. I wouldn't recommend it to any of our friends. I tried to get the e-mail address of the management, but to no avail - I would like to e-mail him/her this review. Hopefully, they will see it. Next time, we'll go elsewhere.

<Content>Not bad at All ! Don't be discouraged by what other bad reviews say... the Palace was great. I too read prior reviews and was a little hesitant about bad food, bad service and bad experiences. I can honestly tell you my family and I had no problems. I took my 8 year old daughter and she didn't want to leave. There is a mini club for the children with an attendant who meets the kids at 10:30 a.m., 4 pm and 8 p.m. for tennis, golf, beach games, sightseeing and a nightly kiddie disco in the lobby. I found the Palace to be impeccably clean, the service was good and the food and variety was excellent. I did not see any buffets with flies all over it - there is no such thing. I did hear a couple of comments about people there being sick while we were there, but we did not have anyone in our group of 12 get sick. There is such an abundance of food and drinks that after 4-5 days, you don't know what you want to eat or drink anymore. I would go back but only for a 4 day stay - a week was a bit much. Overall, I plan to go back with our group and others who have also heard from friends about the Palace. Bring lots of change in $1.00 bills for tipping otherwise getting change can be a nightmare - they try to give you change in dominican pesos...

But then i went to the lobby and they didn anything about the lost jewley. room: awsome,clean, the tub is pretty big,the room was cold, and the beds were comforble. beach:The beach was hot and clear and great. pool:huge, it didn't have stairs to go inside the pool it was like going inside the beach water,and warm. food:great and never made me or my family get sick after they ate and the most greatest hot chocolate i have ever tasted for breakfast. service:great and the staff wasn't rude to us and you should take $1 and $5 dollar bills for tips. It was a succes!

<Content>Viva La Punta The Palace was very nice, but it certainly did not feel like a 5 star resort. The food was actually not too bad and the sevice was excellent, except for the front desk, who dont have a clue what s goin on. You must be accompanied by a spanish speaker, or else you will not be able to communicate well. The beach was excellent, and be prepared to see some nudity, which was good. Being a 23 year old single man, the night life was not soo great. The discoteque was decent, music wasn't soo good and out dated. For all Single Men, I recommend visiting A night club out side the resort, called La Punta. Be sure to be accompanied by a Local and be equipped with some spanish vocabulary. Trust me you'll enjoy it with dollars. Other than that enjoy the beach and make sure to tip your service poeple. (waiters, Maids, and bartenders.)

<Content>Great Beach Bad Food!!! We just got back Sunday June 29th from Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana. First of all when you arrive at the airport do not take a $20 cab to hotel, wait with everyone else for the bus because we took a cab and ended up getting to the hotel in an hour but had to wait 3 hours before check-in which starts between 2-3 p.m. if your lucky - we had to wait in the hot lobby - nothing is airconditioned except your room, stores, and expensive resteraunts (all the free food is open air attracting every single fly possible). Also at the airport be prepared to pay $10 per person when you arrive and leave thats what they will charge you for entering and departing their island - I've heard every year this amount has gone up. I recommend you take lots of singles for tipping with you and small denominations for expenses -they will not give you change in US dollars only in pesos so you will lose, if your a no frills person $200 for a week is enough, if you plan on doing lots of stuff take $500 just in case. Your rooms will be clean and average the grounds are beutiful so is the beach. Thats the only good thing I have to say. Five stars means nothing in 3rd world countries so don't expect it to be the same as other hotels in U.S. or Europe. The food is horrible my husband was sick all week and I got sick towards the end - they have no idea what salmonella is or any type of standards when preparing food, also food is left out for hours with flies all over them. Avoid stuff that looks like its been out for hours and with too many flies. Also do not eat the chicken that they cook in front of you because its been sitting out for hours before they do. The fancy resteraunts are more expensive with same ingrediants as all the other stuff just more $. For you beer drinkers there is all the free Presidente beer you could ever want and free drinks made with rum, anything else will cost you. Don't drink the tap water even to brush your teeth or you will be seriously sick. I found that some travel agencies were on site and very informative and helpful to their clients giving them such tips, one of these was Apple Vacations, we on the other hand were with MK Tours which all they do is put you on a charter flight like herds and get you there once you arrive your on your own and abandoned - but I gues thats why they are so cheap so choose your travel agency wisely. The hotel doesn't post any shedules of activities and they don't have an activities director - so your bored 99% of the time when your not at the beach, so I recommend bringing some good books to read. Any activities you want to do outside of the palace like go to Santo Domingo or horse back riding etc. will cost you anywhere's from $40-80. They don't really have a nightlife worth talking about and the night shows they put on could be done better by some high school students - they are horrible and tacky. I reccomend you do tip the staff who are kind and good to you, they are terribly overworked at least a buck per meal won't kill you! Also in our room we left $2 a day and she cleaned everything well and never took anything. Overall this place is taking a nosedive, I spoke to other people who had gone in previous years and many said it was getting worse and I couldn't find one person who said they would return and neither will I. If they spent money on a water plant to clean the water, on better quality food, and on activities it would be great, now all they have is the beach but thats not enough for me and a lot of people who will never be back!

<Content>Okay, But Some Probelms The Bavaro Palace is nice--but no airconditioning in any restaurants except the ones you have to pay extra to eat there.. Flies are all over the food and it is not comfortable eating with the heat and the flies. Very little English spoken by any of the staff.Only beer available is their own name brand . Limited availabilty of drinks except frozen drinks-- Any special drink you might want is extra charge. Avaialabilty of American money extremely limited and if you change to pecos - upon leaving they will not convert back into American money. The hotel makes you sign a blank credit card voucher upon arrival and you are supposed to get it back when you check out if you made no charges. everyone told us this is a must to get it back. Do not leave without it. well they could not find ours . We waited 45 minutes and they still could not find it. The Apple Vacation guy that was to pick us up for trip to airport was 30 minutes late. We were frantic about this and it put us in extremely long line at customs at airport -- airport is not air conditioned either. The beaches are beautiful and we enjoyed the speed boat and snorkeling trip we took. My husband enjoyed the golf.

<Content>Reasonable Trip for a New Area I have to say, the negative reviews scared me, so let me get straight to my experience...1. I had a beautiful ocean front suite at the Palace. I was not bumped as I read in reviews which left me very relieved. The rooms were very island in decor and the suite good albeit a few minor things to fix like batteries in the remotes and few burnt out lightbulbs.2. Food is okay. Very Domincan so don't go expecting American food. Expect to see lots of meats at breakfast, etc. I ate at the buffet a lot and just tried to avoid the salads as they looked a litte suspicious. La Brisa was great and so was the grill. French restaurant was excellent.3. The staff does not speak English and don't expect them to even try to understand you. I speak some Spanish and was okay, but good luck.4. Phone calls that you make to an 800 number to the US has a charge of $25 per call before you start, so BEWARE. Direct calls were not that outrageous.5. Internet is $6.00 US for a 1/2 hour in the Internet cafe.(some other activities are learning Merengue, shows at night, ceramic painting, beach chess, watersports, water aerobics, etc.)6. Stamps are NOT at every hotel or rather at ANY HOTEL. They are actually in an area called the Plaza in a CD store of all things. I spent four days searching for them and finally on my last day, got them for my postcards.7. A bonus is that in this all-inclusive, your wristband allows you to go to the other resorts via trolley that arrives at the hotel every half hour. This is a must do. There is also a casino and other good shops.8. Walk down the beach a little and you'll find all the jewelry you will want. I bought at the jewelry store at the hotel thinking that was it. Boy was I wrong. Just down the beach you can find all the Larimar and Amber you want at bargainable prices.9. Be prepared to get to the airport a couple of hours in advance. The hotel is a 25 minute ride from the airport and the airport is not air conditioned and it's a bit chaotic.10. You have the option to purchase the photos that they took of you when you landed in Punta Cana. I can't imagine why anyone would want to do this when we all are hot and tired after traveling. The photos are good for laughs, though.Overall, I'm not sure I'd go back. It's not the greatest, but it certainly is not bad at all.

<Content>Good vacation but with a final sting! For the most part I would say that my vacation (5/17-5/24) at the Palace was good. Although my roomate and I arrived in the late evening, not being able to really see anything, I was pleasantly surprised at the property's beauty the next morning. We were dropped in error at the 'Beach hotel' by the transfer van from the airport but were quickly wisked off to the Palace, the next section of the complex. We were pleasantly greeted by the front desk staff. At this time I was asked for my credit card to secure any purchases or services made while there, I complied as this is a general practice I've experienced during my travels.W e were then assigned a pretty decent room location in the 4000 series on the ground level. Its proximity to the beach (one of my main attractions) was OK. The maid service with the exception of one day was good and nothing was stolen, as I've read in one visitor's review. General service was good although sometimes language was a barrier. I've have traveled the World and understand we are 'visitors' in a foreign land so I am patient in most cases but I felt they could've had more English speaking staff but they were all pleasant.I have no complaints about the food or the variety of dishes offered although I'd read of people becoming ill plus heard of a few while there. Thank goodness neither me or my roomie didn't get sick. the food was good, satisfying and plentiful. I especially liked the seafood restaurant called 'Las Brisas' where I had grilled lobster as much as time allowed.Now for my one complaint. On 6/8, I received a call from the 'fraud unit' of my credit card company inquiring about what they considered an unusual purchase made of over $700.00 (not my pattern of spending). I immediately told 'no, I had not made that kind of purchase' then asked where, they told me in the Dominican Republic at a clothing store after my departure! They said they believed a duplication was made of the card. It seems it's something that happens frequently in that country. However, I wouldrd and will issue a new one in the 7-10 days. But you see what a nightmare that could become? I'm sure it's happened to many others as well and it doesn't happen till you've returned home, of course. I will also be writing the sponsors of this trip to inform them. So, my advise is, should you make this trip, a word to the wise, do NOT give them your credit card. Just say you don't have one! What would they really do? Your trip's already paid for and its all-inclusive! This could be easily avoided and I wouldn't want anyone else to experience that shock. Thank goodness my credit card company was alerted to that unusual transaction.

<Content>You be the judge - We liked it Well I wanted to make sure that I listed a very complete review for everyone to read. First I think that it is important to give everyone a little background about the person writing the review so the readers can associate themselves with the perspective that I am coming from... a 24yr old will not write the same review as a 50yr old person.So here we go..... I went to Punta Cana and stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. I went with 11 other friends from the Pittsburgh, PA area and we are all in our late 20's and early 30's....some married some single....and to say the least we all had a great time.The trip from the ariport did take some time if you waited for the bus like we did. You have to wait for the entire bus to fill up with people from the tour group or apple vacation group as with us. It didn;t bother us too much but yes a cab would be quicker as stated in other reviews on this site.Check-in (2pm or so) went very smooth...except one of our parties rooms was occupied when they checked in...but they went right back to the front desk and they gave them a new room instantly.The property..... is very nice.....5 resorts a linked in one campus with train/shuttle service running between all locations. Depending where you stay will dictate what resorts you have access to....the palace gets you access to all resorts...a nice plus!!One of the big questions....Did anyone get sick. Well we only had one person out of 12 that got any type of sickness that kept them out of action. We did come prepared with Pepto, Immodium  a few presrciptions for CIPRO. The person that got sick spent less than 24 hours out of action with the meds we had with us. The food....as with any large group we had mixed reviews from all. For the most part the things that looked appetizing tasted very well...the things that didn't look appetizing - WE DIDN'T TOUCH. I preferred anything that was cooked right on front of me, to the stuff swimming in a pan under a heat lamp in the buffets - but that's me.....so the gril there.... the restuarants we all fine...no major complaints or rave reviews....after all we were in a different country and things are different than in America.The service..... in most cases the service was excellent. From room service to bars to restuarants...no major problems. We found that it was more of who was issuing the serivce. I think most of that was based onthe persons personality just like ANYWHERE you may go....so people were outgoing and very freindly and would do anything for you...and then some people wouldn't give you the time of day......HENRI at the pool bar is awesome....be sure to order a RUM RUNNER - it's his specialty.The pool/Beach...... Both are extremely clean. The palm trees make for a cooler stay on the beach...I'm not one that likes to sit and bake on the beach.... but playing volleyball in the sun/shade was my style...no problems getting chairs or lounges in either location.The Nightlife...... Not much to speak of if your into the Clubin' scene...one disco on campus that was fun for one or two nights...but to have to go back everyone night...not my style...I liked cancun for the nightlife better. The Nightclub at the Palace is very lame!!The Casino....was small but fun....just watch the dealers...all of them don;t know all he rules...if you catch them making a mistake the will move on quickly so call the pit boss over...they do know all the normal rules!! it was fun and they are all $5 tables unless you are playing with PESOS they you can lower your bet to the equivalent of about $2.ATM cards/$$$$.... bring extra cash if you plan to do anything extra...there isn't easy access to additional cash - but credit cards are accepted....the one time we tried to use the ATM machine it ate our card and lead to a very interesting cab ride and trip to the city to the local bank to try to retrieve the card. We got it back...but it was an adventure. and another side not if you need to go to a bank to get cash...be sure that you have a passport...no birth certificates accejust be prepared when you visit these outdoor shops on the beach..... if you show interest in anything they will hound you until no end....however they are very friendly and will respect a polite no thanks...but if you are interested in some souvenirs or rum or cigars...be ready to barter...they ususally drop their prices in half or by 2/3....have fun...Also a note you can get them down to about $4 a bottle for the rum....and beware the most of the cigars are fake....just FYIThe Golf Course....it was fun to play...but it was in very bad shape...Tee Boxes were dirt....greens were rough....and there was very little sand in the traps......but again it was better than being in the office!!The language....it is advised that you brush up on a little spanish...even a few simple words will go a long way..... we found ourselves listening for any English speaking people just so that we ha d other people to talk to....we met a town of great people that way..... the staff speaks very little English...you will get by without problems if you don't speak Spanish with no problems...but it will make the trip a little more fun if you can communicate a little bit the the staff and locals.The rooms..... the rooms are very standard and nothing extravagant...but I'm not on vacation for the room...the beach/pool/food  nightlife are all far more important than the room.Well I think that covers it......I hope everyone got a little something out of this review....please feel free to email any questions if you have them....I'd be glad to shed some light on anything else you may want to know.

<Content>Vacation 5/23 - 5/26 OK Resort Great Vacation!!! I gave this hotel 3 start but it was a 5 star vacation. My wife and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Barcelo Barvao Palace. We were there from May 23 to May 26. Our flight was perfect and arrived at the airport at 1pm. Instead of taking the bus to the resort we opted to take a taxi to beat the crowd to the hotel and get us on the beach sooner. We arrived and checked in with no problem. We got to the resort around 2 (check in time is 3) and were shown right to our room without any problems. The room was nice and very clean. We were in building 5. We really liked our location. All of the buildings are more or less the same except for their location. The higher the number the further away from the lobby/pool you are. Building 6 the furthest one away cant be more than a 5-minute walk to the lobby. So, the closer in you are the more likely you will hear people at the pool/bar or the evening shows.Then we went to grab a late lunch We were disappointed in the food. Some things were ok. I dont know how anyone could say it was great or having really enjoyed it. We do appreciate good food. We dont consider ourselves food snobs. The beef was usually chewy and the chicken was dry and rubbery. It is way below a TGI Fridays food quality. Neither my wife nor myself got sick from the food. We didnt let this bother us.Restaurant Review lunch at a sit down restaurant by the pool this may have been the seafood restaurant. I ordered lobster and my wife had fish. Both were disappointing.Italian We went here the first night we got a pizza appetizer and it was awesome. Really good pizza. We got the plain one We were afraid of the sausage pizza or the pepperoni. My wife ordered the gnocchi and I got plain spaghetti I figured to order plain dishes and we might be happier. Mine was ok it sort of tasted like spaghetti Os. Her gnocchi was very bland.Steakhouse again started with the pizza. We both got the Rib eye It was ok. Better than I thought. It wasnt Outback quality or anything but they had run out by the time we dined.Spanish This is one you have to pay additional for. We wanted to go to the French restaurant but it was closed on Sunday night. The food here was good. We were pleased with our meal. I would recommend this restaurant considering the other choices.Breakfast and Lunch Breakfast we would eat at the buffet. They had an assortment of all kinds of stuff. Made to order omelets were the best. These were very good. We were pleased with breakfast. They also had made to order smoothies as well. You pick out random fruit and they will blend it into a drink for you. Very nice.Lunch we ate lunch at the grill on the beach. It was close to building 6. You pick out what you want and they grill it for you. My wife got a hamburger and I got steak kabobs. This was ok. Another day we ate at the buffet they seemed to have a little bit of everything.Alcohol the only beer they have is Presidente which is very good. The frozen drinks were good. Probably not much alcohol in them but who cares they tasted great. These arent the same quality drinks you will get at a resort or cruise that charges $6 for a frozen drink. They user cheaper liquors for all of the drinks. You do have the option to pay for high quality liquor if they have it. I could have had a Tangery and Tonic instead of the local gin for a surcharge. I opted for the local gin it was different.Everything was very nice and clean. The pool area was very nice. It is a very big pool. Nothing extravagant, but simple and nice.The beaches are topless, very clean and excellent. No complaints about the beaches at all. They were immaculate. This is the reason we are all coming here, right??? We had no problem getting a chair at either the pool or the beach. We mostly opted for the beach. You could get a chair and put it anywhere you like on the beach. Beautiful!!Water Activities- Kayaking, Pedal Boat and Snorkeling. We did all three of these. No additional charge. Snorkeling isnt the best at the resort it isnt a coral reef. But, its fr. It was fun. They also offer sail boats for a surcharge and they also offer lessons. We didnt do either.Casino Casino is nice similar to a cruise casino. It wasnt huge but it seemed to accommodate everyone. Blackjack is my game. The dealer takes her second card at the very end after everyone has his or her final hand. I dont know how this changes the odds for us. It didnt bother me; I just noticed it was different from Vegas. Thank goodness we had this site to guide us and to set our expectations. We are not world traveler, but we do enjoy a nice resort. We have stayed at the Hyatt resort in Kauai, HI and the Waldorf in NYC. In NYC we prefer the Marriott Marquis. We are used to nice hotels not necessarily the Ritz Carleton. We knew going into this trip that those types of hotels dont exist in Punta Cana. This is part of the reason we planned our vacation here. To get away from commercialized resorts. In my opinion if the Hyatt is a 5 star resort then this resort is a generous 3 stars. We were not upset with our vacation b/c our expectations were set. Thanks to this site! IF we arrived and were expecting a Hyatt we would have been disappointed. Please email me with any questions. David.dicarlo@level3.com - put Punta Cana in the subject line. If you are looking for some RR there isnt a better place.

<Content>Tons of Fun I've been to the Barcelo Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana twice and im returning again this August. I have always gone with other family and friends and no one has gotten sick or had a bad time. everyone returned the following year. My mother is a travel agent and she has clients who have been their 9 times and love it!! The beach is great one of the best. staff is very friendly. c'mon give them a break if they don't have perfect english! i people have given this hotel mixed reviews and that ok but out of my odds its been great. you just have to be careful with what you eat and i mean that anywhere!

<Content>It was only a mediocre resort.... We went to the Bavaro Palace from 5/17-5/24. It practically rained every day except for 3 days. The beach was very beautiful needless to say. The only complaints that I have were only minor stuff.The water turned dark brown on my boyfriend while he was taking a shower one day and that wasn't very good. There were ants in my room. My maid stole my bodywash gel from my bottle and filled it up with water thinking that I wouldn't know. She also stole fifty cents from the bathroom. That was change that we forget to LOCK up....I was leaving her a tip of $2/day until she started taking our stuff. We locked up everything else...but I didn't think anyone would take my bodywash gel or my shampoo!We did not get sick with the food. Just brush your teeth with bottled water and also SKIP the buffets. There were flies and bugs flying around in restaurants b/c the whole place was all open-air. The only room with A/C is the hotel room itself. If you are going, pls bring OFF Bug spray...you MUST spray yourself or be EATEN alive by mosquitoes. Also the official language is spanish so if you speak spanish, it would be a major plus. The restaurants that I would recommend if you are going to the Palace are the Las Brisas, Arroceria, and Las Uvas.The resort overall is pretty average. I have to say the beach was very beautiful indeed. The resort grounds with the gardens and pools are very neat, clean, and nice. It was very HOT and Humid and very rainy when I went, however you also must know that the rainy season is from May - June. Temperature was mid 80s.I would not go back to the Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana due to the fact that I didn't like the humidity as much. The beach is nice but I can also find the same nice beaches in Bahamas or Jamaica where I had a blast.

<Content>Booked the Palace, got the Beach I just wanted to share...I have seen some reviews of people complaining that they were bumped from the palace to the beach. This happens ALL THE TIME at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. We vacationed there in April of 2000. This was my wedding, and there were 16 of us on this trip. When we arrived at the Palace, we were all told that they overbooked and we would be staying at the beach. We were allowed to use all of the palace amenities. The front desk staff was extremely rude. Needless to say, this being my wedding, I was very disappointed. So, if you plan to go to the Palace, make sure you check out the Beach hotel so that you see where you will stay if you get bumped. That said, once we got over our initial disappointment and frustration with Barcelo, the trip was wonderful. The food was great, beautiful beach, beautiful wedding set up by the hotel. I never even got to see what a palace room looked like, so I guess I don't even know what I missed out on. The only reason I would not return is because we were treated so rudely. I have looked at a lot of other sites with reviews of the palace, and this has happened to quite a few people.

<Content>wasn't pleased with accomadations We travel to Dom. Rep. 2x a year and always make sure to go to a resort during our short stay.I must say of so many resorts in Bavaro I chose the Palace thinking it would exceed my expectation.I found the beach and the facility very clean and the waiters very attentive.But the reason I will not return is because when I made the reservation I requested a ocean or pool view,almost sure It was going to be given,because during this time the hotels are practically empty.We were a party of 5 with 2 rooms, when we got there I reminded them about the room view in which first they said it wasn't requested on my reservation,but said even though the resort was practically empty they were'nt able to give it to us because the rooms with the pool/ocean view were under construction,which I believed until I got to our rooms, and across from ours were the pool/ocean view, and there wasn't any work being done and like 6 of the many rooms were occupied,that made me very mad.I was lied to! I will definetely not return to the Palace!!

<Content>Fabulous honeymoon at the Palace I went to the Barcelo Bavaro Palace last summer for my honeymoon in August 2002. My husband and I loved it and had an incredible time. I am surprised that many people have written about food problems. I usually have a weak stomach but we ate everything and had no stomach problems. Overall I thought the food choices were excellent. I especially loved the outdoor grill open only at lunch time where they fry up fresh seafood before your eyes. The drinks were also excellent - if you like coconut, try the coco loco drink - it was outstanding!We especially liked the seafood place and the mexican grill. The beach was beautiful except for a little bit of seaweed that is cleaned up daily. The pool is nice but we didn't spend much time there. There is a big show called Tropicallisimo that is advertised as the best show in the country - trust me. it isn't! But its fun and its free. We were impressed with the size of the grounds and enjoyed taking the trolley from place to place.As for room service - it was probably the only area that could use serious improvement. It seemed like the more we tipped the less often room service would come. Sometimes they hadn't cleaned the room by 4pm. However apart from that the rooms are very nice and comfortable. We loved the pampering at the Palace. We noticed that the service was excellent at the restaurants that cater only to Palace guests. (There are 5 hotels all together at Barcelo Bavaro) I think it's worth it to pay a little extra and stay at the palace for the better food choices and services.Overall we had an awesome time and no major complaints!

<Content>Barcelo Bavaro DIAHARREA We returned from the Palace tonight, had a meal at home and miraculously, we are no longer sick! It is hard to believe that a five star hotel could operate such poor food service. The food made everyone we spoke to very sick, many ended up in the on-site clinic and we were in the bathroom often. I recommend staying away from any animal products. Stick with the fruits, vegetables, stir-fry, rice/beans and pasta. The beach was beautiful, the staff and other visitors were friendly and the rooms were clean and stocked with drinks. We had sunshine throughout the trip and loved our rides on the 2-person catamaran. As for the casino, come prepared to lose money! The dealers make the rules as they go. For example, a guy had a 5 and a 4 at a Blackjack table, and then doubled-down and pulled an ace, and he was told he has 10 and not 20! You can also bet on sports in the room next to the casino and lose your money at a slower pace. If you want a beautiful beach, cheap watered down liquor and are happy living off of bread, rice and peanuts, the Palace is for you.

<Content>Give the poor dominicans a break! I expected less than what I got at the Bavaro Palace. The people were nicer than any American I have ever ran into, they live to please you. The food was EXCELLENT for the conditions...of course you are going to get a little sick but that is just because your body isnt used to it. The resort and its grounds are like walking through heaven...neat and beautiful. There are so many things to do and the hotel will do anything to help you. The maid service is prompt and thorough and the beach is indescribable. The only down fall is sleeping at night...it is like sleeping in wet sheets because of the humidity but that isnt the resorts fault! The rooms were big and beautiful. I recommend the palace to anyone! Dont forget to check out the outback safaries!

<Content>Beautiful - except for the food Well what can I say, we read all the reviews and knew what we were getting in to!! We were smart enough to bring crackers, granola, etc. This ended up being our lunch everyday! We were a party of six, we ended up having a great time ( 5 out 6 got sick). The Palace was beautiful. A couple of tips on arrival --- don't wait for the bus!! For $20US you can grab a taxi and get there before anyone else!! Our check in time was 5-10min, they had all of our rooms except we were in different buildings, I gave the woman at the desk $15US ( I would have paid more) and wouldn't you know we were all upgraded to oceanview and right next to one another!!! Needless to say the reviews on this website alone taught us that money talks down there! After check in we immediately went to the pool and started to cocktail, the place was tremendous! The food however is absolutely disgusting! We couldn't believe our eyes, the buffet had more flies than a horse stable and the food just wasn't appetizing (beast lasagna, crab teeth???). We stuck with the papas fritas (which ended up being deep fried in the same oil as the bacon- lol) and the rolls which were hard as rocks. Other than that we just kept drinking! The presidentes were fine, they were cold and they did the job! The nightlife was great, we hit the different lounges and the casino before heading to the disco. The disco was fun, most people were drunk trying to dance on these little stages that they had, and then security would come and drag them down, it was hilarious. We gave the bartender $10 each and told her to serve us six presidentes every six minutes, and she did (needless to say we were drunk). Everyone on the staff was so friendly and fun, they were really great! Just remember that these people are extremely poor and they work really hard and anything that you can give them helps! And frankly, in regard to one of the reviews posted a couple of days ago about THE LOUD AMERICANS, and how the almighty AMERICAN DOLLAR will ruin the resortif our AMERICAN DOLLARS can help someone lead a happier and better life than SO BE IT!!!!!

<Content>Don't eat, Don't drink, be wary... Just got back from a five-day visit. Over two hundred people.. many got sick from the food. Took the excursion to the mountains and lunch was cold  cuts, cheese, salads, and some drinks made by the locals. It's 85 degrees in the shade and they are serving potato salad! The locals are proud of making some kind of cocoa drink, and another one colored red. Some people tried it. Many got sick from this lunch. Hardly anyone speaks English, so if you try to ask a question of one of the staff, you will get a blank stare. Most of the food contains something that will make you sick. Who knows what kind of sanitary conditions they have in the kitchens, or even where the food is prepared. I doubt the kitchens are air conditioned. I'm sure they use the same knives to cut fruit and desserts, as they do to cut chicken and fish. The same music plays everywhere...on the beach, in the restaurants, on the tours, in the bars, at the pool....after a couple of days...you would kill to hear Emenem. The beach is beautiful...and topless. Other than that...live on bread and water while you're there. After a day or so...that's all you'll be able to get down.

<Content>Great Place, Bad Food First, the Palace is magnificently kept. The grounds are spotless and the service is good. The rooms were nicely kept and the views were memorable. The a/c in the room, however, was way too cold to the point where you had to turn it off. That turned out to be a mistake because we found a couple of roaches making their way out. Tip: Keep the a/c on, even if it's on low. Overall, the rooms were good.The beach was well maintained and clean. The sand was cool and the breeze was needed because of the sweltering (mid-90's) heat that hits the area. By mid-afternoon, our group of 6, always retreated to the pool bar and had a bunch of Presidente's. The pool is clean and the beer was cold.The nightlife at the Palace is really good. The Bavaro Disco was the place to be late night. Good music and once again the beer was cold and flowing.Now, for the bad part. The food was horrible. The buffet was atrocious. My wife actually just was diagnosed with ecoli which she got from the buffet. The Mexican place was scary, but the Steakhouse was decent (the steaks were fatty). I would recommend going to Chez Palace every night if you can because their food was really good. Tough to get reservations and closed on Sunday's, but worth the $20 extra...just for health reasons. Every one of us, there were six in the group, battled some sort of ailment there or are battling it now in NYC. That shouldn't happen on vacation.Finally, you need tip these people something. The group of us would always throw $15 to the waiter at dinner and at least $20 to the bartender during the day and evening. Leave a couple of bucks for your maid each day. If you don't, you might find some things missing. Don't leave regular or prescription medicine around because it will be taken.The Palace is beautiful to visit, but I would never go back. The food is like playing Russian Roulette and the Canadians get mad at you if you tip the service. Get a clue, since these people make little money and a couple of bucks here and there won't hurt us, but will help them a lot.

<Content>Beautiful beach, but not going back Just returned last night from a week of laying on the beach. I had expected more from this resort than I experienced. There were four of us in our party and all were sick at one point except for me. Not sure why, but it was disappointing. Lots of people were sick, and spent several times in the bathroom, cramping up with upset stomachs. It's true about the Punta Cana Poopies! It was our joke for the week, we had to make the best of the situation. The Palace is a clean, comfortable resort, but not a five star. Our room was musty (candles are good) and the sheets always felt damp at night. Although we were next to the pool and had a nice veranda to sit on. The bar service and mixed drinks were nothing to write home about. The staff were friendly, a bit hard to understand, but as long as you are patient and tried to talk with them they are helpful. Food was sorta okay, I enjoyed the steakhouse the best. I stuck to salads, chicken/pork and bread. The casino was a let down, entertainment was minimal and not much to do but lay on the beach. We did the Bavaro Splash tour and that was fun! Went to Manati Park, swam with the dolphins and that was a great experience. Tried parasailing and can't wait to do it again. You need to book some excursions or you will be very bored. The weather was perfect, bring sunscreen. My advice to anyone looking to visit Punta Cana would be to bring some snacks or food, a few books and Beer! They only served Presidente which is similar to Budwieser and never cold enough. Overall, I did enjoy relaxing on the beach and made the best of it, but would not go back. We're heading to Aruba again.

<Content>Horrilbe food and bottom shelf booze I came to the palace with a very open mind about the food. But it was still very dissapointing. I lived on stale bread and rice because I was afraid to eat any meats. At least 50 percent of the people there were sick from the food. Some having to see a Dr. which costs them $200. We ate at the french restaraunt 3 nights cause it had the only food that was decent but you had to pay for it. The resort is very nice and the staff was veryt friendly and usually helpful, but you can not get anything to drink except for presidente beer and bottom shelf liquor. So if you are used to fine dinning and drinking I would not recomend this resort. I know lots of people that have come here in the past and it seems that once the resort got a good rating they cut back on the quality of the food and drink. So if you want to loose wieght and chill at a very nice place than this resort would be good for you.

<Content>Excellent We just returned from the Palace, we had a terrific time. There was plenty of good food and drinks. The rooms were clean, all of the workers were very friendly. This was our first time there and are planning to go back in November and next year also. The only draw back was in Miami we had a two an one half hour wait going through customs

<Content>Tale of 2 Trips The Bavaro is a nice resort but in no way is it 5 stars as it is billed. It is a 3+ star hotel, the decor is nice but do not expect an elaborate lobby or exceptional room amenities as you would in a 5 star resort. The service depends on how busy the resort is. We started our vacation on 4/22 which was the peak season and the staff was awful. You really need to know how to speak Spanish to get anything otherwise prepare to be ignored. The staff was not willing to do anything above and beyond the bare minimum - unless you are going to flash some cash - than everyone understands English. However once the crowds left over the weekend the remaining days were very pleasant and the staff was extremely helpful. My advice would be to go during off-peak times. I traveled with 20 people and 17 out of 20 got sick (intestinal), my guess is that they were not using filtered water to wash fruits/vegtables. I only ate meat and did not get sick. Other resorts in the area do not have this issue, so make sure you prepare in advance.The food is good, my favorite was the seafood resturant. The steak house was disappointing, the steaks are small and thin. The buffet is great but lunch and dinner are the same meals so it can get redundant. The lines can be long but once most of the Easter vacationers left most resturants had only a 1-2 minute wait. The beach is exceptional, by far the best I have ever seen, even neigboring hotels would come to our beach. You can snorkle off the beach and walk out for yards without getting your hair wet. So to summarize, go off-peak for the best service and do not expect a 5 star resort. However, the beach is exceptional and that is why you are going in the first place.

<Content>Was OK I was at the Barcelo Palace from April 22/03 to April 29/03. Weather: Great no rain!Hotel: Very beautiful, though the only place you could find air conditioning was your room! Dont like the whole concept of villas. Rather perfer the one big structure.Beach: Nice, but hate the reefs.Staff: They were very niceThe pool: was very beautiful though could have had more activitiesFood: Was good though somethings did taste weird! I got sick the last few daysNightlife: Very boring. The shows were not that great, there was really nothing to do, seemed to be more excitement at the Garden and Beach hotel!Overall: will probably not be returning to Punta Cana, I dont like the idea where you cant leave the resort because there is nohing to see or do. A place like Cancun is more what I like to see!!! It has everything in one!!!!

<Content>From 5 star to a three star This was our third time at this resort. The first two time it was like being in heaven . But this time it was not like the other time . The food was not near what is was before too many flies in the restaurant.We both got sick and on our returned my spouse had to go to the hospital.The room was a little dirty killed one liz and three big bug.But the biggest drawback this time was these loud mouth AMERICAN who became very arrogant to some other culture because of the war in Iraq.Also these College kids who were on spring break that think they were in Florida and respect for other people was never in their vocobulary.I will sum it this way . The mighty american dollar will ruined this ressort in a matter of a couple year

<Content>Disrespectful, Deceitful, Rude Our trip was from April 21, 2003 thru April 28, 2003. Upon arrival to the PALACE, (10:00 p.m.) we were informed that they did NOT have our rooms (1 triple, 1 single). Though we had a confirmation number and payment was made in March. The hotel told us they had overbooked and would place us in the Beach hotel. This was not acceptable, but we had no recourse. By the way, there were five other families in the lobby with the same problem at the same time. They told us we would receive a band to utilize all of the Palace's amenities, be reimbursed the difference between the hotels and receive a free 3 day stay in the Palace. When asked what the price difference was, we were told they would let us know the next morning. We also inquired when we could be moved into the Palace. They had no rooms until Sunday. On Tuesday I checked with the desk, no message, no room, no information. Our Tour operator was not available either. Finally on Saturday, 2 days before we leave, I went to the Office and inquired about our situation and the cost difference along with the 3 day free stay. I was informed that my travel agent had not contacted them, which she did.. she had an extention of the person she spoke with which they do not give out unless you talk to that person directly. I was told that the manager was not around and they could not credit my card, because they had not been paid yet. Funny, we had confirmation of the payment. I was told that they would need to review the situation with their manager who would be returning on Monday at 9:00 a.m. I stated I would return on Monday at 9:00 a.m. I returned to the office and approached the individual I had talked with on Saturday. She acted as if she had not seen me before. I stated I was there on Saturday and said I would be back on Monday for finality to our issues. The manager is not in yet and is not due until 9:30 a.m. I said I would wait with my Mom and 5 year old. At 9:15 a.m. I was told that children need to be at the beach or elsewherghter was talking to us, no yelling, no running etc..) I informed her that we have been inconvenienced all week and I would wait in the office until 9:30 a.m. At 9:30 we were informed that the manager was not here yet and they would send me a letter. I asked why she could not do the credit now. She already stated we would get the difference and free stay. Guess what, we will send you a letter. Not only were they rude, but lying and non cooperative. Punta Cana itself is great. DO NOT stay at the Bavaro Resorts. You will not get what you pay for. This is a very unhappy person with 3 children and a mother on this trip. I have traveled many place and never run into such disgust in my life. GOOOD LUCK IF YOU GO

<Content>Palace is clean , not the food The Palace is definetley the nicest out of all the Barcelo resorts.A lot of people got bumped out of the Palace that we talked to when we were there. How can these resorts overbook by 1 or 2 hundred people. There was a woman standing in the front lobby our first night there with 2 small children, holding up a sign that said I booked here and now they tell me they don't have a room for me. She had two small children with her -this is pathetic we thought. The staff were misserable.l would only get them to speak english (at this a little) or smile if I gave them money or a gift.The food is very questionable. Two out of three times to the Steak house, they didn't have any tenderloin steak.Our last visit there , my steak was bad and sour.Don't deep fry your bacon, there is enough fat in it already.The coffee at the buffet in the palace was terrible.We (our party of 4) all got sick.I'm still not well.Definetely not a 5* more like a 3*. Not impressed.

<Content>Bad and Good My husband and I arrived, along with another couple in Punta Cana on April 17th, hoping that none of the reviews we had read were true!! We went to check into the Palace to find out that we did not have a room. Reception first tried to tell us that it was because our travel agent booked our hotel incorrectly and that we booked the Beach, it was not the hotels fault. After about ten minutes, the hotel rep came to meet us letting us know that we WERE booked at the Palace, but because other guests decided to stay longer, we were being bumped to the Beach Resort. We were taken to the Beach, given a room that was already occupied by another couple and then given a new room, where the patio doors would not lock. Overall, the check in time took approximately 3 1/2 hours!! Now about the hotel, the resort complex is beautiful with many restaurant to choose from. The buffets are very questionable, I am not sure how fresh the food is plus the food is not kept very cold. The Italian and Seafood restaurants are very good and the Steakhouse and Mexican are just okay. My husband and I lived on Immodium for the entire week in order to be able to leave our bathroom and enjoy the resort. The French restaurant is totally worth the extra money, no complaints.As for trips outside of the park, we went on the Bavaro Runner and it was a blast, well worth the money - we got to see the country side, visit the sugar cane fields, a farm and have lunch at a ranch. We also went to Manati Park and swam with the dolphins for all of maybe 5 minutes - a big disappointment. The park was okay but we missed most of the shows while waiting our turn to swim.Lastly, make sure that all your belongings are locked up in the safe that is provided. Our friends left some things in a locked suitcase which was then broken into. When we went to notify Public relations and our travel rep about the theft we found out that theft happens alot on the resort but is kept very quiet and the Resort does nothing about it.Overall, Palace if they do not bump you to the Beach, Garden, Casino, Villas (very terrible), or Golf Resorts!!!

<Content>Beautiful beach My boyfriend and I just returned from an eight day trip to the palace. It turned into a six day trip because of the traveling and delays in each airport. The island is absolutely beautiful. The hotel is very nice and many employees to keep it clean. The room was clean, however smelled of mold. The employees are wonderful and pleasant to the people. We brought lots of singles and tipped the maid and bartenders. They were appreciative. Our biggest dissapointment was the food. When you go on vacation you want to eat more than usual (at least we do). Seeing we were in another country was understandable and we were aware that it would be different. In the buffets, you have to choose the kind of meat you want out of a cooler and they cook it in front of you (slow). It takes a while and is annoying when everyone wants steak and chicken. There are many people crowded around the meat and it can become uncomfortable. We were expecting it to be readily availabe (seeing it was a buffet). Don't forget there is a buffet on the beach (a lot of people were unaware of this).

<Content>This resort is a Treasure! This resort is one of the best vacation spots we have been to and we'll definitely return. The grounds are fabulous, lush vegetation, beautiful flowers  extremely well maintained. The beaches are clean - white sand  beautiful blue  green colours in the water. The Palace is kept extremely tidy - there is never a mess anywhere - even in the washrooms outside by the bars! The food was great in the buffet - always a variety - the waitresses  waiters are courteous  work very hard to make sure you are well looked after. When visiting this country, we MUST keep in mind that Spanish is their first language  many of them speak several other languages including German, French, Italian as well as English. Even if some don't speak perfect English, they will attempt to understand what you are trying to communicate - you can have a good time with them anyway! The rooms are spacious, clean and we never saw any bugs. There is very little insulation in the walls  ceiling so beware that you can hear your neighbours especially if they are noisy. If you want a room away from the pool - try to get into building 4,5 or 6. One side of building 3 is poolside. The Bavaro Runners excursion is lots of fun if you would like to see the Dominican countryside. Overall, it was an enjoyable trip  we highly recommend it.

<Content>Good and Bad The hotel was very well maintained and attended to. Food was plentiful but some items were questionalble. The weather was supposed to be at its best but we had rainy days. If you didn't know how to speak or understand Spanish you were at a loss. It was very hard to communicate with the hotel/restaurant staff since most only spoke Spanish. The tours offered were expensive and not worth the money. If you are going to Punta Cana, stay put and relax at your hotel. Do not venture off site.

<Content>Great Vacation Destination! My friend and I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace for a short, 3 night getaway, and that certainly was not enough time. Upon arrival, we were greeted with delicious, tropical welcome drinks. This made the wait to check in much more bearable. The rooms were very nice, and the views are just breathtaking. Although we were there at a very slow time of year, all the restaurants were open, and the staff couldn't try hard enough to please us. They were very accomodating and made sure you were having a wonderful time every. Having the option to go to the other 4 Barcelo hotels and use their restaurants was great. The seafood was excellent. While we didn't go to any of the shows at night, we listened from our balcony, and they sounded phenominal. One piece of advice: if you go to the market that's down the beach from the Barcelo Bavaro Palace, BEWARE! The people working will do anything to make you buy their stuff, and they're much pushier than Jamaica or anyplace else I've ever been. They grab you and pull you over. You're better off not converting your money, but if you do, make sure to do the math in your head before you buy anything. They kept coming down in price until I finally agreed, then later realized I spent $35 on a beaded necklace that should have been about $5. Aside from that, the beach and resort itself are absolutely incredible, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a tropical getaway.

<Content>Best vacation ever This is the place to stay if you want to be surrounded by paradise, great friendly staff, and nice rooms. This was our second time to stay at the Palace. Both times were wonderful. No complaints what so ever. This time we had a group of nine adults. Everyone had a great time. Drinks are plentiful and the food is in abundance, but remember to bring your pepto and take a sip every morning. The staff bends over backwards to help out with any needs you may have. Service is excellent. I will be going back again next year. We were there March, 2003, weather was perfect. Went on the shark and manaray snorkle trip and had a great time and experience. I would recommend this resort to anyone who is into beautiful surroundings and relaxing. If you go have a great time.

<Content>Never Again Not to belittle the facilities..the rooms were fine, had a very nice oceanview room in Blgd 5. Upon arrival  check-in there were ants literally covering the bathroom sink...we were quickly relocated next door without a hassle. The restaurants were very pleasant and the buffet pretty good. However, we did get some kind of stomach problems the 3rd day there...and no, it wasn't from drinking too much. The property itself is gorgeopus and well manicured. BUT...the staff at the lobby bars  front desk are anything but friendly. If you do not speak Spanish...forget it...they will not try to speak English and look at you like you have just landed from another planet if you try to comunicate in Spanish. The most pleasant, courteous  frienly staff members we encountered during the 8 day stay were the housekeeping ladies. The tennis courts are in horrible shape. The casino is small and also staffed with who cares if you are here people.We have satyed at another Barcelo resort, in Playa Del Carmen and it truly was much nicer...especially the staff....much more friendly...smiling  laughing with you as you attempt to speak Spanish  they try to communicate better in English. I would not recommend the Barcelo Palace, but would highly recommend their resort in Playa Del Carmen

<Content>Great vacation in the DR My parents, sister, her boyfriend, my girlfried, and I visited the Dominican Republic from March 6 to 13. We stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace Resort. This resort was wonderful and would absolutely go back. The grounds, beach, rooms, and water were all wonderful and I couldn't imagine anyone complaining about this resort. I am 17 years old and I will tell you now that the disco doesn't get started until around midnight so get some tequilla in you early to keep you awake. There is not much activity at the Palace resort at night for teenagers so you can always go the Barcelo Beach resort. This trip is only about 5 min. by the provided train. The food was also excellent in my opinion. These other people that are complaining in the other reviews don't understand that you are in a different country and they should respect that. Just because these people don't speak to the workers in Spanish doesn't mean the employees should have to try to speak in English to you! If you just say hola or buenas dias to them you will get a much better attitude from them. Back to the resort, the beach was wonderful and there was plenty of chairs. I suggest to take the Outback Safari tour if you have time. This tour was wonderful and it gives you an idea of how it is to live in the DR. You take a big truck up into the mountains and have a lot of fun. You go to a local home, local school, sugar cane plantation, rum shack, and a beautiful secluded beach. Try very hard to get Tony for your tour guide. He was wonderful and also please tell him hi from all of us in Maryland. We also took a snorkeling tour on a big white party boat. This was a lot of fun because you got to swim with sharks and stingrays. This pretty much sums everything up that I wanted to say. I have been to the DR three times and I would definitly choose Bavaro Palace over all the other resorts. Happy vacationing!!!

<Content>All got sick A wonderful resort except out of the 6 adults, 5 got sick. So each of us lost a day in bed. One required a trip to resort Doctor for a shot. She was very sick and is still recovering. Beach is great. Pool is clean. Rooms were Ok. Food was OK. Golf was poor. plus its difficult to get a Tee time unless you want to play in the heat of the day. Would not return to Barcelo Bravo Palace. Mexico much better and no illness.

<Content>for your health, bring your own food We had same experience as Canadien reviewer the week of March 22, 2003. Nice facility, great staff... but BEWARE of the food... they warn you about the water, but it ain't enough.... of 30 guests in our group, 20 got sick on the food...Bring CIPRO, you'll need it!

<Content>Excellant We have just got back from the Bavaro Palace it was woderful. We read the negative reviews and so was a little nervous. We found no complaints from begining to end. The beach is paradise and the hotel is excellant. They keep the grounds and hotel in perfect condition. We would certainly go back again. We ate breakfast at the buffet  lunch at he Pina Cana, dinner mostly at the buffet. We did get a little tummy upset but nothing to stop us eating or keep us in our rooms, so take some /Immodium also any other medications and femine needs as they are exspensive to buy. Don't pay the asking price in the market what ever they say you will get it for half. Drink only bottled water and brush your teeth the same. The jeep excursion is worth the trip. A bit dusty so take you swim suite and a towel so you can bath in the ocean at the stop for lunch. Have a wonderful time and please e-mail me if you have any questions...as I know how nervous my husband and I was. You will love it, ther is so much to do bur we took our pleasure on the beach. Enjoy. :)

<Content>A great resort to lose weight! Travelled the week of March 14-21, 2003. I have plenty to say about this resort. I'll tell you the best part first and please read the worst!The Best Features?: THE WEATHER: the sun rises every day and its ready to burn your butt off. We usually got a really nice and welcoming ocean breeze everyday, but that breeze can be decieving. While you feel and think its cooling you off, that sun is still doing its job. As for the nights, the weather was awesome and romantic too! TIP: Don't forget to bring and use the sunscreen! THE BEACH: the beach is beautiful and very clean. The water is crystal clear and it looks as good as the pictures you see in there ads. Plenty of palm trees and you can walk for miles in either direction.Don't expect any those shady huts! There is only ONE hut on the entire beach. It's unbelievable that the resort would provide only one hut!IMPORTANT TIP: (1) If you plan to use one of their paddle boats, please make certain that you are extremley protected. I went out for only 20 mins and got the worst sun burn on both of my legs you can ever imagine. The pain was unbearable. Why?...the water reflects the sun and basically acts as a mirror. You will not notice the damage or the pain until a few hours after you returned the boat. (2) If you plan to spend time on the beach and plan to reserve one of the resort's beach lounge chairs, make certain to choose only the blue colured ones. The green coloured chairs are useless and a joke to say the least. I cannot belive that the resort would actually provide their guests, who pay good money, such chairs. THE POOL: In short, the pool is awesome and you won't be disappointed.THE ROOMS: The rooms are spacious and extremley clean. THE MAIDS: The maids do an incredible job each and everyday. Once they are finished, you will not find a speck of dust or dirt.THE GROUNDS: The grounds are pristine and beautiful! The Worst Features?: I hope that the resort reads and take notes on my following comments. THE FOOD: If you want to lose weight fast and without any exercise whatsoever and without paying Jenny Craig...just eat the food. I did and got very sick. I do know that my sickness came as a direct result of eating the food. The only good thing that came out out of my sickness, no pun intented, was that I lost about 7 pounds in 48 hours. Some people lost as much as 12 pounds! I also found that no-one, including myself, did not know which food or drink caused there sickness. And yes...I only drank bottled water. The one thing I can tell you is that Montezuma is alive and well. I think that Punta Cana should be renamed to POO-POO Cana. The fact is...there is at least a 70% chance that you will get sick. 7 out of 10 people I spoke to got very ill within 24-72 hours after they arrived, which lasted generally lasted between 24-72 hours. Even women who were pregnant have gotten ill. And when you do get sick..get ready to pay the doctor too! As for the food....the food is not the worst I have ever experienced. The main buffet set up next to the pool, and the food looks great, but, the taste is not as good as it looks. In addition, I witnessed time and time again that the resort does not do enough to keep the flies and little critters from feasting on it too. One thing is for sure, their are having a good time feasting and the best part for them, its free! The majority of the food provided in all there restaurnats are so-so at best. Whatever you do...stay clearly away from there so called Italian resturant and stay far away from there so-called Steak restaurant. TIP: The French restaurant located next to the main buffet hall is by far the best to eat, but you will have to pay an additional $20(US) per person to eat there. WHY?COMMUNICATION: If you speak spanish...you will not have a problem communicating with the staff, which I found were pleasant. But if you don't speak spanish, you wil have a major problem. Almost the entire staff cannot speak or understand any english whatsoever. And belive me...its pretty frustrating. I do not blame the staff because whatsoever. In fact, my heart goes out to them, they work hard everyday day. But I do blame the resort. At the end of the day, I would recommend the resort if you don't have a problem with getting sick or don't have a problem with communicating with the staff. Would I go back?...Probally Not. The main reason is because of the food and there lack of keeping the flies of the food. I hope my comments helped.Have a great day!

<Content>Perfect! We loved the Palace! We started out at the Beach (4 Star) and we were quickly lured over to the Palace by lobster dinners and the luxurious facilities, so we switched after the 1st day. The beaches were beautiful, the facilites were nice, the food was excellent, and staff was very friendly. It was the perfect, romantic vacation.

<Content>Wonderful holiday Our March 7-14, 2003 holiday was wonderful.All categories would be either 4 or 5 star. Food was a bit disappointing, but lots of variety and different restaurants to choose from. Most importantly no one got sick. Beach is absolutely the strongest feature - wonderful for sunbathing or going for long walks. Very lively atmosphere, but also as many opportunities for privacy and solitude as anyone could want. Facilities, grounds, rooms, etc were quite nice. Staff were consistently friendly (although I was surprised by their limited English skills). Nightly entertainment wasn't spectacular but always enjoyable. Lots of fun activities for teenagers. Overall, a very safe choice for a completely worry-free holiday. Good value.

<Content>Can't believe the negative reviews!! My daughters and I just returned from a wonderful vacation at the Palace. After reading all the negative reviews, we were expecting the worst possible scenario and were pleasantly surprised. Our room was exactly the one we requested, ocean view, upper floor in building 4000, the staff was helpful and courteous, even finding and returning a lost article of clothing. The beach and pool area was beautiful and there was a variety of choices for dining. Can't say anything negative about the Palace. Maybe some vacationers are just picky, picky, picky!

<Content>Great resort, bad airline My wife and I returned to the Palace for our 4 visit, this time with 3 other couples. A good time was had by all, great resort and staff. The only glitch was a lost suitcase on the way to Punta Cana by one of the couples. Ryan Airlines our charter carrier, found the suitcase still in Minneapolis and refused to place it on another airline. Only pressure by our travel agent Carlson Wagonlit (who was a great help) managed to pursuade Ryan Airlines to forward the suitcase, but after 6 days! I would not recommend Ryan or TransGlobal Vacations as they both advised us they were not willing to help. We will all return to the Palace next year, but using a different airlines and vacation package wholesaler. (Maybe MLT travel)

<Content>Loved the Bavaro Barcelo Palace AC vacations Just returned March 2 from a fabulous week at this 5-star hotel. with my husband and another couple. Air Cnada Vactions made sure that even with some bad weather delay to leave, we were treated well on the flights. drinks, meals and movie made the flight less tedious. They were ready with the bus on our arrival and check in was quick. Our room was ocean-frount (you have to insist on this, if you care. Our friends eventually got one their second night. I emailed the hotel a few nights before our departure to remind them of our request, which may have helped us) in the best block (5), king-size bed and spotless. Hint: ocean-frount faces the ocean VS. Ocean-view allows you some glimpse of the ocean. Daily maid service and even turned down the sheets for you at night. Air-conditioning when dressing and sleeping was wonderful! Large balcony with comfortable chairs. If you leave a $1.00 (US!) for the maid each am, she will add extra snacks etc. into the mini bar. I would bring small packages of crayons next year as they appreciate this for their kids as well. The only disppointment with the room is that they did not have bathrobes as promised. The service was excellent. Never had to wait for a drink or coffee etc. Always with a big smile (Ola!). Try the Pina Baveros, they were excellent along with the strawberry daquiris...The buffet had many choices, including a fresh pasta bar, grill, salads, fresh bread. the breakfast included all kinds of choices. I always had Ramona make me up a fresh fruit smoothie to start and then had an omlette with ingredients of my choice. The seafood restaurant had a delicious shrimp and garlic dish. We were disappointed with the lobstar (over-cooked), and watered-down wine here though. The paella resturant had the best chicken currie dish! We also experienced the Steak House which had wonderful tenderloin, rib steaks etc. All these were included in the all-inclusive. Long line to get into the Steak House at the Beach, but moved quickly (20 minutes). We treated ourselves to the Palace Restaurant one night for French cuisine (Could have licked my plate!), which was $20.00 each and the wine extra. the chef was French Canadian from Montreal and came out to meet us. It was a real treat!The beaches were well-groomed and you could find a quiet place to relax or choose to be in the action..your choice. The Palace beach chairs were the most comfortable of all the Bavero sites. The casino was fun (if you win!) and disco played oldie disco tunes which got us up dancing (if you want to stay up until the opening at 1130pm). Do bring some Imodium, though. While I was fine, the other 3 had some GI disturbances at some point and were happy to use my stock of it that I brought. Drink only the bottled water (even brush your teeth with it) which is plentlyful.The ONLY real disappointment for our group was the golfing experience. To book an early am game, the you need to get up at 500am the day before and WALK 15 minutes to the course to stand in line to book. We did have an early-bird in our group who did that, but we all agreed that it was not what you want to do on your vacation. The course was rough and you must pay extra for a golf cart ($30.00 US) each day. DO NOT expect a golf vacation and then you will be totally satisfied with the experience. The Palace was much less crowded, more civilized and friendlier quicker service than the Beach. We did notice a dramatic difference in service at the Beach vs. the Palace. The Beach did have more action, though..If we bring the kids next time, we would sacrifice the service and standards at the Palace and stay at the Beach (less costly there). What can I say? Wonderful Service, drinks, sun, warm waters, great weather??? Now that I am back in -25 C weather..I can only dream that I am still there! Ola, my friends!

<Content>Golf is light years behind Requiring guests to arise at 5:00am to get a tee time is not my idea of fun. The golf course is poorly run, service there is poor. Overall, the facilities including golf course are nice, but the food is average at best. Take immodium!

<Content>Don't swet the small stuff! We just returned from 7 awesome days at the Palace. Weather was 85-90 degrees everyday with no rain during the day at all. Food was good, Don't be afraid to try a little bit of everything. You will find out that most of the food is not like the american food you are used to, but still goodWe did not go on any excursions off the comlpex just hung out on the beach and at the pool. Be sure to take of the bartenders (with tips) and they will take care of you. Henri, Henri, and Juan were excellent bartenders at the pool. Do bring along a insulated mug, the sun is pretty intense and will keep your drinks cold Do tip your maid and the person that stocks your mini fridge. Like I said before don't swett the small stuff, relax and have a good time attemp to speak a little spanish and all will go well.

<Content>Will be there in May I am surprised by some negative review here. It seems that the airlines and organisator are responsible most of the time for the trouble. I spend 2 weeks last year not in Palace but in Casino and no problem whatsoever. So I am now preparing for this year vacation and with my wife we decided to go for the Palace. The resort was great, not much to add to the other positive reviews here. I think that peoples buy cheap flight (charter) cheap holiday maker etc.. . Peoples get real, if you buy cheap you get cheap.

<Content>Facility was Wonderful Let me start by saying that every vacation has +'s and -'s and this is how I will present my review. We flew Sky Service from Toronto to Punta Cana, about a 4 hour flight. The airplane is set up for only amputees, there cetainly wasn't any leg room for anyone over 4 foot, very uncomfortable - minusArrived in Punta Cana at 10:30 PM their time and was surprised to see how quickly visitors were processed and how quickly our luggage was available to move to the buses + plusArriving at the Palace, approx 1/2 hr later and we (my wife and I and close friends who had not travelled South before - first trip) were the only 2 couples that got off at the Palace. Fortunately, again, we were processed immediately with no hassle and no delays and given a welcoming drink (no alcohol) and were shown to our rooms + plusRooms was very nice, with double sink bathrrom, shower and tub, large king size bed (hard as a rock, however), a small table and 2 chairs in the room and table and 2 chairs on the balcony. The room had a wonderful pot of real red roses, a small bottle of Dominican rum and a fruit basket on the table near the pario doors + plusAble to find a buffet still open at 11:00 PM, actually at the Beach facility no far away form the Palace, surprising enough, the Palace (5 star facility) had nothing available to eat for late arrivers - minusWe had tee times pre-booked for Sunday 9:00 AM, arranged via direct contact with the golf pro at the Bavaro golf course (I will explain the tee time arrangements later - terrible!), the buffet at the Palace was great, at least in the morning, there was everything you can imagine availbale to eat + plusWe were able to get a golf cart ride to the golf course by simply requesting at the front entrance, gentlemen there made a quick phone call and within 15 minutes there was a cart ready to transport us to the golf course + plusWe were able to leave our clubs and shoes at the club at no charge, they were quickly cleaned and stored away + plus. Having completed this excerise, we requested a ride back and we were immediately driven back to the Palace by golf cart + plus - whatever, you do, be sure to tip the driver, as they get quite upset if you don't and will possibly effect the whole process the next time you play + plusIn general, the facilities at the Barcelo Bavaro complex are wonderful, the grounds are spectacular, the beach is very clean, the water is a light turquoise and surprisingly warm, warmer than the pool. The room in the Palace and that is all I can comment on, were very nice, large, very clean and the minibar was stocked with Cola, beer and choclate bars every day. It does pay to leave $$ for the maids each day and some small items like childrens' crayons, makeup, shampoos, dollar store stuff, it appears they appreciate these types of gifts, based on the amount of beer stock and choclate bars left in your minibar + plus Oceanview rooms is a loose term for the view, most room balconies are angled such that you have a partial view to the beach, in our case, we had room that directly faced the ocean, however, there was a court yard in front with 30 to 40 palm trees (beautiful) which block the view of the ocean. It was there, we could hear it, it was about 200 yards away, a close walk to the beach later in the day + plus / - minusSit down restaurants were difficult to get into in the evening, be prepared to stand in line at about 6:30 PM, 1/2 hr before openning, to be seated in the first round of sevice. Most restaurants were acceptable quality, however, we were very disappointed at the Steak House, teh steak looked like a quick fry, over done, tough as nails, 2 bites and I was done and pushed it away, what a waste of the good cow - minusBack to the golf course - they will only take 1 day in advance booking and they had suggested to us that if we called at 6:45 AM, we could make advanced booking for early morning. However, we did find out from experienced golfers at the Palace, that you had to be at the club by 5 AM to book an early morning teetime. There was no transportation to get us there at 5:00 AM and the Palace is approx 2 km away for the golf facility. THis is not what I wanted to do at 5:00 Am in the morning, walk in the dark for 2 km to make a teetime and probably have to walk back. Absolutely unacceptable for a 5 star facility! - We were forced to arrange a meeting with the Director of the Palace and discuss our concerns. He was able to arrnage 3 teetimes for the balance of the week, all at 10:00 AM, which meant we played during the hottest time of the day. If you have planned a golf vacation for the guys, as we did, you will be disappointed at the quality of the course, tough, elevated greens, trapped to death, but the grounds were poorly maintained, several tee boxes with no grass.In general, the facility was immaculate, wonderful trees and flowers, rooms were very nioce, the personnel were pleasant to deal with, go with an open mind and have fun with the waitesses and waiters, they are funny people and will laugh alot. Remember - you reap what you sow!

<Content>Great Time My husband, myself and about 70 other people from our area just came back from a great week at the Bavaro Palace. Other than the late( 1 am) check in due to flight delay we had a good time. We had one of the best rooms. Building 6, ocean front. This is by far the best building if you want quiet. We lucked out getting the ocean front. I did e-mail them 5 - 6 times requesting this. Others in our group requested also but not everyone got what they wanted, but no one was disappointed. Unless you do not mind a lot of late night music I would suggest you ask not to be put in the first two buildings. They have a great view of the beautiful pool but they are close to the nightly entertainment and sometimes late night swimmers, clothes optional. The grounds are beautiful with flowers, palm trees and little lizards. The beach is very clean and always well maintained. This is a topless beach, so be prepared for just about any thing. Young and old alike. It became amusing after a couple of days, there were some you wanted to offer to buy them a top. You also have the men in those little speedos, Ugh!!! I only saw one, bright orange thong speedo, that was really worth the look. The grill Pina on the beach next to building 6 was great. They have the best pizza, you have to ask for the menu. The food at the grill was always good. Ask for Cesar Altagracia Puente. He is a young waiter there and so friendly. He is studying his english and welcomes any help. He also will help with your spanish if needed. We found the buffet at the Palace to be the best food all around. Many choices and servers always willing to get what ever you want. We tried the French resturant, you pay $20.00, this one is not included. It was ok but I would not recommend it especially when there are so many places to eat for free. We tried the Italian, ok, the buffet at the Beach hotel, not recommended, the seafood place at the Beach, it was good but they did not have lobster the night we went and I did not like the soup, too watery for a bisque. Ye all good, sometimes too good! The rooms were nice but everyone seemed to have a problem with the air conditioner. It seems to have only two settings, very cold or off. I turned it off at night as I was freezing and it was 80 outside. Durning the day you need to leave it on as the floors and everything gets very wet if you don't. The bed was very hard, some people like that I personally did not. The mini bar is free,suprise!! I left $1.00 everyday and had many extra beers, sodas,water and candy. I also left the maid $2.00, on the pillow so she knows it is ok for her to take it, every day and I always had extra towels and a very clean room. Most of the people who live in the DR make $200.00 a Month!!! so tips are appreciated even though they are not necessary as they are included in your stay. I left tips at my meals and for the bartenters. They work really hard and deserve it. We had no problems with crime as someone else stated. There are security guards 24 hours a day. I took the Tiki boat trip. I did not think it was worth the money and all you get to eat is potato chips, that is the snacks they tell you about. We took the Safari trip, that was really great. You get a chance to go to the rain forrest and stop at some of the houses, have a great lunch then go to the beach on the other side of the Island. It is a full day but well worth it. It will give you a chance to see how these people live and believe me you should appreciate every thing you have. We encountered few problems and were able to solve most of them. My biggest complaint was with our Apple rep. whose name was Isabel. She told many of us things that were not true and seemed to disappear when you needed her. The fellow, I do not remember his name was helpful. All in all it is what you make out of it and we all had a great time. Use the bottle water for everything including brushing your teeth and you should be ok. Take all meds with you as things are very expensive. I hope if you go you have a great time.

<Content>Great place to relax! A nice relaxing vacation overall. The Palace was very clean, and the staff very pleasant. It helps to brush up on your Spanish or bring along a Spanish dictionary. The room was plentiful; 2 sinks in the bathroom, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided. Mini-bar stocked with water, soft drinks and candies and refilled daily. A nice little veranda overlooking the beach. Any requests we made were answered promptly. Could use better, brighter lighting in the rooms and a few more throw rugs as the tile floor gets cold on your bare feet.The water was beautiful but a little cool this time of year. Plenty of water sports included in the all-inclusive package -- sailboats, paddle boats and kayaks. Plenty of lounges by the beach and pool. Swim-up bar in the pool. Drinks were plentiful. Be sure to visit all the hotels in the complex and eat at the variety of restaurants. The Italian place was the best and the only restaurant that offered smoking and non-smoking sections. Tipping also ensures very good, attentive service! Will definitely go back.

<Content>Not all that shines is gold! Stayed at the Palace last summer and had a nice time overall, however, I expected so much more since that's what all my friends had told me. The rooms were roach infested and not too clean. The pool was overcrowded and basically the service was average. The restaurants are not air conditioned and on hot summer nights the mosquitoes are the size of a horse.

<Content>Trip Just returned from a 4 day trip to the Dominican, where we stayed at the Bavaro Palace. We had a great time! The only problems we encountered were with check-in and checking out. Extremely slow...and when we got to our room, there was already someone in it! They took care of it right away and from that point on until we checked out we didn't have any further problems-it was just very slow again. Food was good-had heard the Seafood place was terrible, but we ate there twice and didn't have any problem. Also ate 1 night at the Casino and that was good. Otherwise ate at the buffet and that was fine. Never got sick-we just made sure we took 2 Pepto pills each day. People were helpful and tried to understand us since we do not speak Spanish. Maid service was fine-our room was always cleaned before noon. So we would go back again!

<Content>Pick another hotel Giardia lamblia (confirmed by a lab) that is what we got while staying at the Palace. Other fun highlights included (but not limited to):1. Our room was robbed 3 times in one week. While we were at the casino losing our shirts someone was in our room stealing our shoes! Items from our room included 2 pair of shoes and numerous items of clothing. Husband reduced to wearing red elf like shoes for the week. Other guest also had rooms robbed including money taken from SAFES. 2. Hotel management not available others not paid enough to listen to complaints. Maybe management took a raft to cuba. Ohla- ennnnoy! Funny how enjoy is pronounced so it sounds like annoy. Anyway when we told them about our missing items we could see that we ennoyed the staff. I emailed the mail office last Wednesday and have yet to hear anything from them.I have been to Punta Cana quite a few times and never had these sorts of problems and there is no reason why you should have them either. Try staying at Breezes, the Iberostars, Paridisus, The Princess much better service, food, rooms and no Giardia!!!

<Content>Perfect oh my god! it was absolutely amazing! the beach was perfect, white sand and clear water. the staff were all so nice and i loved the bartenders Henry and Osian. watch out because the drinks are made dominican style! Rrrrrum punch! it was a very fun time and definitely go on the outback safari, which gets you out of the hotel and into the country. hopefully i will be able to go back soon. pay no attention to the bad reviews because this place was beautiful. the only bad thing is coming back home.

<Content>Palace Great Lovely resort; went mid January 2003. You cannot avoid Montezuma's Revenge though. The room was big; damp but OK. The food (all inclusive) was average. The grilled lobster at the seafood restaurant was definitely the best. Extremely nice staff. Ask for a beach front room. We were in Building 5 and it was beautiful.
