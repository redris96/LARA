<Content>Just the best location MY husband and I and our two daughters have just returned from a 5 week trip the to the United States. Our last stop was Hawaii. This was the first time for all of us. We stayed 7 nights at the ResortQuest Waikki Circle Hotel. It was just fantastic.When we arrived at the hotel the reception people were just delightful and couldn't do enough to help. It was like family. In some of the larger hotels we had stayed in throughtout the states you were just another number.The room we had was on the 12th floor with an ocean view. Although it wasn't oceanfront it was beautiful. Loved the decor of the room. The balconies were great to sit morning and night.A complete surprise was the free coffee each morning in the lobby from 6.45am - 9.00am. A daily newspaper delivered to your door each morning.Great shampoo/conditioner and soaps in the bathroom each day.McDonalds was right next door which was handy with young children. There were shops and restaurants everywhere in the area. The ABC shops were just fantastic being on every corner. They are reasonably priced as well. The International Market Place was a short walk. The Zoo also a short walk in the opposite direction. Tour desk was very helpful.We have been back in Sydney for 1 week and we have already decided that we would love to go back for 3 weeks this year and spend Xmas again and extend to New Year. It was just the best location and a wonderful way to finish off our holiday.

<Content>great location and view The room was very clean and we had a great view of the beach from the 12th floor. My husband and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon and I can't wait to go back. we stay for 3 nights at this hotel before taking a 7 day cruise around the islands(ncl cruise line)then we stayed for another 2 nights before returning home. The hotel didn't have much to offer and it wasn't fancy but for the price it was great.I really loved the open outdoor concept in the lobby and the location was excellent. The beach was just across the street and close to alot of restaurants and shopping. I would sugest doing most of your shopping at the swap meet (flee market) which was about an hour bus ride away. We actually got off the bus at Pearl Harbor and walked to the swap meet. Prices were much better here then anywhere else..I would stay at the hotel again. It really was perfect for what we were looking for. A nice place to sleep and a good location if you wish to explore the area. The zoo was in walking distance as well as most things.

<Content>Paradise - Exactly!! My best friend and I stay there from Nov. 6-21/08. RM 604 Oceanfront - awesome. Staff very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was wonderful. Coffee in the lobby every morning with a newspaper delivered to your door - can't get any better than that. The rooms not too big - just right for the time you spend in it. Lanai was perfect. Vickie from the tour desk in the lobby was like a best friend within minutes of meeting her and she took care of us. Elevators you never really had to wait for. This hotel is the best - you're not just a room number like bigger hotels. Quaint and clean is what brings people back and we hope to get back some day. Thanx for the wonderful memories. Belle and Melodie

<Content>Such a deal! Absolutely, positively the most wonderful hotel experience in Waikiki. Reserved ocean front room and stayed in Room 404 first night. Requested to be relocated to a higher floor room by 2nd day and staff graciously moved all our luggage up to Room 1306 while we were busy sightseeing. Unbelievable ocean view from room! Rooms were small, but caused no problem since we could unpack suitcases and place contents on closet shelves, hangers in closet, or in small bureau under TV. Bathroom space was fine and shower water pressure was fantastic. Rooms were very clean and beds were fabulous. Best location in Waikiki and very SAFE area with police station just across street. Super clean beach across street with free cultural entertainment nightly. Staff were extremely friendly and laid back. Lobby also has a tour company representative behind another counter, who was quite helpful in arranging excellent day trips. The Circle was definitely a throwback to the 50's and 60's era, which was quite refreshing amongst all the high rise hotels, condos, and name brand shops. The ABC store next door was convenient and somewhat reasonably priced. McDonalds was a great stop for early morning coffee on the way to sunrise and surfer viewing across the street on the beach. Doesn't get much better!

<Content>Will definitely come back here! We spent 3 days of our 10 day stay at the Circle. We arrived late at the airport (10:30 pm) and hopped on the Airport Shuttle ($8.00 one way), the driver turned on a Hawaiin CD and we were off and a few stops later dropped at our hotel. There were 5 in our party so we had two oceanfront rooms on the 8th floor, I had asked for 7th floor or higher on the advice from TripAdvisor reviews. We were not disappointed - the views are fantastic, the accommodation is comfortable, plenty of towels, shampoo, soaps and lotions, room safe ($2.50 a day but gives you great piece of mind when you leave your passport etc behind), each with a balcony. Hula shows directly across the street and our last night a lone street musician playing guitar on the beach with his music floating up to our room. This spot is perfect - at the break of dawn people are out running, jogging, strolling, walking the dog, on their way to work, heading for the beach and you can watch the city start to come alive. All this while laying in bed reading your morning paper delivered to your door and drinking complimentary coffee supplied in the lobby each morning. The staff are very friendly and well informed. Even after checkout they will lock up your luggage until you are ready to leave the city. They provide use of beach toys, towels, you can lock up your surf board if you bring it with you all with a safe swimming beach directly across the street. We had two teenagers with us and they loved going to the International Marketplace, picking up a quick bite to eat, or strolling the beach on their own and could easily find their way back to the hotel. Everything is a short walk away. There was no room noise at all from other visitors and the rooms catch the ocean breezes. I would definitely recommend this hotel with its funky, relaxed ambience, great staff and location.

<Content>I'm Home! Just returned from a 3 week U.S.A. trip topped off with 5 days in Hawaii. We had stayed at The Circle 18 months ago and had been eager to return. We arrived at 8.00am from Vegas and checked in immediately. I was half-expecting a problem with the bookings because were using Entertainment Book Cards for a 50% discount, but all was correct  efficient. We were warmly welcomed and offered hot coffee. Obviously the rooms weren't ready, but the staff were happy to store our luggage  supply an area where we could change  freshen up. The girls took off for the shops for the day  the boys hired a couple of mopeds to do a bit of exploring. We returned around 3.30pm  the rooms were ready. Staff had changed shift and were as pleasant as the previous. A young porter eagerly organised our luggage and escorted us to our room. Imagine my surprise to be escorted to the same room we stayed in on our last visit. Room 805 - what a top spot! Beautiful views from this baby. Some friends that were staying at the Sheraton Princess stopped in for a couple of drinks on our lanai one night and announced Now this is THE SPOT. We smiled  nodded. They were paying nearly 4x what we were. Sure, their room was larger  they had a pool, but they wished they could swap with us. No way!Rooms were the same as last visit. You've heard it before:2 double beds, minifridge, desk  chair, safe, LCD tv on top of small chest of drawers, small mirrored wardrobe in end of alcove, wall air conditioner, small bathroom with shower only, 2 chairs  a drinks table on the lanai. No coffeemaking facilities in the room. It's ABC store next door or free coffee from the lobby in the morning. Want a pool? There's a huge one with waves out the front door and don't forget to pick up your free towel at the front desk.All of this was clean  tidy and housekeeping made sure it stayed that way for the duration of our stay. I was a bit off colour and slept quite late one morning during the usual housekeeping time. No problem. They returned in a few hours  tidied up while we relaxed on the lanai, finishing in just a few minutes. Should you need a laundry, there is one 2 blocks directly behind The Circle, coin-operated  it takes quarters. Our stay was as great as the first one and we look forward with enthusiasm to our next stay. The units are clean, comfortable budget accomodation on the inside and the best Hawaii has to offer your eyes from your lanai. Don't expect the Hilton - it's not. There's scratches  stains, chips  flakes. She's an honest old lady with a friendly feel. The only complaint I had was the aching pain I felt as I grudgingly boarded the airport shuttle.

<Content>You Get Exactly What You Pay For My husband and I have just come back from our very first overseas trip to Hawaii and stayed at the Circle for 6 nights.On arrival, we were given a room on the 4th floor and asked to be upgraded to a room a bit higher. Unfortunately they were booked out, but were able to move us to the 10th floor 2 nights later. If you are booking this place, make sure that you pay the extra money for an oceanfront room, it is so worth it. If you don't, you may not be able to upgrade as I think that the secret is out about this place, and it may be booked out. We spoke to other Aussies staying here, and they had all tried to upgrade unsuccessfully as there were no rooms left.Anyway, as others have said, view is to die for. You would struggle to get this view anywhere else in Waikiki for the money that we paid. It is lovely just sitting on the balcony and watching the world go by.The rooms are exceptionally clean, beds are very comfortable, the in room safe is handy to leave your valuables when you don't want to carry them around, but the room is very basic and very small. We didn't mind as we knew this from reading trip advisor reviews, but if you are looking for a bit of luxury you wouldn't stay here.We didn't find any noise from the rooms around us or from the street below, but we always pack our earplugs and we were so tired from being on the go all day that we just slept like logs.I agree with the previous poster that Vicki on the tour desk is fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and she ended up treating us like family. I quite enjoyed the Kona Coffee that the Circle provides free for guests every morning, and we made use of the free beach towels every day.All in all, you get what you pay for here - a 2 and a half star room that is very clean but very small, but what makes this place worth every penny is the 5 star view.

<Content>A tale of two hotels! A Tale of 2 Hotels!October 20th 2008The 鈥渇irst鈥?hotel is located in such a prime location you would expect to be paying huge prices, however the rates here were very reasonable. It is within a few steps of an ABC store in either direction so that gives you the opportunity of purchasing breakfast provisions daily, to eat at the beach or on the balcony if you prefer. It is directly across the road from the beach so in a few seconds you can be in the water or lazing on the sand, lying underneath an umbrella if you wish to pay the small hire fee. The hotel provides good beach towels which is very convenient, and saves on luggage space.The view is to die for, especially if there is a brilliant sunset, and to have an oceanfront room here is certainly one of the best views you will get in Waikiki. I am very fussy about cleanliness and this hotel meets my requirements and the toiletries are very nice, we even asked for additional and this was supplied without question.The beds are very comfortable, and the additional pillows we requested were placed in our room as soon as our backs were turned. The water supply is efficient and we enjoyed long hot showers. Fortunately, the towels are plentiful.As this is not a large hotel we had no time wasted waiting for lifts and there was always one available.The tour desk consultant, Vicki, was so friendly and knowledgeable; she was a real pleasure to deal with. Her contacts meant that our tours were fantastic and it was so easy to make them on site without the hassle of finding someone we could trust along the street front.The fridge was very efficient and meant that we could store our drinks and snacks to enjoy on our balcony each evening.The 鈥渙ther鈥?hotel we stayed at was very different. There was constant noise from people down in the street below all hours of the night and deliveries very early in the morning, even though we were on the 10th floor. Also, the noise from adjoining rooms indicated that the walls are very thin.The room is very small and we were never told that there was an option of a 鈥渒ing size bed only鈥?room, esp when we were just a couple. If you are in a room with 2 double beds, and anymore than 2 suitcases, you will find limited room to move around.The shower is small so if you are on the large size do not expect to have much room to lift your arms to wash, and the flimsy shower curtain does not prevent water getting all over the floor.Do not expect to be able to fit anymore than one person in the bathroom at a time, the sink juts out and makes a midnight dash slightly dangerous as there is not much room to maneuver. The shower towels are very, very thin, requiring the need to use several each time.By now I must explain that the 2 hotels are actually one in the same, just polar points apart! If money is no object then I鈥檇 assume you would not be making this hotel you choice of accommodation anyway. If you are budget conscious and prefer to allocate your holiday dollar elsewhere then this hotel may just be perfect. Also, many who holiday here do not spend much time in their room at all and if it is just to sleep at the end of another day in paradise, then this hotel would be quite appropriate.

<Content>Great location! We stayed at The Waikiki Circle for 4 nights in September 2008, in an ocean front room on the 12th floor.We thought this was a brilliant place to stay. The location was the reason we chose to stay here - you walk out the hotel lobby, cross the road and you are immediately on Waikiki Beach, right by the protected swimming areas in less than 30 seconds. And the views and sunsets from our balcony were unforgettable.The room was very clean, had excellent air conditioning, a small fridge, a safe that was easy to use (you had to pay for this), and use of an internet connection (you had to pay for this too). There were beach towels toborrow in the lobby. I liked the fact that the rooms were an interesting shape too!Overall, I thought this was an excellent place to stay at a reasonable price for Waikiki! I would definitely stay there again, and would definitely recommend it. (And I would recommend paying the extra for the ocean front room, and try to get a floor as high as you can!)

<Content>Amazing location and view I had read all the reviews so I knew the room size. It was a lovely room as I was travelling alone and would also be great for a couple. Any more and there might need to be a ballet to get all done in the space. But the room was light, bright, clean and I slept like a baby. I had 1004 with an amazing ocean front view and it was worth the extra money. I had vacillated between this and a more plush resort's city view and I know I made the best choice. That view was hypnotic and far more fabulous than any of the fancy priced ocean front views. The people working there were friendly and very helpful and the beach that this poor end of Waikiki had was far superior to that by the Moana Surfrider and that end. There were shops and restaurants all over and the zoo and aquarium were short walks away and a lot of fun. I will return and like so many of those who were checking in as I sadly left, I will be back at the Waikiki Circle. Thanks for making my stay so magical.

<Content>WE LOVED IT!!! Although a little small we found the room to be very functional and super clean.We were given an upgrade to an ocean front room which gave us a beautiful beach view from our lanai and made a great place to enjoy our complementary morning coffee and newspaper.We didn't stay in our room much other than early morning and late at night,but if we ever go back to Waikiki we will definitely stay at The Circle again.

<Content>Best Value in Waikiki My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 wonderful nights. This was our second visit to the Circle (and Honolulu) and once again, could find little fault.Yes the rooms are small but the convenience of staying in a hotel directly across from Waikiki beach with unobstructed views at the price they charge makes this hotel a little gem. The position of the hotel is perfect being right in the middle of the beach area.The staff and service are excellent. We also had no problems with parking.The only incident was a full scale fire alert at 3.30 am. Everybody quickly evacuated the building and after 30 minutes, we were back in our rooms. It appears some young idiot was fooling about with the fire alarms. This could have happened in any hotel. I'd hate to think how long it would have taken if this was a 500 room hotel instead of 100.Our favourite restaurant in Waikiki by the way, is the Californian Pizza Kitchen. Great food at a reasonable price.

<Content>Great View My friend and I stayed for 3 nights...staff was ridiculously helpful in getting info about the area, taxis, where to find the nightlife, great restaurants, etc. Rooms were tiny but view was super great! We had a city view which was great, and our room was to the side of the building so we also had a great view of all the surfers in the ocean! Comfortable beds, awesome tv... however the bathroom was small and the shower was old school. Overall a great stay.

<Content>Incredible View and Cute Little Hotel We loved the Waikiki Circle Hotel! I personally was really impressed with the history of the hotel and we really appreciated the little extras more than anything - really incredible shower soap, wonderful smelling lotion, the cute little fish next to the sink which we kept to remember our stay with, and the great seperate shampoo and condition. Most hotels these days provide low-grade extras that you wouldn't use unless you had to and you definitely would not take home, but I took home the items and I would actually love to be able to purchase more. The tour desk left something to be desired, the lady had kind of a thick accent and she was really brief when we asked questions so we just went off of our own ideas. The beds were comfortable and the shower heads had good pressure and were very functional. Plus you get a mini-fridge at no extra cost so that you can eat leftovers the next morning. You also get free coffee in the morning at 6:45 AM until 9 AM and it's delicious Kona coffee. All of the front desk clerks could tell you how to get where you were going and what bus to take. Also, they will hold your bags for you if you arrive before check-in and if you are not leaving until hours after check-out so that you can continue to explore the city. The air conditioning was wonderful. Most of the hotels I read about prior to booking with this one had comments from customers frustrated about the complete lack of air conditioning, but ours was great. We stayed on the top floor and had a ocean front room and the view was absolutely breathtaking. The location of the hotel on the street was great because it was close to Kapahulu where we often ate because of the cheaper prices and more authentic food. I highly recommend this hotel and when I return to Oahu in the future, this is where I am booking. FYI - Do not miss Ono's Hawaiian Restaraunt located just a couple blocks up Kapahulu Street on the left - it was incredible!!! And if you are going to hike diamond head - take the bus or a trolley, don't try to walk there, it's quite a ways. The Bodies exhibit is in town and just a trolley ride away until January 09 and it was really interesting although pricey - $24/adult. Don't take taxis/cabs! You can get a better deal by using the shuttle services that are available - VIP is the company we used most - $8/person from airport to hotel, $8 from hotel to Pearl Harbor, etc. We rode the city bus once and it wasn't a great experience. Do not order the pancakes at Mac 24/7, a restaraunt nearby. They are open literally 24/7 which is nice, but unless you have 5 people in your party, you will never be able to eat the giant pancakes they serve up. LuLu's was a nice restaraunt, although pricey just like all of the others on the strip in front of the beach, and it is just up the street toward diamond head from the hotel. Definitely get a burger from Burger In Paradise, right next to the hotel. Skip Haagan Daaz or other ice cream joints, you end up paying $6-7 for some ice cream. Room 1404 is the best view in the hotel. I will try to upload some photos later when I have my camera card.

<Content>Not Too Bad The view was excellent, you gotta pay $20 extra for the ocean view. There's no restaurant in the hotel. Rooms are small (we stayed in room 805). There was practally no waiting for the elevator so that was a plus. You can use the hotels beach floaties; they have several types. They let you check out a beach towel. They had surf boards too, but I didn't use one. Lots of beach stuff to use so you don't have to bring your own, rent or buy. Of course an ABC store is to the left of hotel as well as a McDonald's. Staff was courteous and friendly. This isn't a 4 or 5 (probably not even a 3) star hotel. Small showers. There was probably some light patch work that could have been done to the walls in the bathroom. Overall not a bad stay at all.

<Content>Paradise in Waikiki My partner and stayed at the Circle in March for 10 nights and loved every moment of our stay. Yes the rooms are a little small but the view and the location make up for it. And as for the shower I am 6 foot 3 and I did not have a problem. The staff at the front conter were so friendly and professional.Location location location.... beach at front door, resturants shopping and entertaining all so close to the Circle. Everyday we went on a tour the bus either picked us up directly infront ogf the hotel or we had a 1 minute walk around the corner to be picked up.I would highly recomend this hotel and we will be back very soon.Mahalo

<Content>Wow, what a view!!! We stayed here for 2 nights and while the rooms were small they were clean and the view can't be beat; we were on the 14th floor front  center to the ocean (1404)?. Oceanfont totally worth the xtra $$ (which by the way Entertainment book has an excellent rate!). Views fantastic! As the name indicates, the hotel is a circle so the rooms are unique. Beds very comfy but only doubles are available; coffee available in the lobby and fridge in the room. Staff were helpful and friendly. Parking rates a bargain at $10/night.

<Content>Great Location, Service, Access My family of 4 stayed for 6 nights. Best access to Waikiki beach, friendly and helpful staff, affordable given the prime location, easy parking, and free use of beach toys like boogie boards and inner tubes. I definitely would recommend it and will be booking my next stay at Waikiki at this hotel.

<Content>Love the Circle! I love the Circle hotel. Not only is it a landmark to tell your hotel from the others, it is still small enough that you can walk out of the elevator and down the steps to the sidewalk and straight across to the beach, and not far from the great spots on Waikiki! An ABC store is next door and the location is close to just about everything you'll want to do in Waikiki. The rooms are nothing special, but they are nice, clean, and they have everything you need. Get a floor higher than 5 as traffic can be a little noisy at night if you are oceanfront, but it's nothing serious. This is my second stay and I won't bother looking elsewhere...

<Content>A fantastic hotel ,a room with the best view R  C jones Melbourne Victoria AustraliaMy wife and myself stayed in this lovley little hotel with my brother , sister and there children ( 3 seperate rooms ) in may 2007. The hotel was very clean the staff were very freindly and helpful.I have read some negitive reviews about the circle and thought i would write my own positive one .Our stay was an experience that we will be repeating in may 2009. Our room was small but we only slept there , the beds were the most comfortable i have slept in . Every day we returned to our room which was cleaned as good as any hotel we have stayed in ,I loved the location ,the people and everthing about Hawaii.We have recommended this hotel to all our friends who have travelled to Hawaii. we look forward to our stay next year

<Content>Bit Average A very clean hotel and the beds were ok, the location was great and the views from the front spectacular, but thats about the redeeming factors of this hotel. Its old and the rooms are small and dated, but if that doesnt bother you, then this hotel is fine. Make sure you get a room with ocean view.

<Content>Think about it twice... or more. My husband and I went on vacation and stay at this hotel. If you are reading this review, you are just like us. We read good and bad reviews about this hotel. Still we decided to risk it鈥ust because of the price.The hotel鈥檚 location was great, that is for sure.But when you actually go inside the hotel you realize that you should have stayed at a different place. Just for starters: the elevator is terrible; it stops suddenly one floor before it finally stops at your floor. In fact the feeling you get is worst than the one you get when the plane is taking off. There are only two elevators. They are small and you have to wait a long time before they finally arrive. During the weekend you might not be lucky enough to catch the elevator鈥t will stop鈥?but filled with people鈥o after the 5th time you might want to use the smelly stairs鈥?br/> The rooms are very small. The shower is tiny. If you are claustrophobic, you should definitely not stay there; if you are not, you might become. The pillows were stinky. The bed and bed clothes didn鈥檛 feel clean.  If you open the curtains that鈥檚 it! You are not going to have privacy at all. The window didn鈥檛 have a separate set of drapes. The parking lot is very small and stinky. It looked like they had their own Petri dish in progress. You get a windows AC unit that you have to turn on when you get inside the hot room. We were scared thinking that it was going to get messed up by using it all night longIf you are thinking about staying at this hotel because of its location you can find tons of hotels that are in Kalakaua avenue and they are right in front of the beach. All of them have a great location.If you want to stay there and enjoy the ocean front view, (which is what we had) make sure to ask for one of the highest levels. On the one we stayed we couldn鈥檛 see that much because we were on a lower level, so it wasn鈥檛 great at all.You will get for sure a place to sleep, restroom, shower, and ac.Like I said at the beginning, we took the risk because it seemed less expensive and we thought we wouldn鈥檛 spend that much time at the hotel anyway. Still, it does make a big difference on your overall experience when at night you go back to sleep or rest in a place that it is not nice and clean.My recommendation is to stay at a different hotel. For a few more bucks you can stay at a nicer and cleaner hotel.

<Content>Great little qurky hotel We had a condo rental for a week at the Ala Moana  due to air prices it made sense for us to stay one more night. We asked our Travel Agent for a recommendation and she came up with the Waikiki Circle. If you are looking for an elegant hotel with large rooms and pampered by all sorts of services this hotel is not for you. if however you are looking for a nice clean room right by the beach with a great staff and reasonable prices this is a great pick.My 6th floor room had an amazing view of the beach  the sunset was wonderful.The staff was VERY helpful with ideas  suggestions.The rooms are a little old  the AC in some units I'm wagering can leave a lot to be desired but the pluses of this hotel far outweighed the minuses.Plus I thought the street noise would bother me a lot more then it did being on a main drag.Overall a fun place.

<Content>Great View Great location. Right in the middle of Waikiki. Beach just across the street. Hotel service was great. Rooms were clean but alittle small but if you were like us all you did was sleep there. The beds were soooooooo comfy. Would def stay there again and would recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Great location and excellent value The Waikiki Circle is in an excellent location, right on Kalakaua Avenue, opposite the main part of Waikiki Beach. Our room on the 14th floor was a 鈥渃ity view鈥?room with a small balcony. The room wasn鈥檛 large but certainly adequate, on a unique pie-shaped design. The decor was a bit dated but the room was clean and well-maintained.  The front desk staff was pleasant and efficient. All in all, we recommend the Circle as a great bargain for its location and level of comfort. We were there for only one night, as a stop on our way to Singapore, but we would definitely stay at the Circle for several nights on some future trip.

<Content>Great value Loved it. We were lucky enough to get the top floor ocean view on the Diamond Head side. The view was amazing, the hotel staff was super nice and you sure can't beat the location. We will definately return.

<Content>Do not stay here warning My husband and i are from Australia and stay here from the 15th of May for our honey moon. On our first night we went out for dinner only to return to have $3000 of our cash,my husband's passport and credit cardsall had been stolen from the safe in our room. When we rang down to tell the staff, they where very rude to us and told us to call 911. When the police arrived they found that the safe had not be broken open and only hotel safe had another key other then us for the safe in our room. The staff was no help and made as feel like liars.please do not stay at this place.

<Content>Great Location I had a one night stopover in Hawaii to break up my trip home from the USA as I have a bad back and had done a lot of flying in the past 5 weeks (round the world) and didn't want to sit on a plane for 14 hours or more! But also wanted a brief look at Waikiki and not just an airport hotel. The Circle Hotel was perfect.Not a posh hotel but a good price and great location and clean! Right on the beach and along with being on the beachfront I discovered the best place to eat breakfast! (who cares that there is no restaurant in the hotel when you find something better) Just go down a couple of blocks (towards Diamond Head) past Maccas and Burger King and turn left at Kalakaua Ave. There is a restaurant there called Arancino that serves an Italian buffet breakfast for $15. It was the best buffet breakfast I had in my whole 5 weeks away! If you meet a waiter there called Marc say hi from me - he is great.Was a great one night stopover....made even better by the taxi that picked me up to go to the airport - a stretch limo!

<Content>Another Great Stay!! This was my second stay at the Circle and it definately won't be my last!! Once again, the rooms were spotless, the staff friendly and helpfull, and of course, the view to die for. I would highly recommend paying the few extra $$ and getting the oceanfront view....well worth it. The location cannot be beat for shopping restaurants, transportation, or swimming. If you need swim toys or beach towels the hotel will provide them. I will be back for another stay as soon as possible!!

<Content>Location was greattttt, inside was not too bad The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. It was in the center of everything, and a few steps to the beach. I researched a few hotels before wanting to reserve this one. I thought the price was very good considering the location of everything.The rooms however, were another story. The air conditioner was noisy and sounded like it was about to breakdown. The shower was very small, just like the other reviewers said. I thought the bathroom looked ancient and it was tiny. Keep in mind I鈥檓 very petite, just imagine if you were a large person. I got the ocean view, which I admit was worth the extra money. If you are looking for a high-class hotel this is NOT it. I found the bed sheets to be a little on the sticky/dirty side. The room has a brand new flat-screen TV, which is about the only thing it had going for it. If you want a place to sleep and shower, then this is your best bargain in Wakiki Beach.The staff was friendly. There are free towels, so I thought that was pretty nice. They had limited parking available, but if you did get a rental, then the parking fee is $10/day to park. I would stay here again, but only for a few days, and no more. Overall, an excellent bargain for the budget traveler.

<Content>Best view for the price We stayed here for 4 nights in early May and found it just right for the two of us. Excellent price through the Entertainment Card with a 14th floor ocean front room which gave us spectacular views of Waikiki. (#1407 gives you a view of the Ala Moana Surfrider and the Pink Lady Hawaiian) This kitchy little hotel is directly across from a park so views of the ocean are fabulous. This part of Waikiki is where the surfers gather early every morning...what a sight. The rooms are small and it's kind of weird being in a circular hallway (!), but they are kept immaculately. The personnel on the desk are so helpful, even calling up maps on Google for us to take with us. Beach towels and chairs are free to use and, while they have no restaurant on site, there are loads of places within a few blocks. We loved the option to eat elegantly or quick and cheap. Parking was only $10 (a bargain in Honolulu) and you never had to wait to get your car or pay someone else to get it for you. Free paper and coffee every morning...Until I win the lottery, I would NEVER stay anywhere else.

<Content>location location location This hotel has one of the best locations in Waikiki. You're right on the main drag,across the street from the beach. Walking around the area, I saw all these fancy hotels that didn't have any beach front view at all ! Now if you're looking for a resort or spa hotel, this place is not for you. But if you are looking for a great place to hang your hat, while you're out enjoying the strip this place can't be beat. I was high up so the street noise wasn't a problem. The lifts are fast and I never had a problem parking under the hotel. Of course, get an ocean front room, and I think you'll enjoy your stay in Waikiki.

<Content>.We Loved The Circle We stayed at the Resortquest Waikiki Circle For 5 days in April. There were 9 of us so we had 3 rooms. All the rooms had incredible views of the ocean and the beach. The rooms were not as small as I was expecting from the past reviews I had read. Make sure to get the ocean front room as it was well worth the extra money. We got up early every morning to watch the beach slowly come alive with surfers, swimmers and joggers. Not to mention the ocean, it was beautiful watching the cruise ships in the distance and the waves hit the beach, all while still laying in bed. It doesn't get much better than that.The staff at the Circle were very friendly and helpful as was the lady at the tour desk, very helpful.Having been to Waikiki twice now there are other islands we would like to explore, but if we were ever to find ourselves in Waikiki I would stay at the Resortquest Circle again without a second thought.

<Content>Fabulous Location We had won a trip to Hawaii so they did our booking for us. The view was great, the beach 30 SECONDS walk!!!! Clean, tidy and the staff were just great. Esp Vicky at the Tour Booking counter she was awesome.The rooms are not huge but for a couple they were just fine. You are just sleeping there really ,you don't need alot of room. The Hotel is situated in a perfect place to find everything that you need.We had booked another Hotel to extend our stay before we left New Zealand and kick ourselves for having to change, we loved the Circle.

<Content>Great Location The best selling point for this hotel is its location. Close to everything you would need for a great holiday.We stayed in a partial ocean view on the 4th floor and it was fine. We spent a bit of time on the balcony and the view was OK. Yes the room is small but we had 4 people in the room (2 adults and 2 teenagers) and 4 suitcases (from travelling around USA for 3 weeks) and we fit fine. You just have to be organised and keep everything in its place out of the way. The bathroom was tiny but we managed. THe location and price far outweigh any size issues. You could borrow a range of chairs, tubes,beach toys etc for free which was great. THe staff were nice. THe lifts were really fast. THe only negative about the place was the fact that the lift is out in the open almost on the street and I was worried about security but we didnt have any problems at all.With an ABC store next door and the International Marketplace a short walk away everything was at your fingertips. Would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great little hotel I loved this hotel, yes it is a little small, but we had three people and had no problems. We had an ocean front room, which was great because we could just lay in bed and look at the beach. The rooms have a huge lanai with two chairs and a little table. Six nights a week there is a hla show across the street that you can hear and see a little if you have an ocean front room. The hotel itself is just adorable and well maintained. Housekeeping is very good and all of the people working the desk were friendly and helpful. They have a place out front to store surfboards that lock, they also have a locked room to store luggage if you have to check out a long time before your flight. There is an ABC store right down stairs where you can buy drinks and snack food. We spent so much time there they were sad on the day we had to go home.

<Content>Perfect Hotel for me! ResortQuest Waikiki Circle has everything one would want for a Waikiki vacation. Steps from the ocean, shopping, fast food, gourmet food, groceries, ABC stores, entertainment, safety.The rooms are kitchy, wedge-shaped, and #1407 has a nice ocean view. 1406 would be even better, if you plan on booking!Bed very comfortable, maid service impeccable and friendly, consierge prompt, courteous and helpful.Water pressure, hot water, and flushability just right!My shower had plenty of room: it is a shower, not a shower-tub combo, which some travelors might expect.I hesitate to sing the praises too much, for fear too many will book, and I might not get a room next time!!

<Content>Friendly staff, Small rooms I stayed in a partial ocean view room which had an ok view..could have upgraded to ocean view room but didnt think I was going to stay at the hotel for long anyway.I found the rooms to be very small there was no where to put your luggage. Its basicly just 2 double beds in the room and a tv not much space to walk or put any shopping its the size of a small bedroom. The bathrooms are tiny and the shower is like a little cave. I hated showering there.The staff are very friendly and they provide free towels to take to the beach. The hotel has no pool.To be honest its not that bad. The rooms are clean just I found them really small and have stayed at other hotels for better value money. Great location though for the beach.

<Content>great little hotel I and my two daughters (age 17 and 7) stayed here the last week of March. Booked through Priceline for a great deal from Chicago. We stayed on 14th floor toward back of hotel, not a great view, but we didn't care. The only thing was it was extremely windy on the 14th floor all the time, no matter what time of day. This hotel is really really small, but clean. We fit with no problem but by end of stay (1 week), walls were starting to close in.The location is excellent, just hop across the street to beach. Very helpful front desk, and the lady at the tours desk was also helpful. Housekeeping was excellent. Give them alot of credit for straightening up a room that was always messy due to size of room. Location is great, not too far a walk for any dining, shopping or entertainment. I recommend this hotel over anything directly on beach due to cost. I find it ridiculous what the expensive hotels charge compared to this hotel. You're not in your room 24/7. If you are you shouldn't be in Hawaii, you are missing out!!

<Content>Sardine Can ResortQuest needs to keep on the quest for the resort aspect of this hotel. We felt like sardines in a can staying here. There was no room to store our luggage, so we had to keep moving it out of the way to move around the room. We wound up just leaving it on the second bed. We had an excellent view of the neighboring hotels air conditioning units, as well as the sound of them all night long. This was only partially offset by the noise of the elevator that runs in the the center of the hotel for everyones audio enjoyment. The bathroom and shower were so crowded, you couldn't change your mind much less move freely.

<Content>Excellent Location, Excellent Value This hotel may be small compared to the mammoth hotel high-rises in Waikiki, but its location and price can't be beat. It is literally steps from the beach and the ocean view rooms (slightly more expensive than the other rooms) offer picture-perfect panoramas. The hotel's no-frills approach may not appeal to those searching for the perfect romantic getaway but it's great for families or friends spending a few days in Waikiki. Staff are extremely friendly  helpful. The hotel is also near Kapiolani Park Beach, a nice expanse of lawns  beach that offers more quiet  space than on the main strip.

<Content>Enjoying the view at Wakiki We stayed at Resort Quest last week and it was great value and a fantastic central location.We opted for the Ocean front room (most expensive) and ended up on the top floor. From here we watched the sunset, people coming and going on the street/beachfront, we could see the surfers, everything except for Diamond Head actually.The rooms was basic and tight, but as there was a desk and wardrobe around the corner it really was more than adequate.The shower was very small, but as the balcony was really pretty big overall this balanced everything out.There is no restaurant at this hotel, therefore you have to leave for all meals, but they do bring out the coffee urns each morning so take advantage. The front desk staff are helpful but were really only good at recommending the usual touristy eating venues!Tour desk staff were reasonably helpful.

<Content>Perfect for our short stay We stayed at the Waikiki Circle the first few days of March. Our family of four were in one room (2 small children) as we had a couple nights to kill before heading back to Canada. Spent the first 2 weeks in Kauai. When we checked in, our room didn't have a great view so we spent $10 more and got a beautiful view of Waikiki, and they even put us on the floor we requested. It is across the street from the beach and the location is fabulous. We didn't have to take a cab once. The staff was very accomodating as I needed my room cleaned after we left in the morning and b4 my infant needed a nap after lunch. Very helpful front desk staff. They have inflatibles you can help yourself for free on the way to the beach. A small room, but just for 2 nights, so we managed. I couldn't have lasted much longer. We would definately go again if in Honolulu for a short stay. The price is right on for what you get.Thanks for the great service Circle!

<Author>Confusedalways
<Content>Please stay here! Ok so after days and hours of searching and researching hotels in Oahu I decided on this one. Thank God! If you were like me and frantically trying to find a good place to go, PLEASE just stop and go to this hotel!The location is the absolute best! Right across from the beach, near all the shops, resturants, the Zoo and various public bus and tour pick up points. The rooms are not THAT small! Two people fit wonderfully in the space. Three would be ok and four might be too much...unless its two adults and two kids. The trouble with space when there is more than two people is trying to find a spot for the suitcase. But if you can make good use of the closet three people is fine. There is a closet to hang up stuff (if u have a lot of stuff to hang bring more hangers). Also there is a safe inside the closet which was very useful. There is a desk to put various things on, a good flatscreen tv with regular cable tv and movies you can rent. There are two double beds. If you are a large couple you may end up sleeping in different beds. We are a small couple and even ended up in different beds just so we could roll around more comfortably. However they have put in some Queen size beds. Which are only located on the 2nd floor, so if you want a room with a view you will have to give up the Queen bed. Now the dreaded bathrooms. A lot of ppl have commented on the bathrooms in this hotel. OK so, the bathroom itself isnt that small BUT the shower I have to say is very small. There is plenty of counter space for your things and enough room to have two people putting on make up or whatnot. The shower is not made for large people at all. Iam a small girl and I bumped my elbows many times. If you want to have a nice shower together...forget it. A small shower however isnt enough not to stay here.There is some noise I must say. I requested a high up room so that we were away from street noise. The street noise was much less however the noise from the a\c machine on the building next to us got much louder. I believe no matter where you are positioned that there will be some kind of noise. I would say the least noise might be the very Oceanfront top floor but alll you have to do is keep your sliding door closed and your own ac machine on.The maid service was excellent, fresh towels everyday. Front desk did their job well, and you get beach towels when you want them. The tour desk was also very good. I must say though that one of the ladies there was very very good! I reccomend trying to book things with her (Hawaiian lady) the other lady that was there got the job done but it was like pulling teeth (Chinese lady).So all in all this is the place to be. Good price for everything you get ,very well worth it and I had a great time. A couple tips not involving the hotel. Be careful with taxis. Some taxi drivers will try and scam you by offering you the same price as public transit to take you somewhere. This just cant be right. Another tip is to take transit as much as possible. Its $2 for one way no matter how far. Booking a tour to some places that the bus can take you costs wayyyy more. Use the bus to go to diamond head and hanuma bay. Ask the tour desk, they will tell you everything and if the bus can take you there. Another tip is plan your meals. One of the biggest problems we had was figuring out what to eat. In waikiki its either fast food or expensive restuarants. We did find a few places that had good food and wasnt expensive. One place is called The Cheescake Factory. Very good place...but VERY busy. Dont go at usual meal times like 12 for lunch and 6-7 for dinner.Ok iam sure I could ramble more but I think this is good. Good luck! And have fun! Its Hawaii!  P.S wear sunscreen!

<Content>Central Location Great customer service especially from the 2 old girls on the front desk. Really make you feel welcomed. Rooms were clean however small. Especially after already travelling for 6 weeks prior to arriving. If your a light sleeper the echo of noise from hallway can be a pain. Hotel is a great location with everything at fingertips, beach at front door an array of resturants, shopping etc. Down fall is that hotel doesn't have guest laundry facilities. Nearest is a couple of blocks away. Bathrooms also blocked up a few times, however maintenance was quick to respond and fix the problem, also in the high winds it played havic with the lifts as their no such foyer.Overall it was comfortable and served it's purpose for us being able to sleep in comfortable clean room.

<Content>Location, location, location! This older but renovated property across the street from the Waikiki Beach has nice clean comfortable rooms that feature HD flat panel tv's, memory foam double beds, large lanai's with two chairs  a small table, and a closet with extra shelving. Yes, the rooms are small and so are the bathrooms, but the friendly staff, complimentary newspaper  coffee in the lobby are nice features as well. You can also check out beach towels at the front desk. We really liked the convenience of the property location. Though we didn't get an ocean view room, we still liked our room very much. This was our 4th trip to Oahu, and this may be our favorite place to stay on the island, since it is minutes to the beach and a short walk to so many places we like to frequent, like International Market Place, Duke's, Hyatt, etc. ***If you are renting a car, you must notify them to reserve a spot, because parking is limited. Would like to stay here again!

<Content>Great value for a great hotel We stayed at the Waikiki Circle for 5 days pre cruise. This hotel was great! Right across the street from the beach. We had a 2 double bed room, which gave us an extra place to put luggage! Some of the room details need updating, but we didn't spend that much time in the room so it didn't bother us. We really enjoyed the lanai in the morning, as well as the complimentary morning paper and coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel and will return if I am ever back on Oahu.

<Content>Loved our stay! My husband stayed at the Waikiki Circle Hotel for just one night before heading off to Kauai. After a two long flights from Ottawa Ontario to Vancouver BC and Vancouver to Honolulu we were exhausted and ready to get some sleep. The hotel receptionists were very friendly and check in was a breeze. The room was very clean and the beds were sooo comfortable. It was so relaxing to open the patio door and sit out in the lanai and watch the people enjoying a warm Saturday night in paradise and listened to the music of the street performers. The next day we had several hours before we had to head back to the airport and the staff again gave us directions on where to go and suggestions of what to see that morning. I've read that some people have complained that the showers are small, but what makes up for it is the great water pressure! It was so refreshing...yes small, but not bad. Next time we want to spend a few days in Honolulu and plan to return to this hotel.

<Content>Ideally placed for Waikiki Beach We stayed here 14 nights over Christmas 2007.If you want a reasonably priced hotel overlooking Waikiki Beach, then this one would be hard to beat.It is, as its name suggests - a circle - a 14 or so floor tube of a tower, just over the road from Waikiki beach.The Ocean Front rooms have a splendid view of the beach and the Pacific ocean and are ideally placed to view those gorgeous Hawaiian Sunsets.The rooms are small by US standards. The twin bed rooms are as-described - Doubles - not queens - so your delight with these will depend on your normal sleeping arrangements.The, rare, Queen bed rooms seem a much better use of the space and, having tried both, we preferred the Queen bedded room.The Ocean front rooms and ocean view rooms do give the views as described. The other rooms look directly at the adjacent hotels.The hotel is situated directly in front of a nice, though busy, sandy part of Waikiki beach.The Hotel areas we visited were clean and, provided we could be sure of a Queen-bedded room, we'd be happy to return as it is, for Waikiki, and in that price range, a good location.

<Content>Another great stay at the Circle We stayed five days. Dec 19-24, 2007 This was my second stay at this hotel. I just love this hotel. It is a small hotel. The rooms are small as are the bathrooms but who cares with the view you get and the price you pay. All the rooms now have brand new big flat screen TVs. We booked a ocean front room and the view was incredible as usual. The elevators are fast. The employees at the front desk were so friendly! They have a place outside where you can borrow boogie boards, surf boards, beach mats etc. Pleople just leave what they have bought and don't want to carry home. It was nice not to have to buy a beach mat since I only wanted to use it a few times. This hotel has no pool but who needs a pool when you have the ocean right across the street. They have big fluffy beach towels you can borrow at the front desk. The bathroom has no tub just a shower and yes the shower is small but my husband is 6'3'' and he never complained. My only slight complaint is the bathroom floor needs a good scrubbing with bleach as the grout is getting very dirty. I just put a towel on the floor and felt better. I would have liked to have been double sheeted. I'm sure I could have asked and the maid would have done it but didnt want to bother her. I think what makes this hotel so nice is that it is small and personal not like the mega resorts in the area. I highly recomend this hotel. When I return to Hawaii I will again stay at this hotel

<Content>Charming Just Returned from a trip to Hawaii. Loved this charming hotel so centrally located. Stroll accross to the beach for a morning and afternoon dip. The rooms are small but contain everything you need and are clean and serviced well. Will go back again if development doesn't overtake this icon of a bygone era

<Content>Fantastic location Fantastic location. While this hotel is not the flashest in Waikiki by any stretch of the imagination, being directly accross the road from Waikiki beach, it is fantastic value for money. As per the other reviews the rooms are fairly small but how much time are you going to spend in your room anyway when the beach is calling from accross the road? I recommend you pay the extra for an ocean front room. We stayed on the 8th floor and the view and sunset are fantastic.....With our bottle of wine and cheese platter on our balcony (lanai) each afternoon watching the sunset we could have been at the flashiest hotel in town for all we knew !!!!The staff are very friendly and helpful and there is a travel desk on site which provides a lot of details on things to do and will book tours etc for you.I would definitle reommend this hotel to people who want a great location, a room that is clean and tidy and do not want to pay a million dollars for it !!!

<Content>Better than before! My wife and I stayed at the 'Circle' several years ago along with a short stay in another hotel, and repeated that sequence again. The Waikiki Circle was a little run down when we stayed before, but they have re-marketed themselves very successfully. Now falling into the category of a 'boutique' hotel. It looks like it never left the 60's, but in a good way. We chose an ocean front room for the excellent view. We found everything to be clean and comfortable, housekeeping was immaculate (they use 2 people working together, for speed or security I guess). The view is good from the 5th floor, but I wouldn't go any lower. The showers are still a little too small for me, but then I haven't lost any weight since my last visit so I guess that one is on me...Sitting on the balcony (lanai) watching people, the water and the sunsets. Well worth the price of admission to that show!Here's a hint: If you plan on having a car, make sure you make arrangements for parking. It is first come, first served and only $10 per day! Very small parking area under the structure.

<Content>Fantastic location, great views, helpful staff! My partner and I stayed at the Circle from November 30th thru December 3rd. The location was ideal, right in the middle of everything. The pie-shaped room was smallish as was the bathroom but who cares when you're only using the space to sleep and shower. The bed was very comfy and closet/drawer space was perfect. We had an ocean view room on the 3rd floor and it was great. If you book one of the other rooms and are offered an upgrade you should accept it. It's well worth it. The higher floors' view is much better but I'm afraid of heights and requested a lower floor.The world famous Waikiki beach is a very short walk right across the street. There are countless shops, bars, restaurants and ABC convenience stores right outside the lobby of the Circle. Your hardest decision is whether to go left or right. The shopping within walking distance ranges from cheesey tourist traps and roving carts to Louis Vuitton and Tiffany's. The eateries range from the familiar McDonald's to the raucous rooftop Tiki's Bar  Grill to very expensive and formal steak houses. My description of Waikiki is Miami meets Las Vegas...and I mean that in a good way.I've read some complaints about the parking situation and I can confirm spaces are limited. It seemed there are only spaces for about 8 to 10 cars. We had no problem finding a spot each night but our stay there was considered low season. It should also be noted the Circle does not have a pool and the onsite restaurant has been closed down for some time. But you can make arrangements with the front desk to use the pool at the adjoining ResortQuest property if you absolutely must go for a chlorine dunk rather than a dip in the warm blue sea. As for the restaurant being closed -- you won't even notice with the countless choices all over.I would highly recommend the Waikiki Circle for my clients on a mid-level budget. By the way, I took lots of pictures but decided not to post any because they look exactly like those already posted :)Aloha!

<Content>Good value for the money I stayed at the Waikiki Circle for a few nights prior to heading to Maui. I read many of the reviews prior to settling on this one. As a travel agent I've stayed at a few hotels over the years. I found the reviews to be a little generous. The staff are nice and it's hard to beat the location. Just make sure to get an oceanview or oceanfront room or you might be looking directly into a suite at the hotel next door. If they've got extra rooms you can typicaly upgrade at a cost of $10.00/ night at the front desk at check in. I went from an oceanview to an oceanfront on the 12th. floor and was impressed with the view. If you don't care that the rooms are VERY BASIC then this hotel is just fine. Shower was tiny, but all in all I had a plesant stay.

<Content>Great value in a terrific location This is the place to stay if you go to Honolulu to experience Waikiki and the busy nightlife - and just sleep in your hotel. The beach couldn't be much closer or more convenient, and neither could the shops, restaurants, etc. We didn't stay long in Honolulu as we only passed through to see a couple of things before moving on to the Big Island. The rooms are small - yes. It's definitely best suited to couples, very good friends and singles. But it's a clean and convenient place to sleep. I'd definitely aim for the higher floors as it's a very busy street. We had a partial-view room and that was fine with us. Definitely recommended for those who'd like to spend their time (and money) somewhere else than their hotel.

<Content>love this hotel This is the second time we stayed at the Circle and both times where great. The hotel is right opposite the beach ( less than 2 mins walk). The hotel has complimentary float ons. The rooms are fine for two people and are really clean. The staff at the front desk, housekeeping etc are all lovely. They all treated us like family. The hotel has been in the one family since it was built and has a long history in Waikiki. This makes you feel less like a number like at some of the other hotels. There is a complimentary paper each morning and free kona coffe in the foyer. All the rooms have flat screen TV's and are safe and secure. It is ideally located next to an ABC shop and close to McDonalds and some great restuarants like Tiki's at the aresortquest waikikii beach hotel. its a short walk to the bus stop and most of the shuttles stop 5 mins away at the Duke statue on Waikiki Beach. I recommend booking your trip to Waikele ( factory outlets) at the tour desk plus talk to them about all your tour requests - they are really helpful. I will be definately staying there again next year.

<Content>great location My sister and I stayed at this hotel from Oct 26th - Nov 2nd. We were impressed with the location. And it was CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. Everything you could possibly want was here. Although the rooms were very small, they were quite accomadating for both of us. The beds were super comfy and the view was outstanding. Hot coffee in the lobby was just fine for us, the mini fridge was big enough, the new flat screens were a bonus, but we hardly watched them. We were out and about, what you should be doing in Waikiki. Tip the housekeeper, they do a great job! The only thing I didn't like was the teeeeeny shower. Look out, you'll bang your elbows when you wash your hair!! The tour desk was great, but if you book the Arizona tour, it doesn't include the Mighty Mo or the Bowfin, just not enough time to do that and there is an extra cost. Also, if you would like a little break, take the Circle island tour, and you don't have to rent a car, I highly recommend it. The next time I come to Waikiki, I will definately stay at the Circle again!!

<Content>Great value, great location My wife and I recently spent two nights at Resortquest Waikiki Circle hotel. From the outside, it looks very tired and dated however the location is unbelievable. It's in the heart of Waikiki, with nothing in front apart from it and the beach. We were offered an upgrade to an Ocean view room for $10 extra per night which we took. Good decision. We stayed on the 5th floor . The views are stunning. Our room had two double beds, not my preferred option as space is tight however that's where you put all the bags. The bathroom was on the small side but very functional. The reception is manned 24 hrs with helpful staff. Our only problem was the TV but it was fixed very quickly.The room was clean with a decent size TV. For the money we paid, you won't get a better value room in Waikiki. If your'e looking for a clean 3 star hotel in a terrific location, look no further.

<Content>best choice for waikiki great location! great view from the balcony! (make sure you pay extra for the ocean view).right across the street from the beach, and right across from where they do hula shows at sundown. lots of restaurants, fast food, and shopping.it costs 10 bucks a night to park under the hotel, but it's very convenient. everything was spotlessly clean, and comfortable. they even had beach toys to borrow, like boogie boards, air mattresses and beach towels. the only thing i would complain about is the coffee. it's not ready until 7 am, and kind of weak. but having a mcdonalds next door solved that problem. anyway, my husband and i loved this hotel, we'd surely stay here again!

<Content>excellent value It was our first time to hawaii and for the location and view, it was excellent. value. The only problem we had was the humidity in the room. The room size was a bit small and the bathroom was old. Apart from this, I don't think we could have gotten a better value for our dollar elsewhere along the waterfront.The front desk staff was really friendly and met our needs in a timely fashion. Definitely would stay here again and highly recommend it.

<Content>BEST DEAL, BEST LOCATION This hotel is the best value for your money. It is located across the street from Waikiki Beach, next to expensive hotels. The location cannot be any better. Staff was very nice. The rooms are a bit small, but adequate for 2 or 3 people. Not luxurious, but who needs it if you will be out and about most of the day. We booked a regular room (the most economical) and we were upgraded to ocean view. It was the best. There is a free night show across the street every night we were there and we just sat outside of our balcony to see it. The hotel offers free use of their beach toys, which is great when traveling with children. There is a McDonalds and ABC Store next door. I saw some very expensive hotels located 1 or 2 blocks away with no ocean view like this one and I could just imagine their cost. This is the best value. I will definetely stay here again. Also the parking is so economical ($10/day) compared to the hotels next door (almost $30/day). You can't go wrong. You will save a lot of money to wine and dine in wakiki instead.

<Content>Loved it!! This is a budget hotel (so don't expect fancy) but for the price it has to be the best place to stay on Waikiki Beach. Rooms: clean, small, upgrade to oceanview. Perfect size for two people (3 would be tight). I would suggest floors 5 and above to get the best view. Truly, the rooms are not fancy but they provide everything you need.Staff: very friendly and helpful. The staff at the excursions desk was particularly good.Amenities: parking right there. Floats, boogie boards, surf boards are all right at the front entrance and you just grab them and cross the street to the beach. Very handy!!! ABC store right next door as well as a McDonalds. Coffee in the lobby every morning.Beach: very nice, directly across from the hotel is a very protected swim area within a sea wall, to the right and left are more open areas of beach. For a change, walk down towards the Honolulu Zoo (5 minutes) and there is beach in front of a beautiful park with great shade trees. It's a nice change from laying on sand.Excursions: nothing to do with the hotel but FYI we booked several excursions through Hawaii Activities (online). 1. Kailua Kayaking tour was nothing special, I woudn't spend the money on it. 2. If you are truly interested in WW2 history book the Pearl Harbor Home of the Brave tour (Pearl, Wheeler Field, Schofield Barracks, Fort Shafter with lunch at the Officer's Club, Punch Bowl Cemetary and Home of the Brave Museum). It's awesome.3. We hiked Manoa Falls (breathtaking) and Diamond Head (go early in the morning, we had no crowds). Warning about Manoa Falls--apparently it's usually dry this time of year (we got lucky because of the hurricane which brought some rain to make it flow). 4. Hawaii Shark Encounter was the coolest thing I've ever done. My 10 year old and I did it. Highly recommended. 5. The Honolulu Zoo and the Aquarium are a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Both were great.I would definitely stay at the Waikiki Circle again. Completely adequate accomodation, great location, great price!

<Content>1st timer  1st timer to Hawaii and 1st timer to use of a travel service (Pleasant Holidays) so that is how I found this ResortQuest property. I hope my 1st time to the Waikiki Circle will not be my last - I'd make this hotel my choice if staying in Oahu again.I'll second many reviews here with these essentials from my seven day stay:If you are 2-3 people in one room, appreciate cleanliness, helpful service from office staff  housekeeping (suggestions to local eats, extra towels requested and received everyday, generous with soaps and shampoos etc, smile and aloha spirit consistently every day), plenty of beach toys, boogie boards and surf boards and beach towles to use; if you love a central location to restaurants, shopping, activity centers, and of course Wakiki beach and all it has to offer....this is the place! Parking is right there and never had a problem - they even have extra parking at sister prop next door if there is an overflow.If you haven't already - take the upgrade (for $60.00 for one week when we check in they asked) and get a full front ocean view. We had the 11th floor - it was fantastic....no noise, the lanai was our central place for breakfasts, people watching and snacks/drinks under the stars. Sunrise and sunsets....beautiful.Yes the bathroom is small. Believe me - you can deal. Flush, wash, brush and shower - how long are you in there anyway?Rooms are clean. Beds are comfortable. Closet space is adequate (we had six bags and did just fine - you have floor space in room). Safe in closet - like a $2.00 fee a day - small price for peace of mind. Refer a plus, small but you drink and eat everyday or so, so just step outside and restock - ABC stores and Foodland/Big Save supermarkets abound!New wide screen flat TV's just installed - I think we had it on like five minutes each day (to see it rain back home in the Northeast HA!)....see the island instead! Elevators worked just fine - no slowness or breakdowns. Rooms were quiet - no room to room noise. Yes there is no restaurant on site - but there are like 400 around you, yes there is no pool, but - uh....the Pacific is right across the street and it's the biggest pool you can imagine! Even have a calm kiddie pool (walled breakwater - directly across the street) for you that like it calm. If that's not enough beach for you - go left - go right - plenty.Consider this:Beautiful viewsIn the center of Waikiki action and conveninceWalk across the street in your bathing suit and - go swimming, boogieboarding, surfing, outrigger canoe rides, catamaran sails, see the free shows (hula/music etc).Walk a few blocks to the right and go to the zoo, botanical gardens, parks, more beaches, more shopping, more food.Walk a few blocks to the left and do it all over again with different beaches, eats, stores, parks.Drive a mile and hike Diamond Head. Drive a mile and be on Highway 1 East or West your access to anywhere on Oahu.15 minutes on HW1 to Pearl Harbor, Honolulu sites (Iaoni Palace, Chinatown, Aloha Tower, Airport etc). 10 minutes on HW 1 to Napali Highway and explore East Oahu. Coastal Drive right past Diamond Head - keep exploring! North Shore....PCC...it's all doable from easy access and believe me - traffic is NOT that bad on highways or in Waikiki. Take it from this Boston/NYC vicinity life - this is NOT traffic. You are in Oahu - Waikiki - vacation.....take in the sights, sounds and smells - chill out in steady 80 degree temps, then sit on your lanai in the PM and watch the waves.... The next time can't come fast enough. This is a great spot.

<Content>Anniversary stay We live on Oahu but decided to spend our 19th wedding anniversary at the Waikiki Circle Hotel. We had stopped in a couple of times and were able to see a room each time we visited. The staff is the friendliest we've come across in a long time, especially Naomi and Steve. We requested a high floor, ocean front because the view cannot be beaten. It's true, the rooms are small, however, there is a refrigerator and a large closet with a mirrored door. They are tastefully decorated, bright and have been updated with 32 HDTV televisions. It was clean and didn't smell like other reviews had mentioned. The bathroom is also small but there is some exaggeration with regard to the size of the showers, my wife and I managed to both fit quite well at the same time.

<Content>What a Great Location! We stayed at The Circle July 13th through the 15th. It was wonderful. The rooms are not big, but they are clean and well maintained. You probably won鈥檛 be spending a great deal of time in the room anyway. When we checked in, we were offered an upgrade from an Ocean View to an Ocean Front room for an extra $10 a night. If you are offered this upgrade 鈥?take it! Better yet, just book the Ocean Front room to begin with. The view of Waikiki Beach is just spectacular. It may be the smallest hotel on the block, but it has a great view and is significantly more affordable than the others. The staff was also polite and helpful. We would certainly go back there given the opportunity

<Content>Good value for your money We stayed here at our last night in Oahu. This was no Hilton hotel, the rooms were small; stand up shower only, but for a place to sleep, stash your stuff and take a quick shower it was a great place to stay. The facilities were clean and generally well maintained and the front desk was more than helpful and accomodated us with above average service. You cannot get a better location in Honolulu with the hotel being less than a 2 minute walk across the street. Recommended for couples not fussy about 4 star facilities.

<Content>Good short stay We had a short stopover on the way to the States and didn't want to spend too much. We selected this property for its price and location immediately opposite the beach. We were not disappointed. The location is great! The rooms are small and the shower is a tight squeeze, however we upgraded the room to get a view of the beach and that was why we stayed here.If you are after a longer stay, I would recommend paying for a better hotel. However if you are single or a couple then the rooms would be fine for short stay. Too small for a family.

<Content>I cried when I saw the rooms..=( My mother arranged a package for our family since my sister was getting married in Hawaii. I knew there was something wrong when she mentioned the package price but I didn't want to push her since she had to fund the trip for others. This hotel is dwarfed by all the other hotels, we drove past it twice! As soon as I entered the room I sat on one of the beds on wheels and cried. The rooms are budget, each has 2 beds no single bed options - definitely not the honeymoon place. I wore my flipflops in the shower because the tile looked dirty and the mattresses are quite old and uncomfortable. There is no tub just a small standing shower. The biggest perk was the gumball machine plastic fish decoration in the bathroom, the TV was tiny, the patches of plaster on the wall didn't do much for the room. I couldn't bear to leave my family there and go elsewhere even though my husband offered so we choked it up like troopers and consider it an adventure. Good location though!

<Content>Okay hotel This was an okay hotel nothing wrong with it. We just stayed overnight and I don鈥檛 think it would be great for a longer stay. It is very near the beach and on the main street so very accessible

<Content>Best little secret in Waikiki My husband and myself just returned from our 38th anniversary trip to the Waikiki Circle. We had such a great time, this wasthe first time at the Waikiki Circle and we enjoyed every minute of it.I would go back there today. The staff was wonderful, especiallythe two ladies, our room was just as it was pictured at the video.We had a ocean front room at the 13 floor and the view wasjust super. The housekeeping was good every day, yes the bathroom is small, but the little dressing area with mirroredcloset made up for it. The hotel is in the middle of everything,ABC stores, McDonald is next door, restaurants etc. Coffee wasin the Lobby every morning at 7:00 AM. If we go back to Hawaiithere is no other place than the Waikiki Circle where we would stay and for the price, whatelse is there.

<Content>Perfect vacation destination My two twenty-something children and I just spent seven wonderful days at this fun hotel across from Waikiki beach. We found the accomodations to be just right and a perfect choice for our fun island getaway. Upon arrival we were charmed by the adorable outdoor lobby area. The staff were accomodating and always available to help with extra bath towels (we used a ton of these). The view from our 14th floor ocean front room was breathtaking, and unforgettable. I can not wait to return here and I would not hesitate to stay at the circle again. Location, location ,location. This hotel won't dissapoint!

<Content>Not bad for the price Just came back from a 5 night stay at this hotel. As other reviewers have stated, the rooms are definitely small, but it's doable for two people. The size of the bathroom is equivalent to those of the cruise ships'. As an average-sized person, I banged my arms against the wall every day while showering. Our oceanview room had a view of half the ocean which to me should really be considered a partial oceanview. There was some paint peeling from the ceiling. This hotel charges for using the in-room safe which still uses a key lock instead of a combination lock. But overall, the hotel was not bad for the price we paid. It's conveniently located with the beach across the street, restaurants and shops nearby and the bus stop just a block away on Kuhio Ave. If you just need basic accommodation with a nice view, this is the place. If you want something fancy, look elsewhere.

<Content>Great Views and Value for Money My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in April 2007. Having scoured the net for accom in Waikiki this hotel seemd to offer an excellent location without a $$$$ price tag. We paid the internet rate of Us $184 + tax for an ocean front room on the 13th floor and considered it good value. The view from the balcony was spectacular and the room though somewhat dated was very clean. Just to put the size of the bathroom in perspective it was small but about average size for an ensuite bathroom in a European capital city hotel of the same category (say London or Paris). If you are a accustomed to a hotel with loads of onsite facilities this may not be the place for you but if you want value for money in a stunning location the Waikiki Circle could be what you are looking for. We would not hesitate to return

<Content>Cute little hotel, big on location. I just returned from a great stay at the Resortquest Waikiki Circle. I had an idea of what to expect after reading the reviews on this website. I booked a partial oceanview room and stayed for 4 nights for a girlfriend getaway. The rooms are very small. Between us two girls, we had our stuff strung out all over the place and hardly any room for suitcases. The shower is so small. Normally this wouldn't matter, but every time you took a shower, the whole floor would be soaked. Ladies: you have NO room to shave your legs. You have to rest your foot on the toilet paper holder or toilet to get the job done.Location is everything in Waikiki. This is one of the best locations for the hotel to sit. Not to mention even the partial oceanview had a fantastic view of the ocean. The staff is very friendly and courtious and will go out of the way to help you. (I left my swimsuit out to dry and it blew on top of their shed. They went and retrieved it and returned it to me ASAP.)I liked this hotel but if my stay was longer than 4 nights, I would look elsewhere. A family of four probably would not fit comfortably.

<Content>Bummer...Forced to stay another night!! We stayed our last 2 nights here on our 2 week island tour!!There were 7 of us in 3 oceanfront rooms. Gramps chickened out  had to be moved down a few floors...to the 2nd floor,  our other room asked to be moved down from the 14th floor down to Gramp's old room on the 8th floor! ......Chicken's!!Rooms were small, but comfortable. I woudn't advise 3 in a room like we did...kinda crowded... due to all the ~extra'a~ that we had accumulated! When we were supposed to leave, we were informed that American Airlines had cancelled our flight due to bad weather in Chicago, so were forced to spend another night in Waikiki!! How unfortunate!!! ...NOT We were thrilled,  very thankful for Waikiki Circle for being so accomodating to us  let us have our rooms another night.

<Content>Clean, basic, good accommodation We stayed at the Circle for 3 nights in April. I choose this hotel from brochures because of the location and the price. I was a little disappointed when I first arrived. The rooms are quite small and getting a bit tired. But they were clean - the bathroom clean and the linen on the bed clean and fresh. I guess the rooms are very simple and if you like a bit of luxury, I wouldn't recommend it. The views are great (ask for a ocean front room!!), you can see the sunsets, beach and the street below. However you can't see Diamond Head. When you are sitting on the balcony (we were on the western side) all you can hear is the air conditioner from the building below (very annoying!)The location of this hotel is perfect - straight across the road is a great swimming beach and you have all the shops you need within walking distance.I wouldn't stay here again, I would choose another hotel that was maybe a three or four stay. But hey, if you don't really care for 'all the extras' it would make a great place to stay.

<Content>Good Value for Beachfront Hotel If all you want is a place to sleep and a place right on the beach, then this hotel is for you. We paid $140/night and stayed for 6 nights and we were OK with the hotel. The staff was nice, the balcony view was nice, but the room was sub-par. Very small, no tub, shower only. The elevators were broken every day we were there, making difficult to get to our room or the beach.  Overall, when we go again, we will spend a little more to stay at a nicer hotel.

<Content>Excellent location for the price We stayed in room 705, Ocean front view, from April 19-22. We booked our vaction package through Northwest Airlines after reading several reviews here. The hotel staff was very courteous and friendly. Hotel location was excellent since it was in the middle of everything. The room was small and the bathroom even smaller, but the view was great. Noise wasn't an issue unless you wanted to sleep with the lanai door wide open. My only complaint was that our room did smell damp/moldy or mildewy when the air was turned off and the lanai door was closed. We just kept the fan on Low while we were away and that seemed to help a little bit.

<Content>Best little property in paradise This was our second year at the Circle and still, everything about this hotel make it the best place to stay in Waikiki, from the staff, to the room, to the location, to the price. All these features rolled in together make the Circle so memorable. You will hear some complaining about the size but doesn't the saying go size doesn't matter. Have stayed in many other larger and fancier hotels and spent half my holiday just waiting for a lift. You don't get this at the Circle - small and friendly and just perfectly priced and located.

<Content>Beware of Breakfast Coupons The room was very small but adequate for one night. The rub is the downloaded breakfast coupons. You have to read what you are getting! It is a breakfast orientation (sales). The vendor is MCA. The hotel does not have a breakfast. You can walk to several breakfast fast food vendors near the hotel.

<Content>Simply the Best! We've stayed in the Waikiki Circle 6 of the 7 times in Waikiki and love it. It is right on the beach, next to the gym, close to great restaurants. We stay in ocean front rooms so the views are fantastic. The staff are great - particularly the lady who works during the day - she did everything she could to get us better rooms. The lower rooms at the front can be quite noisy - especially at festival time when the equipment is dropped off really early in the mornings but the festivals are well worth it. We love this place.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay but had trouble with staff We stay at the Circle for 4 nights in the middle of Feb. We had booked this stay back in Dec. and made special arrangements to make sure that our Ocean Front room was 8th floor or higher for a better view. Our flight was 3 hours late coming in so we called the hotel to let them know when we arrived in town and to hold our room for us. we were told no problem so we went out to eat at Duke's first and checked in around 11:30pm. The night clerk put us on the 3rd floor, one of the lowest ones in the property. When I asked why we were not given the room I was promised, we were told it was because we checked in so late...1st come...1st serve. I then said, but we called and booked 8 or higher, we were then told, it doesn't matter. I was told to come down in the morning and ask to move. I asked to be moved everyday we were there and told they had nothing higher. On the next to the last day we were there I went to open our door of our room, IT WASN'T EVEN LOCKED! The housekeeper never closed our door all the way and all of our stuff was right there for anyone to steal if they even tried to just push the door open. I then hit the roof, between this and them not changing our room, I kind of lost it with the desk clerk and told him just what I thought of the uncaring staff. It wasn't until then that he said now MAYBE in the morning again they MIGHT have a higher room...MAYBE, but we would have to hang around and wait and see in the morning, wasting more time. He offered us a room on our last night on the 11th floor even though he had one on the 14th floor and even after all of this didn't want to give us the highest floor. I could have been missing a LOT of property from the unlocked door but never claimed anything was missing, thank God it was not and the housekeeper did apoligize, mistakes DO happen but the front desk help here could really care less to help out guest.Great location, super views from top floors,bad service from front desk...stay here again..NO WAY Jose!!

<Content>Best Hotel in Waikiki for The Price My Husband and I stayed for 2 weeks over the New Year and had a fantastic time. We stayed on the top floor with an ocean front room which was breathtaking. The rooms are not that small and there are 2 double beds. The bathroom was small and clean and the shower was fine, unusually shaped which I liked. You cannot fault this hotel for the price. All the staff were fab and the towels were soft and fluffy. I miss everything about this hotel and cant wait to return one day. If you want a clean hotel in the best location but dont want to spend the earth, then stay here as you will not be dissappointed.

<Content>We will be back in heartbeat! LOVED this hotel. While it's not one the fanciest and could be one of the smallest...you canNOT beat the location, the view and even the staff! The value compared to other beachfront hotels is second to none...why would you pay more for a beach front fancy hotel when this Waikiki Circle has the same beach front?! From check in to check out the staff was superb! Very knowledable and accomodating. You can use their beach toys and not have to buy or rent any. The beach is RIGHT across the street! Stores, stores and more stores all within walking distance (the beach strip reminded us of the Vegas strip--always bustling and things to see). We also upgraded for a minimal price to a beachfront room and the view was AMAZING. Sure, rooms may not be as spacious as other hotels, but who cares!? The view people, the view! Shower is small but bed is comfy. Room is small, but we used the other bed as a luggage rack. We made it work. The hotel did not seem crowded at all and we never had to wait for an elevator. The first night for parking we had to park at their sister hotel which was about 3 blocks away, but they told us to call the front desk first thing the next morning and they would save us a spot in their parking lot. So we called the next morning and got it. Easy as pie. I was surprised at how easy it was! Seriously, for the value and location, you cannot go wrong at this place. You are in HAWAII, you shouldn't be holed up in your room anyways! As long as there is a bed and shower, that's all you need. We will be back and we are so glad we choose this hotel.

<Content>Stay here!!! This little hotel is terrific - you don't walk city blocks to get to your room - it was just steps away from the very speedy elevators.Rooms were clean and comfortable and if you use the closet, there is lots room for your luggage. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom and shower were exactly the right size for what you need to do there. Staff is friendly and helpful and the hotel has great beach towels,mats, and water toys for all to use. The view from the oceanfront rooms is second to none ! Great shops and restaurants are close at hand without paying the big bucks to have all their patrons hanging out in your hotel. We loved the location and the uncrowded size of The Circle. We would go back there in a heartbeat . Miss my oceanfront lanai already and have only been home one day!!!! You won't be sorry if you choose this great spot!!!!!

<Content>Can't beat the view - not enough room to change your mind. The rooms are tiny... we were challenged by where to put our suitcases, but cute. The amenities are minimal... one of the tiniest showers I've ever seen. I have agree with many others on this site, the location is excellent. When we arrived the desk offered us a full ocean view for minimal $$ and it was really worth it. You are right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but across the street is a public beach park which gives you unobstructed view of the ocean, sunrise, sunset, diamond head, surfing school, and the ongoing tourist parade. We could walk to the international market, the waikiki aquarium and had easy access to public transportation. All kinds of restaraunts were within a 3 block walk ranging from McDonalds to the revolving top of Waikiki. Room was clean and well maintained. What more do you need?

<Content>location, location location Highly recommended hotel if what you are looking for is basics with little frills. Clean, cute rooms, surprisingly comfortable beds, and quiet. I would suggest an ocean view room as the other rooms face directly into buildings behind you and you feel a little looked in on by the neighbors to the rear. Jan is a nice lady at the front desk and the tour agency was quick to find mopeds and taxis for us . Very centrally located. If you have a late returning flight, this hotel offers no transient room. However for 80.00 more we were able to keep our room until 10 that night.

<Content>Location Location Location We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We stayed at the Circle 5/10 - 10/10/06. Oceanfront room with balcony on the tenth floor was everything we could hope for from the beautiful sunsets over the ocean to the hawaiian entertainment every night right across the road. Room was small but compact and clean. We would definitely stay here again. We have recommended this hotel to others for the value and location.

<Content>Great hotel This hotel puts you right in the middle of everything. Perfect location. The room is smaller than normal but is fine for 2 people. Shower is small but similar to one on a cruise ship. The staff are great. Very clean. Anyone coming to Waikiki is not going to be in their room much so it should not be too much of a concern. Has a great little desk area for your computer and nice size closet. Balcony. Great views. You would not go wrong here at all.

<Content>Really is Oceanfront! The Resortquest Waikiki Circle hotel is an older property, and has small bathrooms, but it makes up for it in its location and view!We had two rooms (803  805), which were both oceanfront. I recommend that you ask for rooms that are -04 (e.g. 804, 1004). They are direct oceanfront. Our two rooms had a slight angle, and were not quite as nice as the -04 room. However, rooms that are 03-05 in number have incredible views (The 05 room would be second choice!). Go to the hotel's website. They offer e-special rates that are the lowest prices available.The rooms all have double-beds. The staff was very kind to bring up a rollaway, extra blankets and sheets, with no additional charge. In fact, the staff was very profesional, helpful, knowledgeable, etc.The bathrooms are the size of bathrooms on cruise ships. There is no tub, just a shower. However, even for a big guy, such as myself, it was fine. The air-conditioning was a small window unit. You might want to run it continuously to have it comfortable at night (Close the full-length window curtains while you're out). You will enjoy sitting out on the lanai. It's quite a view!There is no coffee maker in the room. However, in the outdoor lobby, they have coffee every morning, beginning at 7:00 A.M. There is a mini-fridge in the rooms. In-room safes are available, but cost (I think about $2.50 a night). Just outside the lobby (to your right) is an ABC convenience store that has everything you would need and want. Outside the lobby to your left is a McDonalds. Both are only 10-20 steps away. There are stores and restaurants up-and-down the street.Parking is underground, and costs $9.00 per night. That's a bargain, considering other hotels!We loved the hotel, and plan to stay there the next time we visit Oahu.

<Content>Loved the Circle! I'm a 45-year-old female flight attendant who has visited Hawaii many times with my family over the last ten years. I've stayed at Aston/ResortQuest hotels most of those visits. This was my first time at the Waikiki Circle. We stayed the first week of November and I doubt we will ever stay anywhere else in Waikiki! Judging from the other reviews, the Circle doesn't really need me to chime in with praise, but here goes.Very cool, groovy and retro. Cheap, cheerful, clean and fun. Location CANNOT be beat. Waikiki is JUST across the street, the Circle has sweet yellow umbrellas on the sand for guests and water toys in a rack just off the open-air lobby.We had two rooms, one for my parents (first-timers) and one for myself, my husband and our 13-year-old son. A tip: Pay the extra $10 or so and get a room higher up. It will be quieter and you will have a better view of the ocean. The elevators are fast enough and the view and quiet will be great!Yes, as other reviewers mention, the rooms are small. If you are the person whose body spreads into mine when sitting next to me in the economy cabin, you aren't going to like the shower. But you are hardly going to Hawaii to enjoy a luxurious room. The little desk by the mirrored closet is an ideal addition to the counterspace in the bathroom. If you have room in your bag, bring a great BIG fluffy towel for beach and bathroom use. As soon as you enter, open those curtains!!! Enjoy your lanai. (Ideal for smokers.) And remember what you paid. First thing after you've opened those curtains, plug in your refrigerator. The maids leave it unplugged to save electricity. Plug it in ASAP for your leftovers and drinks.Les was great at the front desk, and the staff was great about calling a cab for us a couple of times and also more than happy to store our bags after the noon checkout on the last day, giving us the opportunity to spend time around Waikiki before heading for our early-evening flight. The lady at the tour desk in the lobby was wonderful, gave us great advice about our visit to Pearl Harbor and arranged a very inexpensive transport to and from there. My one complaint, and it is a little one, is about the complimentary coffee service in the lobby. Most mainlanders in Hawaii get up early (and consequently poop out early) when in the islands due to the jet lag. 7:30 or 8:00 a.m. is too late for complimentary coffee to be very meaningful. I would suggest putting it out earlier if you truly want your guests to enjoy it. There was not a single morning when we did not avail ourselves of coffee at either McDonald's or at the Kona coffee kiosk in front of the Pacific Hotel (both just steps away from the Circle's lobby) because the lobby's coffee wasn't out yet. We then simply walked across the street and enjoyed it on the beach. I have told many a passenger: You will wake up early, and this is a blessing. Get up, slide your feet into your flip-flops and walk on that beach when the moon is still up and there is no one there but you and the local with the fishing pole or geiger-counter. Enjoy the beach this way in the morning because by 9 am it's a riot of people.Caveats: I almost hate to say any of this, but....the Waikiki Circle is NOT a honeymoon/romance type of hotel. There are no king (or even queen) sized beds, no hot tub, no pool, no room service, not even a bath tub in the room (shower only). This is an IDEAL girlfriend getaway or familymoon place. Unbelievable value. If you think you'll never go to Waikiki because you just can't afford the hotel rates, this is the place for you. I can give reams of advice about Hawaii and specifically Waikiki, but, in a nutshell:In the Waikiki area, visit Cheeseburger in Paradise for a meal and a great t-shirt. We never miss at least one breakfast at the Oceanarium buffet at the Pacific Hotel, but the breakfast buffet at Duke's Canoe Club gave it a run for its money this time around. Everyone knows to visit Pearl Harbor their first time in Honolulu, but make an effort to go to Iolani Palace too, a bus ride away in downtown Honolulu and excellent if it's rainy or overcast. An awesome tour for $20 a head, or get an audio for a lot less, but DO GO. It will help to have a rudimentary, 10-minutes-on-the-internet history lesson before you go, if you can't do any more homework than that. We have climbed Diamond Head as a family, taken a picture, and made our son promise to take the same picture with his family someday. Get a cab or bus ride to the entrance to the trail if you're up for that. It's fun to sit on the beach with your drink, look at Diamond Head, and know you've been to the top. We always spring for ONE expensive round of drinks at the beach bar behind the Sheraton Surfrider (the gingerbread hotel, you can't miss it) and we will never miss an evening at the Halekulani Hotel's beach bar, called House Without A Key. (Tell the cab driver to take you to the Halekulani, say Holly-koo-lonny, down the street. It's a cheap ride, don't try to walk.) At 5 pm a Grammy-nominated band starts playing on the beach, at 6 the hula dancer begins her program (a former Miss Hawaii). Get there early for a good spot. Very romantic and old-world Hawaii. Order the coconut shrimp with your drinks and watch the sun set behind the band. We always enjoy an inexpensive Thai meal at Keoni's, near the Princess Kaiulani Hotel (people will point you there). They have an inexpensive breakfast menu too, traditional American fare. There is a coffee place in the front part of the Surfrider, you can sit in the gingerbread window with your mate and it makes a great photo from the sidewalk, if you can get someone to snap it. The coffee is fabulous, esp. with the mango pastry. I love other spots in the Hawaiian Islands more, but my husband is a nut for the action and activity of Waikiki. He says he doesn't want to stay anywhere else from now on but the Waikiki Circle. My parents agree that if they go back to Waikiki, it's where they'll stay as well.

<Content>Great place to sleep  hotel is on same street as int'l marketplace and tons of restaurants and shops--its basically where all the hotels are. we didn't have to drive at all at nite to dinner or shopping. only took the car out to go to non-waikiki beaches (every day except first and last) and to airport.when you go to oahu (without children), you only need a room to dump your stuff, shower after swimming, and sleep. this hotel is PERFECT for that. DON'T expect a spa/resort and you will NOT be disappointed!! the rooms are all the same size, all have double beds and balconies, and are pie shaped. TINY rooms, but unless you're going to be ballroom dancing in the room, who cares??all the drawbacks of the facility are NO big deal, if you are going to oahu for what you SHOULD be going for: swimming, shopping, eating, drinking, and having FUN!! drawbacks: no pool but who needs one when your hotel is across the street from the best part of waikiki beach; no restaurant but don't need one on the street FULL of places to eat; varying degrees of crankiness from hotel staff but who cares you don't talk to them except to ask for as many towels as you want; tiny pkg lot but we always got a spot; slightly dingy street and icky people (some hookers!) but after 24 hrs i didn't even notice that...the pluses WAY outweigh any and all of these minuses. i am a VERY picky person, did LOADS of research about everything prior, and i recc this hotel. as aforementioned, don't expect a seaside couples massage or a mint on your pillow but do expect very diligent cleaning service (she even gave us extra towels w/o asking) and adequate accomodations. don't fall for the discount rate for a viewed room. why do you need a room with a view when you are across street from the beach? don't waste your money. DO fall for the discount if offerred a convertible for your rental car SO worth it!DO eat at: duke's across street, cheesecake factory (which we resisted since we have those in california but it was EXCELLENT after the hour long wait), and DO eat breakfast at Da Big Kahuna on Kuhio, one street away from the beach side. excellent hawaiian bfast. we had corned beef hash and white rice EVERY morning!! sounds gross but YUMMMMMY!!lastly: we shopped at ABC stores like, twice or thrice a day every single day and all i can say is if you think you should buy something there, DO IT cuz once you get home, you can't get it, can you?? i did TONS of christmas shopping there as 10 bucks spent there is equivalent to loads more mainland!! lastly, remember as long as your hotel is safe and clean, you will LOVE your vacation in PARADISE unless you have a stick up something...!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you don't have fun there, there's no hope for you whatsoever!!

<Content>Great spot This Hotel is in a great location however, we stayed in one room with 2 double beds for 4 people, it was just too small, great for a couple but thats it! The rooms are clean, staff helpfull and friendly. This is not the place to stay if your looking for slight luxury. Overall a nice Hotel.

<Content>Clean and convenient It's starting to sound redundant now, but I'll go ahead and add my two cents......this is the perfect hotel for those of you who, like me, don't want to spend a fortune on accommodations but don't want to stay in a dump either. This hotel is not fancy at all but it is nowhere close to being a dump. It's clean, affordable, and incredibly convenient. The rooms and bathrooms are small (it did remind me a little of a cruise ship cabin) but perfectly ample for two. The location is fantastic; right in the heart of Waikiki Beach. The staff is friendly. The beach towels they loan you are huge and fluffy. I thought the bed was very comfortable; I think the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. I had a partial ocean view, so I could not see Diamond Head from my balcony, but I could see the beach and the waves. And I kind of liked being able to also see the hustle and bustle of Honolulu on the other side. If you are like me and like to get and do things on vacation rather than hang out at the hotel, I highly recommend this one. (Otherwise no; there is no pool and limited services.)

<Content>Fantastic place to stay - I searched through hotels on internet and checked TripAdvisor. Since they received a great review I decided to go for it. We stayed 9/30 and 10/1 pre-cruise with another couple and had a fantastic time! Again, the rooms were small but clean but the view was outstanding! The location was perfect -- we walked a lot of places. When we go back we'll stay here again. The hotels around us were over $300 a night and we paid $140. Great deal! The staff was very friendly.

<Content>Excellent location! We stayed at the hotel Sept 30th thru October 2nd before going on a cruise. We chose this hotel after reading all of the other hotel reviews. I can say that we were very happy with our choice. You cannot beat the location and we also upgraded to an ocean front room for $20 additional a night and do not regret it. As others have commented, the shower is extremely small (smaller than the shower on our Carnival cruise ship) but it was fine for what we needed. The beds were great, we slept so well. The hotel does not have a lobby, but we found the staff extremely helpful and they also recommended Dukes to us, and we loved the food and atmosphere. I strongly recommend dining there. The ABC stores are everywhere and it was nice to have the McDonalds so close. We sat on our balcony watched the sunsets and listened to the music being performed across the street in the park. It was very nice. It is so close to the beach, it was so easy to walk to the beach come back if we forgot something or wanted a snack. The hotel also provided beach towels which was very nice and greatly appreciated. We also used the beach toys which the hotel provided. There was no need to purchase a raft or anything other type of toy. One of the elevators went out of service when we were there but it was fixed the next day. The travel desk was very helpful and spent a lot of time with us. I recommend getting an ocean front room higher than the 5th floor. We were on the 5th floor and would have preferred to be a bit higher. The only bad thing that I have to say is that the air conditioners are single window units in the wall and sometimes depending on how the wind blew, condensation water would drip on you from the air conditioner. Also, there was a lot of road noise, but the view made it all worth it! Overall the room was clean, beds were great and you cannot beat the location or view! I don't know if we would have stayed there if our final desination was Oahu since there is no pool or other ammenities that you find at other hotels, but for the price.......it cannot be beat! I would recommend this hotel to family and friends and we would stay there again. Happy travels!

<Content>What a view! Most of the reviews cover the obvious - smaller rooms, older hotel - but. . . . this is the place to stay on the beach. My wife and I stayed there for three nights and loved it. We got a room on the 13th floor and the view was spectacular. Rooms were very clean, service was exemplary and the staff could not have been friendlier. We had no problem parking in the garage under the hotel so that was not a worry. As many have noted, there are ABC stores (a chain convenience store) all around the hotel as well as MacDonalds and other great places. I recommend highly Duke's Canoe club just down the beach for dinner - the sunset from the patio is fantastic.You can pay much more but you won't get any better view of Waikiki beach.

<Content>What a spot! I chose this hotel from a travel brochure. It was within our budget and was across the road from the beach. This was a decision we never regretted. When we arrived we upgraded to a room with a view. We could sit on our balcony and watch the sunset show each night. We could sit on our lanai and watch the surfer's while we ate breakfast.An abc store was at our doorstep for supplies, We could be at the beach in 30 seconds and if we forgot something, we could return without it being a major hassle.Everything was within our reach.Oh, and everytime the street was closed for a special event, we were in the best seats in the house.I will return....Magic!PS Needed an iron and ironing board.

<Content>Best View And Value. This Is Waikiki'S Hidden Treasure! This is the best hotel I have stayed in with regard to its value. You can't beat the price and location of this hotel especially if you get a full ocean front room like the one I had. This was my 6th trip to Hawaii and this hotel was fantastic. 1. The staff was incredibly friendly always competent and very knowledgeable of not only Waikiki but Oahu and the neighbor islands as well. Every restaurant recommendation from Ciao Mein (yes italian and chinese) to lunch at the nearby swanky Kahala were right on the mark. This hotel is superbly run. 2. Yes, the bathrooms are small but if you are on a budget or are looking to spend the money you are saving by staying here to do other things, who cares if there is no bathtub? The beds are brand new and incredibly comfortable. Did I mention the view? A view like this at either the nearby Moana Surfrider or the Halukalani would cost thousands. Each room has its own lanai where each night you are treated to a fantastic sunset. I will definitely be back at the Circle Hotel in January. Ths time I will be joined by my extended family for a little reunion. This hotel is clean, well located and VERY well run. You won't make a mistake choosing the Circle Hotel for your Waikiki vacation.

<Content>bang for the buck The hotel is as basic as it gets. BUT considering that it's got great ocean views, a receptive and helpful front desk, an awesome location, and very affordable rooms...this is a great deal. If you want chic deluxe, try the Halekulani. If you want cheap-n-chic, it's all about the Circle.

<Content>best location for the price We stayed here for two nights on our way back home from the Big Island. The hotel location is fantastic for the price. Value-wise it's hard to beat this hotel. It is directly across from the main beach at Waikiki. An ABC store on one side of the main entrance for incidentals and a McDonalds on the other side for a fast breakfast on your way out!. Coffee down at the front desk in the morning is very good quality. The front desk staff were very knowlegable and I asked for their help several times for driving directions etc. The rooms are small but if you are two adults traveling together there is plenty of room. If you are two adults with two children you will be cramped. There is a small fridge in the room which we found very helpful. The views from the lanai, even the city view rooms, are still decent if you are on the upper floors. Staying up higher also gets you out of the noise from the street and traffic. My only real complaints are that it would be nice to have a pool for an evening cool-down, and they don't have nearly enough parking for hotel guests on site. The heat in July was a bit more than we expected and we didn't want to go to the beach in the late evening. We had a car because we wanted to get out of Waikiki and see the less populated areas and beaches. We had to park at another hotel a few blocks away for one night. The next day they made room for us outside the lobby area at no charge to help us out which was very nice of them. For the money? GREAT DEAL! I'd go back tomorrow.

<Content>Amazing Location!! Ok, so the rooms are small.....but who is really in thier room for any reason other than changing clothes and sleeping? The view from our ocean view room was amazing! You can't beat it for the price. It is conveniently located right across from Waikiki Beach. ABC Store is right next door (plus 2 or 3 others on the same block!) For the budget traveler wanting to stay near the beach it is definately the place to go. I also recommend taking the 120-mile circle island tour, what an amazing day and the driver was terrific! Enjoy your trip to Oahu and mahalo!

<Content>Love letter to the Circle The Circle is for the young or the young at heart, we've spent many vacations at the Waikiki Circle beginning in 1980 when we were in our twenties, we loved it then we love it now.The location and the view cannot be beat and it is so architecturally hip! Once you stay there you always notice the circle in any photo of Waikiki. Our favorite oceanfront rooms are 1304, 1305, 1306......on the odd floors the 05 rooms are center front oceanview and on the even floors the 04 rooms are the center front oceanview therefore on the 12th floor the best rooms are 1203, 1204,1206.Now for some caution:If hotel amenities or room size are important to you, you will be disappointed. Also there is street noise, but the awesome view makes one hard of hearing........For me the Circle is six stars!

<Content>Rooms okay for two We stayed for two nights plus had a late check out on day 3. Our group of 5 adults had 2 rooms on the 13th floor. Location is excellent ... right across from Waikiki beach, and the price was great too, compared to another property we stayed at earlier in our trip.Parking is awful if you have to park 'off site' .... you have to park at the Waikiki Banyan, 2 1/2 blocks away. UGH! It's a long, hot walk after a day of sightseeing.No pool (what a drag). That would sure add to this location, even if it was a small pool. I realize the beach is right across the road, but our family LOVES pool time at the end of the day!The rooms are small, but okay for 2. The room was VERY clean, and we liked the sandpail  shovel for the ice bucket. Good bonus to take home for the nieces!Bathroom also small, but manageable. Shower spigot was at our 6' 4 son's mid chest! The lanai was a good size, and had a partial view of Waikiki beach. Nice to sit out on in the evening to catch a breeze. Or blow a conch at sunset!Room fridge great for bottled water, snacks  alcohol beverages. We had an ancient A/C  TV, but our 'other room' had new ones. Would stay here again only in a pinch.

<Content>Great place to stay This hotel is great, for all those people conplaining STOP. Your right it is only a two star hotel and thats all you need with a beautiful beach literally across the street and hundreds of shops, cafes, and other places to go the only thing you need the hotel for is a quick rest in the middle of the day and the have a few hours sleep at night.If you wanted a hotel that provides five star service than one must pay the price, but if you just want somewhere to keep luggage and sleep this is definetely the place to go.The staff are amazing and helpful, willing to hold keys and other items whilst on trips or down at the beach. if you ask they are happy to provide extra towels for the beach etc.This is a great place to stay if you are willing to make the most out of your holiday (not get other people to do it for you!!).

<Content>The Best Hotel Ever!!!! We Loved It!!! My husband and I spent a week in Oahu and had the luck of staying at this terrific hotel. Don't go by any negative remarks you might read (i.e. there is no pool). Who cares if there is no pool considering the magnificent stretch of beach right across the street! We had an ocean view room on the 12th floor. Every morning we had coffee on the balcony and watched thre surfers do their thing. Also had lots of birdie visitors. The room was perfect for 2 people. The staff was amazing. They will hold onto your luggage if you have a late flilght. We lucked out because we had a 10 p.m. flight and checkout was noon. For an extra $78 we were able to hold the room until 10:00 p.m. That gave us time to hit the beach and have dinner. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The best part is you can't hear your neighbors. Nice thick walls!

<Content>Very Ordinary We stayed at this hotel for a total of 5 nights (4 consecutive and 1 later in our trip). Whilst the hotel has position, position, position (great views of the beach if you are lucky enough to have a beach view room), it really has not much else to offer. The rooms are comfortable but very small and hot and noisy. The alternatives for sleeping at night are to leave the balcony door open (too noisy from the street noise and other air conditioners) or to leave the old-fashioned air conditioner running all night and neither is ideal for a good night's sleep. The bathrooms are also quite small and in one of the rooms we had the paint was peeling off the wall in places.There are no dining facilities, no room service and no coffee making facilities either apart from being able to get a cup of coffee from the foyer for a short time in the morning. Fortunately there are plenty of places to dine in the street. This hotel is fine if you want just basic accommodation but if you are expecting a little more then this is not the place.

<Content>Great spot great stay. We stayed at the Cicle on two occasions in april, we had a group of 8, (4 Rooms) and we were very happy with the service and rooms. The views are just the best, the rooms were clean and tidy and serviced very well, All the staff were very helpful, our main contact was Jan at the desk and as this was our first trip to Hawaii she helped us on many occasions. To Jan and all the staff at the Circle from the 8 Ausies we appreciated your service and help and we would reccomend this Hotel to all.Regards Geoff.

<Content>Great place! My family and I stayed at the Circle for a couple nights in February 2006. You cannot beat the location and the view!! I was rather hesitant because of the reviews I read, but was pleasantly surprised! The rooms are small, but fine for two people. Our room was clean and the view was incredible!!! The staff was very helpful. I would recommend staying on a higher floor because of the street noise. I definitely will stay there again!

<Content>Great place to stay! Stayed at the Circle for 10 nights in February and we had a great time. We were hesitant on booking this place because of the negative reviews we had read but we were more than pleased with our choice and the ocean view from the lanai was superb. The room itself was a little on the small side and the bathroom was rather tight, but this was expected. We did not have a major problem with the water pressure as others have noted, although it could have been a little better. As for the shower, it would be a little tight for anybody who could be considered a larger size, although I did not have a problem with it. On the plus side, apart from the sensational view was the brilliant location right across the street from a great stretch of swimmable beach, and the close proximity to a fantastic selection of shops and restaurants. The staff were all very friendly and being a small hotel the service was very personable. I would recommend the Circle if you are interested in a clean but smallish room in a brilliant location and do not wish to spend a fortune.

<Content>loved the circle Stayed at the circle for 23 nights from the 22 december,this was our 5th stay and we love this hotel.Ok it has not got a pool,restraunt,gym etc,but so what.The rooms are clean the reception very friendly and the location cannot be beat.The room was cleaned every day by very friendly staff,we even got a christmas present from them on christmas morning,we had clean free beach towels everyday,and the honolulu advertiser newspaper outside our door every morning all for free.We had a ocean view room and at 18.00 hours every night watched the free hulu show opposite the hotel from our lani..As a previous reviewer stated,the shower is quite small,but it takes minutes to take a shower,so whats the problem!!Give this hotel a try,and hopefully u will love it as much as me.We are already planning our stay for 2007.

<Content>Loved the Circle Just returned after spending 10 glorious days at the circle!!!!! We took our family there for vacation and don't pay attention to the negative reviews of this hotel... It was great!!!!!! The rooms are clean not as small as everyone says they are, Sure the shower is a little close but come on how long are you in the shower????? Everyone at the hotel was very helpful especially Maura at the front desk. The cleaning staff was fantastic always making sure the halls and lobby were spotless. We were upgraded to a partial oceanview without having to pay any extra. Dont be sucked in to the higher priced hotels it isnt worth it we were the last trip there. Aloha and have a great time.

<Content>Small, Small, Small My husband and I stayed at this hotel from Jan.4, 2006 to Jan. 10th, 2006. I guess you get what you pay for. The only thing going for this room is the view. It was breath taking and beautiful. This is about the only good thing I have to say about this hotel. The room was a bit bigger then my walk-in-closet. The beds are so uncomfortable. They should be replaced as they are old. If you plan on getting some sleep before 1 AM forget it. The traffic is unreal, it never stops but does slow down around 1 am. I will say the staff is very friendly and helpful. Will never stay here again. I will pay extra to have a comfortable hotel room.

<Content>Great location! I was a bit leery when I booked this hotel originally because of some bad reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised when we got there. The hotel is directly in front of the beach, with views that are just as good as any of the 5 star hotels. However, you get what you pay for - the rooms are tiny. With just 2 of us we were comfortable, but the bathroom was tiny, specifically the shower. We had a partial ocean view room that had a gorgeous view on the diamond head side, and were on the 13th floor. We took advantage of the balcony and sat out on it almost every day.Though we were so high up Waikiki is noisy at night! We probably should have closed the door at night, but we liked it open. There is free coffee in the lobby every morning. We had no problems with the elevators, and the place was kept very clean. Also, we requested a non-smoking room - I'm not even sure if they have them, as are room was equipped with ashtrays, but there was no lingering smell or anything. One thing that I didn鈥檛 like was that they charged 75 cents per outgoing call, whether it was local or using a calling card 鈥?which was a pain to try and make reservations and call home using a payphone on the beach.It鈥檚 also close to the action, short walk to many different restaurants and shops, and close to the international marketplace. No pool, but there was only one really windy day when we gave up on the beach that we would have used it if we had one. We usually camped out in front of the Moana Surfrider and relaxed (this is the place we want to stay next time we go to Hawaii when we have more money!). Also, they gave us a coupon book when we checked in that was useful (free cheesecake from Tikis!).Overall it was a great place if you are on a budget, probably not good if you are planning on having 4 people stay in the room 鈥?would be cramped. But we enjoyed it and were happy with our choice for our first trip to Hawaii.

<Content>Motel 6 Of Waikiki The only pro about this hotel is that it is located at the heart of waikiki across from the beach. If you are planning on being out all day and have an extremely tight budget and are only concerned about getting a few hours of sleep after a long day of exploration, then maybe this is the hotel for you.You will quickly learn that you better have a long day and night planned since there are minimal guest services and amenities at your disposal at this rat hole. Please remember that this hotel is a converted boarding house for troops during WWII. There is no pool (what resort doesn't have a pool to chill out in after swimming in the ocean all day? after all this is RESORTQUEST waikiki right?), no central AC, the bathroom is oddly divided so that the sink and mirror are separated from the toilet and shower (water pressure is a trickle). There are no extra pillows or towels conveniently available should a need arise for them and the front desk personnel are quick to remind you that this hotel is indeed appropriately rated two stars with curt and rude remarks about how we don't have people to run errands like that, you'll have to come down here and get it yourself (thanks, jan, you're super sweet). so why complain? i'm not complaining, i'm giving a review. this hotel was recommended to us by travel agents who made grave misrepresentations. if you want to relax and enjoy yourself go to kaua'i or one of the other islands and stay clear of waikiki and the waikiki circle hotel. it's less commercialized and the concept of aloha is better preserved on the other islands and in other establishments than in waikiki and the waikiki circle hotel.

<Content>Geat value, Perfect location This hotel is a little older but that added to its charm. The staff was so friendly and our room was spotless. No, there is no turndown service or mints on the pillow but get over yourself!! You are paying for the best location in Waikiki and you are paying less that half the price you would pay if you were staying next door!! I would return to this hotel if I ever visit Waikiki again. I also stayed 2 nights at the Royal Hawaiian and I fould this location better and I felt more *in* Waikiki staying at the Circle.

<Content>Best location on the beach at great price Just returned from a stay at the Circle. Here are the good points-Absolutely great location, oceanfront rooms truly oceanfront with best view on Waikiki. Located directly across one street to the sand. Walk to beach is as short as the other hotels charging outrageous prices. Nice central location to shops, restaurants etc. Our room on the 9th floor was very clean, no smoke smell. Decorated very cute. Small fridge and good coffee in lobby area. Elevators work very fast and smooth. Employees were much more friendly than the average we met in Waikiki. Now for the not so good points for some people-The rooms are small by some standards. But there was a nice closet and it was large enough for us. The balcony is large and that is where I sat to read etc. Who stays in the room anyway? No tub, and shower is small-but not a problem for us. I learned that unless you plan to drive everyday-it is not worth the cost of renting a car daily, if you are staying at the Circle and doing the Waikiki thing. You are located walking distance to just about everything and there are numerous trolleys and buses cheap! Just get a car for when you intend on traveling the island. The rental cars have locations close to the Circle, plus I think they will deliver.We are country, farm people and Waikiki is not for us-very busy and the beach was crowded this time of year. But we did enjoy the view very much from our room. I am so thankful that we did stay at the Circle and had the nice balcony and view. If we have to stay in town again, we will definitely stay at the Circle again. I will try to post later about the places we visited and the rest of our stay at Kailua and Lanikai. If you are looking for a quiet area, please feel free to email me.

<Content>Not a good place for non-smokers When my husband and I are discussing ther merits of differenct places we have stayed, this is our benchmark of icky. We booked a non-smoking room. When we checked in there was actually visible smoke issuing from the vent in the bathroom. We were adjacent to a smoking room and the circulation system ensures that all rooms are smoking rooms. We were offered another room, same problem and then rebooked into the Aston Waikiki Beach just a few block down the same street, which was fine. The staff was very nice about it, and I got the impression this is a common problem. This hotel caters to smokers and has an elderly air circulation system. If you are not prepared to accept a seriously smoky environment, don't stay here. Rooms were tiny and bathrooms tinier. I am 5'0 and my husband is 5'6, so we usually never even notice the height of the shower. I think that is the first shower we have ever seen that was too short for us. I had an overall impression of dirtiness, which to be fair was probably influenced by the overwhelming smell of tobacco. Since we were just down the street, we walked by often and noticed many people partying on the balconies, sort of a college dorm atmosphere with lots and lots of cigarettes, so if that is your cup of tea, you might be pleased by this place. The location is excellent, but the cigarette smoke was beyond belief.

<Content>Perfect for us! This hotel is awesome if you are on a budget yet want to be practically on the beach with awesome views! When we got to the room we opened the curtains and about died and went to heaven! The door/window fills the whole room! We had an oceanfront room but I am sure the partial ocean rooms would be pretty good too! There are two queen beds (I think they were) and me and my hubby decided to sleep separetly because they were a bit small and we aren't big people but we like are space! The room is small but it is a circular hotel as well. The only thing that I didn't really like about the room was the bathroom. The shower was almost too small for one person (but doable). After a day or two there was a stinky smell in the bathroom (not sure what that was). But the room was clean enough and didn't stink. There were some stains on the floor/mattress. The beds were o.k. to sleep on. Not too hard... but don't try to have s-- on the bed because there is no give and you can't move and the springs go into your back :-) You have to pay like $2.50 a day to use their in-room safe which is really stupid! Also they charge you even for local calls! even calls using a calling card!!!!There is a small refridgerator which was nice. But it would have been great if there would have been a microwave too. There is a desk to write on and the closet has shelving and was nice.The help at the desk was very friendly. We didn't use the tour desk because we could never get the woman to acknowledge our presence! RUDE and not nice. But we arranged everything ourselves so it was no problem. The balcony was nice and large. I wish they had chairs you could lay down in instead. Some birds visited us out there. We slept with the door open about every night and it was really nice. One night it rained hard and we had to shut the door because the rain came in and was so loud. Sunday mornings they have some big grill fest outside the hotel and they close the street for it... VERY LOUD putting up the tent and stuff so we shut the door. Not sure if I am forgetting anything. Overall we ended up spending a lot of time in the room believe it or not and enjoyed it throughly!!!Please let me know if you need anymore info. You can see from one end of the beach to the other. The hotels nearby are at a nice distance and not too close. It is very open and breezy. Oh yeah we stayed on the very top floor (14th). At night there is a Luau or something in front of the hotel every night but the trees are a bit in the way but you can hear the music and see some things going on. I have LOTS of pics :-)

<Content>Good budget hotel We spent 5 nights at the Waikiki Circle hotel October 10-15. The hotel is old and the rooms are very small, but you can't beat if for the money. We were on the top floor with a partial ocean view. Our lanai faced Diamond Head for a lovely view. The room was very clean and the service very good. I can't imagine a better location - we could walk to everything. This is not your fancy, pricey resort accommodation, but we were very satisfied (especially since we didn't spend a whole lot of time in our room).

<Content>Waikiki Circle Up to Expectations Having read many positive and some negative reports on the Resortquest Waikiki Circle Hotel, we found that it was up to our expectations, September -October '05. Tripadvisor resarch had prepared us for the small shower recess, little bit of paint peeling off the wall and the small rooms. However, the little bit of extra money to have the clean, oceanfront room with an absolutely FANTASTIC view was more than ample compensation. Friends who were staying in the nearby, very expensive Outrigger were extremely jealous of the size of our balcony and view. The hotel staff were efficient, friendly. Free ice for a pre-dinner duty free was a nice touch! Only down side, was the $2.60 per day fee for using the in-room safe (unusual) and the downright unfriendliness of the lady at the tour desk, after a couple of rebuffs from her we used the tour desk at the Outrigger, who were helpful, friendly and efficent. Further note; the Japanese restaurant in the foyer of the hotel is something to be avoided. On entering we were told we only serve noodles we that's ok to be greeted with  you won't like it here! We left. The restaurant is always full of Japanese, perhaps this is just a form of racial discrimination in reverse?

<Content>Don't Waste Your $$$ I am here at the hotel right now. I am very disappointed. Very small. Shower is like a coffin! No pool! It reminds me of a child's dorm. There isn't any room for our clothes. Our luggage is out on the balcony because there isn't any room in this tiny box for them. If you are going to pay all this money for airfare, don't waste your $$$ on this hotel. Pay a little extra and you will have a much better time!

<Content>Not too Shabby This Hotel has everything you would expect from a 3 star hotel. If you expect more you may be disappointed. My wife and I stayed here for the first night of our Honeymoon. We stayed in an ocean view room on the 10th floor. The view was wonderful and the location was great. It's just a short walk to the beach, a restaurant, or a bar. The rooms wont fit more than two people comfortably but you can try. The positives were the price, location, and view. The only negative was the parking. They have a parking lot but I think it only fits 3 cars. You will most likely have to park several blocks away in another hotel parking garage. The walk is about 10 minutes which isn't bad unless your one of those people that needs to run to your car all the time. I'd stay here again for a short trip. Anything more than a few days and I might look for a larger room and a closer parking lot.

<Content>Great view but dirty My family, husband and daughter stayed at the Circle for 10 days. As soon as I walked in the door I knew immediately it was not the hotel for us. The bathroom was gross. The balcony floor was so black I couldn't walk barefoot. Pigeon poop all over the place. I was not able to upgrade to another Aston hotel, all booked. The company that I booked my vacation with, Expedia does not give any refunds after you arrive. So I was stuck. Went to the Food pantry bought some clorox and sprayed the bathroom floor. The towel I used to clean was literally black with dirt. Gross! Shower also did not drain. I had to call downstairs they did come up to repair. Towels are very, very small it is hard to dry off completely. Don't get me wrong I was not obsessed and didn't do all of the cleaning the first hour I was there but I was very disappointed with the room. We did have an awesome vacation otherwise. This was not going to ruin our vacation, we had a great time. Best one out of the three times we have gone. Good things to report were staff was friendly, water toys to use, front desk let me look at several other rooms, elevators were fast and like everyone says the view is to die for and the sunsets are absolutely beautiful! If I had to choose between a view with a dirty room or a clean room without a view, I would choose a clean room without a view. So next year will be a different hotel. Aloha!

<Content>Great view and location We stayed in an oceanview room, and for the price, the view was awesome. We could open up the curtain and have a nice panorama of waikiki beach while lying bed. I also found the fish motif cute. The other nice thing is there is a hula performance each evening across the street from the hotel, and though our view was blocked by the banyan tree, we could open the lanai door and listen to the music while getting ready for dinner. The rooms are small, but there was just two of us so we are able to use the other bed to store our second suitcase and spread out our belongings. Everything in the room was clean and well maintained, except mattresses weren't the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The bathrooms counters/toilet/sink were in good repair. The shower stall is small, and had just a curtain. If, like me, you like to adjust the water temperature before fully stepping into the shower, you will end up with a wet floor. Also some areas around the door were rusty, and there was peeling on the shower ceiling. But to me this was not enough to ruin my experience.If you don't need all the amenities of a resort or want a luxury experience, and want an oceanview room without paying through the nose, the Circle will work for you.

<Content>Run down Hotel rooms are very very small and not cleaned properly ie. hair, beer bottle caps, dirt and sand throughout. Bathroom is tiny, shower recess even smaller ( if you are any bigger than a small to medium person, don't bother trying to shower as you will not fit into the recess). We had continued trouble with shower blocking due to the amount of hair build up in pipes. Towels are a joke, might as well attempt to dry your self with a tea towel.The place is very run down and looks nothing like the pictures on the net. Think twice before going there its not worth the money.

<Content>Great Bargain! As an average couple wanting to save a few bucks, this hotel was perfect. We had upgraded to the Ocean Front (not to be confused with Ocean View) and loved it. It's so close to the beach and doesn't have the big price tag. You could probably save more by staying a few blocks from the beach, but why would you??? The bathroom was a bit small and the bed was a bit too firm, but overall the place was a great deal.

<Content>A Great Family Place! My family of seven just returned from a six night's stay at the Circle. My 70+ parents, my husband and myself, plus our three children, ages 8, 4 and 2, shared two adjacent ocean front rooms on the tenth floor. The staff were extremely accomodating. Within minutes of checking in, we received extra towels delivered to our room at no request and one of the front office staff went out of her way to make sure all my children received their Children stay, play and eat free cards and necklaces - there was only one necklace available upon check in, but she kept looking and provided two more on day #2 because she wanted to keep things fair for all three kids - she also gave us an extra bucket and shovel because she knew we only had one per room, yet three kids. Other extra, unexpected perks included: huge unlimited beach towels provided each day - we could take them anywhere on the island; free use of water toys, including rafts, surf and boogie boards, sand toys, chairs and umbrelllas; free local paper delivered to our door each morning, and a latte stand just around the corner. (My parents enjoyed the complimentary morning coffee, but my husband and I had to splurge; after all, we were on vacation) The rooms were clean and comfortable and not at all cramped, even with our huge family. The layout of the rooms worked very well and the kids had enough space to spread out - they even had room to play hide-n-seek. The panoramic view, to echo other reviews, was breathtaking. We were always drawn to sit out on the balcony so perhaps that's what made the room feel spacious - it seemed to extend out to the ocean! We were so close to the water that we were able to take in a swim each day - even on days that we went out sightseeing. And the beach directly across from the hotel was perfect for the little ones - very shallow and calm, even for my 2-year old. And talk about convenience! I loved being able to pop down to the variety stores for any little thing I needed and having a McDonald's and Jack in the Box right below helped out when the kids needed a quick, familiar bite to eat. We had a rental mini-van and never had any problems finding a parking place, even when we came and went throughout the day. All-in-all, we were thrilled with our choice of hotels. Beach access, the view, convenience, and the staff's Aloha spirit will bring us back to the Circle anytime we plan to stay on Oahu!

<Content>great location! Our family group of 6 just returned from a seven night stay at the Circle. If I was going to return to Oahu or was going to recommend a hotel to someone going there, I would definitely consider the Circle as a unique, friendly, and well located place to stay. The staff was helpful anytime we needed directions, a recommendation for dinner or extra towels. We had a partial-ocean view, but from our lanai we could see Waikiki beach right across the street. The rooms are small, there are two double beds in each. Smaller than what I am used to(for two people to sleep in)but everything was clean and the air conditioning was efficient if needed. Over all, a great value for your vacation $$$ .

<Content>Nice Place/Great Location If location and price are more of a concern than frills and shine this place is for you. Rooms are small but acceptably clean. The view from the ocean-view rooms can't be beat. We found the staff to be very friendly. It was great to watch the Waikiki Beach sunset show from the room. Would stay there again next time in Waikiki.

<Content>Loved it! What can I say, I don't see waht some of these peoples complaints where about. You can tell from pix that it isn't huge, it's more of a casual inexpensive way to stay. You can't stay any closer to the beach for this price! Some of the complaints I see didn't happen to us, I think they just had bad luck! Sorry about that. Why are you hanging out at your hotel this much anyway? GOb OUT, YOU ARE IN HAWAII! I thought it was great and colorful. The WORST thing I could say is the shower is a little small, but it was easy for us to get over... we found it more funny then inconvenient.

<Content>Think of the price - you'll love the value I am always a little surprised when I see reviews about the Circle where people were totally unhappy.I think this is definitely a get what you pay for scenario. There is a reason the Circle is a third of the price of other hotels. The rooms are small, and old BUT.... the view is outstanding, the location absolutely cannot be beat, the lobby staff have got to be some of the nicest folks I have ever met and at this price you can afford to stay more days than you would at the Sheraton's or Hilton's of Waikiki.If older and small is not your cup of tea, and you can afford it, by all means check out other motels. But - if you want one of the best values on Waikiki - within walking distance of the zoo, shopping, fine restaurants and right across the beach from a free show, you cannot beat the Circle.

<Content>what the??!!..... The only nice thing about this hotel was that it was in Hawaii.Here's the run-down of all the negative things1. There is NO lobby, the pictures lie to you. There is a window with 2 tiny holes that you have to talk to the front desk staff through2. The lovely blood  cigarette stains of your bedsheets3. The faucet sprays more water up in the air then it does on your hands.4. Dont bother putting the AC on if you dont want to be sprayed with the nasty water from it (on the balcony)5. If you have to take a shower you are better off taking it outside on the beach, their showers are cleaner and at the hotel there is NO room6. Dorm rooms are bigger and cleaner. Hotel is very old and run downon the lighter note, front desk staff was helpful when we complaint 1000 times  the view was nice.

<Content>Hold your nose and look at the view It was Aloha Week in Honolulu. The plane landed hours late.At two am we checked in and found the hotel room smelled.Holding my nose I opened the door to the terrace and just wentto bed.Thinking the next morning we would check out other hotels andjust move on.Every other hotel was booked. And the price of an ocean-view roomwas 16 times the cost we were paying for ours.So we went to the ABC store and bought a lot of cans of air spray.None of it worked -except to make the smell worse.It short we keep the terrace door open and stayed out therewhenever we could.The big Aloha parade passed by right under our terrace. They sang and danced their way up the ocean side street toward Diamond Head--which we could clearly see day or night.And best of all I heard the late Loyal Gardner sing at an outdoor concert.If you do not know her-- find her recordings. Her range,voice and aloha spirit were unmatched.My stay was over ten years ago and I know that the hotel has undergone a complete re-do and has sentthe bad smells away.The view remains and if you check out the cost of the big hotels just across the street you will see just what that view is worth.You can put the rest of the money into your food budget.The cost now for the Circle is about 5 times what I spent then --but I would go back to the Circle in a heart beat. This is great (view) value for money.

<Content>Really, really happy with the Circle Yeah, yeah you've heard it before - spectacular view, great and friendly staff, small room, reasonably priced. My kids and I had a fantastic time. We got a 14th floor partial ocean view which meant you turned the chairs to the right and wow. We were there five nights and I could've stayed ten, honestly.We liked the room. Small but comfortable. I've stayed before at outrigger reef and that was small, too, and not nearly as comfortable and we looked out at a wall. I did not miss the pool - two minutes and you are across at the beach, sand may not be as fine as in front of the Royal Hawiaian (so walk up the beach five minutes if you want) but you can rent chairs/umbrella/surfboard reasonably right there, catamaran, right there, park really clean and nightly free hula/music shows, right there.While it probably doesn't belong in a hotel review, I don't know where else to put it, so I will say a few other things about Waikiki and Oahu in general, because this site has been SO good to me (helped me plan trip to Utah this summer, Grand Canyon, Vegas, and now Honolulu) I want to pass some of the marvelous information along.Some general advice:That free hula/music show at Prince Kuhio park is great, free, and kids can play in water at sunset - what could be better? Tiki's is a really fun restaurant with great drinks and reasonable for waikiki prices. If you are going to Dukes near sunset hang out on the lower lanai, they will eventually put tables/chairs out there too and then you will have one with a much shorter wait than when upper lanai becomes available, and a table right on the sand. Food:While I liked the Royal Hawaiian's Luau much much better than the icky food/long drive to Paradise Cove, they DO NOT show you the pig. it is already prepared and in a chafing dish. While fun, am not sure that this is worth the high admission ticket. What IS worht it is the Royal H's brunch, make your own smoothies and omelettes, and a fabulous view plus Hawaiian music performed strolling past your table. Keo's Thai is very disappointing. Arty Thai, not fun Thai (i/e unsweet pad thai really isn't that fun), weak drinks. pretty room though, but I'll take the less sophisticated, much more enjoyable (great live contemporary music!) Tiki's any time.Good bar eats and the best drinks at Sheraton Moana, and more music, this fairly traditional. great sunset view of diamond head.DO check out Waimanolo beach, maybe an hour outside of Waikiki. gorgeous and deserted and nice for swimming. And in the same town go to Keneke's. Do not be put off by the handpainted signs or slightly run down look. GREAT food, really inexpensive, really friendly.Climb Diamond Head but early, before it gets too hot (i.e. before 8 am) Check out Makupu point lighthouse, you do have to hike in now.Must have Matsumoto's ices in Haleiwa on N. Shore. With the beans!Ilioni palace was fun and worth touring, beware the one way streets.Chinatown is also alot of fun, I liked shopping in the afternoon, the lei store is fabulous - all sorts of exotics for $2, plus my daughter bought a chicken head for a quarter (not at the lei store) and got to terrorize her brother for hours of fun. If you get a surfing lesson from Palekaiko brothers at Kuhio Beach in waikiki ask for Roger. BEWARES:SKIP Hanama Bay, IMO. crowded, not many fish, the tedium of the 'don't feed fish, dont pee in the water' etc. lecture, the rude parking lot attendants - really not worth it. So many nicer snorkling spots toward the north shore and windward oahu. Do not want to draw too many to one specific spot but there are so many beautiful places. Just rent a car and drive along the coast route toward the N. Shore, and then return the fast way on the 99. We got to swim with a sea turtle and see dozens and dozens of beautiful fish - NOT in hanama.SKIP the L and L diner chain at least in Wahiawa, grease central, really really bad plate lunch, the complete opposite of Kenekes (our L and L went in the trash, literally).SKIP Waimea Bay Audobon Park falls - the falls are contaminated with bacteria. You CANNOT swim there (well you can if you ignore the life guard's warnings and don't mind murky water). the gardens are pretty but not as pretty as some around Honlulu and shouldn't you be out scoping the locals snorkling spots and windswept beaches instead?Aloha.

<Content>Non-smokers beware! We stayed at this hotel in early March for one night. We requested a non-smoking room but were booked into a smoking room. The room was very small and in dire need of repair. The partial ocean view was from the deck. It was a miserable night, we tried turning on the air-conditioning but it only blew cigarette smoke. We tried opening the sliding door, but the noise from the street was equally unbearable. On the plus side, the management was friendly and helpful and arranged for us to upgrade (for an additional fee) the next day to the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel where we enjoyed a beautiful ocean front view (smoke-free) from the 18th floor.

<Content>Great view Great location We stayed at the CIRCLE 1/26 -1/30 The view was UNBELIEVABLE from the ocean front room! The park across the street is spotless ! Very easy to get ANYWHERE from the CIRCLE ! Rooms are small, bathroom is small, WHO cares.... we were not in the room much ! Who needs a pool ? You are across the street from WAIKIKI BEACH !! LOVED sitting on the lanai having a drink, watching them surf ! The price was super ! $145.00 ocean FRONT room ! Clean rooms, friendly staff, great location, and AWESOME VIEW !!! I would stay there again in a minute ! If you are looking for a great value THIS IS IT !!

<Content>Great Views, Great Hotel! We spent a week here in January. I can be a tough customer, but I thought everything was just great. Maura at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping was great, coffee in the lobby, newspaper, fridge, fluffy beach towels. Some people have mentioned the size of the bathroom/shower. There was nothing wrong with it at all.  We received an upgrade to partial oceanview from city view for $5 a day, and it was the best deal ever!! You cannot beat the view or the location of this hotel...sure, the walls in the halls and rooms could use a paint job (a nice shade of warm sand instead of the glaring white, perhaps?), but all in all this was great for the price and location.  I would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Love it I stayed at the hotel on dec 7 -10 2004. I loved it!! I got the ocean view room. The room is a little small but clean. The customer service lady when we checked in was very nice and helpful. However, the another one when we asked for beach towels and checked out was just so so and not very helpful. However, I still voted it for 4 stars. I would consider staying at this hotel for my next trip!

<Content>Good value on Waikiki Admittedly, I've bumped this rating up a bit because of the mid-Century charm of the place, but there are drawbacks. The rooms are small, largely due to the goofy-fun nature of staying in a round building. The housekeeping was spotless. The partial ocean view was a delight (ours was not a direct ocean-front, but having coffee and hanging out on the balcony gave us an enjoyable beach view from the 7th floor.) Waikiki Beach is right across the street, and other restaurants, attractions (e.g. Surfrider's outdoor cocktail bar,) and shopping are an easy walk. I love the mid-century decorative touches, e.g. ocean motifs in the hall flooring. For the location and general pleasantness of the place, it's difficult to match the location at this price unless you get an unbelievable discount on one of the online travel sites.What you have to deal with: there is only one size room (small.) Since there seems to be only one size of bed (queen,) if you can't deal with two sleeping in one queen bed (we don't), then there are two queen beds in a small room that really squeezes the space. One king might have been better, but that doesn't seem to be an option. There was no real chest of drawers in our room, which made it difficult to work out of 2 large suitcases (we were traveling beyond Hawaii for a few weeks.) There is only a shower in the small bathroom. There is a desk in the closet and dressing, which could have held a suitcases, but we wanted that space for other needs. Finally, some types of maintenance could be a problem after hours. When we complained that our room safe (extra charge) did not have a key lock in it, we were told that it would be fixed the next day. NOT ACCEPTABLE, since in the interim we'd go out to dinner, go to the beach, etc. They finally called the hotel manager to do the repair since the maintenance man already left for the day. With all the Aston hotels in Waikiki, they couldn't have sent over one of the maintenance persons from another sister hotel? Otherwise, the service was very friendly and accomodating.To be honest, I'd stay again as a good value place with a fair amount of charm. My husband thought the place was fine enough, but would prefer to spend somewhat more to stay at the Marrriott, or other places we've stayed in Waikiki. The operative word is somewhat more: during holiday time, few Waikiki hotels are offering bargains.

<Content>Loved, Loved and Loved the Wonderful Waikiki Circle Hotel I can't say enough good about this hotel. We stayed at this hotel for 1 week Dec 8-15. We had a wonderful stay. Rooms are rather small but there were three of us in this room and we also had 3 big suitcases and didnt have a problem with space. Besides, $146 for a Oceanfront room is a real value. The view was awsome. Bathrooms dont have bathtubs just showers(and no......they are not that small). The rooms are very clean, bright and cheery and have very large balconies. The room had a small refrigerator and the A/C always worked great. The lobby had lots of big fluffy beach towels you could use. Staff were always friendly. helpful and always had a smile. Free coffee bar and newspaper in the morning was wonderful. Maid service great. Nice fast elevators........never a wait. We went to the free hula show across the street every night. Only thing I disagree with at this hotel is this.....Hotel is a circle. Only the center rooms should be classified as Oceanfront. The other row of rooms on each side of the center rooms are also classified as oceanfront however they should not be as they are side oceanview in my opinion and not oceanfront. I received a side Oceanfront room and was disappointed, However, I asked the front desk for a Oceanfront center room and they switched me in two days. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Loved it!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>For the best view(180 degrees-the entire length of the beach) stay at the Circle Thank you to all reviewers. We arrived home Xmas day after 11 nights cruise and 11 nights at the Circle We did what you advised-stayed on the tenth floor smack bang in the front, in a compact clean and crisp beach themed room. Sat on the lanai, people watched, saw the luau out front at 6.30 each nite sipping cocktails from our fridge.(Also held our milk for our cereal, orange juice and fruit for brekkie) Swam, lazed, strolled along the beach (right out front), towel from reception, valuables in safe. No worries mate.The staff were genuine(unpretentious) helpful, happy and courteous. We couldn't find a better rate for such a position. It is imortant when staying a while to have a great room.We knew zilch before we left. The places our agent recommended were out of the way. We come from outback of the outback in Australia, we loved the atmosphere, loved the climate, loved exploring Oahu, loved our 11 nite cruise we took on Norweigan Wind to see the hauntingly beautiful islands of Hawaii and loved the friendly peopleand loved the Circle.We had a wonderful holiday Thank you all.

<Content>Worth it for the location and views I have to admit I was a little surprised at how small the rooms were when we walked in. There was still, however, plenty of room to put our stuff and a nice little side area with a good sized closet, desk, and refrigerator. Now even though I was surprised at the room size when I walked in, I was shocked when I checked out the bathroom! I really have never in my life seen such a miniature shower!! When I shampooed my hair I kept accidently bumping the faucet handle that controls the temperature and changing it. The water pressure is also really really low. I do think it's just a minor annoyance (and it's something I got used to pretty quickly - I mean, how long do you really spend in the shower anyways - just soap up, rinse off and get out!) What really made this hotel great was the cleanliness of the rooms (the carpet was spotless and looked brand new, the bedspreads looked freshly cleaned and the beds were very comfortable). Also, our ocean view room for $125/night was just beautiful - it was so nice to step outside and enjoy the view in the morning and evening!! My suggestion would be to just accept the itty bitty shower and small room size and just enjoy the views, location and a good nights sleep!

<Content>The beachfront value in Waikiki Our partial ocean view room allowed us to sit in bed and look at the beach or sit on the lanai (balcony) with an incredible view. All for $125/nt. They let us check in at 10 since our room was available and stay late for no extra $ (again because room was available). Very helpful and friendly. Certainly an older hotel but in decent shape. Fridge hand to chill water. I don't think you can stay this close to the beach anywhere else for same or less $$$ (unless you have military affiliation).

<Content>Great Location - Tiny Room I think everybody who has stayed in an ocean front room here would agree that the veiws are unbeatable. Unfortunately, the rooms are quite small (smaller than they appeared on the Aston website), and if you're over six feet tall you'll be painfully disproportionate to the small double beds. The air conditioner made a very loud rattling sound when it was turned on, and the problem didn't appear to get any better when somebody was supposedly sent up to fix it (we were not in the room very much, so we took their word that the AC was fixed). On the other hand, when our toilet started leaking water at the base all over the floor, it was fixed as soon as we reported the problem. I'm not saying our stay was horrible, but I think it's worth it to spend a few extra $$ and stay in a larger, more comfortable beachfront hotel.

<Content>Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel was great!!!!! My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Circle Hotel August 26 until August 31, 2004 and had a wonderful time. The room was clean, the hotel staff friendly, courteous, and very accomodating to our needs. I would highly recommend this hotel. Also, every night we could sit on our balcony and watch a Hawaiian show across the street with the ocean as the background. It was beautiful!

<Content>Great Place To Stay I just returned from a week's stay at the Waikiki Circle Hotel. I had an Ocean View Room. It was very good. The room was small but of an acceptable size. The refrigerator was a nice bonus. The shower was a nice size (compared to some in European hotels I have visited). The location was what really made it a great stay - across the street from the beach and right on the main drag of Waikiki. The front desk staff was knowledgeable and very helpful. The coffee bar in the morning was a nice touch as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Waikiki.

<Content>Had a great stay at the Circle My wife and I just returned from Waikiki and a stay in the Circle Hotel for a week. They did everything they said they would do and more. The ocean front rooms provide a breathtaking view of the ocean and the activity on the beach. If your looking for a fancy hotel the circle isn't it, the rooms are small but adequate, they are clean and as long as you put out the sign to service the room everything is cleaned and refreshed daily. The in room refrigerator works well and keep your beverages cold, the safe was also a nice amenity. The staff is pleasent and they do all they can to be helpful. The tour desk in the lobby is excellent and they were extremely helpful in booking Luau's and tours. We will not hesitate to return to the Circle on our next visit.

<Content>Best little budget hotel My sister and I travelled the states for 24 nights, our last 6 nights was spent at Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel. This our first time to the U.S and we loved it.This is a neat, tidy and a laid back hotel in which the ocean views of Waikiki Beach were breathtaking.Close to all shopping,beach and everything you need to relax before heading back to the hussle  bustle. This hotel was perfect for us as all we needed was a decent bed, good bathroom and to die for views.

<Content>Neat little hotel We just returned from a stay at the Circle Hotel. It was only a 2 day stop from an inter Island flight to home. I wish it was a longer stay. The hotel has a very uncrowded feel while being in the best part of Waikiki. View units are definitely the way to go here as you can see the surfers, beachgoers, and special events on Kalakaua. It is a great base of operations for surfing during the summer and is close to the sights in the Waikiki area from the Zoo to the International Marketplace. I see a lot of bad comments about the small shower. It is small but plenty of room to shampoo and soap up...I wonder what other people use the shower for. I also notice that some people are not familiar with how to use a shower curtain.The room was very clean and big enough for what I do in Hawaii (which is not to spend all day inside). Service was just fine, no complaints at all. I will definitely go back, and next time, I'll bring friends.

<Content>Will only EVER stay at the Aston Waikiki Circle! We have stayed at the Aston Waikiki Circle a total of nine times between 1978 (before Aston)and 2001 and cannot even imagine staying anywhere else in Waikiki. The staff has never changed in all those years and we have become friendly over the years. Going back each time is like re-visiting old friends! They are wonderful to us and we have no complaints at all. The rooms ARE small but have all you would need as a place to sleep and the view CANNOT be beat! If you look, you can find a great rate too. I would only book into an ocean view or oceanfront room though for the best location. Going back in 2005 and cannot wait!

<Content>We thought it was great!!! Before our holiday, we read some of the reviews for the Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel. Some of the reviews were not very complimentary, and we felt a little apprehensive about our choice...but, what a surprise! The location of the hotel is fabulous, and it's a wonderful feeling to walk out in the morning to sea Waikiki Beach and swaying palm trees. The room was clean and comfortable, and we were provided with fresh towels and soap, etc, on a regular basis. The staff were very helpful on our arrival and throughout our stay. Also, the Aloha Express tour desk downstairs made our visit run smoothly and enabled us to make the most of our stay in Hawai'i - we enjoyed trips around Oahu, and also to the Big Island to visit the volcanoes. We had a very special trip with our daughter and hope to go again in the future - and we would definitely return to the Aston Waikiki Circle. It was a pleasure.

<Content>Good location I stayed here with a school group for 2 nights. The rooms were very small and we had 5 people in a room. There are no rollaways either. The location is great, although Waikiki is a bit touristy. The hotel has a great tropical theme.

<Content>Great deal, perfect location! When my husband and I decided to stay at the Waikiki Circle this April, it was mainly for its convenient location (right across from the beautiful Waikiki beach, close to the International Market), but we got much, much more. First of all, the hotel didn't lie about the ocean view. The partial ocean-view room we booked offered an impressively expansive view. Second, I found the hotel very clean and the staff helpful (not artificially cheerful). Third, considering its location, this hotel is cost-friendly. Finally, the fastest elevator in town! Because this hotel is small, I never had to wait around for the elevater to arrive (like I did at other bigger and more expensive Waikiki hotels in the past). When you're back from the beach all wet, being able to catch the elevator right away is a GOOD thing. For those who are looking for a resort-type vacation, this hotel won't do. But I'd definitely stay at the Waikiki Circle again for its location, view, and value!

<Content>Great stay!! Stayed in the Circle the first 5 days of June and it was great!! The clean rooms are small due to the circle shape of the hotel but the views from the 12th floor ocean front lanai are fantastic; Diamond Head to the east and Honolulu to the west. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Free use of beach towels, ice, personal items, downstairs phone, maps, and suggestions. Days of entertainment within walking distance. Beach across the street is gorgeous. Everyone is friendly and courteous. Plenty of places to eat both cheap and expensive. Your choice. Great street entertainment. Careful of the Ladies of the Night, they are aggressive. Go to the international market and barter for everything. They will practically pay you to take it!! Great bargains here. If you wait and purchase things to take home elsewhere, you will pay 3X the price. Ship things like coconuts and pineapples to loved ones. Great gift from Hawaii to find in your mailbox. Hope to stay at the Circle again! Aloha...sas

<Content>cheap but definetly not nasty My friend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 days in May 2004. We thought the hotel was great, yes the rooms were small, but you could not find fault with it. The rooms were extremly clean, the staff were fantastic. Always ready to put themselves out(especially with the iron and the ice).. Right across the road from the beach and only a couple of blocks from all restuarants and night life. I would recommend The Waikiki Circle to any one who wants a nice clean tidy room, friendly staff, close to evrything..(because you are on holiday to sight see, not to spend time in your room)We will be back.......

<Content>will stay again This hotel is in a great location to all of Waikiki. Rooms are small, but most budget hotel rooms are.Suitable for 2 adults, more would be a little crowded. Rooms are decorated cute and have beenupgraded last year. I found everyone to be helpfuland never had a problem while there for 10 nights.I paid for city view and was upgraded to partial ocean view, beautiful view on high floor, I think I would ask for a littte lower floor was very windy on my lanai. I will stay again there providing they offer the 5th night free and free upgrade to POV.I have stayed at almost every budget hotel in Waikiki, this one is great.

<Content>Great Location The hotel in itself is small..The only great thing about the Hotel is the location. Right across the street of Waikiki beach..You can go to the beach any time without having to take a bunch of stuff..The service was o.k. Our room was small..I read that the bathroom was tiny but never really thought it was. Believe me its tiny..It wasn't a bad hotel for the price we got it..I just wanted something really close to the beach..I would go back just for the location its in.

<Content>What a Great View! We stayed here in March of 2004. The rooms were small, but clean. This is not a fancy place. The rooms had an in room safe and fridge. The view from the balcony is incredible. We got a complimentary upgrade to full ocean view. I could have thrown a rock from the balcony and it land in the ocean. The staff was courteous and helpful. I plan to stay here again on my next trip to Hawaii.

<Content>Great Value, Wonderful View and Location We spent a week in Room 503 during May 2003 and could not have had a better time! It was the first trip to Hawaii for our 15 year old son.We paid extra for an oceanfront room, and were glad we did. On checking in, I requested a room no higher than the 6th floor so we could see all the action on the street. The staff was glad to grant my request. Since we paid a VERY low rate, we didn't expect a spectacular room (we don't go to Hawaii to stay in the room) but it was clean and comfortable enough for the 3 of us. The room was pretty small and the bathroom was tiny, but it had a big mirror and a nice-sized countertop to keep all our toiletries on. We also chose this hotel because it had an in-room refrigerator which allowed us to save money on breakfast and evening cocktails.Waking up to the spectacular view, having our Cheerios and orange juice, watching the waves, sipping Mai Tais and watching the sunset all from the private lanai was just priceless. My husband and son both surfed twice every day, and the hotel had a secure place on the ground level to store their boards which could be accessed anytime. If you go surfing, beware of the locals -- they don't mean well to the tourists. Otherwise it was a perfect vacation.I think the people who were unhappy with this hotel must have paid a lot higher room rate than we did, which might account for their higher expectations and comments that other hotels right on the beach were only a few dollars more. We booked through orbitz and didn't pay anywhere near $107 per night for our oceanfront room!We'd go back in a heartbeat if we hadn't purchased our own condo in Waikiki last month.

<Content>A Great Deal My husband and I have stayed here for our vacation the last two years, and we think it is a great deal. The ocean view and ocean front rooms provide an absolutely beautiful view of Waikiki Beach. The lanai is very comfortable and a great place from which to watch the sunset. Yes, the rooms are small, but we have always found them clean. The rooms have air conditioning, cable Tv and a refrigerator. The staff have always been courteous and helpful. Our only complaint is that my husband is a light sleeper and is sometimes awakened by the noise of neighboring doors closing, which he says is quite loud. Overall, we have been pleased and would stay here again. It's on the quiet end of Waikiki and you can't beat the price.

<Content>Excellent Value We just got back from a stay at this hotel March 10-16 and couldn't be happier with our choice. This hotel is right in the center of the action. We got an Ocean View room which has an angled view of the beach. The balcony is huge  we would sit out in the early afternoon  watch the surfers. The room itself is medium sized  includes a safe, a small fridge  a hair dryer. The bathroom is very small  there is no tub--just a very small shower. The room  hotel was very clean. It is an older hotel, but it seemed as if most of the hotels there are this way. Service was ok--we had to wait 30 minutes to check in as they only had a small desk with one person working. The location though is unbelievable. I would not stay anywhere else, with the exception of the Sheraton Moana ($245 a night). However, we got our room at $107 a night  I still can't believe what a deal it is. We had considered the Radisson, Doubletree, Ohana Waikiki Surf  Ohana Waikiki East  am glad we didn't stay there. Those hotels are all several blocks back from the beach  the area they are in is not as good. If you are looking for a hotel in this price range, don't consider anything else. Feel free to e-mail me if you have questions.

<Content>SERVICE WAS NOT GOOD! The customer service at this hotel is horrible. Do not expect anything other than a cheap(er) room. Most the staff we dealt with seemed really annoyed to answer any questions or give any directions. Dont be fooled into thinking that the excursion booth is there to help you. Overall, the location is great, but the customer service was somewhere else.

<Content>Great Value! Great View! Right in the center of everything! This hotel is a great hotel as far as budget hotels go in Waikiki. It's location can't be beat, right there on the beach. There are many restaurants within a 5 minute walk either way. The view is amazing. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Sure the bathroom is small, but it is functional. We went to Oahu to explore the island and go to the beach, not sit in our room all day. For a place to sleep and shower, it is great. It is not luxury, but when you consider the great rate, you are getting an excellent deal. We would stay there again for sure. Just go there expecting a nice clean, safe budget hotel right on the beach and you will not be disapointed!!!!!!!

<Content>Location was the best!! My husband and I have gone to Oahu for the past 5 years and every year we get to stay a little longer each time we were there this time for 2 weeks. We enjoy our time in Hawaii more than I can explain. In able to allow us to stay longer we have to take the bargins that are on the internet. We give up alot of extras to be in the place we love. The Coral Reef was nothing fancy, but had a great location. The frount dest crew were not very friendly, anytime you needed their services they acted like you were interupting them. The bellman and the security crew were great help and friendly. Our favorite out of the whole hotel was Miltilda our maid. She was the nicest person we met this time in Hawaii..She always had our rooms(we went with 6 other people) clean and any extras we needed she made sure were left in our room..The worst thing about our stay at the Reef was at check out time everyone in our party was subject to false charges. My husband and I were charged 12 days of parking when we never rented a car..Our friends did rent one for 2 days and they paid for one day of parking and we paid for one, well so we thought! After refusing to pay the extra charge(after 30 minutes of debating with the frount desk personnel then the manager) we paid for 2 days parking, so we could leave and enjoy our last day there..After returning home, we found out one of our friends were billed on their credit card(after checkout) for the remaining bill they were trying to get us to pay..Well that just about topped it for us. We will not stay there again. Check your credit card statement If you stay!

<Content>Had a great time We just got back after staying 5 nights at the Aston Waikiki Circle hotel. We had such a good time that we booked an additional night. The rooms were clean and for 4 people the bathroom size was sufficient. The ocean view was spectacular! We spent alot of time in the morning on the balcony watching the sufers, boats, waves and people. The location was great, great, great. My co-worker recommended this hotel as she and her family always stay here. I will definetly thank her for her recommendation. As for an ecomony hotel it was great.

<Content>Wonderful location, employees, facilities........ We arrived six hours late due to flight problems and checked in at midnight. We asked for the highest floor possible since we had ocean-front reservations. Was told that the 5th floor was the best available, but to check back next day around noon. Was moved up to 12th floor and had splendid views from our balcony. Room was small which we expected from other reviews BUT very clean  attractive. We NEVER had the first problem with anything or anyone there. I have stayed next door for about 3 times what we paid. I am returning a year from March and will never stay anywhere else unless The Circle is sold out. My advice to anyone considering this hotel is grab it quick (except for a year from March).

<Content>You Shoulda Stayed There Before the Remodel Caveat emptor is usually the phrase of the day when staying at admittedly budget hotels which this used to be before it had a serious upgrade/remodel in 1996. I stayed at The Waikiki Circle Hotel twice a year (usually April and first two weeks of December) from 1982-1995. At the time the place was in some disrepair and sorely needed a facelift, as the Aston chain later gave it. The pro's and con's tilted squarely onto the pro side at that time due to a number of factors, the chief one being the obscenely low rates. In 1982 a high floor ocean view room was (brace yourself) $29.00 per night and at the end in 1995 around $65.00 a night. While in the US Army at Schofield Barracks (near Wahiawa) from 1976-'79, I discovered this little gem. The pro's were: directly across the street from Waikiki Beach; hotel parking ($2.00 per night in'82 and $8.00 in '95) and yes the slots are limited to about a dozen and are extremely narrow so rent the smallest subcompact you can if you intend to stay here; restaurants, stores, attractions close by; centrally located about midway down the island that is Waikiki (and on the prettier less trashy half); spacious lanais that afforded great people watching, sunsets and ocean views and finally did I mention how CHEAP it was? The con's were: air conditioners that were less than reliable (that's where being on a high floor helped due to ever present tradewinds); shabby decor: carpet that looked and felt similar to concrete; bathroom fixtures from the '40's; flimsy louvres near closet and sliding glass doors that rattled at night and finally, as all hotels and homes are wont to have in Hawaii, copius amounts of cockroaches. I can happily report however, after two subsequent stays (December 1997 and March 2002) that all of the pro's still endure (except the rates, of course, but the ocean view rooms are still about a third cheaper than other ocean view rooms along the beach) and that the con's have been eliminated with the remodel. We saw nary a cockroach on either stay but those parking slots are as miniscule as ever. Overall, bearing in mind that this property is over 50 years old, it is still asthetically pleasing, comfortable (perhaps crowded if more than 2 are in a room) and a relative bargain. I would recommend to anyone, except perhaps Donald Trump. Besides, you'll be out discovering the natural beauty of Hawaii and all that Aloha anyway!

<Content>Mahalo Mahalo Mahalo We left Waikiki on December 27, 2003. We had an excellent stay at the Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel. The staff were helpful and pleasant to deal with. The room were small but comfortable and great for resting and sleeping needs. We had a breath taking view from our ocean view room. And talking about being right on the beach! There you are, just walk across the street less than 25 meters and you are on Waikiki beach. It couldn't have been better! The hotel accommodations were basic and limited, but a health center was next door and most all other accommodations were in close walking distance from the hotel. The hotel parking was somewhat questionable and crowded but I always found a place to park. Now for food! I wouldn't eat at the hotel restaurant it was kind of scary. However, there many excellent restaurant and other places to eat all over Waikiki. Most of the restraunts also provided great entertainment and the best drinks. The Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel is more consistent with a Motel 6 motel. But we enjoyed out great stay at the Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel and we plan to stay their again upon our return to Waikiki.The Spells family

<Content>Nice small hotel The location is great. Right in front of the beach in the middle of the strip. The staff was very nice. Room size was average. The restroom was very small. THe view from the room was beautiful. We weren't in the room that often anyways. Just there to sleep and shower after coming from the beach.

<Content>Excellent Value If you want room service, and a massive room, bar fridge and huge shower, onsite pools and resturant dont stay here. (Go pay double price at Sherraton or Hyatt) If you want great value, absolutely fantastic views from your Lanai, DEFINITELY STAY HERE. The rooms were clean and serviced excellently. The bed comfy. In room safe for free. It is opposite not only the Waikiki beach but opposite a small show area where evening shows come on. Nothing better sitting back watching the night go by with a beer,great view, live show etc. (thats if your in your room at night) You cant go passed this place for value for money. Some cheap hotels are dumps, this is maintained well. Yes, the check-in is small, but so what, you only check in and out. They have a tour booking service office which is manned by very friendly staff. Most definitely will stay here again. Also close to all shops, market place, and of course transport.

<Content>so disappointed The view is awesome but it's not worth staying at this hotel. Hotels next door is much better with same prices.Aston Waikiki Circle looks very old in really. The decoration is the worst that I've seen. The room is so ugly and unorganized. Service is real bad.If you have kids and the kids don't care about the place they sleep, then this hotel might be your choice.

<Content>worst hotel This hotel is across the street from the beach. But there are many other hotels at even better location and even right on the beach. The hotel is too old, and too small inside. The reception area is like a ticket booth. There is no door to get inside the hotel. There are two elevators next to the reception booth. Service is bad. I informed the receptionist two days in advance that I was going to check out late and will pay for the extra charge. The receptionist agreed. But on the last day, I was locked out. I came down and asked the receptionist why because I've already informed her about checking out late. She responded: two days ago is different. Today is today!!! I asked for the manager. The manager wasn't there!. Last time, I went to waikiki and stayed at the hotel next door. The price was $7 more per day but the hotel is much more beautiful. I will never stay or recommend Aston Waikiki Circle to anyone.

<Content>Awesome Value I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks and was amazed from the first night I stepped in the door how clean and well maintained the room was. I paid for a partial ocean view room and wasn,t expecting much of a view but I could see all the way down Waikiki beach and out to sea. Breathtaking! Staying here made my holiday so much better. Especially since I fell sick for a few days but I was still able to sit on my balcony and check out everything that was going on around me. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Clean, Cheap, Great Location, Great Views. It doesn.t have facilities such as a restaurant, room service or bar but you don.t need it! You have the whole of Waikik beach and all its bars and restaurants to chose from. I would definately stay here again. 10 out of 10.

<Content>Good Enough The rooms are definitely economy and the shower is tiny. Most of the time we stayed on our lanai and looked out at the ocean. The room was clean enough and the staff was helpful enough. Most of the hotels in Honolulu looked as run down as this place, charging much more. It was good enough, considering we were there to explore Hawaii, not hotels. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great location!!!!!! This Hotel had to have been the absoute best deal in town. Sure the bathrooms are a little small but how much time do you actually spend in there? The beach is literally like 50 feet away. I couldn't have asked for more, we had a partial ocean partial city view and it was fantastic. In the downstairs lobby there is a day trip counter with great deals on any trip you want to do on the island or any other island. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I would definatley stay there again!

<Content>Loved It!! I have stayed at the Circle several times, just came back from staying there for 17 nights. I am slightly handicapped and have stayed there by myself when I need a vacation. The location is supurb, the view fantastic and the hotel help is very nice. I have noticed in reading these reviews that either people love it or they hate it. I'm at a loss to explain why some people don't like it. I always ask for the deluxe ocean view. I have never been disappointed. It's not the best hotel I have ever visited but the location and view are beyond words. Shirley Esralian Aloha, Oregon

<Content>Should be classied as hotel This hotel destroyed our honeymoon. The hotel in reallity doesn't look as good as in the pictures. This hotel should be rated as cheap motel. The room is tiny. The floor is dirty and very old. Everything in this hotel is very old. The shower room is the smallest in the world. I need to stand and don't feel comfortable turning around in the shower room even I'm only 120 pounds. The hotel next door charges only $10-$25/day more but worth the price. There are about 15 hotels right accross from the waikiki beach offering wonderful view. So don't stay at this hotel because of the cheaper price. Here is the list of the hotels that I recommend. The location are perfect and they charge decent price.Aston Waikiki Beach Tower Aston Waikiki Beachside Hyatt Regency WaikikiOutrigger Waikiki on the Beach Pacific Beach HotelSheraton Moana Surfrider Sheraton Princess Kaiulani

<Content>Fantastic View!!!!!!!!!!!  The Waikiki Circle is my favorite place to stay! We sat on the Lanai for breakfast every morning and just took in the breathtaking view. The water is such a beautiful color!! We had a partial ocean view room, but if we walked out on to the lanai and turned toward the ocean, their was a fantastic, unobstructed view of the ocean and beach. We turned the chairs to face the beach with the little table in front of us with our breakfast on it. We could have stayed there all day! But there is so much to do on Oahu that we didn't spend much time in our room. The fact that the room wasn't large wasn't a problem. We don't go to Hawaii to sit around in our room. The room was clean and the bed spreads were particularly lovely. I will positively return!!!!

<Content>Ok But .... Great location. When the hotel ad reads economy believe it. The rooms are small. The shower is almost nonexistant BUT the view is to die for. The rooms are clean and the staff is pleasant. If you are looking for even something comparable to a Holiday Inn you are going to be VERY disappointed.

<Content>Best Hawaiian Experience I can't say enough about this place - it's absolutely the best deal in town! Visited May 2003. The hotel was exactly what we were looking for: great location steps from the beach, restaurants  shopping, it was very affordable, clean, safe and the staff was friendly. In fact, both John's at the Registration Desk were courteous and helpful; they made us feel truly welcome. The hotel is obviously not new, but it was quite comfortable - the A/C was great and I loved having a fridge in the room. I would definitely choose to stay here again!
