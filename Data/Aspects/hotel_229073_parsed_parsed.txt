<Content>Hip Boutique Hotel Meets Traditional We really liked the Bernini Palace for a number of reasons, but perhaps the most important one was the fabulous breakfast that was included. It was wonderful to wake up and dine in such a beautiful room, with an excellent, high quality selection of food and some of the best service we have ever experienced. Check out some of the other reviews for pictures of the room, because it is so gorgeous it's hard to describe in words. Our rooms were clean and bathrooms were spotless. Decor is traditional with high ceilings, but the lobby is more like boho chic. The lobby is small but serviceable. The location is central to everything, only a block or so away from the Piazza della Signoria. Everyone at the Bernini Palace was very friendy and attentive. I did a lot of research on Trip Advisor before selecting the Bernini Palace. There were many many positive reviews of this hotel and that greatly influenced my decision to stay there. We were not disappointed at all!

<Content>Great location and very stylist hotel I stayed at Bernini Palace for a business trip and found the rooms to very luxurious and quiet. I stayed on the Tuscan executive floor and a colleagues of mine stayed in rooms also on the Tuscan floor and the premium rooms. I received very positive feedback from all my collesgues on the hotel. Breakfast is served in a beautiful room with a very nice continental buffet style breakfast and excellent service. The hotel location is superb and close to all the main sights.It is an expensive hotel and definitelty worth the money.

<Content>classy and clean My husband and I loved this hotel. It was convenient to nearly everything (the Pitti was a trek, but so what), breakfast was wonderful, the staff were helpful, the rooms and common areas were very clean. The lobby and bar were really very nice, and made us feel like we were staying somewhere really special. A funny side note-- everybody who's been there knows that public bathrooms in Italy are rare-- the bathroom in our lobby was always spotless and stocked-- a great help in between running from place to place. The building outside was under construction, but we rarelty heard anything- miraculous.

<Content>Great Location, Very Nice Hotel, Staff is okay My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights during our honeymoon in October of 2007. Here's what I liked about the hotel:LOCATION: It was about a 5 minute walk to two great museums - the Uffizi which houses many of Botticelli's paintings (including Birth of Venice) and the Bargello which houses Donatello's sculpture of David. If you have time for only one, I would recommend the Uffizi. The Uffizi is adjacent to a very large square that has lots of restaurants, shops, and ATMs - hence anything you need is pretty close by. We took a cab from the train station to the hotel because we arrived in town late at night, but walked to the train station upon our departure (took about 20 minutes). Although it was my first time in Florence, I felt as though the city was pretty walkable in general.ROOM: The room was spacious by European standards - it fit a large bed (2 twins pushed together) with room to walk around, a desk, refrigerator, and TV. I did not care for the ornate room decor but I'm not living there so it didn't bother me. The bathroom was surprisingly large and everything appeared very clean and well-kept.BREAKFAST: The breakfast room was beautiful (felt light and airy) and the staff was friendly. They asked us what was liked to drink as we sat down. This was the only breakfast buffet we had in Italy but I thought it was very good. Here's an abbreviated list of what I recall them offering: pastries, breads, spreads, hard boiled eggs, smoked salmon, cold cuts (very good), cheeses, salad, cereals, yogurt, milk, juices, bottled water.What I did not like about this hotel:THE BED: As mentioned above, the large bed was actually two twins pushed together. When we tried to sleep close to each other or spoon, the beds would start to separate - so we ended up sleeping on our respective beds. I believe this is common in most European hotels though.FRONT DESK STAFF: After being in Italy for several days and reading some guide books, we finally learned that almost everyone at the hotel expects a tip - including the person at the front desk when doing any favor for us. Our receptionist walked us to our room, showed us all the amenities inside, and demonstrated how to use the phone. We were a little distracted from our train ride from Rome (almost got arrested and had money issues to clear up with American Express)- we tipped the porter but did not think to tip her. Our hotel booking came with two free tickets to the Boboli Gardens so when we came down the next morning to ask her to book the reservations for us, she had a sour look on her face. I was a little taken back and worried that we might have somehow offended her, but then realized that it was because we did not tip. Her mood was a little better after we slipped her what we thought was a generous tip (10 euros = $17 USD). Although this incident was annoying, it's not unique to this hotel.SUMMARY: Based on the rates that I've seen posted here for this hotel, we got it for a steal. In my opinion, I would not stay here for any rate higher than $250. I would rather pay less for a hotel (without sacrificing comfort and safety) and use the difference to eat at nice restaurants or take a guided day tour to Sienna. Setting all analysis aside, I really liked the vibe of the hotel. My husband and I are the kind of people that love to splurge on high quality things (hotels, food, etc.) without the fuss. This hotel felt quality without making you feel uncomfortably out of place.

<Content>Great Hotel, wonderful location We stayed here for three nights and loved every minute. We booked into one of the eight Executive Tuscan rooms...pricey but worth it. The rooms are large and luxuriously furnished and each evening there was proseco and canapes laid out in a small lobbey shared bythese eight rooms along with coffee, fruit and pastries the rest of the day. The location is absolutely perfect....no more than a ten minute walk to almost anywhere in Florence and a two minute walk to the Ufizzi. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful or friendly and they were very helpful in arranging tickets/tours for us. We had dinner in the hotel one night and it was very good but even better were the two restaurants recommended by the concierge. One of them, The Golden View was a very trendy modern bistro that had wonderful live jazz.. This was our second stay at a Baglioni hotel (Luna Baglioni in Venice is wonderful too) and I would definatelly recommend them. Can't wait to return!

<Content>Favorite Hotel in Italy We arrived in Florence and after walking from Santa Maria Novella all the way to the hotel, we found that there was a problem with our booking. So Bernini Palace moved us for one night to a nearby hotel, the Borghese Art Hotel (which is also beautiful and I'd recommend it too). They were very apologetic and arranged for a cab with fare to take us the short distance of one block to the hotel. They also arranged for us to dine at the Bernini Palace in-house restaurant that night. The next night we came back to the Bernini Palace and received an upgraded room on the Executive Floor. This hotel is not only gorgeous, but the staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast room is very nice with tons of options. This was our second city on our honeymoon itinerary and we ruled it the best hotel - very romantic and centrally located.

<Content>Loved the Bernini Palace We arrived at the Bernini Palace only to find that my husband had left his camera in our cab. The people at the front desk called the cab company and within minutes the cab driver brought back his camera. The people at the front desk were so very nice and helpful any time we asked for anything. Our room was very nice and very clean. After staying in some not so great hotels earlier in our trip, we felt like we were in the lap of luxury. We had some clothes cleaned and they were returned on time. We ate at the hotel's restaurant our first night. The bar was elegant and dinner was good (expensive!). The location is great - just a short walk to the Piazza della Signoria. Breakfast was served in a beautiful high-ceiling room and was delicious everyday.

<Content>It was a memorable stay I stayed at Hotel Bernini for 4 days in december 2007 with my four year old son. The room was big, very clean and comfortable. I was really impressed. Location is also great, very central and you can easily walk around to shops,restaurants  museums. It is also very quite. Some of the staff can't really speak English  it was a bit fustrating at times, although i did come across a lady who was really helpful , knowledgeable  patient!. I certainly recommend this hotel to other travellers.Can't wait to stay there again the next time i visit Florence!.

<Content>Loved the Bernini Palace Our family of two adults and three children stayed at the Bernini Palace for three nights. We had heard that the rooms were quite small, so we booked Superior Double and Triple rooms. The rooms were small, but no smaller than many European hotels. I can't imagine how small the normal rooms would be! However, the rooms were beautifully appointed. All furnishings were great. The bathrooms were small also, but ours managed to have a separate shower and bath,so not too cramped! The triple room for the kids was larger and had a fold-up bed. They had a nice window looking out to the street. We all thought that the bar here was the best of our trip. It is so beautiful! The staff remembered what drinks we all had and even which nuts we preferred - great service. We were here in Winter, so the whole place was not busy, so maybe that helped? Also, the reception staff were friendly and helpful. I wanted internet access, so was given a laptop and sat in the bar -- very pleasant.The breakfast room is a lovely, large space and again, staff were good. Breakfast had enough chocolate croissants and hot chocolates to please the children!In addition, staff happily recommended really great places to eat. The location is wonderful- easy, quick walk to everything. We felt happy every time we walked in the door.

<Content>A lovely stay at the Bernini Palace We recently returned from a 4 night stay at The Bernini Palace. Our room was small but beautifully furnished. The breakfast room was lovely and the food itself was adequate. You can't beat the location of the Bernini Palace - we walked everywhere. A word of caution if you have a disability and find it difficult to climb stairs. The Bernini Palace was once a real palace, and even though there is an elevator, you still must climb stairs to get to your room. There are not a lot of stairs, but some, so if this is a problem for you, you may want to look elsewhere. Overall, our experience was lovely.

<Content>Excellent Central Location The staff and service were exceptional. Room was small but elegant and very quiet. But best of all for us was the location. The central location was ideal as we were within easy walking distance of every point of interest on our agenda. Very nice breakfast available in the mornings. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Florence Stayed in this fantastic hotel on a recent trip to Florence. I had a wonderful weekend break which was made even better by this lovely hotel. I stayed in room 504 which was beautiful; breakfast in Sala Parlemento was excellent and the staff were all very professional and friendly. Definitely a place I will return to in the not too distant future.

<Content>Beautiful hotel, mediocre service This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Unfortunately, the front of house service is not up to scratch, especially for the price (420 euros for a double Tuscan room, 300euros for a single). One of the receptionists (apparently the senior front-of-house person) was very terse, bordering on the unfriendly. On our first night, as we sat down for the dinner we had booked, we were told to vacate our table for 5 minutes as the table was being used for a photo-shoot. Inevitably this soon became 10 minutes and so forth. No-one seemed to care that we were left hanging around for our table to be free. On another evening I phoned for room service. After 2 further calls to reception, I had to go down myself to chase up the order. The same (dark-haired) head receptionist was, I felt, very offish when asked what was happening. When it arrived, the order was wrong. This was intensely frustrating.On the day of our departure, I asked the same receptionist to arrange a cab to the airport for 11.00 am. At 11.15, as we waited patiently in the foyer with no other guests occupying the staff, I asked if it was on its way. She had completely forgotten my request. All things considered, this is still, potentially, a great place to stay. The nibbles left out for patrons of the Tuscan floor are a nice touch and the breakfast is superb. Unfortunately, the quality of service at reception left a lot to be desired and, frankly, spoilt the experience. The notable exception to this was Orlando the avuncular concierge.

<Content>Good location and value Everybody agrees the location cannot be beaten. Amazingly quiet. Helpful staff and clean room with comfortable bed. Breakfast is good, while the dining room is superb. The entrance and lobby are basic, but there is a comfortable bar. Old building, but well maintained and clean. Overall, good value.

<Content>Only stay on the Tuscan floor! We booked this hotel as part of our honeymoon trip. When we arrived we were shown to our room which was large but unfortunately very tired in appearance. Despite the images on their website it was not very opulent and was a mix of uninspiring furniture, chintz and a worn carpet. The bathroom was no better and had dirty grout and chipped tiles.My husband went to the desk to complain and to their credit they showed us other rooms - this time a suite and a regular double but the same in decor. We explained that we wanted something a bit more befitting for a honeymoon and they upgraded us free of charge to a room on the Tuscan Floor. Although not large the room was very nice with lovely furnishings and a large newly decorated bathroom. The hotel staff were very pleasant and recommended some nice restaurants and museums etc 鈥?it was a nice touch that on the Tuscan Floor pastries and coffee are left out in the afternoon and prosecco and nibbles in the evening for guest to help themselves to.I would gladly recommend this hotel but only if people stay on the Tuscan Floor 鈥?until they are redecorated the other rooms are not worth the money.

<Content>We, too, loved this hotel We, too, loved this hotel as some of the other reviewers have posted. The location is perfect. The hotel is up to date and beautiful. Our room actually had a little leak in the ceiling which was fixed right away. I think that comes with the older buildings. The breakfast was similar to the other breakfasts we had had in two previous hotels. Just an average, buffet breakfast. The staff was very nice and courteous. I would stay in this hotel again. I thought it was a great value for the money we spent. It also has a lovely bar, lounge area that is great for a wind down after a busy day in Florence. We noticed lots of Americans staying at the Bernini! If you need a computer, bring your own as they do not have a business center. They do offer a little laptop to use in the lobby but the connection is very slow and difficult to use.

<Content>So Terrible we left! My husband and I booked this hotel for our recent honeymoon. Upon arrival we were very optimistic because the lobby is very nice and the staff seemed friendly.While we were waiting to check into our room we were very upset that people would ask for a key and without id they were just given the key.When we finally gave us our key to check in, we were very disturbed. The room was very dingy and tiny, but that was not the worst problem. The bedspread was filled with what appeared to be burnholes. My husband went down to the front desk to ask if there was a different room available- they told him there was not, but that they would send someone up with a new bedspread.Over an hour later there was no sign of anyone coming to change the bedspread- which was totally disgusting, so we decided to call our travel agent at American Express and go somewhere else.When we left their only concern was that we know that we were not going to be refunded. No mention about how sorry they were that they had to have a customer leave because of disgust

<Content>Nice hotel in the center of town This hotel was lovely, newly renovated and very centrally located. We had 2 large rooms with a private hallway connecting them, which was perfect for our family with young children. The rooms are decorated with beautiful antiques, as is the entire hotel - the breakfast room is particularly beautiful. The staff was helpful and our stay was enjoyable.

<Content>Great location, great service We used this hotel for a week as a base for my daughter's wedding in Florence - so we had about 12 rooms. The management couldn't have been more helpful, particularly David Foschi, the reception manager who did everything possible to make our stay as comfortable and convenient as possible.The first floor of the hotel has recently been refurbished, Tuscan style, and these rooms are sizeable and beautifully appointed - very stylish and in keeping with the area.The position of the hotel is perfect - right by the Palazzo Vecchio and Uffizi Gallery, 2 minutes from the Ponte Vecchio and 3 minutes from the Duomo - but despite its central location it manages to be very peaceful - with a cool (in all senses) bar to retreat to.Great, historical breakfast room with great big and varied breakfasts - and a lovely little roof terrace if you want to chill out for a bit, several floors above the Florentine hubbub.I'm normally hypercritical of hotels (see review on Villa del Quar) but I can't speak highly enough of this one. This is the only place I would ever stay again on further visits to Florence.

<Content>Loved this hotel! Just returned from my Italy trip which included two nights at the Bernini...and we just loved it. We were 4 tourists and we had rooms 204 and 205...not adjoining but next to each other. They were huge rooms that were elegantly furnished with beautiful bathrooms....lots of space and lots of amenties. I had a laptop which plugged into their system which gave me free internet while I was in my room and in the lobby there is free wifi access. The breakfast room was large and comfortable with a wonderful selection of foods and the service was quick and helpful.The front desk was equally friendly and helpful.The location is very central so that you can walk to almost all the major sites.I would certainly recommend this hotel and I personally would stay here on my next trip...

<Content>Great location but... The Bernini is located at walking distance from all major attractions in Florence. However, the hotel is old (in the bad sense) and has not been well renovated. My room was very-very dark and smelled pretty bad. The TV set in the room was from the 80's. The hotel does not have wireless internet in their rooms (although most hotels in Italy do).I am not sure there are better options in Florence but...I will do more research next time.

<Content>Good hotel in the heart of Florence Excellent hotel in a great location.My wife and I stayed three nights here and the room was very nice and clean. We had a standard double room so it was fairly small, but the bed was comfortable, the bath room was relatively large and clean.The hotel staff were helpful and made excellent recomendations for dinner.We had never been to Florence or Italy for that matter, so we picked a this hotel that had a high star rating and good reviews and were not disapointed.

<Content>At the door step of the Palazzo Vecchio This hotel was included in our Tauk tour and what a great location. If it was any closer to the Palazzo Vecchio it would be in the square. All major attractions are within a 10 minute walk.The hotel has a quaint arrangement of half floors that require some navigation after the elevator (it used to be a governmnet bulding). Our room was non-smoking and included a queen size bed, good wardrobe and bath (shower, no tub).Hotel bar was very nice (order a drink and you get a great selection of appetizers)Be aware that the hotel is very expensive (by US standards) so trade off location with price consideratons

<Content>Unbeatable Location in Florence The Bernini Palace Hotel's selling point is its location in the historic center of Florence, a block from Piazza Signoria, three blocks from the Duomo in the undistinguished and busy Piazza San Firenze. Ask for a room that doesn't face the street--we didn't, but got lucky. The hotel's interior decoration is rather schizophrenic, the spare modernist lobby-lounge-bar area standing in sharp contrast to the heavily draped and brocaded guest rooms. I would have gladly traded our room's fancy trimmings for more floor, drawer, and closet space, though I could easily say the same about most city hotels I've stayed in--there's rarely enough drawer space. That said, our room was clean, very quiet, and well-maintained, the bathroom spacious and spotless. (I don't understand what Europeans have against shower curtains or full-width doors--it's so cold in the partially enclosed set-ups they seem to favor.) We didn't eat at the hotel at all, breakfast being extra and expensive. We grabbed coffee and pastry at a bar on the way to wherever we were going each day, and for dinner would particularly recommend Trattoria Gabriello, Via Condotta 54, just around the corner from the hotel--best bruschetta I ever ate. For fantastic gelato, don't miss Gelateria Vivoli, Isola delle Stinche 7, just a few blocks away near Santa Croce. The best part of our experience at the Bernini Palace actually took place after we got home. I realized I'd left behind a scarf that I'd bought in Venice and called, not really expecting anything. But the maid had in fact found and saved the scarf, so my cousin (who lives in Florence) stopped by and retrieved it. To me, that experience alone speaks volumes about the quality of both the staff and the management of this hotel. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Lovely 4 star hotel We stayed at this hotel for one night in March and the stay was fabulous in all areas. We were spending our honeymoon in Italy and were amazed by the art work inside the hotel, and the cleanliness of the rooms. The service was also first class. One thing to note (which is general for all hotels in Italy) is the lack of English channels. All in all, well worth it.

<Content>Pure luxury A lot has been said about this hotel and it is what prompted me to stay there. It's location is brilliant and close to everything. The DUomo, the Uffizi, The river, the major piazza's. The restaurant, being amazingly reasonably priced is a must for at least 1 night. I don't normally eat in the hotel restaurant's but this one has a fantastic ambiance, brilliant food and reasonable prices. The room itself, even for the standard one, is well finished, spacious and apart from a flat panel TV, has everything all good hotels do. Service is 5 star, in fact, I would rate this 5 star, not the 4 star (superior) it actually has.

<Content>Great Location Hotel Bernini is within walking distance of so many of the points of interest in Florence. You can walk out the front door and stroll to a plaza within minutes. We booked a private tour through the hotel, we visited the Tuscany wine areas, with stops at San Gimignano and Siena. Helena, our tour guide and driver was excellent. She was very knowlable and fashioned our tour to our interests. Hotel Bernini's foyer is a bit much with the gold glitz but the housekeeping is wonderful when they turn down your beds and light candles in your rooms at night. The breakfast room is huge, with a nice selection of foods with great background music playing. Stefano, the bartender is also highly recommended. He takes pride in preparing your drinks and tapas with the highest of care and quaility. We would defineitly stay at this hotel again. It's worth 5 stars!

<Content>Excelent hotel, tiny room A superb and very elegant place, right in the heart of this magnificent city.Our experience was very satisfying, with efficient and helpful concierge (not many smiles, but very courteous and professional in all dealings). Our bedroom was booked via an Expedia package and by coincidence or maybe as a consequence, was the smallest on the third floor - Room 308. However, despite the lilliputian dimensions, the room was spotless, sumptuously furnished, with a comfortable 5' bed and a gleaming chrome and marble bathroom.The cocktail lounge is very swish and served an awesome Negroni, accompanied by freshly made appetizers that made the experience very stylish indded.Close to some great neighbourhood restaurants, Florence's legendary shopping and the wonders of the Uffizzi, the Bernini Palace is a true Florentine classic.Next time, we shall spend a little more and go for a larger room - it will be a joy to return.

<Content>Good locaton with in easy walking distance to all attractions The hotel was an interesting mix of old and new. It was a palace with multiple half floors of rooms. The rooms were small but clean and comfortable. The concierge was polite but stiff. They lacked the warmth of some of some of the other hotels where we stayed.  The breakfast was great with good servers. The best we received during our two week stay in Italy (4hotels).

<Content>Nice Location but a bit gaudy We stayed at the Bernini on the last night of our tour of Tuscany and were a bit disapointed. We figured we would splurge a bit for our last night but I don't think we got our money's worth. The hotel is undeniably in a great location, right off the Piazza della Signora. Our room was comfortable but somehow we expected more from a five (or four depending which web site you look at -- they claim to be 5 star) star hotel. The decor was very overdone -- unless you like everything covered in gold leaf -- and then you'll feel right at home. The photos showing the hotel on expedia must be old because the hotel didn't quite look like the pictures. The breakfast room was really lovely, as was the breakfast -- until we found out at checkout that it cost 30 euro for the two of us -- even though we were told the breakfast was included when checking in. Overall -- the location was great but the hotel was not worth the price.

<Content>Loved the Bernini I'm just back from spending the Easter weekend at the Bernini Palace Hotel, Florence. From reading previous reviews I understand the reception and bar/lounge areas have just recently been upgraded - and what an upgrade! When walking in off the street first impressions are of a boutique hotel but on a very grand scale. The lighting, though a bit dull, adds to the atmosphere - contemporary meets a flavour of Morocco - fabulous.The breakfasts were fantastic though not included in our room price. One could spend all morning in the stunning breakfast room sampling the various dishes on offer.The roof terrace on the fifth floor became our little haven away from the hustle and bustle of the streets below.Our holiday experience was hugley enhanced by our stay at the Bernini. Loved it.

The breakfast was the best we had on our trip, and the breakfast room is an absolutley beautiful room. I especially liked the mimosas. The staff was nice and very friendly. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>If only all my hotel stays were like this... I stayed five nights at the Bernini and was thoroughly pleased. The staff spoke English, but tolerated my fractured Italian. They also were invariably helpful and friendly. Breakfast was included and was generous, including fruit, yogurt, cereal, baked goods, ham, cheese and enough Nutella to make me feel comfortable about grabbing a little extra each day! the room was clean and good-sized by European standards (140 Euros), with quality sheets and a bathroom that matched most American hotels for size and exceeded the Americans in clean, quality towels and fixtures. My room had a TV, but jet lag and fatigue from seeing all the sites keep me from saying anything about the channels or signal. None of this is the real reason to stay at the Bernini. Stay for the location. I figure I slept 150 yards from Boticelli's Birth of Venus and 200 yards from Donatello's David. No location could be more ideal and I look forward to visiting again.

<Content>Wonderful Florence Hotel We had a wonderful experience at the Bernini. Our room was a bit small. But perfectly clean and very livable...we also got a GREAT rate on Expedia, so we were paying WAY under the rate card, we couldn't complain.Turn down service every day, good chocolate on the pillow, very clean bathroom and even tidied our stuff if we left it out.We were there for 12 nights. We really got to know the staff and to love them. Francisco was our main bartender and our unofficial Italian tutor. Peter was also great. Good stiff drinks, if a bit expensive.We received wonderful reccommendations from the front desk for restaurants and activities. Boccanegra was a suprisingly good restaurant, and the Virgin Active spa gave the best hot rocks massage I've ever received...both were reccommendations of the hotel.There is no better location in Florence. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.Beware, breakfast may NOT be free based on your room rate...we found out the hard way...it is none the less DELICIOUS!

<Content>Loved the "white stuff" you put on the croissants!!!! I LOVED this elegant old hotel. My son had just moved to Florence and I had been staying with him. I stopped in the Bernini to see if I could get a room. They had a suite available for a very reasonable price. I stayed alone for a week and enjoyed every second of it!! I especially loved their breakfast.....that white cream or cheese or whatever it was that I put on their croissants was unbelievable!! I often wake up thinking about that stay and dreaming I am eating that white stuff!! I loved getting up, stopping down the way to get my latte and then headed for the internet cafe!! It is so much fun to do that. Everything is so close to that hotel. Even one of the world's most famous gelati stores!! I had about 3 of those a day! And at the end of the day I was always anxious to go to my wonderful hotel and crawl into that big, soft, squishy bed!!!! Stay there....you would love it.

<Content>a bit of a let down! We stayed in this hotel for the final 3 days of our honeymoon. Although when we arrived the staff were excellent (received champagne etc) and given a great room we didn't feel the hotel reflected 4 stars. There was no e-mail access or terrace and we found the staff very unhelpful and rude. Although very central we would not stay here again. We felt the hotel was not in the four star league!

<Content>Great location, but that's it We spent four nights at the Bernini. The location is excellent. Florence is small enough that you walk almost everywhere, but by staying here we were able to return to our hotel several times a day to freshen up, drop off packages, pick up umbrella, etc.If not for the location, we would have been very disappointed in the hotel. When we first checked in, we were given a very shabby room with dirty walls and carpets. We complained and were upgraded to a room that was better, but still did not have the charm we had experienced at other hotels during our trip to Italy. The breakfast was adequate, and the coffee not very good. Again, perhaps we were a little spoiled as we had excellent coffee everywhere else, even at Autogrill. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly, as was the bartender who loaned us his corkscrew and brought us limoncello while we were checking our email.Possibly the worst part of the hotel though was the smell in the lobby, which reeked of raw sewage. They really ought to do something about this.

<Content>beware of renovations Hotel Bernini Palace has a great location, but we encountered some problems while we were there. The hotel is undergoing renovations and the elevators were out most of the 6 days we were there. It was not enjoyable climbing to the 5th floor. The first room we were in overlooked a courtyard and there was a terrible smell coming from garbage from a restaurant below us. They did change us to a lovely room, but there was a lot of noise from the street below. This was early April and we had to keep the windows open because the room was stuffy and hot. There was not a rest room available on the lobby level due to renovations, nor was there computer access available. The staff did what they could to be accomodating. I sent 2 emails to Baglioni Hotels regarding our problems and have not heard from them, so I guess guests comments are not important to them. Before staying there, check about the status of the renovations and check the whereabouts of where your room will be. Location can't be beat, but there are drawbacks.

<Content>Recommend Bernini Palace I stayed in the Bernini Palace Hotel at Easter 2005. Although the lobby and first floor are recently under renovation the hotel is very, very good. Beautiful bedrooms with nice bathrooms and a great breakfast. And in the very middle of Florence. You can`t find anything better.

<Content>perfect location My entire family (husband, self and 3 kids) stayed here for a spring break vacation. The hotel was fabulous. Our rooms were huge and well appointed with spacious bathrooms. Upon arrival we were given a complimentary fruit and cheese tray to snack on in our kids room until my husbands' and my room was ready. Breakfast (in the ballroom) was wonderful; lots of choices and good food. The location couldn't be better; close to everything. Sorry to hear that some have had trouble with the staff. Our experience was very positive. The front desk staff handled beautifully a big problem we had . When we arrived and went to check in we were asked for our passports. (All hotels in Italy do this. It's a requirement..something about the police reigister city guests?) I went to get the passports out of my bag and realized that I had left all of our passports, airline and train tickets in the taxi we had just taken from the airport! I was in a panic but the front desk clerk calmly got the taxi company name from my husband, phoned the taxi company and apprised them of the situation. Within 30 minutes the taxi returned with all of our documents intact! Needless to say I gave the taxi driver a huge tip! I'll stay here again for sure!

<Content>Fabulous Firenze... As a combined birthday/anniversary surprise, I took my wife to Florence for a week early in September, having chosen the Bernini Palace based on Tripadvisor reviews.If anything, I felt the reviews didn't do the hotel justice. In terms of location, it was literally steps away from the Piazza della Signora, and within easy walking distance of all the other sights of Florence. The hotel itself has an air of faded grandeur, but is clean and airy. The standard of room was at least as good, if not better, than other 4 and 5 star European hotels I've stayed in. Breakfast was excellent, with a large range of food on offer.The staff I met - housekeeping, restaurant and front desk - were courteous, polite and helpful in the extreme, even to the point of upgrading our room at check-in when we told them why I'd booked the trip. Their restaurant recommendations were spot on, and they even put up with my terrible attempts at Italian!In conclusion, I can't wait to go back...

<Content>awesome hotel Bernini Palace is in an old Palace one block off the Uffizzi in Florence. It is beautiful and elegant, very beautifully decorated. The location is a 10 minue walk to all the sights in FLorence, it could not be better located, great especially if you don't have alot of time in FLorence. The hotel is very elegant, but reasonably priced. The rooms are huge, huge modern bathrooms, very luxurious. We had asked for a room with a view and looked into the interior walls of the hotel so this was alittle disappointing but no big deal. Breakfast is in an elegant room, huge and way above usual standards. The only negative was that it was unseasonably warm in Florence, the hotel controls the AC which was essentially off so the rooms were warm during the day, otherwise a perfect stay.

<Content>Great location We stayed at the Bernini for 3 nights in late Sept. The location is perfect. Very close to Piazza della Signoria, Uffizi, Arno River, and great restaurants. The breakfast was very good. The front desk was not friendly at all and kept us waiting in the lobby for our room for at least 30 min after telling us it would be ready in 5 min. The room is a decent size and the bathroom is very large. The elevators are very scary and loud.

<Content>Good Hotel, with a blemish The location is ideal for first time visitors to Florence. All of the major attractions and piazzas are just steps away. The breakfast buffet is wonderful. The lobby, while tired, was spacious. The lobby bar is always open, according to the front desk, but you have to go to the front desk and ask them to page the bar-keep every time you'd like another drink or snack. The room was comfortable and the bathrooms are nice. Internet connection was only available on one computer in the lobby at 6 euros per hour (you have to buy a card). It was hard to get a spot in line to use it. The blemish: They did not honor their quoted rate. Although I booked on their Internet website and guaranteed with a credit card, they charged me 80 euros per night extra because the computer did not give you the right rate. The front desk staff was indifferent to surly - not my expectation when paying more than $400 per night for a hotel room. In addition, there is a problem with one of their elevators that causes a very loud, low-frequency groan to shudder throughout the hotel every 3 or 4 minutes. It makes it difficult to go to sleep.

<Content>Accomodations Very Nice But Indifferent Service We stayed two nights at the Bernini Hotel in June 2004. The room accomodations are top notch, and the breakfast with complimentary copies of virtually all international newspapers was excellent. However, the service was mediocre and front desk unfriendly. We asked for assistance in obtaining reservations to avoid the very long lines to museums. The desk was absolutely unhelpful, and was not even aware that a reservation desk was located only blocks from the hotel across the river (after our own searching we discovered the same). When the power went out for about an hour, and we went to check on it, the desk was rude and acted like were imposing on them for simply asking when to expect we would have lighting. The accomodations are an excellent value in a great location, but don't anticipate friendly service.

<Content>Great Hotel! Terrible Front Desk!!! The hotel is elegant and very well situated. We had a lovely room on the third floor. Unfortunately, the staff at the front desk were very difficult. We had booked our room through the hotel's website. We needed to cancel one night, but the website would not allow the change. I called the hotel from the U.S. and as soon as I spoke English, they hung up on me. I then called back and began to speak French, and they hung up on me again. I called a third time the day before our arrival at the hotel, and again, they hung up on me when I spoke English. I had to get an Italian translator for the fourth phone call. The staff at the front desk was totally uncooperative about cancelling the one night even though we were within the cancellation period. They kept saying that we had to make the change on the website. When I showed them on the website that the reservation system would not process the cancellation, they said that they weren't paid to change a reservation and that it wasn't their problem! Despite the difficulties with the front desk, the hotel itself is magnificent and the personal staff (waiters, bell boys, etc.) were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Lovely Hotel in Lovely City We recently had a delightful stay at this hotel. Upon entering the lobby, the decor looks a little worn, but the rooms and the breakfast area are beautifully decorated. The staff was helpful, the breakfast buffet delicious, and the location just can't be better. You can walk anywhere and around every corner there is something to see.

<Content>Great Location, Difficult to Find My wife and I stayed here in the summer of 2003. One of the daunting tasks of Florence is to drive in it. We had taken a drive from Nice in the South of France and passed by Portofino on our way. It was a wonderful but tiring drive. A word of caution would be if you are going to drive a long distance and are staying in the bernini it will be difficult to find it. My advice would be that you call ahead and ask for a map to show you directions. Bear in mind Florence's ridiculous one way system and also there are some areas that do not allow you to drive ( which is a blessing by the way). Anyway once we found the hotel we gave them the car to park it for 4 days in their (overpriced 15 Euro a night) garage.When we got there what struck us was the ease and proximity to all of the main sites in Florence. Duomo 3 minutes walk, Uffizi less than one minutes walk. Ponte Vecchio 5 minutes walk etc. Pitti Palace and the exhausting but wonderful BOBOLI gardens 7-10 minutes walk.The rooms were wonderfully decorated in the classical Italian style. My only complaint was the loud carpet. The walls were covered in a sumptuous light yellow wallpaper. Rather large with only 2 English language channels which meant you were forced to go out and explore. We had a problem with our Bathroom where the water kept leaking from the shower which was very promptly fixed. The staff was very freindly and helpful. Breakfast was a pleasure served in a beautiful dining room with a full choice of food, from cereal to american breakfast to a continental breakfast and for all you health freaks fresh fruit and yoghurt.Florence was a walkers paradise. All you want to do is walk and look at all the wonderful buildings, galleries and restaurants and cafes.I asked the hotel for some recommendations for restaurants and were happy to oblige and recommend some restaurants. We ate at some pretty good places.Restaurant 1) Recommended by the hotel when we asked for a restaurant serving typically Tuscan food and where the locals eat. They recommended the Tirovino in Via Ghibelina which was a three minute walk from the hotel in one of the many little cobblestoned alleyways. Recommend the tuscan antipasti platter full of locally produced food.Restaurant 2) Il Cantastorie. What a fun restaurant! The owner sings opera while you dine semi al fresco. The only thing that spoiled it for me was the fact that despite i was in a Smoking section with smokers we had an annoying non smoker in the SMOKING SECTION huffing and puffing away. Nevertheless the food was average but the ambience (apart from the annoying non smoking stupid woman) was spectacular and man does that guy have a voice on him.Restaurant number 3) Enotecha Pinchiorri. Michelin 3 stars very expensive nuff said. No smoking eventhough we were outside. NOT recommended by me or by the hotel we were warned.Overall the hotel and Florence was a wonderful experience. We came out of there with knowledge, a sense of history and romance as well as culture.

<Content>Great Service, Great Location, But Don't Stay on 1st Floor We booked our room through Carlson Wagonlit as they had a block of rooms at a significantly reduced rate (110 Euro per night). We were shown to our room on the first floor. Even before entering the room, I could tell that the room was on the cheap floor. The room itself was a fright. The floor was dirty, the walls were full of water stains, the air vents were covered with dust, and the room was very dark and unwelcoming. The room was in desperate need of updating. After looking around, I spoke to the concierge at the front desk and requested to see another room. He immediately showed me a room (317) on the third floor. Even before entering the room, I could tell that this room was on a more expensive floor. This room was beautiful. It had a chandelier and was beautifully decorated and in the back of the hotel away from the street. I asked how much the upgrade would be, and the concierge immediately (with a smile) told me that it would be the same price. I was very impressed with the attentiveness and the response to our request.After working through this initial impression, I have to say the Bernini is an excellent hotel (notwithstanding the first room experience). The service is impeccable, always friendly and attentive to all of your needs. When I needed any assistance, I spoke to the front desk and they took care of all of the details. The service at this hotel is top notch.The location of the hotel is superb. Within walking distance of everything you want to see in Florence and within a short distance of some very excellent restaurants.The breakfast (which is included) is the best breakfast in our entire trip (we also visited Rome and Venice). The breakfast had everything you would want and it was delicious.Overall, I would recommend this hotel on the caveat that you do not stay in one of the rooms on the first floor, which may mean requesting an upgrade or reserving a more expensive room to begin. Again, the service was superb, the breakfast very tasty, and the location cannot be beat.

<Content>Best hotel experience in Italy...! The Bernini was the best hotel experience I've had in Italy. The location is ideal, the decor is beautiful and the bathrooms are phenominal (large and completely renovated). The beds were comfortable with nice pillows and linens.The breakfast room was beautiful and as mentioned in previous reviews.. the best breakfast in Italy (maybe Europe) - even the coffee was fabulous.The desk and hotel staff were friendly and went out of their way to help us when we lost our credit card.Our biggest disappoinment in Florence .. we had to leave the Bernini to stay at another hotel we had booked and could not cancel.Highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>You can't have a bath! I stayed this hotel in mid February. Location was excellent. Rooms were classic style and lovely. Bathroom was large and beautiful and had a big bath tub, but not enough hot water to fill the bath tub. One of us had a shower first and no more hot water! I was so disappointed. Front staff were not helpful at all. I will recommend this hotel only for the location.

<Content>Best Breakfast I have had in Europe I stayed at the Bernini in March, o3. We had a 5th floor room facing the street. I was concerned about noise but was delighted to find it quiet at night. The bathroom was huge with white marble and the bed comfortable. The breakfast buffet had a delicious selection of cheeses, breads, meats, good eggs, cereals and juices. The fresh baked cresants are a great way to start the day and smell wonderful. The staff were very helpful during a rail strike. I was especially impressed with the breakfast room maitre'd who was training new staff while we were there. He was charming with his guests and staff. The location is within walking distance of the train station for day trips to Siena and Pisa plus all the main sites of Florence. I would definately stay at the Baglioni Bernini Palace Hotel again!
