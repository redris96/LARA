<Content>Wasn't too impressed I stayed there for 1 day after staying 4 days at the cheaper Best Western Coconut (part of Aqua). I moved because I wanted to be closer to the beach and treat myself to a better quality hotel. The website for this hotel was nice, but the rooms weren't as good as the one at Best Western. Both were newly renovated hotels, but the Parc's renovations were a bit half baked, with old tiles mixed with new carpet. The location was also not ideal; even though it was physically close to the beach, you had to walk through a strange alley to get to a small stretch of beach that wasnt part of the main waikiki beach front. The value was ok, there was a 35% discount and they upgraded us from a normal ocean view to a deluxe ocean view. Unfortunately if you look carefully at the location, it is hidden behind the Halekulani and the Sheraton and the ocean is a very small area, so even the deluxe ocean view is pretty average. Further, I think because of the air conditioning vents of the neighbouring hotels the ocean view rooms actually get a lot of noise and warm air on the balcony.. Overall the value was much lower than the Best Western.The staff were professional although they don't like to smile at all.

<Content>great staff We selected the waikiki parc based on trip advisor comments.This is a newly reno'ed boutique hotel in a great location but you might wonder when you get to the entrance, down an alley way, but it is very nice, ours was a large room with a 350sq ft lanai (balcony ). The staff were excellent and the location really is in the middle of great shopping and 1 block off the beach. Not cheap but Waikiki is not cheap.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel I read a couple of the reviews and was a bit surprised about some of the criticism. My wife and I stayed mid October for 5 days. We found the rooms neat and clean. The front desk staff very extremely helpful.Someone said the breakfast was dreadful - I can assure you it was the best breakfast we had from the 4 hotels (marriotts) we stayed at in the US earlier in out trip. It was a la carte and very healthy. The restaurant staff were also very helpful and friendy.One point of interest is that we were located on the top floor and in the middle, viewing the ocean. This was great, but not so lucky may be units further down. Nightly when at the unit, we could see and hear the hawaii band across the road, and the lovely lady dancer - they play from about 5.30 to 8.30. They were great and in the end we just had to go and visit first hand.Waikiki Parc is recommended by us.

<Content>Wouldn't stay there again We stayed at the Waikiki Parc thanks to some rewards points. We were in Honolulu for one last night before heading back to the mainland. The front desk was friendly, but we weren't impressed by the property. The rooms are small and functional (which doesn't normally bother me, it was just off) and there was a definite smell issue in the hallways and rooms, although I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe it was cigarette smoke? (We had a nonsmoking room). The breakfast at the Parc Cafe was pretty bad. I know they are billing themselves as a sister property to Halekulani, but it might as well be a separate country.

<Content>Good hotel but bad customer service for some reason the customer service here was horrible, the front desk people are not very nice at all, and especially since we have a child I think they did not like that. Anyhow the rooms where nice if you get a high up floor and mountain facing, I heard a lot of bad reviews about the noise, the free parking is always a plus, the only thing this hotel has going for it is location and recent renovations (apparently). If you want good customer service this is not the place for you.

<Content>Just OK This hotel is so tucked out the way not much happening here, the rooms are nice apart from the very thin windows so no sleeping in after 6am. The front staff need to be more polite and actually all need to get together and tell the same stories. Late check out was not a option at all even to pay extra $$$. I will choose another hotel next time. This place needs a bar and a cassual place for visitors to relax in apart from there room. I hope it happens.

<Content>Great service, simple decor As sister property to the Halekulani hotel, the Waikiki Parc is very different in its approach. LOCATION: Although it has no direct access to the beach, it's just a short walk away down a side alley to the beach front. It's also within easy walking distance to all of the Waikiki restaurants and stores on Kalakaua (the main street). If you need a cab, you can arrange one at the bell desk in advance but there's also a cab rank across the road in front of the Halekulani. And for some 24/7 dining, there's a Denny's on the corner (only if you're really desperate). ROOM: We stayed in a room on the 12th floor that was the most economical. It was quite a small room and really very simple. The decor was surprisingly unpleasant - the entire room is tiled and there was a green rug under the bed. At all times, though, the room was very clean and the make-up service efficient but be prepared for a very simple room. We had a view of the parking lot next door so if you'd like something better, make sure that you request it upon booking. SERVICE: Absolutely everyone in the hotel was extremely courteous, helpful and efficient. Check-in and check-out were quick. They were extremely reliable too - from wake-up calls, to pre-ordering a cab for the airport, etc. Every Tuesday (?) and Friday night there's a one-hour mixer in the lobby - everyone's invited and the hotel provides free alcoholic drinks. It's a nice touch and something that would be particularly good for younger travelers or those who are going out on the town but don't want to spend too much on alcohol. FACILITIES: There's a small pool on Level 8 and an even smaller fitness centre. The business centre off the lobby consists of two computers for which you need to purchase time - $3 for 15 minutes or $5 for half an hour. Other than that, the hotel doesn't offer too much. DINING: We never ordered room service and I'm not even sure that it's available. For health-conscious travelers, the breakfast is fantastic. It's located in the Nobu restaurant off the lobby. There's no buffet but they have several different options which you order a la carte. It means that you can control your portions in a much better way and all of the food is very healthy. One option, for example, is a three-cheese omelette with shiitake mushrooms (delicious). All options are accompanied by a breakfast muffin, a serving of fruit, a small tub of yoghurt and juice and/or tea/coffee. On the day that we had to check out earlier than when breakfast started, the hotel was able to arrange breakfast boxes for us at no extra cost - fruit, yoghurt and breakfast muffin and a bottle of water. I thought that this was a nice touch. MISC: Although we never did it, you can arrange to hire a Lotus Elise which and the hotel has several parked out the front. If you arrive too early to check-in, you can opt to use one of their hospitality suites to freshen up. It's best to use a phone card when making calls (international or to Hawaiian cell phones) rather than the room phone. I usually do buy a phone card to do this but didn't have time to on this occasion and the charges were absolutely exorbitant. There are several ABC stores nearby which sell calling cards so it's best to go out of your way to purchase one. As it's a sister hotel to the Halekulani, you can also dine there and charge it to your Waikiki Parc room. I highly recommend trying the dining at the Halekulani - the breakfast buffet is wonderful and La Mer (their restaurant) is exquisite - we've been there twice now and it's worth every cent.All in all, we had a great stay here. It's good for people traveling on a budget who don't plan on spending a lot of time in their room and who don't require too many facilities. The service here was unbeatable.

<Content>Don't stay at the Waikiki Parc unless you have to. While this hotel is better than most in Waikiki it is still a far from a good hotel if you judge it by the same standards as hotels in Japan or Europe. The check in is very slow as there never seems to be more than 1 girl working there although there are 3 places set aside for the front desk staff to stand. Don't expect any service because no one in the hotel knows what it means. The hotel elevators require you to swipe your room key in order to go up, unfortunately the machine does not work very well so more than half the time you will not be able to go up to your room without the help of a manager but that will take a while because there is always a line up at the front desk. Once you get to your room you will find that it is a slightly remodeled room although it is really just a plane jane motel type layout with a couple of upgrades. The bathroom faucets and shower were OK. No complaints. However in the headboard of all beds is a long fluorescent light that will blink on and off if you try and turn it down lower than full power, beware this flickering is extremely annoying. Also you and everyone in your room will appear a sickly green because of this poor lighting choice. The beds were OK. The fridge is empty and you can't order alcohol to your room... they do not have a liquor license. Also the room service is pathetic, you can have some cheese, a tired looking salad or some sandwiches but that is all. This is not a full service hotel. Don't expect to have breakfast in bed... you will be disappointed. Also the internet connection is a nightmare. They have no wi-fi and you have to connect to a LAN cable which really limits your movement. Also the connection is poor and often you can not get online at all. And to make matters worse they charge you 10 dollars every 24 hours although it feels like they are charging you about 3 times a day. Be careful about which rooms you choose, the mountain and city views look out onto parking lots and are horrible. The ocean view is much better but not that great as you have to look at the back of the hideous Sheraton hotel and their loading and unloading area as well. Not very romantic. Also if you plan on making any calls from your room you will be in for a treat, as the phone system is very sensitive and no one you call can ever seem to hear you. Very annoying. Also they have really old school style televisions in the room which are thicker than they are wide and the remote system is very finicky. There seems to be alot of excitement that there is a NOBU restaurant in the hotel. Forget it. Don鈥檛 ever eat there. Their service is horrible and the food is second rate Japanese pub food. I am not sure why Americans think Nobu is so great but let me tell you as a long time resident of Japan that it is not. It is not good at all. Japanese people do not eat at Nobu... and neither should you. You could the same meal only better in Japan on any street corner. Don鈥檛 be fooled. Eat at Denny鈥檚 around the corner if you have too, they have better service... I guarantee it. There were a couple positive things about the hotel: the valet attendants were excellent. Very helpful and always smiling and if you are going to stay there do rent the orange Lotus Exige and take a drive up the east coast to Lanikai beach you won鈥檛 regret it. And lastly although this hotel is not very good it is still better than most and miles ahead of the new 鈥渂outique鈥?hotel, Renew.

<Content>Fun in the Sun We stayed at the Parc for five nights in April. The hotel is very clean and modern. Rooms are a nice size. Our room was on the top floor and had a view of the ocean and the city scape. The hotel is a two minute walk to the beach and you are around the corner from the main drag where there are tons of shops and restaurants. We had a late flight and had to check out at noon, but the hotel has a complementary shower/bathroom/changing room which was very clean and well stocked and was great after a day at the beach before our flight home.  THe front desk staff is nice and they provide mats, towels and water every day for you. There is a tour desk in the lobby, but when I was there the man did not speak very much English and just gave me a bunch of pamflets and we ended up booking a tour on our own.  The area of Waikiki is reminesent of Miami in that it is a beach in the middle of the city, but I highly recommend checking out the surround areas. We took a bus tour to the North Shore which is beautiful and mountain biked in the mountains on the West side of the Island where Lost and Jurassic Park were shot. Great eats and an overall wonderful experience! We also did not rent a car, its not really necessary if you do not want to. There is public transportation which we did not try but there are tons of cabs and tours and walking is a great way to see things!

<Content>A decent hotel at a fair price in the heart of Waikiki Beach Stayed in a mountain view deluxe room on the 18th floor over the Easter weekend. We had a comfortable stay there and would probably stay there again if we go back next time. Our room was clean and always kept in good shape. The decor is pretty modern but I feel the floor tiles look out of sync with the decor.I realize many people complained about the noise. Yes, there was noise in early morning but maybe I live in the city so that was not a major issue to me. I still slept very well in the comfortable bed. If you are very sensitive to noise, you may want to pay a bit more money to get a high-floor room. Location-wise it's in an ideal location. Through a short walk and the beach is there. No reason to use the hotel swimming pool at all. Plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops are just nearby. Very close to the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Centre. To take the bus, it's about 5 minutes walk towards the US Army Museum.When it comes to asking for travelling advice, yes I agree with some who said the concierge doesn't offer much help. There's always a local expert sitting across the concierge from 8-5 and he is a really good resource. He recommended a few nice Japanese restaurants in a few less travelled neighbourhoods in town and they are excellent!

<Content>Great Location; Great Price I just got back from a 6 night stay at the Waikiki Parc.I was able to get a AAA rate for a deluxe moutain room which included parking. The bottom line being that I don't think I could have gotten a better location or room for the price I paid. The hotel is located right in the heart of Waikiki just 100 yards from the beach. There is public access to the beach right out of the back entrance of the hotel. All around the hotel are stores and restaurants from familiar chains to local spots. The staff is very friendly and acoomodating. The rooms are small but I was traveling alone and so the size was fine. The rooms are clean and there are nice amenities and plenty of towels. Free coffee and newspapaers are available in the lobby starting at 6:00.Another advantage is having signing privilages at the Halekulani located within steps of the Parc. The prices at the Halekulani are what you'd expect for a high end resort but it was great to eat and drink right on the beach at the House Without A Key bar/restaurant.Drawbacks to the Parc are that the neighborhood is loud. I was on the 17th floor and was woken every morning at 4:00 by deliveries, garbage trucks and the construction of a new hotel nearby. I was able to get back to sleep, but if you're sensitive to noise this would be a problem. Also...the pool at the Parc is lacking to say the least. Your backyard would be better because you'd have quicker access to drinks, food and a bathroom. FInally, get breakfast elsewhere. There's a Denny's right next door and numerous coffee places very close. The breakfast was expensive and didn't offer many choices. Overall though I don't think I could have done better for the money which with the rate I received was $188 a night.

<Content>Not a full service hotel Very disappointing stay here in January. Location is not bad - it looks over the entrance to the Halekulani Hotel (owned by the same people), and THAT hotel is fabulous. Had several meals there, so it was a convenient walk across the street.Major complaints are to do with service. The concierge was totally useless in giving advice on which bus to take to various places in Waikiki. Basically gave me the phone number for The Bus, and didn't offer to call himself. There is a coffee maker in the room, and there were two tea bags to choose from - Earl Grey and Green tea. When I asked at the front desk for something else, they said that's all they had. No regular English breakfast or other black tea. There is very limited room service - for breakfast only boxed breakfasts. The restaurant within the hotel is only open for breakfast till 9 a.m.The decor of the lobby is very stark and unwelcoming.The guest rooms were more pleasant but need updating.Bathroom was small, but with nice amenities.Wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Service When I went to Hawaii, I didn't have the option of chosing my hotel because I had won the trip on Wheel of Fortune, but I figured the hotel would at least be a nice facility. This hotel was absolutely great. It is located right across the street from the beach but in the heart of everything tourism. We had a room with a balcony and a beautiful view of the beach as did my sister. We were there for a week and when you are somewhere for so long you tend to eat out and sometimes have leftovers. The rooms did not come equip with a microwave, however the front desk staff was so lovely. The warmed our food for us whenever asked. The concierge (or bell hops) were so friendly and nice. They told us the best way to get to every place we wanted, they even suggested things for us to do. When we went to the beach the concierge gave us mats, towels, water, and umbrellas. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Room 1714 Great location and friendly staff service - bring earplugs Stayed here for 3 nights in mid-February during Pan Am Soccer week when hotel of choice nearby was full. Stylish lobby, and then the battle with the elevator security card keys begins to get to your floor. Ask for two sets of keys and expect to turn them in periodically when they don't work in the elevator or your hotel room door. Room was ok - city view cheapest level with nice bathroom and toiletries. Free room safe, and bless them, an empty mini fridge that actually kept drinks and snacks chilled! Didn't need to beg to have the mini bar cleaned out like most hotels I stay in.Room wear and tear visibile with cracked floor tiles and some scuffs on the furniture but quite serviceable with plenty of drawers and closet with ironing board and iron. Another smart thing - the duvet is cotton instead of down. Don't understand why so many hotels in hot climates think guest are impressed by down duvets so you can sweat all night.If you have time and the budget skip eating the boring breakfast here and go across the street to the Halekulani for the fabulous buffet, ditto drinks at sunset.Things you'll need to stay here - earplugs that damped the chorus of dumpsters being emptied, delivery trucks going into the Sheraton next door and tour bus backing up that start at 6AM. The empty bottles get emptied at nearby restaurants and hotels between 3am - 4am. And then the construction crew arrives at nearby hotel being revamped and starts precisely at 7am. If you are an early riser this is fine, but don't plan on sleeping in. Also the plantations shutters don't really block out the light so bring a sleep mask along too.Do not get into a taxi anywhere in the city unless you know that the driver A) speaks a few words of English and B) is carrying change. Take lots of small bills with you in case of B. Also limo drivers hang around the hotel with vulgar large cars seeing short trip customers to earn some cash. No meters, so if you take a limo be sure to agree on price up front. Drivers not very friendly and the cars cannot get in an out of driveways easily so opt for the metered taxis once you know the driver speaks English

<Content>TAKE YOUR EARPLUGS Never, never again. Arrived after a morning delay at San Francisco airport to find my fully paid room given out to someone else. I'd paid for a two week vacation there. The female receptionist had a couldn't care less arritude when I complained, that this was all wrong etc that peoples plane journeys must be delayed all the time. Couldn't have cared less if we had to both sleep on the beach. Eventually given a room on the 15th floor overlooking a carpark. The room was very clean. The noise though, every morning at 4am until at least 6.30am you heard dustcarts beeping as they reversed, the noise from emptying them was dreadful. Coaches slammed their doors constantly storing away suitcases for early morning shuttles to airports etc. Even on the 15th floor you heard it all. The Concierge did have a poor grasp of English so we booked in the end most of our trips at the Outrigger Activities Desk at a nearby hotel who were excellent and very informative. The Hotel is very close to he beach, one of it;s few virtues. IIt is clean inside everywhere and breakfast was very nice indeed. Dinner didn't seem worth the very high expense. If you decide to book ahead, you'll be fine if you have no dealings with reception and you can catch up on your beauty sleep on your sun lounger down at the beach because truly the noise is terrible. It could be a good prize hotel if they trebled glazed the rear rooms and curtailed the attitude of some of the front desk into being helpful.

<Content>The Real deal with Waikiki Parc Here's the Real Deal on Waikiki Parc - Let's get straight to the Point - service is Lousy , asking for help from the Front Desk is totally useless! We asked for simple things like 'how to take the Bus'  they said that they only have one Bus route map for the Hotel  cannot give it to us. Fine! They didn't even show it to us  made a few useless scribble on our map. We asked about other things such as are there 'good casual smaller restaurants without being too much of a Party atmosphere ?  they couldn't come up with one -  Yes they send us to Roy's (Hawaiian Fusion Fine Dine) told us it's casual  no snooty people -------- really, HELLOOOOO???!!! Over all the Front Desk Clerks didn't seem to really care , just casual answers of confusions. They are so clued out on service, I'll give it 1.5 STARS! Great that they turned this Hotel into 'Sort of a Boutique Hotel' but PLEASE up grade the SERVICE too! We're surprised 'Nobu Restaurant opened up in this Hotel.' Never ate there  wonder what their service is like??? mmmmmmm????The Expedia Center across from the Front Desk was Helpful with organizing the Tours  it ended there. They pointed out the Tours that were available but never gave good/interesting suggestions. You point - They book'em!The room we had was fine 'Deluxe Ocean View' , for what it is we fine it a bit expensive even when we were put on the 23rd (Top) Floor. The Ocean view is fine, looking out between 2 buildings.Room was a bit small  the Show Head had very little force, very weak.We had a Great Time on our Trip to Honolulu , we just wish The Hotel's Front Desk Concierges care more about the Customers. We felt a bit ripped off.

<Content>Can't wait to go back!!! I loved this hotel. My boyfriend and I spent a week in this hotel and it was worth the price. We had great access to shopping, dinning, and the beach was a five minute walk. I had booked excursions by phone and had the confirmation faxes sent to the hotel. Every time a fax came they would call my room right away. The staff were very helpful, and willing to help without hesitation. I recommend a restaurant called A House with out a Key in the Halukani Hotel, just steps away. It was a great trip and the hotel sealed the deal for us. I can't wait to go back

<Content>Hated it so much we checked out early! I travel extensively, and this is the first time I disliked a hotel so much that we decided after our 3rd night to check out early and into a different property. I really wanted to like the Waikiki Parc. I was very excited about staying at a small boutique hotel instead of a massive chain. The visit started out well. We were impressed with the chic decorations throughout. A wrapped box of chocolates and a card was waiting for us which was a nice touch.We got a corner room on the top floor which looked out over the mountains. We got two beds instead of a king, but we decided not move because the room would be even smaller than the cramped one we had. This hotel caters to Japanese tourist much more than Americans so I'm sure the size is great for them. Strangley, the beds did not have fitted sheets, just two flat sheets. Each morning, we woke up to bare mattresses after tossing and turning each night. We were often woken up by the street noise, and we were on the TOP FLOOR. We noticed that the high velocity elevator made me nauseous and my husband light headed everytime we got on and off. The valet switched our keytags with someone else, and we had to run back and forth to get the rental agreement to prove the car was ours. This made me late for my meeting. The valet was very slow other times. The concierge was absolutely useless. He speaks poor English, and unfortunately, we don't speak Japanese.On the food front, the wine and cheese reception was a joke. I've had better wine and cheese at Costco. Nobu is highly overrated and incredibly expensive. I had such high hopes for this place. Luckily, Orchids at the snotty Halekulani next door has the most amazing ahi sashimi I've ever had.The final straw was having my razor broken by housekeeping. Can you imagine how frustrating it is to try and shave so you can go out onto the beach only to find it impossible to do this task? Argh! We booked another hotel online and promptly checked out of the Parc. Maybe we were so cranky because of the sleep deprivation.

<Content>The Best Honeymoon!!!! We arrived at our planned Hotel, the Ohana Malia, and were horrified. We spent the first night of our honeymoon in a very unclean room. Luckily, the next day, after a major arguement with our travel agent, we switched to the Waikiki Parc. We were amazed - the rooms were very clean and modern, nothing extremely fancy, but tiled bathroom and a beautiful screen door we could open or close to go out to the lanai. The candles burning in the lobby downstairs smelled amazing. We lucked out with an oceanview, and fell asleep and woke up every morning to the sound of the ocean. The service was exceptional - they even left a gift basket of chocolates and macadamia nuts that said TO the Mr. and Mrs. - what a nice touch after all we had been through with the first hotel. It isn't far to the beach at all, and walking through Waikik is extremely convenient from this hotel. The Sheraton isn't far at all, as most of our adventures (Parasailing, Kayaking) picked up at that hotel. Close to the Hula Grill (very good!) and just a short walk to most everything in Waikiki. Overall, if we go back to Waikiki, we will definately stay at the Parc. What a perfect honeymoon!!!!

<Content>Ultra "chic" What I liked.........I liked almost everything. We were greeted by the staff right when we arrived and our luggage was whisked off while we checked in. The luggage was brought up to our room about 5 minutes later. The lobby had a real chic look with the lighting and the decor. The staff was very friendly. There was a box of chocolates waiting for us in our room. The rooms looked great! I loved the adjustable lights behind the bedding. The ocean view was great. I think that the whole ambiance is why I just loved this place!What I didn't like.....well I didn't care for the location. I prefer the diamond head end of Waikiki because I like the beach better down there, however this place is near Lewers street which is a cool shopping/dining area. Also, it seems like this hotel is kind of hidden as it is surrounded by other hotels and their parking lots. The beds were really low, which I am not used to at all. The floor was tiled, except under the bed and there were a few times I nearly slipped on the flooring. The lanais are small. Despite the minor issues I had this is a great place, especially for younger people (20-35 year olds). I probably wouldn't pick this hotel again only because it is not my personal ideal location.

<Content>Great hotel, but noisy Overall this was a great hotel. Close to EVERYTHING. Reception desk service was great and the valet staff couldn't bend over further for us. Great tip to remember that you can borrow the beach items i.e. boogie boards, mats etc for free.The only draw back was the noise from the service trucks below. We stayed on the mountain view side and the other reviews mentioned this drawback but I thought it wouldn't be so bad. Even on the 22nd floor, we were so thankful for the weekend when the trucks did not operate.Great value, great location, great service but be warned with the noise level...maybe the ocean side is the only way to escape this.

<Content>a cool vibe to this place From the airport to the hotel and then back it average at 34.00 for taxi each way. My experience started just as my taxi pulled up to the door. You are welcomed with a aloha and ask you for your last name and they thank you for staying with them and reassure you that your luggage will be up in less than 5 minutes after you check in. When i initually made the reservation it was for two adults but at the last minute a friend joined us. There was an extra charge of 63 dollars per night plus taxes. Checking in was quick and they have at least three different people checking people in. The elevators give you like a 1/2 G force going up we where at the 21 floor in a few secs. Higher you are up the less noise you hear down below. busy busy city... There is complimentary water,coffee,cocoa, and tea in the room. A fridge to stock up with stuff from the ABC stores around the corners..They are across from each other and every where around you. The bell desk has complimentary water,towels,floaties, and other stuff.. Always saw at least three taxis waiting for guests at the hotel. The rooms are small but had everything i needed soap, some very nice shampoo,iron,dryer,tv, A/C... On Tuesday's and Friday's they have something caled the Mixer where they have free drinks for the guests so they can mingle with each other..nice touch cool vibe hotel great mellow lighting. Our age group two 27 and one 25 we loved it wouldnt change much. Saw a few mid-lifers looking for a great time and they found it here just a great atmosphere with a upscale touch to it. This is not a kid type hotel no toys and elvis music. Just great adult fun adult toys Lotus cars for rent..

<Content>Great little gem I got a great rate at the Waikiki Parc for a mid-jan stay. I stayed in room 2001, and WOW! wahta view. Being from NYC i like to stay in hotels that get tons of light, and a balcony when I travel, and this had both. Even without my discount (which was large through a friend) the rates are great, you have the full run of the large very elegant Halekuni across the street, and great views of waikiki beach on the upper floors. I am a botique hotel fan, and this one didn't let me down. Wifi in the rooms was missing, which seems to be a botique mainstay, but you're on vacation to have fun, not do work. Great place. Highly recommend.

<Content>Can't wait to return to Waikiki Parc - we'd never stay anywhere else in Hawaii We have just returned from a sensational 9 night stay at Waikiki Parc Hotel. The Waikiki Parc is located right across from the beach and the famous Hotel Halekulani and Sheraton/ Royal Hawaiian.It's close to everything you need - shops restaurants, transport, beach.We're fussy, but found The Parc to be very modern, chic (which usually isn't the case in Hawaii)Importantly the staff were so friendly and a lot of fun. The fed us up with plenty of egg-nog and christmas cookies (we were there over christmas)The hotel pool isn't enormous, but the beach across the road is exceptional.Hotel Halekulani across the road is much more expensive but it's worth checking out it's restaurants which have traditional music playing in the evenings.We would highly recommend booking an ocean view - to be able to relax on your balcony with such an incredible view is priceless.We also reccommend the breakfast (we booked through bookit.com and some of their packages include it). Breakfast is served at Nobu restaurant downstairs.The concierge at the hotel was brilliant too, helping us locate car-part manufacturers right through to the best island tours and the nearest Subway.We can't wait to get back and stay at The Parc once again. We can't recommend it highly enough - especially for couples.

<Content>Not my cup of tea Booked a one night stay through hotwire before going back to the states. First impression, the hotel tried very hard to be chick in decoration as well as attitude. The decor seemed to work in the lobby and Nobu restaurant entrance areas. However, once you got inside the guest elevator, you'd feel that the hotel was not well kept.Upon checking, I asked the front desk if there would be any room with a city view. Was told that no complimentary upgrade was available due to internet purchase. We ended up staying on the 9th floor with a parking lot view right in front of our balcony. The room decor was horrible, the white/grayish tile green carpet combo did not look good at all. Chip paints were noticed throughout the room and molds/mildews were all over the tub in the bathroom. In addition, the size of the bathroom was very small.

<Content>Great bang for your buck I recently stayed at the Waikiki Parc for a quick 4 day trip to Oahu. It was my first visit to Hawaii and I settled on this hotel based on the price and other reviews I had read on Tripadvisor (as well as other travel sites).Overall I thought the hotel was a GREAT value. Average nighty rates came out right around $200/night (stayed Wed-Sat). Like most of the other reviews have stated, it is a small boutique hotel that is a little skimpy on the hotel amenities. The hotel restaurant/bar is Nobu which was stellar. All staff there were very nice, professional, and helpful. My only gripe regarding the staff was with the concierge. We booked our Luau reservations through the concierge but he failed to notify us that the Luau was cancelled due to rain. It was a huge hassle because we were rushing to get back to the hotel/bus station in time for no reason. Furthermore, we only found out about the status of the Luau after waiting around at the bus area for 15 minutes before another bus driver told us that the Luau would not be going on that evening.The hotel room itself is nothing special but at the very least it was clean. The lanai/balcony was barely a balcony as it was probably 12-18 inches deep and 5 feet long. It looked more like an extended window ledge.As a first time visitor to Honolulu/Waikiki I really hit the jackpot with location. Beach access is extremely close and convenient from the hotel. ABC stores are no more than a 60 second walk from the front door. There is a decent to good selection of restaurants in the area as well. The Nobu inside the hotel was excellent (and expensive). There is a Roys within walking distance (probably a 100 yard walk from the front door of the hotel). There is also a decent selection of nighttime activities including a Yardhouse, Senor Frogs, and other drinking establishments all within a 5 minute walk. For you shoppers out there, just about all of the high end boutiques are also within a 5 minute walk of the hotel (LV, Tiffanys, Prada, Ferragamo, etc..)I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a great deal on a hotel. This is not a budget hotel by any means, it is a very classy joint.

<Content>Great staff, city location problems My partner and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc, Room 901, for five nights in early November. This was our first trip to Hawaii. After a long flight from the East Coast, we took a taxi from the airport to the Parc. A friendly and handsome staff member opened the taxi door and pleasantly whisked away our heavy bags! They arrived at our room shortly after we did. Big thumbs-up there!The room had a small balcony and a nice view of the ocean. Air conditioner worked very well (though we did not spend much time in the room because there was so much to see and do in Honolulu).Some definite negatives about the hotel: the air vent in the bathroom reeked of cigarette smoke. This was puzzling to us as neither of us smokes, and I was under the impression the hotel was non-smoking. The toilet did not flush well. Also, a very nasty odor emanated from the bathroom sink area after whenever we did flush the toilet. As referenced in other reviews, the beep beep beep sound of garbage trucks backing up on the streets below awakened me from a sound sleep on more than one occasion. I asked the front desk clerk about this and wondered if a room on a higher floor would be less noisy. He replied (honestly) that he thought that it would not.The box breakfast courtesy of the Halekulani kitchen was ridiculously small. A couple of slices of fruit, two tiny danish and a dollop of yogurt. Not even any coffee! Hardly worth $15!Finally, we acquired a new pet while staying at the Parc: a cockroach! The fourth day of our stay, he/she appeared in the alcove next to the fridge. We had only bottled water in the fridge, so I think he/she was barking up the wrong tree.Despite these negatives, the staff was always courteous and even loaned us umbrellas one night at dinner time during a torrential downpour. The front desk clerk was very quick to call the housekeeper when I reported the cockroach to her during checkout. Still, we would not be inclined to stay at the Parc again if we returned to Honolulu. It is plagued by problems associated with being in a large city. Maybe next time, we'll skip Honolulu completely and go directly to Maui!!!

<Content>A Great Hotel Spent 4 nights at the Parc and found it a most enjoyable experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, room comfortable and clean and great location for the price. Only a very short walk to the beach provided the same access as the more expensive hotels across the road that are located right on the beach. The entry to the hotel has been renovated to a point that it is appealing and provides the breath of cool air conditioned air as you walk in from the warmer weather outside. Will definitely stay again.

<Content>The truth about the Waikiki Parc hotel ... This hotel is pitched to the cost-conscious, independent traveller who prefers a boutique style of hotel. The Waikiki Parc is a safe, clean hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and they go out of their way to make you feel at home. But the real beauty of this hotel is its location - it's a stones throw away from the new restaurant precinct, the beach and shopping strip. I have stayed at several of the five star hotels in Waikiki including the Royal Hawaiian and the Moana Surfrider and I believe this hotel is on par with them.The beds are comfortable, there is lots of natural light and the small lanais means you can enjoy some truly magical sunsets.But be warned that this hotel doesn't offer the same trimmings as some of its five-star counterparts; for instance, there are only about three items available through room-service and there is no mini-bar, as such. Whilst the Waikiki Parc's services are limited, the good news is that it relies on the Halekulani for things like room service, dry-cleaning so the standard is very good. The rooms do have a bar fridge which means you can stock your fridge with anything you desire (the ABC store is just round the corner).Like many hotels in Waikiki there is an issue with the noise (mostly back-up alarms) so it's probably not the best hotel if you are a late riser. The best room to book is the deluxe ocean view room (it is worth the extra expense) but make sure you ask for a room on a high floor on the right side of the hotel facing the ocean. The hotel has recently been refurbished. The foyer and the furnishings have been updated and the Nobu restaurant is a nice addition to the hotel.This hotel is great value for money.

<Content>Very nice place to stay My husband and I stayed at Waikiki Parc Hotel the first week of November. We chose the hotel based on reviews from Tripadvisor. We took advice from other users who said to upgrade to a room above the 19th floor for a better quieter ocean view. It was worth the $40 additional dollars per night for us. The room is small, but no one should be spending much time in their room anyways. I liked the room because it was quiet, we never heard anyone above, below or next to us. The beach is only about a 30 second walk, and you can get towels and mats at the bellmen desk area. On our last day we found out that we could just ask the bellmen if there were any chairs or floating devices left from other hotel guests. It would have made our time on the beach even more enjoyable with chairs and floaties. So, if you choose this hotel, make sure you ask for these things because many guests buy beach chairs and leave them for others to enjoy. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but for us, if we go back to Waikiki we would probably stay at an ocean front hotel and pay the higher cost.

<Content>Friendly, boutique hotel I stayed at the Waiki Parc at the end of October. It was a great little hotel and good value for money. The staff were exceptionally friendly. They couldn't do enough to make our stay a great one. The hotel was renovated last year and it now has a trendy boutique vibe to it. I loved the reception area where they play current music throughout the day. They also had a mixer drinks reception on Tuesdays and Fridays with free wine and canapes. It was a great way to meet the staff and other guests.The location was great too. It was just a minute's walk to the beach and 5 minutes from the main street  Beach Walk where all the shops and restaurants are.The rooms were spacious enough considering you don't go on holiday to spend all day in the room.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to Waikiki.

<Content>Real nice I though the front desk was really nice and accommodating. The hotel is nice and clean and in a good location if you must stay in Waikiki. It is also a little cheaper than the beachfront hotels. Not too many amenities though.

<Content>9 nights of perfection Stayed at The Parc for 9 nights and absolutey loved it. We initally were booked for 5 nights, but didn't particularly like our next place, so returned to The Parc for another 4 nights - that's how much we were impressed with this hotel.Firstly let me qualify one thing: both my girlfriend and I are fairly young travellers and our hotel preference reflects it. Neither of us particularly like big oversized resorts, so the Parc was perfect for us. It's not a big, sprawling resort like some of the other hotels in Waikiki: it's just a perfectly located, hip place to stay in Waikiki.We booked directly through the hotel, with their Sunrise package which included a 4th night free, plus free breakfastand valet parking, which was very useful. We also opted for the best available room (ocean front)... which I would highly recommend. The views on Waikiki beach from the higher floors are excellent: you're not quite on the beach, but you're very near: the sunsets are beautiful in the evenings and you can enjoy the sounds of the house band playing over the street at the Halekulani (they're best enjoyed from a distance).So what made it so good? Firstly, the hotel is new, and nice. Rooms look *exactly* as they do on the website (when does that ever happen)? They're not huge, but they're modern, clean, and, well, just nice.But the best thing about this hotel is the service. They're a sister hotel of the Halekulani (the area's top resort which is across the street) and the service clearly reflects that. Everything was speedy, efficient, and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Our rooms were serviced every day, when we wanted it, and the cleaning staff did a brilliant job, not just making the bed, but tidying up and making our messy room feel much nicer when we came back to it. Ice machines were located on every floor, and always worked. When we wanted additional things (ie: plates and cutlery for a takaway), they were always up to our room in about a minute. Even the lifts were ultra-efficient: they litereally were the fastest lifts I've ever used, moving you 20 floors in a matter of seconds, and meaning that you were never waiting longer than about 20 seconds for a lift. Valet parking was superfast and very friendly. Basically, throughout the hotel, the service was perfecto: nothing was too much of a problem for the staff.Breakfast, although on the early side (6.30 - 9.30) was pretty good. As it's served in the Nobu restaurant, it does have something of a Japanese flavour and is table served (rather than buffet) but there are a good selection of dishes (personally I preferred the tropical which was mainly fruit based and included half a papaya). As Nobu's a top restaurant, the surroundings for breakfast are very, very slick.The pool area is fairly small, and definitely not the best, but the great thing about it is that it's hardly used. Whereas other hotels like the Hilton Hawaiian Village or the Halekulani have great pools, they tend to be packed, noisy, and a bit of a pain. Fine if you're with a family, but for younger people they can be a bit annoying. The Pac pool was almost always quiet, with very comfortable sun-loungers, all-day sun, and a small pool.Um, what else. Wired internet in the room was fast. Gym is small but has a good selection of modern equipment (again, it was nearly always empty). The hotel is defnitely marketed at Japanese people: everything was in both languages and there were a lot of Japanese people staying in the hotel. The clientele was very much couples and young singles rather than families which made for a relaxed, cool atmosphere throughout. Nice touch when we were checking out: as we had a late flight, as well as storing our bags, the hotel has a 'hospitality' room (basically a bathroom) that you can use after after spending the day at the beach.One or two negatives: the room service menu was extremely limited, and we didn't bother to order from it once. However, you're in Waikiki with a pleathora of stunning dining choices steps away so it's not a major issue.Um, as you can tell, I liked it, and as you'll see by my reviews, I visit a LOT of hotels, and can be quite picky. To stay at one for 9 days and be so impressed is very rare, so please excuse my somewhat gushing review. But in summary: it was great, and when I return to Waikiki, I won't be considering anywhere else.

<Content>Nice place, but not as good as advertised. The Waikiki Parc Hotel is a nice place to stay. The lobby was excellent, the staff was friendly, and the location is great (easy walking to shops/restaurants/beach). Two bottles of complementary water was also nice. However, I would have expected better since it was rated as a 4-star hotel. I stayed at other 4-star hotels and they are MUCH better than this. I would consider Waikiki Parc to be a 3-star hotel. A few reasons why I say this:1) The room is a decent size, but smaller than what I expected. There was room for a queen bed, desk, TV, dresser, and fridge (and of course some walking room). I was expecting a small sitting area as well (based on other descriptions).The furnishings in the room and bathroom was excellent -- very modern furniture (they even had LED lamps at the end tables). However, if you look past the furnishings, the room looked somewhat old with a bit of quick renovations.2) I decided to pay for self-parking instead of the valet service. Cost is the same $20/day, but I saved a few bucks from tips for the driver... Be aware of this though -- there are limited parking spaces for self-parking and the lot is used for public parking as well. What this means is that during busy periods, the lot may be filled with public parking and you may drive back to the hotel and there will be no spots for your car. I suspect this is happens mostly on weekends. For $20/day, I would expect some guarantee for available parking spots.3) If you want to use the business center for internet access, you'll need to pay $3 for 15 minutes. Internet access is not complementary. (You'll also need to pay for internet access in your room.) This applies even for printing boarding passes -- however, if you ask the front desk nicely, they may provide the access code for free. The business center has both a PC and Mac so it is handy for both types of people!All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Waikiki Parc, but I had expected better. Next time, I think I'll look elsewhere. I think I can get a better place for the same price.

<Content>Parc was Clean and Safe The Waikiki Parc Hotel was the most safe and clean hotel we've been in. Every attention to detail was done. The mini fridge and safe were complimintary and handy. Their pool and fitness area is good but small. The staff is very courteous and friendly. The valet/bell desk staff are fabulous, they give out beach mats/towels/beach chairs and bottled water. They have the best directions and suggestions. The staff at this hotel is excellent. They are tucked away in a quiet part of busy Waikiki so you get the best of both worlds. Will definitley stay here again.

<Content>Great View for the price..but not a big hotel...very small. We stayed here for labor day weekend, from 9.1.07-9.4.07.. we arrived to Waikiki Parc around 1130 pm on 9/1/07, they upgraded us to the 19th floor since the 22nd floor room wasn't cleaned since it was our one year anniversary that was very nice on there behalf. later on the second day of our stay they cleaned the 22nd floor room and let us move into that for the most beautiful view of the ocean..we had a big view of the Sheraton but on the other side it was a gorgeous view of the ocean. Overall our stay at the hotel was great, since it is a sister hotel to halekulani we were able to take advantage of the great restaurants there...we had our first breakfast at the halekulani breakfast buffet. Yes it was pricey but it was very good and had the best ocean view from our table. Also the concierge of the Waikiki helped us book all of our tours and dinner cruise and luau...it was very convenient he worked for expedia. So he was very knowledgeable of what there was to offer for us during our short stay in Waikiki. We loved how we were so close to all the shops and restaurants everything was in walking distance, and best yet the ocean was just right there...next time we might want to stay somewhere closer to the center point of Waikiki, so we can be near the crowds and also where all the concerts were. It was our first time with no idea where the center of everything was...but now we have a good idea..we were mainly interested in a ocean view...and that is what we got in our room..it was wonderful and breathtaking...

<Content>Nice Place Great views of Waikiki beach from ocean view room. Very comfortable bed and extremely helpful staff. The walk to the beach is about 30 seconds from the hotel, and in a prime location on Waikiki beach. Fridge in the hotel was very useful and the ABC store is literally around the corner.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the Waikiki Parc Hotel one night recently and was impressed with the hotel itself and it's friendly and courteous staff. The hotel is a boutique style hotel, it's a high rise, but doesn't give off that feeling. The lobby is quaint with a more modern sheik look to it, with blue lighting in the entrance hall way, funky furniture in nonobtrusive bright colors in the lobby, this hotel is definetely on the up and up. The security is good, in which it requires a key to use the elevator to get to the different floors, which is nice. The rooms are small, but are okay. The shutters on the windows are a nice touch to the room, as well as the well backlit mirror in the bathroom and behind the bed in the room itself. The linens were most luxurious and comfortable, however the bed I wouldn't say as much comfortable. The breakast in Nobu was okay, they gave a 50% off coupon for breakfast during check in which is why we went, however the breakfast selections are limited to 4 selections only, french toast, an omlette, a japenese breakfast, or something simply like a muffin, very limited selection, although the food we had (french toast) was good and kids eat free with a paying adult (not sure of the age limit for the kids eat free feature). We were on the 22nd floor and had a view of the beach through the grounds of their sister hotel across the street the Halekulani, which by the way is very posh!! The views were okay, nothing spectacular. The lanai was small, big enough for 2 people, but no more than that. Access to the beach was quite easy with exiting the back side of the hotel and walking down a short walkway to the beach in front of the Halekulani. The pool area at the Waikiki Parc leaves a lot to be desired. The pool is very small, it's outdated in it's look, it's nothing luxurious, it's very basic and personally I felt the bottom of it felt quite slimy. There were ample amounts of towels available in the pool area with them being refilled often. There is no beverage/snack service in the pool area, just a soda machine. There is no jacuzzi either. There are some cute sun beds that are covered to shade from the sun, which were nice. However, with the angle/direction the pool area is located in, it didn't seem to me that it got that much sun anyway, thus not making it a great place to lay out. I didn't check out the fitness area, so I can't comment on that.I can comment on the staff and being VERY helpful and very friendly. The bellmen went over the top to provide service, both with delivering your bags to your room, retreiving them upon your departure and being more than happy to store them if you need them stored either prior to or after check out. They also offer what they call a hospitality room so if after you check out you need a place to shower or freshen up, you can do so. For example if after you check out your flight isn't until later in the evening, you can utilize the room free of charge. Also, a nice added touch is they have 2 bottles of water, one still and one bubbly that are complimentary in room when you arrive, much more than what other hotels in Waikiki offer, which is usually all pay for drinks in the room. The hotel does offer day rates for rooms just needed for the day, if for example you would like to stay longer after check out, if your flight didn't leave until later in the evening and you wanted your room available until at least 7pm, they offer a $115 rate, which is nice,, a little expensive, but nice for families who may be traveling with little ones that need to have a place for them to nap or just take a rest. Overall the hotel was fabulous, their sister property the Halekulani next door is absolutly gorgeous and they offer signing rights at their restaurants for patrons who are staying at the Waikiki Parc Hotel, which is nice. The Halekulani restaurants are very nice, the food is immpecable and the views are stunning!! Both properties are nearby the beach, lots of food venues and restaurants, as well as chic boutique shopping and only a 5 minute walk to the International Market Place and the Trolleys!!

<Content>Modern  Spent 3 nights @ the Waikiki Parc in early July '07. Had booked a rate through Expedia for $164/night (parking incl.) for a deluxe mountainview room. At check-in, we decided What the heck, let's ask about an upgrade and we got a deluxe oceanfront view room for an additional $30/night (less than the normal $40/night upgrade, but don't forget the additional taxes tho!)We were part of a group that booked 3 other rooms in the hotel, and all the rooms were identical, except for the view. The rooms that are directly opposite Waikiki Beach actually have a pretty nice view of downtown Honolulu. The rooms on the western side of the hotel though have a horrible view of the hotel imperial which is right next door to the Waikiki Parc. The deluxe in the oceanfront view room description just means that the rooms are on higher floors - 16  up I think.The rooms and the hotel in general had a very hip and chic decor to it - similiar to the environment that the W hotel chain creates. Not my usual style, but it was tastefully done, and none of us had any complaints about it. The room itself is a wee bit small, but well appointed and decorated. The beds were fine, but the blankets/comforters were really comfortable. I can't explain exactly what it was about them that I liked, but they were not your usual hotel bedding.The old-school plantation shutters in front of the windows  balcony were a very nice touch. The lanai is very small, but 2 people can walk out on it and sit down in the provided chairs. Just barely, but it can be done. The ocean view is good but not fantastic. The whole left third of the view is blocked by the monolithic Sheraton, and the bottom third of the view is taken up by the Waikiki Parc's sister hotel, the Halekulani, which is right across the street. If you have thoughts of seeing Diamond Head from your hotel room, forget it, it's not possible. Still, it was very nice to wake up in the morning, flip open the plantation shutters from bed, and look at the ocean while rubbing the sleep out of your eyes.The bathroom was nice, with a huge backlit mirror. No real reason to point it out, other than the fact that I liked it. Water pressure for the shower was excellent.Beach access is through the lobby, out the back entrance and down a very short beach access walkway. You pop out in between the Halekulani and the Sheraton, and there's not much sand on that particular stretch of Waikiki, but if you walk to your left towards the old classic pink colored hotel (Royal Hawaiian?) and the Sheraton Moana Surfrider hotel, the beach opens up quite a bit.After being on Kaanapali beach on Maui, hanging out on Waikiki beach was quite a shock. We forgot how small and CROWDED Waikiki beach is, but on the plus side, we enjoyed Waikiki beach for how far out you can walk away from shore and still have the water be only waist-high in depth.The bellhop/valet desk at the front of the Waikiki Parc was fantastic. Beyond delivering our luggage and taking care of our rental cars, they also offered us plenty of beach towels, chair, body boards and floatation rings for the kids (free of charge). And did I mention that the beach was only a short walk away?The main shopping strip of Honolulu (Kalakeua Rd) was an easy 2 blk walk, away from the beach. Plenty of food options nearby too.Finally, I'd read some comments on TripAdvisor about construction noise around the Waikiki Parc before we traveled. There definitely is hotel renovation  construction going on close by to the Waikiki Parc. Happily, we didn't hear any of it. I don't know whether that's because of our room location, or because of where the construction firms are in their work schedule. What I did hear every early morning however was the @#$% garbage truck at 5am. I was surprised by that, considering we were on the 17th floor and had our windows closed. But I'm sure every other hotel's guests heard the same noise.The garbage truck was the only complaint I had during my stay at the Waikiki Parc, and I believe that has no reflection on the hotel or it's staff. If you want a room that doesn't look like every other hotel room you've stayed in, convenient access to the beach (w/o necessarily being RIGHT ON IT), and to the Honolulu shopping, you'll be happy staying at the Waikiki Parc.PS The hotel rents out these sexy Lotus Esprit cars for something like $200+/day. They mostly go unused and sit out in front of the hotel, and attract alot of attention. A neat gimmick in my opinion...

<Content>Modern  Modern interior, quiet ocean view rooms with some balconies available (lower levels have partially obstructed views of the ocean by the Sheraton and another hotel), located across from the public beach access path. Within one minute walk to shopping/dining/entertainment district. Nice staff. One downfall -- no direct access from the parking garage to the lobby.

<Content>Nice Modern Hotel I booked a package deal through Travelocity. I won't use Travelocity again. Be sure to read their terms and conditions. We had a mixup at the airport, and I called travelocity several times for their assistance, and the representatives I spoke with were completely useless. Travelocity apparently outsources their help lines and it was just a nightmare. As for the Waikiki Parc Hotel, it's a nice hotel right next to the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel and Royal Hawaiian. The hotel has been renovated and has a unique modern feel. The rooms are clean and comfortable. However, if you get a standard room, you are in for a surprise. The hotel that is directly south of the Waikiki Parc has a fan located at the edge of one of their top floors (I think it was 18th). We were on the 22nd and it was approximately a few stories below us. In any event, it was loud. We could not leave our balcony door open at night. It had to be kept closed and we used the air conditioning in the room (which worked great). But my wife and I like fresh air, but the noise of the fan from the other hotel was so loud, we couldn't sleep. I addressed this issue, but I didn't get the feel that management at the Waikiki hotel cared. They offered us a mountain view, which was still close to the fan. They could have offered us an ocean view, which would have put us away from the horrendous noise, but we had to pay extra. I was not about to pay more. The concierge service is excellent. They are very helpful.The extra charge for internet usage is just retarded. It's basic bad management.The Lotus cars the hotel rents are awesome. It's a great ride except everyone on the island looks are you. So don't rent it if you don't like attention.The porter service is great also. Overall, our experience was great with the exception of some of the workers at the reception desk who didn't seem to care if you were content with your stay.

<Content>Overpriced We stayed at Waikiki Parc in the ocean view room for 4 nights ($240/night with one night free). While the view is nice (although not a panoramic view, just a section between two tall building, it is nice nonetheless) and the room clean, about everything else I really have nothing nice to say. The property is not *on the beach* (it is a block away), which is not a big problem, but still there is a difference. And the price is just too expensive -- I really wish we had stayed somewhere else. On top of that, it does not include breakfast, they charge you $10 a day for internet access, and (get this!) $1 per *local* phone call. If you pay more than $200 a day, I think the least you should be entitled for at least free phone calls. The much humbler Sand Villa (where we stayed for one night) gives you a continental breakfast and free internet access for half the price. I would not stay at the Parc again.

<Content>Wonderful Stay at the Parc We had to book quickly when my son made it to an athletic meet being held in two weeks in Honolulu. The meet travel deals had been with the Sheraton Waikiki and were all sold out by the time we knew our son would progress to the championship. Lo and behold, we found this charming hotel just seconds behind the Sheraton for $50 less a night!Every staff member was more than friendly and many went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. The hip lobby and room decor was fun and fresh and my son used the changing colors of the lobby walls to indicate various degrees of luck at his competition. Concierge service was especially nice. We used a lot of taxis and very often were given stretch limos for our rides at the same price as a dinky cab. That was fun!The beach is maximum a 2 minute walk away, and our partial view of it was actually a full view from half of our room. The teeny standing balcony was a blessing just to have the fresh air in our room day and night from the open sliding glass door. What a thrill having clean white plantation shutters to adjust any way you want, rather than a dusty old curtain on the windows.The room was cleaned wonderfully. We left tips each day for housekeeping, on their little mahalo card, and yet some days, the ladies didn't even take the tips. Towels were clean and plentiful. Water pressure in the shower was great.The pool on the 8th floor is a pool. Nothing fancy. We used it for swimming and it served our purposes. We used the little exercise room for our underage athlete (just for the mat mainly) and were glad he was not thrown out. It's a tiny exercise room but was never full so it worked fine for us.If I had to search for something to improve at the Parc, I'd have to say the smell of the hallways. I preferred our hotel to the Sheraton but the upstairs hallways in the Sheraton smelled sort of perfumed and nice. Our hallways had a stale unpleasant smell upstairs.I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.

<Content>A great deal! Convenient location, renovated property, good service. This place is great! Got a great deal off the hotel website at $164 a night, including parking. The room was stylish enough and the staff did a lot to make everything easy for us. Valet parking was free, the concierge was helpful with recommendations and helped us make a reservation at Roy's for dinner. (yum!) I also like that the hotel is affiliated with the fancy Halekulani across the street. So if you want a spa treatment or drinks by the beach, you can just charge it to your room. The pool on the 8th floor is not so great so if you're looking for a great pool scene or fruity drinks by the pool, you're not going to get it. But the beach is just a 5 min walk away.

<Content>Great place to stay without the Waikiki Noise I recently stayed at the Waikiki Parc Hotel from January 1st 鈥?February 9th. I have stayed at some other establishments like the Waikiki Hyatt, Sheraton Waikiki, Royal Hawaiian, Moana, and the Waikiki Marriott for either business or pleasure. All of the other establishments charged unbelievable rates for noisy properties, musty rooms, and to add a insult to my stay, they nickel and dime you for things like in room coffee. Anyway, I had never heard of the Waikiki Parc Hotel and by the advice of United Airlines, I booked a room. I checked TripAdvisor and found so many people had written both negative and positive reviews about the establishment, which made me think, I made a major mistake. I arrived in the afternoon and realized I needed to put up with the Honolulu traffic going into Waikiki. I asked the person at the rental car desk where the Waikiki Parc Hotel was and she was not sure, but when I asked where the Halekulani Hotel was, she told me how to get to it. The Halekulani Hotel owns and operates the Waikiki Parc Hotel, and if you are not familiar with this hotel, check it out. It鈥檚 amazing. Anyway, I found my way from Ala Moana Blvd., to Kalakaua Ave., which is the main strip into Waikiki. I followed the directions and made a right onto Lewers and passed the new Embassy Suites Hotel, and at the end of Lewers on the left was the Halekulani. So, I made a left and about a 陆 block on the left was the Waikiki Parc Hotel, but it was the back side of the hotel. So, I jumped back into the car and went around the block to the front of the hotel. It looked like an Apartment building with a garage above the lobby area. So, I checked in and was surprised how modern the hotel truly was. They gave me a room on the 10th floor with a view of the Pacific Ocean. The room is kind of small, but how much space do you truly need? It鈥檚 very modern and it has everything one would want in a hotel room. What I was truly surprised about was how quiet it was. No traffic, No noise, but the sweet sounds of Hawaiian music being played outside from the Halekulani鈥檚 House without a Key. The staff works very hard to make your stay an enjoyable one and the security is very tight. The only problem I found with this hotel was the lack of a restaurant within the hotel. However, when you check in, they do advise you that a new restaurant will open in a few months, but you can use any of the facilities at it鈥檚 sister hotel the Halekulani. For those complaining about not having a restaurant on the premises, have you stayed at a Mega Resort, you walk miles to get to it鈥檚 restaurant, so walking a few steps to the Halekulani鈥檚 restaurants is nothing. Anyway, I found this hotel great and intend to stay at this hotel again. If you want to spend tons of money and get nothing for it, stay at the other hotels I mentioned above, however if you are looking for a hotel that is located in a sweet location, quiet and a diamond in the rough, stay at the Waikiki Parc Hotel, you won鈥檛 be disappointed.

<Content>Good choice for Waikiki My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for three nights in the beginning of January before heading off to Maui. We then returned to the hotel for one more night before heading back home. Overall the hotel is nice and a good deal. It was recently renovated and the hotel property did a very good job. It has a boutique feel - not as good as the W but the prices aren't like the W either...The location is great, it's only steps from the beach and from some great shopping. The rooms are nice with some cute modern finishes. We paid an extra $30 for an upgrade to an ocean view room and the view was fabulous! I would highly recommend an upgrade for that price.The staff was also very nice. The hotel has a laundry facility (which is a great perk), where guests can do their own laundry. Unfortunately the dryers broke after I put my clothing in the washer. With a little persuading the manager on site agreed to have my laundry sent out for free, which I thought was very nice. We also received a box of chocolates upon returning to the hotel for the last leg of our trip (a nice touch).I would not recommend having breakfast at the hotel. There are a lot of breakfast options in Waikiki and unfortunately Waikiki Parc doesn't really stand up. For a good breakfast right on the beach check out Duke's (less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel). If you're in the mood to splurge the Royal Hawaiian (pink hotel) has a great breakfast but it is pricey.If you're looking for a reasonably priced nice hotel steps away from the beach, I would recommend staying at the Waikiki Parc.

<Content>A pleasant surprise After reading a mix of reviews about this property, I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of rooms, service or ambiance. Friends that made the Hawaiin vacation with us and I even thought about staying somewhere else after receiving a letter from the acting hotel manager indicating they were still in the middle of renovations to the entire property. Our chief concern was the fact that we had booked a Sunrise package that included the rooms, free parking and a buffet breakfast each morning, but the hotel's restaurants had been closed for renovations and the new facility would not open until 2/07. To accommodate the guests with this breakfast package, the Parc offers an outside breakfast buffet on the 8th floor. If that is not satisfactory, they give vouchers to three different hotel restaurants within easy walking distance. We decided to give a try since we couldn't find anything else at a comparable price on short notice, and we were only going to be there for two nights before flying to Maui. When we arrived at the Parc, we were greeted by a very friendly valet attendant who informed us we could either use valet or self parking, both at no charge since the parking had been included in our package. One worry down, after reading at least one review on this site about the refusal to give free parking after purchasing the same package deal. The next concern gleaned from previous reviews was the attitude of the staff. When we checked in, the front desk staff was completely accommodating. I had booked a higher floor room with a mountain view as part of the package, but noticed upon check-in that my room was on the 10th floor, considered one of the lower floors. I mentioned this to the desk clerk and she politely pointed out to me that they were unable to meet my request for a higher floor and instead, upgraded me to an ocean view room, an additional $30/night value. I couldn't complain. The Parc likes to describe itself as chic and I must agree that is a good choice of words. Very eclectic and modernistic, but also minimalistic, this hotel is the antithesis of other hotels in the same area who wish to preserve the old feel for Hawaii. The renovated public areas are pleasing to the eyes with unusual lighting displays and wall fixtures.When we arrived at our room, we were again pleasantly pleased with what we found. The renovations to the old building were not completely transparent, but very well done with good taste. The room was immaculately clean and neat, there was plenty of room for unpacking, and the window and balcony had sliding shutter type doors to block out the afternoon sun. The balcony was small, but big enough for two to sit and relax. The view was quite lacking since the Parc is situated one block from the beach and has other hotels in between it and the ocean. The view from our lower floor room of the ocean was a narrow one, in between two other hotels. A higher floor room may provide a better view to at least some extent.The following morning, we tried the buffet on the 8th floor and found it to be adequate with hot breakfast food rather than the typical continental cold pastries and coffee affair. The selection was quite good, offering scrambled eggs, choice of meats, potatoes, hot and cold cereal and an abundance of fruit. On our second morning, we decided to try Duke's in the Outrigger Hotel, one of the voucher choices, and found an even better breakfast with more variety. No complaints about the breakfast that was offered.It must be noted that valet was very quick, getting us our car in five minutes or less each time we went out. The biggest negative I can think of about the Parc is that we booked our rooms 10 months in advance, but upon arrival, our friends were stuck in a room that had two full size beds when they had specifically requested a king bed. On the second day, they were upgraded and moved to an ocean view room with king bed, similar to ours, but they had to go through the hassle of not unpacking the first night and putting up with a smaller bed. Although the staff was most accommodating about the mistake, it made us wonder why they couldn't get it right with a 10 month lead time.Overall, I would recommend the Parc to the traveler on a budget who either cannot or does not want to afford the more expensive and plush hotels in Waikiki. The Parc's price isn't the cheapest in town, but considerably less than some of the larger hotels. All in all, this is a good case of getting what you pay for, suitable for either the business traveler or the couple on vacation.

<Content>Great Stay! We stayed here for 3 nights for our honeymoon before out 11 night cruise departed from Honolulu. The hotel is VERY CLOSE to the beach. It was clean and the room was modern and comfortable. The hotel was under construction during our stay but this did not affect our time there. Breakfast on the lanai was great and we booked through Costco Travel. You can also eat breakfast at several other locations with your vouchers. It was walking distance to all the shopping and the porters were very helpful in finding us transportation. We would definitely stay here again if we go back to Waikiki. They also gave us a gift of chocolate covered nuts with a note congratulating us on our marriage!

<Content>Chic, loved the renovations My husband and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for the first two nights for our two week Hawaiian vacation. Wakiki is not my favorite spot, but is a great stop to recoup after the long trip from the east coast. The hotel is well hidden and with the construction and one way streets, a little difficult to find. But once there, an easy walk to everything. The hotel is very chic and comtemporary. We were upgraded to an oceanfront room. The hotel sits a bit back from the ocean and inbetween two other hotels, but it was still a perfect oceanfront room. The room was quite small. The bedding was the most comfortable I slept in the two weeks in Hawaii and we were at 4 other resorts. Windows went across the whole front of our room, coverd by wooden shutters. The balcony was nice to just sit on, but we were hardly in our room. Flat screenTV was a bonus, not all resorts have them yet. Roof top pool small, and not even being used when we walked up to view it.The staff was helpful and friendly. We very pleased with the chocolates left on our bed in celebration of our 25th anniversary.Biggest draw back is, no place to eat in the hotel. Everyone likes to get up and not have to run out for coffee, but we made the best of it and walked the beach and found coffe along the way. This hotel needs a coffee shop.The hotel was very clean, other than the front rug as you entered. Maybe when the renovations are completed, this problem will be corrected. We eat on the main strip. Cheseburger Paradise and Cheese- Cake Factory were great. Great hotel for a couple days only. Not the resort feel we like, but a good rest for a couple days in Waikiki. Went to Pearl Harbor, a must everytime we go. I would return to this hotel but only as a day or two stop. Perfect for our needs.

<Content>Very Chic I was pleasantly surprised about the Waikiki Parc Hotel. It's within a minute walk to the beach and the main shopping areas. The hotel and the rooms were nicely decorated. It's described as chic in one of the advertisements in the elevators and I agree that it is. The rooms were clean and I had no problems or issues with the service I received from the staff. In fact, every morning the housekeeper would take the time to say good morning to me when I passed her on my way to the elevators. The exercise room is small and the pool is not olympic, but it's not that small that you can't do laps (but it is 3 to 4 ft deep). Overall, I would definitely stay at the Waikiki Parc Hotel again and I would highly recommend this hotel to people who want to stay close to the beach and the main shopping areas.

<Content>hmmm That Smells Odd Stayed at the hotel while In Waiki on business, the hotel is located at the end of a dark ally in a construction zone, with the hotel itself being partially under construction (no resturant/bar). Major complaint about this property was when I initially checked in I was given a room that was infested with mold and mildew. Eventually after complaining to the staff I was given another room in which i was not able to detect any mold or mildew odor. Aside from the smell, the hotel itself is generally clean, with a very efficient staff. In the event that you are looking for a hotel for a romantic vacation I would suggest that you absolutely look else where, I repeat do not stay here if you want you want a happy spouse. If your just in town on business for a few days, the facilities are just OK.

<Content>very nice hotel The hotel rooms are beautiful and the beds are so comfortable. Still doing a little renovating and the staff was a little absent, but the property was amazing. We stayed in a ocean view and the Lewers St project was quite loud but patience pays off. I would for sure stay here again.......

<Content>Stay elsewhere We booked a room for a wedding at the end of September, and planned to stay from September 28 to October 2. We didn't.We arrived and checked in, and were handed a stack of receipts, brochures, and the like. We went to our room, and all seemed well enough. Until I received a phone call from a friend whose mother was staying at the Waikiki Parc. He asked whether I had read the memo from management. I hadn't even known there was one.Slipped in with the brochures and receipts, sure enough, there was a memo that said that, from 10 pm until 6 am, there would be no hot water, no cold water, and no air conditioning because of maintenance on the hotel's water system. Sure, a hotel may need to do maintenance, but, although they admitted knowing about it for several weeks, they did not contact us before we arrived. More appallingly, however, they didn't tell us about the problem when we checked--instead slipping the note in with other materials, apparently hoping that we wouldn't notice until it was too late.When we asked what their plans were for guests who might want to--oh, I dunno--use the bathroom or brush their teeth before going to sleep (to say nothing of taking a shower), they had nothing. They would not even offer us bottled water to brush our teeth.We checked out, will never stay at this hotel, and will never recommend it to anyone. Not because of the water issue--admittedly, maintenance work just sometimes needs to be done. Instead, the hotel's appallingly bad customer service makes this a hotel you really should skip.

<Content>Will be nice when it is done We stayed here one night pre-cruise on September 3rd. The hotel is undergoing major renovations. As a result, check in was in a make-shift room while the front desk and lobby areas are being worked on. The check-in process was smooth, staff friendly and our room was ready. We had a renovated room, ocean view which was very nice, sleek and clean. Bedding was very comfy. Location is great, two blocks from everything (shopping, restaurants) but there is major construction in the area affecting not only this hotel but others close by. Not a big deal. The hotel is not on the beach so the ocean view is past other hotels on the ocean. Still beautiful. The best part of our stay was watching the sunset while drinking an incredible Mai Tai at their sister hotel - the Halekulani, right across the street. A must do!The hotel, once completed will be a lovely boutique hotel but currently amenities are lacking and quite frankly if I was staying in the area for longer than one night, I would definitely want to be on the beach. With renovations in the works and no restaurant right now (Nobu is coming!), would have been a nice touch to have been offered free breakfast at their sister hotel considering the renovations that are taking place.

<Content>Great Hotel for the Price We stayed at the hotel from August 21-26. The hotel was greater than we expected. The room we stayed in was remodeled with new bathroom and bedroom furnishings. It had a modern Japanese feel to it. The tiles and grout, however, could use some remodeling! The hotel was also only a block from the beach. All you need to do is walk past the sister hotel and there you are! The location was also great as it was walking distances to a lot of eateries and shopping centers! This was great since there were no restaurants open at the Parc. The customer service was excellent! The front desk and housekeepers were friendly and helpful. And if you happen to have a late night flight, like we did, they have complimentary showers you can use if you so happen to bathe in the beach after you check out!

<Content>never again. Nice room, horrible customer service. It all started upon check in. First, driving up in our rent a car, we were informed that we would be paying the $18 a night parking. Our online reservation mentioned free parking. So after we dealt with that ( by paying $18), we went to check in and they told us our room would not be ready for an hour. No big deal, they have a nice little waiting room but it was full. so we sat on the concrete floor. So anyways.. hotel common areas looked like a 2 star hotel. not nice, under construction, and not very clean. Our rooms actually though were pretty nice, new fixtures and nice accents.. so the rooms where good. Until we went to bed. Around 11:30pm i woke to water dripping on my head. I called front desk, and for the next hour and a half i had to deal with maintenance guys in the room, wet floors and towels everywhere. The night manager was actually nice, he said  we will put you in a new room.. great. just what i wanna do at 12am.. pack up and move rooms. But i guess its better then sleeping under a waterfall. Manager calls back 15 minutes later.. sorry we have no more rooms. great. he promises a room with a better view in the morning, and invited us to a continental breakfast in the hotel while they move our bags. ok.. not bad i guess. So morning comes, we call down and they inform they are cleaning our rooms. 8:30am. i say fine ask where the restaurant is. they say 8th floor so we go.Nice looking breakfast. Guy looks at his sheet and says  no complementary breakfast for you, that will be $40 please.  wow. I call manager from restaurant. she answers the hotel phone with a  YO, whaas up?  mmm.. i can tell by that level of proffesionalism how this is gonna go.. and i was right. her response is, sorry your package doesnt come with free breakast.  Immm... my package also doesnt come with latelnight waterfalls in my room and Joe blow the maintanence guy busting in on me and my lovely wife during our honeymoon. so now im starting to get mad. Im not going to mention the night manager tell us about breakfast or get into it.. obviously they ruin our night and want us to pay for our breakfast that we are required to goto while they change rooms? what the heck? no compassion from manager.. i hang up. i dont even want to fight with the hotel, so we leave. for breakfast. 2 hours goes by. We come back, and ask for the new room keys, woman says  sorry not ready yet i ask why it takes 3 hours to clean a room and get no intelligant response. So here i sit.. in my old room waiting for the roof to cave in.. waiting for the new room to be ready after its 8 hour detailing. never again i say.. never again. if this hotel just got a better manager, it could be on of the best hotels off the beach. oh,, as a side note, apart from the major interior renovations, there is a new hotel going up across the street ( the side you look at if you dont get ocean view).. so be prepared to relax to the soothing sounds of jackhammers and semi truck honks as you bask in the constant smell of wet paint. Peter Land.

<Content>Last time I will stay here Luckily we didn't let our experience at this hotel ruin our trip to Hawaii because it very easily could have. It all started by using Expedia to book the hotel. Our package included free parking and free breakfast. Before leaving home, I spent an entire day on the phone with Expedia and the hotel becase the hotel would not honor Expedia's promise of free parking. After that was finally taken care of, we thought everything would be great. The hotel itself was nice and we had a great view of the ocean, but their customer service stinks! On the first morning, we went to have breakfast and were informed that it was not included in our package. Again, after spending forever on the phone with Expedia and talking to the management of the hotel, the hotel would NOT honor the package we purchased for a simple breakfast which was just that, simple. They made us feel like cheap skates for simply wanting what we purchased in our package through Expedia. The assistant manager even said Expedia could promise you a Mercedes but we don't have to give you one. We just let it drop and went on having a great time in Hawaii. I am just amazed that the hotel will not honor the promises made by a service soliciting their hotel. I will never use Expedia again and I will never stay at the Waikiki Parc again.

<Content>A very nice hotel We decided on the Waikiki Parc and got a great deal online, but were wondering what to expect from some of the reviews. Our experience was excellent. Front desk staff was friendly and efficient. Room was as promised, ocean view, across from the Halekulani. The room was beautiful, clean and recently remodeled, with indirect lighting; the lanai was nice for morning coffee or relaxing in the evening after a long day in the city and on the beach. With current construction in the area, the hotel was hard to find on the first day, but once we understood where to go we had no problems. Parking garage makes having a car convenient. Breakfast on the lanai on the eighth floor is Asian cuisine, but the Halekulani, its sister hotel, has a traditional buffet that was excellent. The hotel restaurant is closed due to remodeling. Signs indicate it will be open in December of 2006. We would stay there again.

<Content>Worst hotel experience we've had! My daughter and I had planned an 8-night stay at the Waikiki Parc, but we were so disgusted that we moved out after two nights. We were in a deluxe ocean view room, which we discovered was directly above the loading dock to a nearby hotel. Each morning at 6 or 7am we were awakened by the BEEP, BEEP, BEEP sound of trucks backing up. Despite advertisements about the bountiful breakfast buffet and room service, we found out that the restaurants are closed until further notice, and that room service consists of delivery of food from a local service (for 6.99) in a styrofoam container! Breakfast was some stale danish, hard fruit, and prepackaged ham and cheese sandwiches. The workout room equipment was not working, and the pool looked like it was in desperate need of updating. The room itself was not too bad, but it was not completely carpeted, so there was nothing to absorb the noise coming from the room above us. This hotel is billed as the sister to Halekulani - the fabulous hotel across the street that is ranked one of the best in the world (and it is -- I have stayed there!), but this is a farce. We moved over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is always fabulous! This was our third stay there and we were definitely not disappointed. Just be aware if you choose this hotel that you may not get any sleep or promised amenities. Also, there is construction going on all around the hotel for about a three block radius so even walking down the street is a dusty and noisy experience. For me, it's quieter at home!

<Content>Great Stay! We live here in Hawaii but plan a family getaway once or twice a year for special occasions.Ocean view room was comfortable and clean. The shower/tub was spacious and the water was plentiful and very very hot. We were missing 2 sets of towels on check in but they were delivered immediately. Although the ocean is just across the street the kids loved the heated pool and had to be dragged out. Breakfast buffet was so so...variety could have been a bit better. The staff were helpful and very friendly. It was definitely a hit with the family.

<Content>No aloha at the Waikiki Parc This is a problematic hotel with serious customer service issues, starting with the staff at the front desk. One young woman in particular consistently acted as though she had been roused from hibernation to do her job. I was concerned for her health as she may have a sleep disorder.  During our five day stay, there was no encounter with the front desk that did not consume a minimum of thirty minutes or create auxiliary problems that required later redress i.e., another trip to the front desk or another time-consuming phone call. There was absolutely no spirit of competency, hospitality, or ordinary courtesy, much less aloha, at the Waikiki Parc. Inexcusable at any hotel, but particularly irritating in Hawaii.  We love Oahu, travel there frequently, and we're very much looking forward to our next stay at the Moana Surfrider.

<Content>A work in progress; bring earplugs Although we had no glaring problems that made us rush down to the desk to complain, this was a classic not what we expected stay. The staff is exceedingly helpful and the lobby is well appointed and clean, but our individual room did not seem to meet these same standards. As posted elsewhere, this hotel (and just about everything in this VERY urban beach neighborhood) is undergoing extensive construction and renovations, and our overall impression was that a lot of the general room upkeep has been sacrificed in the spirit of we're re-doing everything anyway, so why waste money bringing things up to standard? The bathroom tile floor and fixtures were clean, but the grout hasn't been scrubbed in ages, and everything has a dull, gritty look to it. The rugs, bedding, etc...are of an acceptable level, but again, only probably on par with a mid-level chain motel. Our 19th floor partial view room did, in fact, have a great view--of the parking lot and hotel-in-progress next door, and construction machinery revved up each morning well before dawn (weekends included). I'd be willing to bet this will be a nice joint when all is finished, but until then, I'd have to recommend a quiter, cleaner location if you're looking to relax in peace.

<Content>Great Location, Some Construction Noise We stayed at the Parc from Feb. 25 - Mar. 2, 2006, the room was clean, but could use some updating, we did have a small balcony with an ocean view. The location was great, very short walk to the beach and plenty of restaurants. The buffet breakfast was wonderful, many choices. The downside was the construction noise during the day, which we didn't here too much of because we were not in our room much during the day, and also the deliverys at the hotel next door at about 2am - 5am. The service from the hotel staff was great! Overall this was a good choice for the price, I would stay here again after the construction was done.

<Content>Super for the Price This is a great location and reasonably priced for Waikiki. (Check their website for good deals off season.) Rooms are fairly small, but clean and tastefully furnished. Don't expect much of a view, but access to the beach is right across the street. There is an adjacent garage if you have a car.The breakfast buffet is excellent, but I would skip the restaurant for dinner. You'll have plenty of other choices in the area.A word of warning. There is a lot of construction going on nearby, which will probably continue for some time. If this bothers you, check before you book.

<Content>Great Location! We just got back from a quick 4-day trip to Oahu and stayed at the Waikiki Parc which is just across the street from the beach. The rooms are small but extremely clean. Had a small refrigerator, hair dryer, ironing board/iron, clock radio with CD player. Everyone was very friendly and the service was great. We had a full breakfast buffet every morning which was included in the price of our room. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. It is in close walking distance to almost everything.

<Content>OK, but not 4 star rating This was my first time in Hawaii and I based my hotel accomodations on the reviews on tripadvisor. My fiance and I spent 5 nites in the Waikiki Parc and we were in no way awed by what we got for a 4 star rating. We reserved the room for $149/nite which was a good deal considering the location, but that was as far as the ammenities went. The room had partial ocean view. The balcony could barely fit the 2 of us standing side by side! The room was clean as the reviews stated. The bathroom was tiny and reminded me of a Motel 6 bathroom that I had some 20+ years ago!! Don't forget to ask for a room high up because the construction noise is loud. Overall, the room was average, but our vacation was excellent and we hardly spent anytime in the room.

<Content>Loved the location Just returned from a 10 day Christmas holiday in Waikiki - my 3rd visit to the island of Oahu. We had a family reunion with 11 of us staying at the Waikiki Parc -ages ranging from 88 years to 2 years. I am not certain of the age of the hotel but it appears fairly new - we all had Deluxe Oceanview rooms (5) and they were a good size with plenty of room to move around. My daughter and I shared a room with 2 queen size beds, a desk with chair and internet connection, a corner coffee table and arm chair, a bureau with plenty of drawer space, a large closet with lots of hangers, a small bar fridge which came in very handy for snacks and drinks, and a very large bathroom with another telephone!! The hotel was excellent - rooms were exceptionally clean, the staff extremely helpful and friendly, the breakfast buffet had an incredible choice each morning, the elevators(3) were express, never kept us waiting and security was never an issue. On the 8th floor there is a well equipped exercise room, laundry room and pool. The pool is shallow, kept extremely clean and usually very quiet -a wonderful spot for my mother to suntan and read and for the rest of us to retreat to from the beach prior to changing for dinner. My mother had brought her walker but the hotel had a wheelchair (left with the bellmen outside) that was at her disposal, free of charge, every day. (Note - they do have some rooms with wheelchair accessible showers - be sure to make this request in advance.)What we enjoyed most about the hotel was its location. The 5-star Halukalani hotel is right out the east door and is a sister hotel with room signing privileges. Starbucks, Denny's and a large ABC convenience store are just around the corner. The beach is just a short walk away out the East door down a short paved walkway to an uncrowded part of Waikiki beach. From the hotel it is a 15 minute walk south to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and a nearby park/playground and lagoon for the children. From the West door of the hotel it is a short 5 minute walk to Kalakahua, the main road, where shops abound and from there it is a 15 minute walk north to the Zoo and Kapiolani Park. So within a very short walking distance there was something for all ages.Yes, it is nestled in amongst other hotels with the Sheraton Waikiki and the Royal Hawaiian right next door; and if you have the lanai door open it can get noisy during the day with the construction that is also occuring around it - but who goes to Hawaii to stay in their room during the day! Noise was never an issue as it never kept any of us from sleeping nor waking us up.I only experienced 2 disappointments on my trip. I am a fresh air person and our lanai was only about a foot deep - not enough room to sit on a chair with wine glass or coffee in hand to enjoy the view or read. If you want a large lanai you need to book an oceanview room. My second disappointment was that 2 years ago they stopped the free Kodak hula show in Kapiolani Park because of funding issues.A few suggestions for you:1)DO take a circle island tour as it is well worth the $21 - a fullday from 9 to 5. We rented 2 minivans and the tour helped orient us to where we wanted to return to spend more time.2)If you want to snorkel at Hanauma Bay DO NOT go on a Sat or Sun and DO go early. We arrived at 8 a.m. They close the parking lot once it is full and you could have a 2 hour wait to get in. Otherwise take a tour there or a Waikiki bus.3)The cheapest place to buy macadamia nuts and Kona coffee (and other souveniers)is at the 24-hour Walmart about 3 blocks west of the Ala Moana shopping centre. We also purchased our snorkeling equipment there at very reasonable prices -lots of selection.4)On the south side of the Outrigger Reef hotel, just a 5-10 minute walk away, are several outdoor fast food restaurants - believe me, there is something to please everyone and the prices are very reasonable. Do try the pizza - $5 for a 4 slice pizza and drink. There is a small park with several concrete picnic tables and benches right next to the beach - a terrific spot to have dinner and watch the sunset over the Pacific Ocean. Wish I were back there!!...

<Author>A TripAdvisor Member
<Content>Kacho sushi restaurant - Waikiki Parc I was introduced to the Waikiki Parc via TripAdvisor.com and have found the reviews there fairly representative of my own experience until tonight - better than average accomodations across the street from Waikiki Beach. Since my last stay there in April of this year and the fire that had us scurrying from our room in the early hours of the morning, we have relocated permanently to Honolulu and visited the Waikiki Parc and sister property, Halekulani, and their respective restaurants and high dollar shops more times than can be counted. Honestly. Imagine my surprise then when my party was turned away this evening from the Waikiki Parc's sushi bar because I was wearing flip flops with my khaki pants and linen shirt.I had visited their website earlier in the evening to peruse the menu and noted their dress code as informal/resort attire (I made a copy lest they change it as a result of this review.) My party of two had already spent $120+ next door in the Halekulani's informal House Without A Key and had planned to continue the evening next door at the Waikiki Parc until Kacho manager Tatsuya Nishizaki summarily turned us away despite hastily ushering in a party of three ahead of us that was all clad in jeans and T-shirts.I have dined up and down Waikiki and Honolulu (including the Waikiki Parc Cafe, Halekulani's House Without a Key, Orchids, La Mer, and others like Roys, DK Steaks, Sansei, Hy's, and Canoe's at the Ilikai, etc) without once being made to feel as insignificant as this experience at Waikiki Parc's Kacho. The manager there steadfastly refused to acknowledge the disconnect between the published dress code and the rude treatment he was dishing out. Even the managers on duty at the Waikiki Parc and sister property Halekulani both felt compelled to pass the buck to restaurant policy, and neither could explain what made jeans and T-shirts acceptable and sandals with khaki slacks and linen shirts verboten. My companion had on Birkenstocks, but it was only my shoes that kept us out according to Tatsuya Nishizaki. It didn't even matter that we were asking to be seated at the nearly empty sushi bar. In my experience, Honolulu is by far the most casual and informal of cities and generally receptive of any. My time in Waikiki has not been for naught, however; I understand what moves the economy here. This time, though, even I was surprised at the lengths at which this lesson was driven home. My suggestion would be to carefully chose where to spend your American dollars. They are appreciated at some locales more than others.

<Content>Comfortable, Friendly, Well located hotel Stayed here Dec. 6-12, 2005. The rooms are small, but comfortable, clean, and well equipped. Everyone on the staff that we had contact with was efficient and friendly. We found the restaurant satisfactory, but over priced. There is a multitude of dining options within a couple blocks.Location is the strongest benefit of this property, and that is why I have given such a high rating to an otherwisw average hotel. The beach, shopping, other top hotels, and restaurants are just a few steps. We had a rental car, but really didn't use it that much. This hotel is a good chioce for people who want to be at a nice place in the center of the Waikiki action, but do not want to pay oceanfront prices.Now, to the downside of this review, the complaints about construction and noise are valid. It didn't bother us, but people who are sensitive about that sort of thing might be happier elsewhere, perhaps outside of Waikiki. The whole area is crowded and noisy, even around the delux properties.

<Content>Awful - Checked out after one night After reading fairly good reviews on TripFinder I booked my stay at the hotel for a 4-day trip. Overall the hotel lacks any personality, but my main complaint was with the rooms. There were bugs in the bathroom, a sticky carpet and the room smelled awful and was freezing. I told the hotel that I was unhappy with the room and they didn't seem to care. There are much better deals than this hotel in Honolulu.

<Content>Pretty good My wife and I were there for 3 nights the first week of Dec. As others have noted, the lobby is nothing fancy compared to luxury hotels. However, the whole place was clean and up to date feeling, which is better than other value priced hotels in the Waikiki area. We got the package that included parking and breakfast, with a mountain view room. The breakfast is good, however, we found that we only wanted a muffin and coffee from Starbucks on a couple of mornings. So, for us, it might not have been worth the extra cost. If your strategy is to have a large breakfast, small snack for lunch or early dinner, or something like that, it's a good deal. The elevators were very fast and we felt very secure, because of having to use the room key to access the upper floors. The only really complaint we had was about the tiny lanai. No room for a chair, just big enough for one person to stick their toes out. Only a curved bump out from the window, maybe 12 inches deep at the widest point. Our room was a 14th floor mountain view room. We noticed that the ocean side rooms had lanais big enough for a couple of chairs. Also, because of the parking garage roof, all rooms on the 8th floors had huge lanais, big enough for a round table with 4 chairs, plus room for more after that.The beach was a 2-minute walk away, the main strip of shops was about a 3-minute walk the other way, so the location is nearly ideal for the price. No noise problems in the morning. I think that I faintly heard the backup beepers at around 5 AM, but it was not an issue. Maybe our noise tolerance is different. Maybe we were high enough to not hear.The staff was very friendly and professional.For the price, this one is hard to beat, especially if you want clean, safe and quiet. There's no grandeur, but all and all a very satisfactory experience.

<Content>Just Ok! There is nothing upscale associated with this hotel !! The Lobby was very average, and there were no grounds to give the place any ambiance. Our room which was listed as Deluxe Ocean View was also very average, I can't imagine what the Standard Room looks like! From the tiny balcony the noise of the Sheraton's a/c units and loading dock down below was deafening (trucks backing up w/ their beepers on as early as 5:00 AM)! And of course I know ocean view' is a relative term because I realize there is also ocean front, but suffice it to say that half the view is staring at the 30 story Sheraton and their guests and we were on the 21st out of 23 floors.   The one bright spot was the breakfast brunch each morning where the selection varied daily  the food fresh  tasty. The breakfast staff very efficient and w/ a smile even though it was a very busy Thanksgiving weekend (Server Alex comes to mind). On the other hand we tried to have lunch at their Japanese restaurant Kacho on Saturday at 1:45 PM and they turned us away even though the sign said open until 2:00 PM. Who turns business away in the middle of the tourist district 15 minutes prior to close? We ended up going across the street at the Halekulani Hotel which as it turns out is a sister hotel. Now that is a hotel worthy of mention, beautiful lobby, great grounds, and restaurants that don't turn you away because they have limited hours.   To cap off our stay their WIFI didn't work, so I was forced to try to use their business center to check my e-mail and print our boarding passes.Well their Sunday night Staffer at the front desk refused to give the password to access the system, even though I showed him our package paperwork that indicated unlimited use of business center. His definition was you can use but you must pay for it at a $10 rt.   Speaking of nickel  dime-ing I thought the $3.75 daily charge for using the in-room safe was tacky! It is for our protection and their peace of mind!So unless you get a really good package price don't waste your precious vacation time when there are plenty of better choices nearby!

<Content>Nice hotel but noisy in the morning This hotel has a lot pluses going for it and one major minor. It's centrally located in Waikiki, it's off the main drag, it's clean, has good parking and has easy access to the beach and shopping.Our package included breakfast, parking and a rental car. The restaurant food was very good and the was service friendly and accommodating.The room was clean with a nice view of the beach. The pool (on the 7th floor) is small and water was cold. A parking garage is connected to the hotel and is very convenient. At check-in they recommended valet parking for which we were not charged any extra. The self park entrance is at the front of the hotel on the next street over from Lewers. Use the self parking after you retrieve your car.The major minor to this hotel is the 4 AM - 6 AM noise of the delivery trucks backing up into the Sheraton off Lewers. It's a loud beep-beep-beep that echoes off the buildings. If anybody says it's not noisy, then they are deaf. Until the PARC does something to fix this issue (they are aware of it), plan go to bed at 9 PM or stick some cotton in your ears or stay somewhere else.

<Content>Honeymooning in Paradise After sorting through the reviews on TripAdvisor, my husband and I chose a Deluxe Mountain View Room at the Waikiki Parc for our honeymoon in Oahu. The room was pleasant and big enough to move around in, with a pretty view of the city and mountains. We kept the sliding door to the balcony shut, and never had noise problems. (If not for the alarm clock provided by the hotel, we would never have gotten out of our comfy king-sized bed!)The American buffet breakfast was huge -- and when I wanted a change on the last day, I enjoyed the traditional Japanese breakfast that was also offered. The wait staff in the dining room were really pleasant and friendly.But one of the best features of the hotel was being able to walk out the back entrance, across a side street, and down a strip of pavement to a small, uncrowded section of Waikiki Beach. (The crowds are further down the beach, near the larger hotels and public areas.)Though not the most luxurious hotel in the area, the Waikiki Parc was a lovely place where we could sleep in peace and enjoy a big breakfast, and it cost less than $200/night. Save your money for cocktails on the beach!

<Content>Very pleased with Parc Hotel We were confident after reading all the reviews that we would be happy with our hotel. We are excited to say that yes we were! After arriving, we were sure to ask for a room on the fifteenth floor or higher facing the south. We got one on the sixteenth floor and it was amazing! We walked in our room and all we saw was ocean! It was beautiful and so inviting! The rooms were clean, and there was plenty of room. The noise was minimum and unless you plan to stay in some very secluded resort which we have, then what do you expect? It was very comfortable, the staff was nice, the bell guys outside were so on the ball, they were great! The guy that planned our activities was great! This hotel is right in the middle of a lot of other great hotels, restaurants, and shops! and the beach! Everything was in good walking distance. We have to be honest, we only ate breakfast once at the hotel and it was good, but we were always gone and doing stuff so we didnt eat much at the hotel. Good place to stay and good prices! Make sure to get a room facing the beach, cause it does make a huge difference, even if your only in your room very little, trust us it will make a huge difference!

<Content>A Great Place To Stay I have just returned from spending nine days at the Waikiki Parc and I am very glad I did. This was my fourth visit to Waikiki having previously stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and Moana Surfrider. I stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View room on the 17th floor. It has to be said, at the moment the streets surrounding the hotel are a construction site, but honestly I didnt hear much noise at all. I would suggest if noise is an issue, you try and get a room facing Kalia Road. As for the noise from the Sheraton loading docks it didnt bother me at all and in fact if you live in a large city as I do you are pretty use to noise. But it was no where near as bad as some people have previously reported on this website. Certainly not non stop! I wondered what all the fuss was about! I had no trouble sleeping. As for fellow guests I never heard a sound and my room was close to the lifts. Better still if you want peace and quiet Waikiki is probaly not for you, I suggest going to one of the other islands which provide that sort of holiday. The breakfast was standard buffet with choices changing each day. I felt no urge to seek out alternatives as the service, food and choice was more than reasonable. I was welcomed by name every morning by Leigh. No mean feat considering the hotel was fully booked. Some mornings there were lines but the wait never exceded 15 minutes. The room size has been mentioned in a number of reviews. It was more than adequate for a single traveller such as myself. It would be suitable for couples too however it may be a squeeze for a family. Whilst not the largest hotel room I have stayed in, it was by no means the smallest. As rooms go it had all the comforts one needs when one is travelling. I couldnt find one fault. I was glad the fridge was empty so I could purchase what I liked to fill it rather than overpriced mini bar items. But really what are you doing in your room other than sleeping showering etc? Very few people go on a holiday to stay in their room all day. The hotel is just so central to everything. The beach is across the road. A well stocked ABC store is just around the corner. Dennys, McDonalds, Starbucks and Jamba Juice are all nearby. You are a five minute stroll to a bus stop that takes you to Ala Moana Shopping Centre, Pearl Harbour and beyond. Nothing was more than a stroll away. I can recommend House Without A Key at the Halekulani for evening entertainment, food and cocktails. Despite not being a guest at the hotel I was made to feel very welcome.It speaks for itself that I have visited Hawaii four times I love the place. I am so glad I have found this hotel it is far better value than the other hotels in the area. I look forward to staying again at the Waikiki Parc on my next visit to Hawaii.

<Content>Thank you TripAdvisor! Thanks to Tripadvisor we chose to stay at the Waikiki Parc for our first trip to, Oahu, Hawaii. I spent many hours researching all the reviews on Tripadvisor and chose this hotel solely because of the great reviews. We loved it! We stayed in September for 5 days. The entire staff, from the valet parking guys to the front desk and caf茅, was great! Very courteous at all times. Breakfast was wonderful! You get hot coffee and a buffet with a selection of wonderful fresh fruit. Do not pass up the papaya and pineapple. My husband who claimed to not like papaya had it every morning and loved every bite. They always had two types of scrambled eggs and bacon with a second choice of meat that changed every day we were there. Sometimes it was ham, corned beef hash, sausages and other choices. Other choices include pancakes, French toast, cereals, oatmeal, breads, pastries and an entire Japanese buffet. What else can you ask for honestly? We had my 7-year-old son with us and they absolutely do Not charge adult price for children. We paid $7 for our son. A small price to pay for a breakfast buffet. This is the only hotel that offers a free breakfast buffet. We never had a desire to start our day anywhere else. This hotel is located right across the street from several major hotels so the 鈥渘oise鈥?that others refer to would be heard whether you are staying at the Outrigger Reef, Sheraton or it鈥檚 sister hotel across the street. The delivery trucks did not bother me. If it truly bothers anyone then they must live in an incredibly isolated place. The hotel room is clean, not small in my opinion, beautiful and perfectly located. We stayed on the 15th floor, which is classified as an ocean view room. It was perfect! We could see over the hotels and had an incredible view of the ocean. The color of the water is absolutely amazing. The trade wind breeze is wonderful and sitting on our lanai in the evening was wonderful. You could cross the street and go down a short path to the beach walkway. Turn right and walk all the way to the Hilton鈥檚 Hawaiian Village there is a great beach there and it is a great walk. Or turn left and walk down Waikiki beach. Better yet, do both!Our best dinners were at the Ocean House restaurant at the Outrigger on the Reef (skip the Shore Bird). I personally was disappointed with the shorebird. They give the best tables to the bar patrons and cooking the small steaks they give you is the pits. Treat yourself and eat at eh Ocean house for a great dinner at sunset! It is right next door in the same hotel. Another great dinner was the seafood buffet at the Oceanarium Restaurant. They have a giant aquarium and the best seafood buffet. You can find a coupon in one of the magazines you find at the airport to give you 25% off the bill. Do NOT miss the Polynesian Cultural Center give yourself two days if you can. The ticket allows you to return up to 3 days after. It鈥檚 a blast! We loved it and my son participated in several shows. Hanuama Bay was wonderful. We were in the water for hours at a time. It was like being in a warm bath. Do not miss the Dole Plantation. They also have a great gift shop with reasonable prices. But for souvenirs the best prices are at the ABC Stores.Another must is the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet. It goes on forever. You can find everything here. We plan on returning next year and will be glad to stay at the Waikiki Parc again. The only other place on the island that I saw would want to stay at was at the Turtle Beach Resort on the North Shore. Oops, I almost forgot be sure to visit the shrimp trucks on the windward side. Eat at Romy鈥檚 shrimp hut. It is the best! Eat shave Ice at Aoki鈥檚 on the North shore. All the recommendations in the guidebook 鈥淥ahu Revealed鈥?are right on the money.

<Content>Great Experience but . . . Overall, our experience at this hotel was great. Waikiki wasn't our favorite segment of our Hawaii trip, but the Waikiki Parc was centrally located, clean and the service, with one notable exception, was excellent.Our package included breakfast, which was good, though not diverse enough to hold our interest after two days. The restaurant service was perfect -- very friendly and accomodating.The concierge and housekeeping staff also did an excellent job.The parking garage was connected to the hotel and was very convenient, but they do direct you to valet parking when you check in (the self park entrance is on the next street over from Lewers).We did have a bad check-in experience which colored the rest of our stay and reduces my rating from above average to neutral. When we drove in, we noticed construction sites across the street from the hotel. I asked the front desk clerk if we could get a room away from the construction. His response (delivered in an slightly obnoxious tone) was We don't sleep in the hotel, so I don't know which rooms face the construction. He could have simply said I'll see what I can do or even sorry, we're fully booked and I would have understood. A truly unnecessary service failure.

<Content>Great little hotel Almost everything written here about this hotel is accurate. If you're looking for a resort which provides everything you need, the Parc isn't it. But if you want a very clean, comfortable place to sleep and rest while you seek beaches and dinners elsewhere, the Parc is perfect.The rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. You can order goose down pillows as well as other little items at no charge from housekeeping (there's a list on a card in the bathroom). The staff, including the parking valets, is very attentive. They offer a hospitality room you can come back to for a shower if you have a late flight out, even if you have already checked out. The location is central, with shopping and dining in easy walking distance. The breakfast buffet is excellent, and we had no desire to look elsewhere to start the day. (Note that two years ago, when the restaurant was under renovation, the breakfast was not good. Now it's delicious.)We had an upper-floor room with an ocean view, away from the Sheraton loading dock. There was a bit of noise, but not intrusive. Remember, Waikiki is a busy area. The hotel guests tend to be quiet, and we had no problems with noise from other rooms.I would much rather spend the few bucks more to stay at the Parc than stay at a hotel that was either not clean or where the other guests were noisy.

<Content>Park yourself at the Parc! Good central location, easy walk to shops and beach. Had rooms with ocean view, small rooms but clean and well appointed. Beware the breakfast included in tariff it only applies to two per room. Others, including children, will have to pay for breakfast. We had two children who eat very little and they wanted a normal adult fee for breakfast for each of them. When we protested and threatened to leave, they agreed to allow the children to eat for free too. Unpleasant to say the least! The other staff were friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Hotel I recently stayed at the Waikiki Parc, it wasn't busy at the time so I received an upgraded room with full ocean views, the reception staff were extremely helpful with all questions, they drew a map so I could catch a bus to Pearl Harbour and save the high tour fee, they even booked me in to a Lu'au (which I would definately recommend at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel next door) the location is so close to the beach (a 2 minute walk) the nearby shopping is fabulous and theres plenty of choices for restaurants.I had a midnight flight so they made a room available until I had to leave for the airport at no extra chargeThe rooms are large and comfortable and also very quiet, no traffic noise.Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic! A real find. The many positive reviews about the Parc are right on. The Parc is very affordable, perfectly located (about 30 steps from the beach), the rooms are everything you need and very comfortable, the bathrooom was spacious and well-maintained, the buffet breakfast was the perfect way to start the day, and the staff was very friendly and informative. The only small disappointment was the pool, which was smallish, tucked away on the side of the building on the 8th (?) floor, and in the shade in the afternoon. But no worries--just hit the beach. The next time I'm in Waikiki, I'll definitely stay at the Parc again.

<Content>Nice Place to Stay My husband and I spent almost 2 weeks at the Parc Hotel while attending a convention being held at the neighboring Shearton hotel.  Overall we really enjoyed our time there. The free breakfast that was part of our package was very nice and helped on our food budget as we normally skipped lunch and had a early dinner.I was especially excited about the feather pillows available upon request. For me its the small things that make my day. We opted for the deluxe ocean view. We were on the 21st floor and I can honestly say that I heard no truck noise at night like I've read about in other reviews. The construction on Lewers in kind of annoying when trying to get around in a car, but really the noise wasn't unbearable. That and we didn't spend alot of time near the hotel during the day anyway.  The rooms were nicely decorated but nothing special. The lobby is nice and quiet. Its not one of those hotels with lots of shops. It just has the one restaurant where the breakfast is. The staff were all very nice and helpful and there were good enough to give us a late check out since our plane didn't leave until 4pm. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families but it was wonderful for the two of us.

<Content>A wonderful hotel tucked away in Waikiki Staying at the Waikiki Parc has a number of distinct advantages. First, it is nicely situated, being just off of Kalakaua Avenue (a major access road through Waikiki) and a home run's distance from Waikiki Beach (i.e., 350 feet). Access to local transit services, be it taxies or The Bus, is straightforward and much of the Waikiki and the neighboring Ala Moana attractions are within a manageable walking distance. While there is ongoing construction off of Lewers street nearby (part of the recently commenced Waikiki Beach Walk project), the inconvience in terms of street access and noise is quite negligable. My room was on the 20th floor facing Mauka (the mountain side), but I found nothing to be disturbed about. The hotel is encased on the Diamond Head (i.e., east) side by the Sheraton Waikiki, on the Ewa (i.e., west) side by a condo highrise, and on the Makai (i.e., ocean) side by the wonderful Halekulani. Ask for a room on one of the higher floors facing Makai or Mauka for best views; the few rooms facing east or west provide little privacy. Second, the hotel offers its guests a number of nice perks. The room furnishings are more than adequate and quite comfortable despite not appearing all that new, and the service personnel are outstanding in their reliability and empathy. The complimentary breakfast buffet at the Parc Cafe appears to be a major draw for the people in the hotel and from the co-owned Halekulani who consistently trickled in for an excellent selection of cold/hot items that provides a nourishing and fulfilling start to their day. Third, it is clear that the hotel management and its staff are concerned about their guests' experience. For example, I was pleasantly surprised to check in to my room and find a nicely wrapped box of macadamia nut chocolates with a personalized welcome note by the hotel's manager. Further, a colleague of mine arrived and was told that her reservation could not be honored because the hotel was overbooked; she was promptly given a room over at the neighboring Halekulani (at the Waikiki Parc rate). Compared with the more recognized and behemoth-like hotels nearby, the affordability and suitability of the rooms along with management's and staff's attention to service details makes the Waikiki Parc an outstanding value tucked away in Waikiki.

<Content>Excellent Location for the Price. Excellent location for the price. I got it from Hotwire for $84, when I needed a room last minute for 1 day. Just across the street from the park, zoo and beach. This is my preferred end of Waikiki. Be sure to explore this end and the park and Diamond head. Most rooms have nice views and lanais. Clean, nice atmosphere. Free paper. My fave burger, Teddys just next door. A number of other more 'local' eateries further up Kapahulu for those who wander outside of Waikiki.Only problem I had was I was unable to check in early and my room was tiny. And if you rent a moped in Waikiki, be careful! During the time I was waiting in the lobby for my room I witnessed TWO moped accidents on Kapahulu. One required an ambulance.

<Content>a great find We have now been to Hawaii three times and have stayed in three different hotels. Waikiki Parc hotel has definitely been our favorite one. The location is great, as are the rooms and service. We rented two ocean view rooms that were spectacular. Waikiki Parc is great for tennagers. My husband and I took both our teenage sons, who we didnt see until the end of the day each day we were there. They would go off by themselves and take surfing lessons, go snorkeling, etc... there is so much offered right there at your finger tips. My favorite part of the hotel was the sushi bar. The sushi is freshly made with local fish and is so delcious. I would highly redommend satying at this hotel. (expecially with children)

<Content>This hotel sports the Ohana (family) treatment We have stayed at this hotel twice. All of the staff is extremely friendly, wonderful and caring. We never wanted for anything during our stays. I was born and raised on Oahu and I can tell you, that everyone at this hotel treats you like family -- as we say in Hawaii Ohana or extended family. I have stayed at the Outrigger Reef many times and I love that hotel, but the family feeling is not there and to me when you visit Hawaii, you need to have that feeling. And, the Parc is less expensive.The only thing I wish they would have is a jacuzzi. Other than that, the location is great. people say it is noisy -- but what would you expect when you are in the middle of 3-4 hotels on one street --- garbage has to be picked up. If you choose to sleep in in Hawaii --- don't go! You need to experience every moment you can. time flies in Hawaii --- As for the complaints about the beach -- please --- that beach is pretty long and nice most of the way -- just walk a little and you will find lots of sand and warm water. I grew up on that beach and I know it like the back of my hand. The Parc is a wonderful hotel with many ammenities and if you choose to have a room that has the breakfast as part of the deal - you won't need 3 meals a day! THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL! I always say it's the water. We will be back in September 2005 - our third trip to the PARC.AlohaKaren

<Content>Parc in Paradise Recently, my friend and I went to Honolulu. I'd always wanted to go there, but I've always been on a budget. This being one of those occasions, I went to the Waikiki Parc Hotel, which I heard was very good quality but not big on price. I couldn't have made a better decision and I would go back there even if there was no budget at all! The rooms were simple, yet elegant. Very spacious, giving us room to sit around and enjoy the great view of Diamond Head. The hotel concierge helped us to schedule a few surfing and scuba lessons and the pool was great. Talk about relaxation! I have never been on a vacation that was as peaceful yet fun-filled as this one. I look forward to returning in November, my next Hawaii adventure!

<Content>Warning! Warning! Major Construction! This hotel was a disappointment! I arrived On July 5th and was horrified by the location and the noise. There is serious construction going on right outside its doors. They are tarring down many buildings right next door to this hotel and it is extremely noisy. We were on one of the highest floor in an Deluxe Ocean View room and we could hear every little bang. Then we asked to be moved to a quieter side of the hotel (which was on the opposite side of the construction) but we could still hear everything. The noise was just too loud to get away from. The buildings that were being tarred down caused a lot of dust in the air around the hotel. There also was a strong odor caused as well. Sadly with all the dark tarred down buildings right next to the hotel, a lot of the bad crowds were being attracted to this area. (drug dealers, homeless, prostitutes) Now, you will see prostitutes and homeless all over Waikiki, but there were greater and more scarier amounts at this location. Also, it is very hard to get around this location because of all the roads being closed for construction. Which was such a hassle. Two things that were bad about this hotel that were not the because of construction was the Sheraton blocking a good amount of the Waikiki views. All of the Ocean Views at the Waikiki Parc did see a large about of the ocean but also had the dirty views of the Sheratons rooms as well. These room that were visible did not appear to be as well taken care of as the other rooms on the front side of the hotel. (which were very beautiful). Second was the dirty ally ways you had use to get to the ocean. These ally ways were very scary, especially at night. They are very dark and have many corners ( not the safest place). Also the beach that is closest to the Waikiki Parc was not the nicest part of the beach. This part of the beach was very small and rocky. There was not a lot of space to lay and the only real place to lay was a man-made sand square which was made by the Halekulani. In order to be able to swim and lay on the beach you had to walk a little ways to the Royal Hawaiian. But don鈥檛 get me wrong this hotel was not all that bad. The service was terrific. The staff was extremely nice and very accommodating. The Ocean views were okay except for the Sheratons rooms. Maybe if I were to revisit this hotel after all the construction was done I might of had a better time. BY the way I had to leave this hotel the next morning because my family and I were unable to stand the construction and location, it was just destroyed our vacation. We ended up staying at the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach for the rest of our stay until the 13th, that hotel was a Waikiki dream come true!

<Content>Loved the Parc Stayed at the Waikiki Parc from 5/26-5/30 (Memorial Day Weekend). I was a little worried that it wouldn't be a great experience. Well, this hotel did everything right. Everybody gives you the best service you've had, from the front desk, to housekeeping, to valet parking, to the waiters. I was prepared to ask for an upgrade, we had booked a deluxe mountain view room w/breakfast, and before I could open my mouth, I was automatically upgraded to an oceanview room. This was wonderful and we got to see and hear the Halekulani's evening show every night for free. The room was nice, clean and big enough for 2 adults and 1 child. The pool on the 8th floor was nice although not deep. The beach was a hop across an alleyway which was really nice to be so close to the beach. Main drag of Kalekahua Street is right there and your in the heart of Waikiki with everything within walking distance if you choose not to rent a car.The valet parking was free with in and out privileges, this was really handy so that we could go out, come back and lay around the pool, relax and then go back out to see more stuff. The stay included breakfast which was great as we didn't have to worry about eating for a long time. We did have to pay for my daughter though as the breakfast only includes adults.Concierge hooked us up to a cheap rental car, advised on tours, told us little things to do (like go to the Aloha Bowl Stadium for the Swap Meet after going to Pearl Harbor which you've got to get to early like 7am). Make sure not to miss snorekling at Hanauma Bay, Kailua is a beautiful beach, the show at the Polynesian Cultural Center, high tea at the Kahala Oriental Hotel (you can also do the dolphin program there where you can play with dolphins), Pearl Harbor, and Diamond Head.The hotel sent us to the airport in their own limousine. I wish I knew that I would have called to see if the limo could pick us up. Anyway, the hotel service was phenomenal and the hotel itself was very, very nice so I would most definitely stay here again and again.

<Content>a real find!! I am a travel agent from Australia and recently had my Honeymoon at the Waikiki Parc Hotel. We stayed there for 7 nights and found it to be quite a find! The location is perfect walking distance to everywhere and is a 30 second walk to the sand!! The staff were extremely friendly and addressed us by name before we checked in!!! They booked our retaurant reservations, car hire as well as day tours. I must recommend to anyone staying there to upgrade to a deluxe oceanview!! It's true people say you don't spend all your time in the room, however, waking up to the view of the Pacific Ocean was heaven!! We had regular vinos on the balcony and for the price for such a lovely room, it just doesn't compare to anywhere else in Oahu (as i said, I'm a travel agent so believe me i know!!)!! Waikiki Parc Hotel is definately a well kept secret!!

<Content>Sound Proofing Required Generally the hotel was great : friendly and helpful staff; well appointed well serviced room though no gowns or slippers; great location for shops and public beach; superb buffet breakfast. However, there was one major problem. The ocean view rooms also overlook the loading bay of the Sheraton. These are in constant use and the noise is dreadful, especially vehicle reversing sirens which sounded throughout the night. Surely the priority of any hotel is to ensure that it's jet lagged patrons get a good nights sleep ? On the plus side, they efficiently arranged a trip to Hanauma Bay which was great - go there and snorkel with turtles ! I still think the hotel was good value for money.

<Content>Best Value in Waikiki Stayed here five nights Dec 14-19, 2004 after ten nights at the Halekulani across the street. It is true that the hotel is situated on two busy alleyway/delivery lanes, and the noise from trucks servicing the nearby Sheraton Waikiki can be annoying-especially on lower floors and when your balcony door is open), and, yes, you do see other rooftops, but this is a truly good place. I found Julie at the front desk to be exceptionally gracious, and the concierge was every bit as accommodating as at the Halekulani (and that IS saying something). Even though it was a busy time (Honolulu Marathon and pre-Christmas week rush), they extended us one night when we needed it...didn't even make us change rooms in spite of being booked full. The food at their restaurant Waikiki Parc Cafe is really good (we have been eating at their buffet for years before we actually stayed here)...their breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets are well-priced and bountiful. I especially like their Hawaiian-themed lunch days. When you book one of their packages, you can't beat the value. There seem to be lots of discounted rates, so don't pay rack. Our room was OceanView Deluxe, and it was large enough to have a king bed and a love seat/chair/table in the corner (L-shape sitting area). For this view, and the immaculate housekeeping throughout the hotel, plus the truly excellent service, you cannot go wrong. I wanted to go on a very popular North Shore Nature Tour...the concierge made a quick phone call, handed me a chit, and I was on my way...the charge on the room. Ditto for a catamaran ride I decided to take on the spur of the moment. The valets and doormen were really great...we were waiting outside for our tour van and they insisted we go into the lobby because of the bus and delivery truck fumes outside...they came in to get us when our ride arrived. I found the lobby to be very nice...not overly large, but it had a lovely Christmas Tree and comfortable sofas/chairs. The inside of this hotel is very quiet, refined, and much more elegant than similarly-priced hotels in Waikiki. The elevators were very quick. I liked the convenience of a guest laundry on the 8th floor, with a nice adjacent outdoor lounge area to wait in, if you chose to stay while your clothes dried (believe me, you don't want to use public laundromats in Waikiki if you can avoid it). I cannot think of one single bad thing to say about the hotel or its staff. The night watchman told me that most of the staff have been there for years...because the morale is very high. I think it shows in their treatment of guests. At least, it did in our case.

<Content>This Hotel does not need to advertise! One of the best kept secrets in Waikiki, This Hotel is for you IF you consider yourself a discerning travler who expects the tops in service, location, value and still likes a quiet room where you are not disturbed by party goers. The lack of a bar is to me a plus in this respect. They offer two resturants, upscale property, (sister Hotel to the famed Halikalani Hotle across the street), have a pool, parking, is located in the center of all the active area of Waikiki and the staff is so helpfull and polite that its almost unamerican ; ). You will never hear any bickering amoung the staff, nor any complaints from any of the guests. The rooms are bright, well appointed, quiet, and comfortable. The bath is quite adequate, and the room we are usually in has items such as two phones, internet connection, refrigerator, safe, ironing board and iron, excelent television, and in room coffee maker, clock and CD player combination. The room is immaculately clean, there are NO out of order signs! Any need you have will be met not only quickly but quite adequately. This is not a Hotel who will tolerate loud party going crowds, who are obnoxious to other guests. There are three elevators which service twenty three floors, so one is always at your service. Of course, the rooms with ocen view are not large and you should not expect large rooms on prime real estate, with ocean views unless you would like to book at the Sister Hotel where you can get a suite of 2,000 sq. but be prepared to pay a few thousand dollars a night for the room. So be reasonable in your expectation and this hotel will deliver a vacation you will pleasantly enjoy, will look after your every need and you will come home with a few dollars left in your pocket. I can not recommend this hotel too hightly, even for the most discerning travler.

<Content>great hotel! The Waikiki Parc is truly a great calm hotel with clean, well-equipped rooms and fantastic service! For what you pay, you get a better value than at the Halekulani (which is a great hotel as well). Having stayed at both hotels, next time I would get an oceanview room ( you don't want to get a parc view room facing the city/parking garage) at the Waikiki Parc and use the saved money for the many activities available in Waikiki instead.

<Content>Waikiki Parc hotel We loved this hotel the staff we friendly and helpful. The rooms are very well kept and clean. I,m picky when it comes to staying in a hotel I want it as clean as I keep my house and this hotel is.  Just a few steps away is the beach and the hotel gives you beach towels and mats for your day at the beach No charge. You are in the right spot for all the shopping and neat little stores all this can be done by walking.  We are planning another trip with both of our Mothers in two years and we will be staying here again.

<Content>highly recommend I'm extremely picky with my hotels and we stayed at the Waikiki Parc in March 2005 and loved the hotel. The lobby and rooms were very clean and well appointed. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating and the elevator worked great - and I'm very picky with my elevators as well. We selected the hotel after reading mostly positive trip advisor reviews. I was a little concerned after reading a couple of negative reviews but I completely disagree with those reviews and chalk it up to you can't please everyone. The parc is a quiet hotel amidst the bussle of Waikiki, a block from the beach and the other busier hotels. It is a very convenient location. If you're looking for a busy hotel with lots of shops and activities then this is not the hotel for you. Stay at the outrigger or one of those other monster hotels. If you're looking for a friendly, quieter, smaller hotel (no hotel is going to be too quiet in waikiki) with an understated elegance, good value, and fine accomodations, than I would recommend this hotel. If you're looking for a very plush, fancy hotel with lots of activity and people around then look elsewhere.

<Content>as good as they say I almost didn't write this review as I want to go back here and not have it overrun and overbooked! Having said that the hotel was very full when we stayed and the staff were great. I think the Halekulani association is a factor here. The buffet is good ( but treat yourself to the Halekulani Sunday brunch, its worth it ) , rooms are absolutley fine and the location is good. A bit of noise from the garbage trucks but easy beach access and for the price, you cannot complain. Save the money on your room and use it at the fabulous Waikele outlets - it is worth the trip. The bargains were awesome. Recommended.

<Content>Yay for Waikiki Parc! Loved this hotel. Staff was so friendly, room was awesome, view was incredible, service was great. I will definitely be returning to this hotel. Little tip: if you get a room facing the ocean, not only do you get an incredible view, but you also get to take advantage of the live music being played at the Halekulani every night at sunset. We'd go on our lanai every evening for this! (I'm assuming they do this year-round, but you may want to check if this is important to you.)

<Content>Awesome honeymoon hotel Stayed here in early September 2004 for our honeymoon.The room was small, but very well kept and clean. We had a deluxe oceanfront room, which was well worth the money. It was fun watching the nightly entertainment at the Halekulani from our balcony, and the sunsets were spectacular.The hotel staff were awesome at meeting our needs and wants. And the proximity to the beach (through a walkway) was exceptional. The hotel caters to Japanese tastes, which means it was quiet with a private air to it. We felt really away from the world, which is awesome in wild Waikiki.Our package included a car (we upgraded at the rental place to a convertible for a song) and breakfast. I can't understate how awesome the breakfast was. It was easily the best eating we had in Hawaii. The selection was excellent, and the staff was super courteous. We could load up in the morning and stay content through dinner. Food was spectacular.We'd definately stay here again.

<Content>Okay, but much better available elsewhere!!!!!! I stayed at the Waikiki Parc hotel for 5 nights. I chose this hotel based on the price and comments that seemed consistently positive. I thought the hotel was not worth the money. When we booked we were supposed to get breakfast with our room, but when we got there they said we didn't qualify. Parking wasn't a nominal fee like stated on their website. The service was fine, they were helpful when we booked extra services or had questions. Our room was very tiny, the pool was disappointingly small and not even fully opened most of the time we were there. The elevator was a pain to use, it didn't always go where we wanted to go, even when the appropriate button was pushed and our cards didn't always work in it.Overall, okay hotel. A little overpriced, but still more affordable than beachfront hotels. Nice location, but next time I'll spring for a better quality hotel.

<Content>I think "deluxe" is a little bit much BUT... ..it was nonetheless a very nice place, especially considering that rooms this close to the beach and in this ideal location usually go for considerably more. This was definitely the up side of the Parc. It is also very clean and the rooms were more than adequate but not by any means 'deluxe'. We had an ocean view (not the deluxe ocean view) and it was a gorgeous view which I imagine would've cost much more in a true deluxe hotel. The downside is not many amenities, but you are basically across the street from some of the VERY best resorts like the Royal Hawaiian, Halekulani and the Sheraton whose amenities you can use (pool, spa, restaurtants, etc. ) I'd definitely stay there again but not for a special occasion (anniversary, wedding, etc.) where I'd want more amenities.

<Content>Great resort area hotle for the price! 1. This hotel is not on the beach. The prices reflect this. If you want to be on the beach or have a large balcony or a resort style pool, do not stay here.2. Breakfast (included in room price) is excellent! Go early. lines start right after 8 a.m.3. Safe secure immaculately clean hotel with small rooms. Coin Laundry on 8th floor.4. If you want more space, ask for 8th floor mountain view rooms; they are the only rooms in the hotel with lanai. The lanai is huge, but no real view (parking garage). Great spot to have a drink with your friends though before dinner.5. Public access to beach right across the street.

<Content>Absolute Disaster Had made phone reservations for 5 nights beginning 1/17/05. Personally asked for something special as we were celebrating 40th anniversary. We were promised and sent confirmation for a deluxe room with ocean view. Upon arrival Julie advised us that they had overbooked and the only room available was a mt. view room at $249/night and they would move us the next day to the deluxe ocean view room at $339. We advised her that we had already reserved for 5 nights at $235. She said she would have to check into the rate discrepency and then tried to make us feel grateful for a mt. view room which, even though on the 19th floor, was noisy from service and garbage trucks below and overlooked the roof of a parking garage (got this beauty at $194!). Rooms are very small, balconies are not useable (will not accomodate even a chair), rooftop pool is very small and virtually useless. The shower curtain in our room had a strange odor that the staff had tried to camoflage with some type of cleaner. The lobby is nondescript, the rooms are staid and dated. Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. I spent hours researching hotels for our anniversary and relied heavily on comments from this web site to make my decision. I would have been much better off going back to other hotels we have stayed at in Honolulu. The attitude of Julie about the overbooking was unforgiveable and her audacity in suggesting that we should be paying a higher rate than we booked for was inexcusable. I would guess we lost our original booked room to a tour group.

<Content>Wonderful experience We spent a week at this hotel, departing Dec 24, 2004. We found the concierge and front desk staff to be extremely helpful and pleasant. Our room was sufficient for us and our teenage son. The housekeeping staff was equally efficient. Our waiter (Alex) for breakfast was professional and helpful. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and liked the proximity to the Halekulani and its restaurants and beach across the street. We visited Honolulu at one of the busiest times yet never felt rushed or crowded. All the facilities were properly functioning and even the laundry area was spotless. The view of the ocean between the Halekulani and the Sheraton was beautiful from the 14th floor. We would highly recommend this property for anyone choosing to stay in the city. Within a few minutes walk are shops, beaches, parks, many restaurants and bus stops. Everyone at the Waikiki Parc was great!

<Content>Not worth the money This leg of our trip (over New Years) was a total disappointment. The hotel looks out at other hotels, especially the roofs and exhaust fans. The balconies are small and claustrophobic. The elevator has a mind of its own - whether it will open when you call it or whether it stops at your floor even though the button is lit up ... you take your life in your hands! The pool is on the top of a parking garage and wasn't open for 2 of the 5 days we were there. We had tried to change our dates to stay and they were not helpful at all in accommodating that request. Our room had 2 double beds in them that were barely big enough for one person let alone two so my partner and I ended up sleeping in separate beds (how romantic). The restaurant was only open for breakfast until 10 am. If you arrived at 9:55, you were out of luck as they were tearing it down. Same for lunch... be there before 2, or again, you're out of luck. Cashing travellers cheques was another nightmare. They will only cash $200 at a time. Like, come on, that's not even the cost of a dinner!!! It was an extremely disappointing visit and we will not be back.

<Content>The Parc Rocks ! Just to add my two cents in and agree with the last review. I spend many, many nights a year travelling for work and have stayed in many deluxe hotels that are deluxe in name only. Just returned from Hawaii - which included a three night stay at the Parc. The phrase understated elegance seems to fit the best. Its not knock you off your feet like the Four Seasons, but the exceptional service, immaculate and unique rooms will keep me coming back. If being a stone's throw from the beach bothers you, move to a beachfront hotel and pay double. Its rare that you find a hotel that does it all right. This one does.

<Content>Soneone Knows How to Run a Hotel! Everything you want - nothing you don't want! VERY service oriented Hotel. Immaculate. Parking, resturant, Great room rates and great service. I travel a lot and use the same hotels all the time. This will be MY HOTEL in Waikiki! I am sometimes considered difficult to please :( But at this hotel the only thing one can complain about is that the towels are too thick to fit in your luggage ;) It's location could not be better, while technically not on the beach, well, you can still spit in the ocean! Everything is nearby. Exactly at the heart of Waikiki and owned by the same owners as the famed Halekalani, just across the street. So, try this hotel but not in Jan-Feb because I want to be sure that they have a room vacant for me and that's when I like to go to the Parc!

<Content>location, location, location .... The Parc has one thing going for it ........ location. Maybe it is not ON the beach, but it could not get much closer. Be careful of rooms on delivery side of hotel ...... noisey. Rooms are small but staff was great. Concierge helpful every day. Breakfast in hotel overpriced, but we were full to start each day. We would stay here again (this is third vist to this island).

<Content>Convenient location! Every one was SO nice here it really made our stay a good one BUT, the constant noise of the delivery trucks ALL night was a pain. Those trucks never quit! Breakfast buffet here was tops and Lori, one of the waitresses was really great. The location of the Parc was great. Right in the middle of all the action.

<Content>fabulous, quaint, friendly staff stayed 4 nites, nov 15-19, got best price ( $ 190 with all taxes ) thru costco.com travel, car, free parking, excellent buffet breakfast with macadamia pancakes, or french toast, papaya, pineapple, and other fresh fruits, excellent service in hotel/restaurant. wifi in lobby area, but installing hi speed now. enjoyed hawaiian singers at halekulani hotel across the street ( rooms there are double+, but on the beach ) @ 5 - 8 pm, sunset is at 6, and amazing. get an ocean view room, they'll upgrade you to high floor, ours was 20th. pool is heated and on 8th floor. we will definitely go back!

<Content>Great Hotel  Excellent hotel for the price! The Waikiki Parc is the sister hotel of the world renown Halekulani which is across the street. The hotel staff was very friendly, knowledgeble and provided excellent customer service. The room, amenities and pool were great. Awesome location close to the beach. Our only problem was HVAC related which was reported to management. I would definitely stay at the Parc again when in Waikiki. Aloha!

<Content>Even Better than Expected! I extensively read and researched hotels on Waikiki, finding Tripadvisor to be the best site going. The reviews make is so much easier to decide. That's what tipped it for us, especially one review that said, Shhh, don't tell anyone about the Parc, let's keep it a secret. The other thing that tipped it for us was breakfast included, the parking included and getting the car package through them, which was upgraded to mid size for free also. I got great service going directly through their reservations desk. What AAA and Pleasant Holidays (they said certain rooms weren't available but they were when you checked through the hotel itself) couldn't get for me in a package I got through them directly and with great charm and helpfulness. We were there 11/5-10, before going over to Kauai. The room was probably smaller than some of the other hotels but still had more room than our 3 star hotel room in London last winter (with a really bad continental breakfast). Having the small sitting area made up for a lot. The fridge was great to have for all the water we kept on hand. The bathroom was a little tight but had lots of counter space and a large ledge around a very wide tub. It poured while we were there the first two days, and the valet/porters even got umbrellas for us. They even supplied us with beach towels and bath mats. The directions that were preprinted out for the major sites were great! (except for those get into the second right hand lanes...the way the streets are laid out one block you have two right hand lanes and the next suddenly they add a right turn lane...just be prepared to move fast) Directions on how to get there and how to get back also, made the difference getting around the one way streets. Just too bad the sites and parks are so poorly marked...typical in Hawaii though. The concierge made our reservations for several venues and this such a help. She answered our questions about all of the things we were interested in and gave us some great tips. But she was only there M-F.The room was always spotless when we got back in and everything restocked. The front desk was attentive. The porters and valet drivers were great sources for local info. The side you pull into for valet parking is just across from the bus station of the Sheraton, and is very handy for getting on buses for tours and trolleys out to the shopping areas. Then just straight through there is the Royal Hawaiin Shopping Center. Who needs shops in your hotel with wonderful stores just a block away. We would pass through the bus station, cross the street, go along the back side of the shopping center along the walkways in front of the Royal Hawaiin, which had beautiful gardens and tiki torches lighting your way. Going out the door on the other side of the hotel took you right across the street to a path between the Sheraton and the Halekulani straight to the beach, or down the street to restaurants and shops. It was like a little haven tucked in there, just a half block or block and you were right in the action.We were on the 20th floor and the view was great. We expected a sliver of a view between two high rises, but we could see right over the Halekani, and had a view of their gorgeous pool and could hear their Hawaiin band all the way up there in the evenings. Yes we heard some trucks in the morning delivering to the Sheraton, but better than staying at a high end luxury place and hearing the same thing. Waikiki is not quiet, period. The Sheraton blocked more view to the left, but it was still so much better than expected. We got great pics of catamarans taking off from the beach, surfers and the dive boats off shore from our small balcony.Breakfast was very good. A few things changed daily, but there was enough variety to make it just fine...if you are eating everything they had I suppose it would get boring, but just rotate what you eat every day. The pineapple spears and fresh papya was amazing and we fell in love with guava nectar and POG, passion orange guava juice! (I've already located some here at home) One particular waiter, Alex, was unbelievable, he anticipated our every need and really spoiled us. We were sad when he had a couple of days off. We did have big enough breakfasts that we would go until dinner or have a small snack. They accomodate the asian traveller very well also, haveing a huge pot of steamed rice for them daily. I found it interesting that it was the asians who were the ones who ate the green salad every morning.We had some torrential rains, that cleared up, but left the streets flooded, then one day the whole island was in a haze. The volcano on the Big island had erupted ash, and caused the haze. We are from Washington state and I guess you could say it felt like home, with the rain and being just a couple hours from Mt. St. Helen's...but it was still warm and wonderful, even in the rain.Eat at some of the restaurants along the beach. We ate at Chuck's Steak House at the Outrigger Waikiki, on the veranda. DH is a very picky eater or we would have gone to Dukes or the Hula Grill there, also highly recommended. We even ate at Duke's Barefoot Bar and Grill (on their patio) one night and you can't get any closer to the beach than this, with great casual dining, great food and a lot of fun! Walk the main street of Waikiki at night, you can step out onto the beach and walk in the sand for a ways and then back on to the sidewalk along tiki lit streets. I highly recommend the guidebook The Ultimate Oahu Guide (on the Kauai one). Excellent book with great full color photso by a couple who have lived on the islands and really researched each and every place they review. Those books and tripadvisor really helped make our trip great.

<Content>Great value! My parents and I stayed at the Parc 10/10-14 and are very happy with our choice. The location; free valet parking; a great complimentary breakfast buffet, and hotel service were outstanding. A great value. The small criticisms are small rooms and try to get a high floor because if you're a light sleeper and ocean side you can hear some noises from trucks pulling into the adjoining hotel early in the morning, but nothing that tissue in the ears couldn't solve. An example of the excellent customer service was that the coin operated washer was working but the dryer was being repaired, so I called the front desk and they said no problem when your done washing your clothes bring them down to the front desk and we will dry and fold them and deliver them to your room for no charge within 2 hours. I highly recommend going across the street to the Halekulani Hotel outdoor bar for sunset - SUBLIME! Tip - Some people were waiting outside for their cars to be brought to them by the valet, but a call to the front desk from your room when your getting ready to leave and ask them to have the car ready and the car will be waiting for you when you get outside.

<Content>The best boutique hotel in Waikiki !! I had previewed this hotel when I was a travel agent and recently had the pleasure of staying. It is the greatest hotel in Waikiki! It is a quiet haven amidst everything! Close to Waikiki Beach, close to shopping and restaurants. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>A Quiet Sanctuary Away from the Noise of Waikiki I did extensive research before I booked the Waikiki Parc Hotel and I'm glad I did because it was worth it. TRIPADVISOR.COM is the best travel site for advice. Thank you!My girlfriend and I (both mid-30s) spent our first vacation to Oahu (and Hawaii) at the Waikiki Parc for 6 nights from August 18 through August 24, 2004. I was concerned about the noise from the streets and 8th floor pool area so I asked for a higher floor. We got a NON-SMOKING deluxe ocean view room on the 19th Floor with the Parc Sunrise Package that comes with the Free Dollar Rental Car (A compact Dodge Neon) and Free Parking. We had a WONDERFUL stay at the Waikiki Parc! Let me break it down for you:FRONT DESK STAFF: Everyone at the front desk (I can't remember all the names, sorry) was incredibly helpful and so thoughtful. Every time I needed directions to get to Pearl Harbor, the North Shore, a restaurant, etc. a front desk employee or the concirege gladly handed it to me with a big smile. They were ALWAYS friendly and cooperative for 6 days straight. I can't say enough good things about the front desk staff. Other hotels I've visited have a hard time being nice for 1 night! The Parc wrote the book on treating guests well.ROOM: The Non-Smoking Deluxe Ocean View Room is worth the $220 per night. It's a lot quieter than the 8th floor or below. You can also see a pretty decent view of the ocean. The problem with the lower level ocean views are that the Sheraton really blocks your view.Yes, the room is kind of small. I'm from Chicago and the rooms here are a lot larger. The thing is that most hotel rooms for this price range are this small or just a little bigger so we were fine with it.Yes, the balcony is smaller than at most hotels, but it's fine. There are two chairs and a little table for drinks. What else do you need? The floor to ceiling shutters are excellent and really block out all of the sun when you want to rest from a long day of Hawaiin adventures.The bathroom is nice with a good tub and plenty of shampoos and lotions. They have a tabletop card that tells you that you can call down to the front desk to get some extra items if you need such as down pillows or an toothpaste. We asked for some down pillows and they brought them right up. I recommend you tip the person who brings them up, the service was worth it.Each room has an electronic safe which is about $3.75 a day and worth it. The closet also has an iron and ironing board and the room has a handy, small fridge which we used everday. The tv is a relatively new 25 color tv.The decor is very simple and plain. I didn't care for the tile and thought the inlaid carpeting wasn't very comfortable or cushy. There's a a love seat and chair and a small desk, too. All in all, not the tiny, tiny room many people have complained about. I'd call it a 3-star room with some 31/2 star amenities and 4-star service.NOISE: Folks, keep in mind that Waikiki is a very crowded, very noisy, city atmosphere. So if you're looking for a whisper-quiet island getaway, go to a quieter Hawaiian isle....this isn't it! However, if you must stay in Waikiki, this is the quietest hotel (15th floor and up) that you can find for the money!CAR AND PARKING: They're included in one of the packages. Please use this package! It's well worth it. My many relatives were so jealous that I booked such a great deal at the Parc. They paid just a little less money and stayed at the larger, older, dirtier, and much more crowded Sheraton Princess Kaiulani (NOT recommended). This is the only hotel in Waikiki that gives you free parking iwth a package! Parking is normally $13 a day at the other hotels. If you want to explore the island, having a car is so convenient. Please keep in mind that if you want to explore the 6 blocks around the hotel in Waikiki, you better walk because traffic is horrible! And parking is just not available is Waikiki. Just use the car to go to Pearl Harbor, far away restaurants, the North Shore, Diamond Head, etc. You'll be glad you did. However, gas prices were about 30 cents more than where I'm from (Chicago) so get the smallest car you can (a compact).FOOD: The Parc Sunrise Cafe was where our included American Breakfast Buffet was served every morning. They normally charge $14.95 for this which I think is a bit overpriced, but everything is a bit over priced in Hawaii.The food is pretty good. They have a decent variety, but it's true that about 80% of the food is the same everyday. The Portugese sausage was incredibly good! The wait staff was decent with the exception of occasional slowdowns in getting our water or coffee. Overall, the breakfast is good enough and cheap enough to get the included breakfast package. By the way, This is the only hotel in Waikiki that has an included breakfast!BEACH ACCESS: A smaller, less crowded part of Waikiki Beach is across a small street next to the Parc's top-of-the-line sister hotel, The Halekulani. We had a Couples Spa package there.....wow, it was expensive, but absolutely terrific. What a beautiful place to visit.TYPE OF HOTEL: This is a small boutique hotel tucked away on a tiny street that you may pass trying to find it (we did) placed into an overcrowded, very noisy touristy city. If you want a semi-quiet resting place with a 3-star room and 4-star service and 4-star value, this is it! I can't imagine families would love it because there's really nothing for the kids to do here. This is the perfect hotel for couples or business travelers who just want a quiet place to stay in this noisy crowded area. Folks, this is a quiet boutique hotel. You should think about what kind of hotel you want for this price:1) A huge, crowded hotel on a major street that is brimming with people, restaurants, gift shops, bars, etc. OR2) A quiet, boutique hotel with unsurpassed service and very few on-site ammenities. There's no bar at the Parc. Stay at the Parc if you fully intend to walk a few blocks or use your rental car to explore restaurants, shops and bars outside the hotel. If you're looking for a shopping mall-like, all-in-one hotel, then go somewhere else.RATINGS:Room = 3 stars (3-1/2 stars for the ammenities)Staff = 4 starsParc Sunrise Breakfast Buffet = 3 starsValue = 4 starsI'd stay there again in a minute!OAHU RECOMMENDATIONS: BEST NICER RESTAURANT: Roy's (Impressive service with delicious food).BEST PLACE FOR LITTLE THINGS AND SOUVENIRS: ABC Shops (They're literally on every block. I recommend you go to the larger ones and buy your family and friends a box of chocolate-covered Macadamia nuts. They're only $2 per box. ABC also has food and shampoo, etc. at a reasonable for Hawaii cost.) BEST LUAU: I've heard that the Paradise Cove is large and has great activities, but too many people complain about the lousy food. For the BEST luau food and Mai Tais, but so-so entertainment, we went to the Royal Hawaiin Luau. It's only on Mondays and it's expensive without a coupon so get a coupon.DEALS: I strongly recommend you do some research online before you go to get some money-saving coupons plus don't book all of your sightseeing before you get there because there are so many coupon books at the airport and also tour discounters on the island. If you're paying full price for any tour, you're just not trying hard enough. WORST TOURIST TRAP: Dole Plantation (This place is awful. The maze is a waste of time if you're over 10 years old. The gift shop staff is so rude! Get your pineapple and get out because this whole place is a touristy,, lousy waste time.)SNORKELLING: Hanauma Bay is good and bad. It's $5 to get in and it's a park. The view walking down to it is spectacular. The only disadvantage is that the coral is everywhere! It's even in 4 feet of water. We got cut up pretty good trying to snorkel there. They have snorkelling equipment if you want to rent it, just make sure you're a good swimmer to get past or around the coral. If you can navigate the endless coral, you'll get some beautiful blue water and great photos.PEARL HARBOR: It's a very powerful, memorable experience. I recommend the audio tour for $5. I hope the people who go there are respectful and quiet. Not everyone was quiet when we visited and this is a war memorial and a grave so it was a shame people couldn't tour it more peacefully. It's a good idea to get there super early (at 8 a.m.). It gets quite crowded. I'd allow at least 3 hours for it.DIAMOND HEAD: Climbing this dormant volcano takes about 2 hours and it's got a rewarding, spectacular view at the top. I recommend you wear good, comfortable shoes like gym shoes or hiking boots. The path is well-defined but still has some jagged edges. This is no cake walk, it's a real hike, but amateurs can do it. The people who wear sandals, loafers or business shoes regret it deeply. The roughest part is a set of 100 steps, but bring water, go early and you can do it!TRAFFIC: I can't stress this enough. This is a big city. Sure, there are palm trees and the weather is fantastic, but it's still a big city so that means rush hour is rough! At 4 p.m. on a Thursday, it took us 45 minutes to go 4 blocks by car! Another reason it takes so long to get around Waikiki is that there are so many one-way streets. Plus the streets don't always go as far as you'd like. Miss your turn and you have to go an extra 4 blocks to get back. Please get a good map while in town or at least make sure you have a good hotel like the Waikiki Parc to help you.FLYING: We took a straight, non-stop 9 hour flight. I recommend that over a 1-stop flight because as long as 9 hours may be, it's better than a total of 11 to 12 hours with a layover in CA. Jet lag in Hawaii was minimal for us...maybe a day. Jet lag back in Chicago was tough! It took me 3-5 days to be reasonably adjusted to the time and feel rested again. Please take a few days off after you get back from Hawaii. Go back to work less than 2 days after you get home is not smart.By the way, since Hawaii is thousands of miles from most people's homes, I recommend signing up for your favorite airlines' Mileage Program. We got 9000 miles from American Airlines plus 1000 bonus miles for booking online! It's well worth it and it's free.Thanks and have a great time in Oahu like we did! Aloha!

<Content>Good option in Waikiki We stayed here one night last week, and it was perfectly adequate to nice. It was more expensive than the other places we stayed in Hawaii (which we expected because it was a full-service hotel and we had stayed in BBs until then), but located 1-2 blocks from the beach, in the middle of lots of stores and restaurants, etc. And the breakfast buffet was in fact good, esp. the pineapple which I thought was particularly fresh. We liked the package deal we got including breakfast and free valet parking with in/out privileges, which was convenient. And the room was nice - faced the city/mountain, so we got a great full-rainbow view when the clouds were over the mountains. The lanai (deck) was maybe 1 foot deep and 4 feet wide, so extremely small and narrow, but we could go out and take a few photos. And we asked to extend our check-out time and the response was generous and extremely helpful given our travel schedule, which we appreciated. My only gripe was that I didn't once see the concierge sitting in his or her chair, and when we asked for assistance with choosing a restaurant in the next town, the front desk was barely helpful and didn't offer to call to make reservations or find us driving directions. But otherwise this was a fine option.

<Content>Too many bad experiences at the Parc!!! Arrived at the Parc for the first leg of our honeymoon on Sept. 14th. After checkin we arrived at our ocean view room. It was on the 9th floor and did have an ocean view, but had a better view of the exhaust fans and roofs of the hotels in front of ours.  The rooms are small, the balconys tiny, but while on Oahu we figured we would be doing tourist things and wouldnt be in our room much, so it was fine. The fact that we were put in a smoking room when we requested non smoking was alot of the problem. The bed smelled and the room was just musty. I was trying to be possitive because it was our honeymoon and I had visions of what the hotel would be like, and it did not even come close to meeting them. The next morning I talked to the front desk and they moved us to a non smoking room on the 14th floor. This room was much better. Better view and just cleaner. We had breakfast every morning and like most reviews will tell you, it is a substantial buffet. It does not change very much from day to day, but there is plenty to choose from. We had taken the advice of one of the front desk clerks and booked two excursions. One to Pearl Harbor and one 9 hour full Island tour. The morning of our island tour we went for breakfast, and my husband noticed the french toast on the buffet was moldy. When I informed our waiter and asked him if anyone else had noticed, he informed me that  the Japanese wouldnt say anything because they are polite! I was furious! To make things worse, when we left breakfast, we asked a member of housekeeping which side of the building was considered the front so we could wait for pickup for our tour shuttle. The staff member showed us to the wrong side of the hotel, and we missed our shuttle and were not able to meet up with the tour. We asked Missy, the concierge if we could get a taxi or have someone take us to meet up with the shuttle, since we knew all the places it was stopping, but she was told there was no way to communicate with the driver. Anyone who has ever taken one of these tours knows there are many ways that base can communicate with drivers and that they usually talk back and forth during the tours. I was extremely upset and still am. The hotel ruined the first few days of our honeymoon. I was contacted by hotel management and told they would pay for a rental car if we wanted to do our own tour of the island, or we would be able to take a 3 hour tour in the afternoon. The day this all happened was Waikiki's Aloha festival, this is when they close down the main streets to have a street fair, alot of the locals come into town for a party. How were we to get around with a rental car? We opted for the afternoon tour, which was OK but we really wanted to see the North Shore and the tour didnt go very far out of honolulu. Overall the waikiki Parc was a huge disapointment! The hotel is located in a good location for tourist and the people at the front desk were very nice to us. The rooms are small and basic. It is pretty much like any quality inn or Holiday Inn.  Dont expect quiet. The dumsters outside are emptied between 4 and 5 every morning and there is a lot of road noise. The pool is small, but clean. If you are looking for an reasonably priced, no frills hotel you may want to consider this one. I would not take any advice from staff and for gods sake, dont say anything bad about the food!! My husband and I will never return to this hotel, I have never been treated so rudely. Especially being that it was our honeymoon!! Take our advice and stay at the Fairmont Kea Lani on Maui. They bent over backwards to make our stay wonderful. We wish we could have made up our 4 days on Oahu there!! We will definatly be making a return trip to Maui someday!!

<Content>Great Place To Stay This hotel was everything I expected and much more. The rooms were very clean, comfortable and the staff was great. Billy always greeted us (my wife and I) with a smile on his face and Lori was always very helpful. The hotel was right across the street from the beach and it was located just blocks from the strip. There was a Denys located at the corner were you eat great for a great price. This hotel is the place to stay at when traveling to Waikiki. This will definitely be my place of choice for my next trip to paradise. One piece of advice (Stay away from the Chilli's on Kuhio Ave. The food was horrible and the service was even worst) Besides that, this trip was all good.Sincerely,Hula Hula King

<Content>Wonderful experience! We loved this hotel! It was clean and peaceful, although not fancy. Its located right across the street from the beach and the view was wonderful. The breakfast buffet was really good. The front desk was extremely helpful. My one complaint would be that sometimes it was difficult to find the concierge--he didn't seem to be there during that many hours. But this is a great hotel at a great price. I couldn't be happier with our choice and would reccommend it to anyone

<Content>Not too bad I read other opinions about this hotel so I was not shocked to see a smaller room and a standing balcony, with room for two only. The hotel was small and lacked the resort feeling from the larger hotels across the street, but it was very clean, comfortable, simple and had great service. I stayed there for my birthday and they had dessert waiting for me when I arrived. (Nice touch.) Location was great. Close to everything. It's ranked a 4 star hotel, but in my I book it was closer to a 3 star...( Size of the room and balcony brings it down for me.) All in all, we enjoyed our stay there.

<Content>Parc perfect for quiet, central, reasonably-priced hotel The Parc is not a party hotel, and that's exactly why we loved it. Waikiki has plenty of places to drink and be merry, but I don't want to have to listen to it all night in my room.We stayed for a total of six nights at the Parc and took advantage of their rental car promotion (free rental with Dollar, but taxes and insurance extra). $200/night in August got us breakfast (American buffet is perfectly adequate with speedy service), a room on the 17th floor with a view of the ocean, and parking is free for guests (whether or not you rent with Dollar through the promo).Great rooms, excellent room service, and the managment showed its mettle when it more than made up for a snafu in renting the car. Our room had a fine refrigerator (no freezer) with an astonishing amount of space for an in-room. The showers are hot and the water thunders out of the faucets. The lanai was ample for two people, and the shutters retract to reveal an entire wall of glass overlooking the ocean if you prefer air conditioning with your sunsets.Although touted as quiet, that is a relative term in Waikiki where hotels are crammed in cheek to jowel and people stay up late. But compared to the hotels that offer live muzak nightly, this really is the spot for adults and families that want to get away from it all at the end of the day.The pool is fine for lap swimming and sunning/reading in the cushy lounge chairs. If you're looking for water-park like pools filled with children for your kids to meet (or singles for you to meet), then best to stay in Maui, not Waikiki. Besides, the beach is right across the street from the back entrance, and you can rent snorkel gear, rafts, surfboards (with a south swell the waves there are great fun) and so on immediately to your left when you reach the beach. There are public rinsing showers right there, too. Who needs a hotel pool with the warm, inviting turquoise waters of the Pacific just 50 steps away?The exercise room is wee tiny, with just two treadmills, an elliptical trainer, a recumbant bike, dumbells, one bench and one universal machine crammed into a corner. If you just want to jog or use the free weights, it's all you could want with towels, water and a poolside location. We ended up jogging down the main drag to an outstanding 24 Hour Fitness with a commanding view of the most famous beach in Waikiki. Nice if you already have a membership with 24 Hour Fitness.There are two coin-operated washers and two dryers for guests to use ($2/load), but while the washers worked, the dryers only produce luke-warm blobs of wet cloth after 45 minutes. Better to have the hotel do your beach towels; wash your swim wear in the room and hang it to dry overnight.Overall the decor in the lobby is inoffensive 70's fleshtones. The elevators get a little sandy at the end of the day. But the staff are responsive, the concierge was super even by phone when we lost our way in the car, and the desk clerks were fast and courteous.

<Content>Great Hotel Stay My wife and I stayed here for 5 days and enjoyed every day there. The staff (front desk, maid service, valets, restaurant personnel) was very professional, friendly and they tried to anticipate our needs. The rooms were very clean, up to date, and quiet. I never heard my neighbors. If anything, I am not used to being treated so well.We reserved a room with the breakfasts. This turned out to be a great choice. The American style breakfast was delicious and had a wide range of items from local fruits, fruits, pancakes, eggs, oatmeal, cereal, pastries, bacon, sausages, bread, etc. It kept us happy easily for the 5 days that we stayed. We also had the choice of a Japanese style box breakfast. The service was excellent there and I figure that we saved hours from havng to find a breakfast that we liked, going out to get it, and returning. We walked down, ate breakfast and took off to the day's activities.On lazy days or afternoon breaks, the pool was a nice way to cool off and nap. Towels provided there.My only con is that it was probably too nice of a place for me. I actually feel more comfortable with a little less service, but my wife liked the treatment.

<Content>Treated like Royalty at Waikiki Parc Hotel I purchased my stay at Waikiki Parc Hotel from Luxurylink for 4 nights deluxe accomodation with waterfall hike, and fresh fruit basket upon arrival for $550 (Excellent price). When my spouse and I arrived we were blown away at our amazing view. A full-on-drop dead view of the water. The staff was very helpful. We used them often for restaurant choices, luaus ect.... The pool on the 8th floor doesn't have a bar, yet there is an ABC store just a few feet away. We bought bloody Mary mix, vodka, Olives and had a great time mixing our own drinks by the pool. It was the best time. We saved tons of money and were treated like royalty. We had a fabulous time at Waikiki Parc Hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Experience Just returned from at week at the Waikiki Parc and found it a wonderful experience. We stayed in room 1902 and had a great view of the water. Breakfasts were great. Staff were very helpful and friendly. There is a beach area across from the hotel that is small, private and quiet! If you do not want the crowded beach atmosphere, this is the place for you. The hotel is centrally located for bus pick-up for tours. Definitely would stay here again.

A quiet, friendly place with great service! Hotel emplyees knew my name by the second day of our visit and we were greeted at breakfast each morning by name. The american and japanese morning buffet was wonderful-don't skip the french toast! The hotel offers a simple exercise room, a nice, well kept pool and a great location-across the street from it's sister property the Halekulani. This hotel is simple. The rooms are small but very well kept. The employees are very friendly, and helpful with every need. The cost is pretty amazing for Waikiki-considering it includes the morning meal and valet parking. Will stay here again!

<Content>good value at the Waikiki Parc Stayed at the Waikiki Parc for 4 nights. Room was on the 17th floor and was in excellent condition. Saw review below about low water pressure...ours was almost too high! Had a very nice view of the ocean, between the Sheraton and Halekulani. Lanai isn't big, but enough for 2 to comfortably sit and enjoy the view. Sunrise package with parking and breakfast included was a great deal. Breakfast had all the typical breakfast foods with a bit of variety each day. (They are renovating the dining area until May 26, so no lunch or dinner there). Enjoyed the proximity to the rest of Waikiki. Didn't have to deal with all the hustle and bustle, but close enough to walk anywhere. There is beach access between the hotels, but it is a small plot of sand. We walked down to the main beach each time we wanted beach-laying.One great feature is that the bellmen will check your luggage on your last day there. So, if you have a late flight (ours was 915pm), you don't need to lug it around all day. Plus, they have a free hospitality room to use to freshen up before going to the airport.I'm sure there is nicer in Waikiki than the Parc, but you start shelling out big bucks for that. I'm sure there is much more worse than the Parc though too. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved the breakfast My husband, 8 yo daughter, and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc and had a pleasant experience. It's close to everything and was quiet. The staff was very friendly and so accomodating. The complimentary breakfast every morning was great! They give you a choice of the American or Japanese meal but we only tried the American since our daughter like it so much. Breakfast included fresh fruits, pastries, oatmeal, bacon, eggs, cereal, juices, etc. They try to change the menu a bit each day. Two adults are free and children are charged depending on age. The only issue we had was that our toilet didn't flush well, the shower seemed to be low in pressure, and the drain in the tub accumulated a bit when you took a shower. Also, the pool only goes about 3.5 feet so you can't really dive in it. The room was a bit small. We would definitely stay here again for the breakfast.

<Content>Very Pleasant Waikkii Parc Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Waikkii Parc Hotel for 2 nights at the end of March 2004. We found that the room was spotless, comfortable and well appointed with everything we could need. The location was terrific for getting around on foot, though we had a car. The staff was what made the visit special; they were incredibly nice and helpful, each and every one. We will stay there again. (Note for families, the pool is small, so do the adults a favor and take them to the beach! It's more fun. We loved the adult feel of the pool.)

<Content>A quiet haven amid Waikiki's hustle  Looking for some peace  quiet away from all the noise  general clamour that is Waikiki? this is the place to stay. It's sandwiched between the Sheraton and its sister Hotel the Halekuia (sp?) on a One Way Street; which it makes it nice and quiet. The Beach is just a pebble's throw away too. The Hotel's in pretty tip-top shape (as you'd expect from a 4-star Hotel), you could eat a meal off the foyer floor (if you have the inclination). The Rooms are a tad on the small side but the modern furniture  fittings do make up for it. A warning about the Balcony in some rooms: Don't wander onto them if you suffer from the slightest degree of Vertigo, -- Our balcony was extremely small; you can only get two people max on them (standing room only). The Staff were all friendly  courteous -- even to their most grubby, obviously-a-Tourist-looking patrons (I speak of my Wife  I). All in all, a great place to stay for the price of a 2/3-Star Hotel. Especially if you want get away from the filthy masses for a while.

<Content>Good, not well known We stayed here in a deluxe OV room. Very nice for the price. The place is clearly not the Halekulani, its sister hotel. However, it's nice and has character for a high-rise hotel. The hotel is clearly more Japanese style. Admittedly, some of the furnishings need to updated. One of the best things is the choice of American buffet breakfast or Japanese breakfast that is included in the price. It's fairly quiet as it sits on a side street away from the heart of Waikiki's action. But it's just a short walk to all the central spots as well. No, there's not a bar, but if you need a drink that badly, maybe you should bring your own booze.

<Content>when in Hawaii, go for something better than this! The Hotel is well located and that is about it when it comes to good things. They dont even have a bar!!! We spent 8 nights there and had 3 days of heavy rain and you can not even get a drink without leaving the premises. Rooms are ok with little balconies which are dangerous experience. According to hotel clerk, we got the best room with the best view, so if that is the best I can only assume how the rest looks. For the price we paid for high season (new year) we still regret we did not spent extra few bucks for a resort like Hillton or Mandarin (the difference was cople hundred, but we booked late and this hotel was only available.) Concierge was quite bitchy when she realised that we are not from US. She did not bother to recommend us a decent restaurant and tried to sell us some ------ show. I wouldn't go there again.

<Content>Grrreat! I loved this palce. We stayed in two different type of rooms and were treated very well on our return. Staff was really nice and went out of their way. We booked an Ocean view and asked about an upgrade. For $20 more we were given a deluxe OV on the top floor. Rooms are a little small but all in all an excellent value. There are packages that include breakfast and parking.

<Content>Great Deal in the Big City This hotel was a great deal (we got the room/car/breakfast package through their Web site). We were pleased with the service and accommodations. The almost entirely glass ocean view front wall makes the smallish room seem larger, and gives a great view of the water. However, bear in mind that you are in a busy city and even a room on the 11th floor (as we had) still gets noise at all hours from a loading dock on the block. All things considered, I can stand the noise for a great price.

<Content>Parc was heaven in paradise!You'll adore it too... Our very first visit to Oahu(Hawaii, for that matter) was absolute heaven-thanks in part to our lovely stay at the Parc.Upon check-in, we were surprised with a free upgrade to deluxe oceanview.Our room was just wonderful-exceptionally clean, modern, tropical decor, yummy toiletries, full bath. We loved leaving our balcony sliding doors open each evening when we retired, lulled to sleep by the sounds of the surf below-OH HOW I LONG TO RETURN!!!The hotel staff were very helpful, friendly and attentive. We always felt very pampered. And the breakfast buffet each morning!We'd booked a pkg. deal which inclued our rental car and breakfast. Each morning we sat down to a heavenly array of both American and Japanese breakfast treats-LOVED the fresh guava juice! Service was attentive and friendly-complete with the morning local paper. What a wonderful start to our day!We can't say enough nice things about the Parc-be sure to get the room/car/breakfast pkg. and you'll be all set! Aloha...

<Content>Very Nice - Would Recommend We stayed at the Waikiki Parc Sept. 12-16, 2003 on our 25th wedding anniversary trip. We enjoyed our stay very much. The room was very nice - a little small but plenty large enough for two adults. The ocean view was fabulous and the beach is just a few steps away (you cross the street and go down a lane between the Shearton and Halekulani to get to the beach). The hotel staff was always friendly and helpful and offered valuable information about and directions to nearby destinations. They also arranged a luau for us and helped us secure a rental car. This hotel doesn't have shops or clubs in it so it is a little calmer and quieter than many of the larger hotels in Waikiki - which was a plus for us. We did enjoy a little Waikiki nightlife but enjoyed coming back to the quiter atmosphere of the hotel. There were plenty of restuarants and shops nearby and the Shearton bus terminal (just across the street) is the stop for many excursion buses. Our room rate included breakfast and parking which is very vaulable in expensive Waikiki. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Priced right. The Waikiki Parc Hotel was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is right in the middle of the action without the big bucks. The partial ocean view was exactly that. The lanai was just big enough to stand on and if you leaned over the rail you could see the ocean.I would stay there again if I find myself in Honolulu.ajp

<Content>Great Value for the location We stayed at the Waikiki Parc for two nights earlier this month. I thought the special price quoted by Expedia ($87.21) was an excellent deal compared to the other adjacent hotels. Breakfast was not included but we are not big breakfast eaters. We had to pay extra for parking, $10 per night, but it still was a fabulous deal. The rooms are small as other reviewers have already noted but the location was great. We were blocks from the best shopping (Intl. Market Place and Royal Hawaiian) and the beach so we walked everywhere and avoided the headaches of looking for parking. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>small rooms encountered difficulty on check-in. Hotel stated reserved room could not accomidate our party of 4 (3 adults and 1 child). Insisted I book a second room and my the same rate as first room of $125 per night. called MyTravel the following morning they addmitted the error and offered to pay for the second room. Faxed receipts today. Anyway the hotel has small rooms with tile over most of the floor, ours had windows facing west and could look out and see the ocean. No true balconies here. 3 star furnishing but not 4 star or luxury as advertised. Hotel cafe small and only those on tours seemed to eat their. Pool is small and shaded half the day. Acess to beach through hotel across street. Parking up to $30 per day. Fancy shopping in area but the high trafific streets are 3-4 blocks east facing the beah and this is where I will stay next time. Access to the the hotel difficult as many tour busses park on the only road avalible to get to the hotel. Others a one-way away from the hotel. No help desk for arranging tours to be found. Rated 3 for hotel and 4 for location.
