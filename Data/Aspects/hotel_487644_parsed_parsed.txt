<Content>great service It was a 4 star hotel and it lived up to its promise by European standards. The front desk (not restaurant) staff all spoke Eenglish very well. They were friendly and took the time to explain how to get around. The hotel is not located in the tourist attraction area, the closest being a 15 min walk to Plaza Catalunya. Take the time to visit some of the local restaurants and shops and see how people live their daily lives. I really like seeing life unfold in this residential (seemed upper middle class) neighborhood. There are a couple of college/universities close by. The only drawback is that the closest Metro station (Hospital Clinic) is a 10 min walk away. All the Bcn tourist attractions are really close to the metro and it was easy to figure out, just buy yourself a 10 pack which saves you a lot of money, multiple people can use it too at one time. We walked the streets at night and it was safe but I don't recommend it, you never know you might get mugged as we did in Sevilla.

<Content>Small Rooms but nice design Taxi no problem to find the hotel. Modern stylish design, clean, has a boutique hotel feel, helpful staff, good location close to ave. diagonal and blue line of the bus tur铆stic. Breakfast buffet adequate, nothing special. very convenient and free wireless internet. On the bad side, our room was tiny. The bathroom, which was very nice, was 1/3 of the whole room. It was crowded. Aircon didn't work properly and we were without water for a few hours one day. not enough pillows...only one long pillow for two people and one half pillow. Lights in the bathroom a bit strange...it only works on a timer, and a short one on that, so found ourselves racing through showers to avoid being left in the dark. We also tried to order room service at 10:45 and couldn't, when room service officially goes until 11 pm.But those failings didn't serve to create any major grief and it was a decent stay over all.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - Deffo Going Next Year I was booked a trip to barcelona from my mum for my 21st and travelled out for 4 days in august this year.taxi ride was about 25 euro if not less (think i just over tipped) although trains and metros are easy to come by! i bought the rough guide to barcelona book, found the street point at it to the taxi driver and away we went!People in the hotel were so friendly its amazing, and so fluent in languages, kindly let us into our room at half 11 which was nice and clear and sunny - view not the greatest but your there to sight see not to look out your window for 4 days.The breakfast looked really good shamefully we didnt try it as we wanted to do so much but ven on our last day they looked after our bags for 8 hours, kept passports sepearate in a safe and let us go off on our way booking a taxi in time for us to be at the airport.they gave a lot of help regarding where to go what to see what ever.location wise about 3 min walk from Hospital Clinic metro stop, which was out of action ( only till 10th august then back working again) however the bus worked fine!We even walked to las ramblas one night which took about 20 mins but it is an amazing walk along.the is the industrial school ( i think this is the name) up the top which you are free to walk around along with local supermarkets which are cheap.i am going to go back to barcelona next year in winter and definatly plan on staying in this hotel again as its cheap, cosy yet close to everything.really good place to stay :-)

<Content>Great hotel Stayed in the hotel for 7 days in June on holiday. Like other peoples reviews taxi's seem to have trouble finding the hotel.Hotel and rooms kept really clean and tidy but make sure to ask for extra pillows, only draw back on the room was that there is only 1 english channel CNN.Hotel in good location away from all the noise. We walked to the centre each day which took about 15mins plus you get too see where some of the resturants are, because despite some of the reviews there are great resturants around the hotels streets you just have to explore, espically the itallian cio bella a few blocks along from the hotel on Carrer de Mallorca heading towards the city. In all a great hotel very stylish but maybe not a 4 star.

<Content>Good valur Definetely not a bad Hotel, we stayed for 2 nights of sightseeing in May and me and my girlfriend liked it a lot, especially the Bathroom was very nice, the bed could have been a bit better though, the distance was not bad for sightseeing only about 2kms from the city centre.Good points.- nice breakfast not the best i ever had but among them.- Very nice contemporary style with cherrywood everywhere.- Great big bathroom.- ok location in a quiet residential erea.Weak Points.- Tv only had 1 english channel- CNN- Location could have been a bit closer to the sights.- Squeeky bed.

<Content>Wasn't impressed The Zenit hotel staff are absolutely lovely and very willing to help but that is about the only good thing I can say about this hotel ..... Firstly we arrived in the hotel after much bother (Taxi man couldn't locate ithe hotel and over charged us) to find a small but welcoming atmosphere. We then received our key to what can only be described as the smallest double room i've ever seen. We had to walk sidewards around the bed to get to the wardrobe which was ridiculous when the bathroom is almost the same size as the room and the stripy decor on the wall didn't help. After requesting an upgrade, the receptionist moved us to the next floor to a double with two single beds, which resulted in a king sized bed free of charge, I suspect because to hotel seemed empty. This room was better almost double the size. One our first night we decided to stay local . . . big mistake after having a small but good meal in the hotel restaurant we went for a drink. We had two options a loud night club or a strip club (hotel bar wasn't open). It cost from 鈧? to 鈧?0 in a taxi to town which is reasonable. Would only recommended this hotel for over night stay.

<Content>Good price for a 4* I stayed at this hotel on the 17th February for 3 nights with my girlfriend. The price was a very reasonable 拢177 for the 3 nights.The hotel is quite well situated not too far to walk to the metro although it is about 4 blocks so may be too far for people with limited mobility. It's only a couple of stops after here though that you arrive at Las Ramblas or Casa Batll贸 in fact any other tourist attractions are only a couple of Metro stops away.The staff were all very pleasant and helped me to brush up on my Spanish. The maids did a good service every day the room and bathroom were both kept very clean and tidy.We didn't have breakfast as we were on a room only basis but we did have our first evening meal in the hotel. The salad to start with was very nice and there was lots of it, then black rice for main course was also extremely nice and was only 鈧?0 for two people.There is one draw back though, the room service for a 4* hotel isn't the greatest. The menu clearly states it's available from 11.30 - 23.00. However when i called at 17.00 i was told they don't do room service till 20.00. Not too much of a problem but why have it advertised as being available when it's not.All in all if i was to go to Barcelona again, i would definitely stay in this hotel however it may not be my first choice. For the price though it really was excellent value for money.

<Content>Beautiful BCN We stayed 3 nights at this nice design hotel. Mainly spanish and british guests.Quick check-in. We paid a good 鈧?0 + 7% tax for a double room incl. breakfast.Room was quiet, very clean, but smaller than most rooms in a 4 star categorie. Maybe because spanish people are overall smaller than north european people the room and bathroom are a bit smaller than average.But furniture, cleanliness are OK.Breakfast: cold meats, cheese, assortement rolls, fresh fruit,eggs, sausage, bacon, cereals, danish rolls, toast, juices. All from a buffet.The hotel is in a residential area, only 5 min. walk from metro station Hospital Clinic. From there good connections to the center of BCN.In the neigberhood are very few restaurants. So you have to dine in the hotel or find a restaurant further away.When you walk up to the Hospital Clinic station you pass a nice supermarket. (about 200 mtr. from hotel) Skip the hotel minibar and buy your drinks, snacks in the supermarket. Specially mineral water because spanish tapwater has lots of chlorine.

<Content>Pleasant but some drawbacks re location The Zenit Borrell hotel is a very nice 4 star hotel at good value somewhere in the region of 拢70 per couple per night Bed and Breakfast.It is nearest the Hospital Clinic underground (5 mins walk) not URGELL as it is too far to walk up a hill (about a mile). On Sundays some of the entrances to the Hospital Clinic are closed but there are entrances nearby.The rooms are stylish and modern and the breakfast is fine (cooked as well as buffet). They closed the bar one night at about 10pm and the barman told us to use the minibar in our rooms, which was not overly expensive.The drawback is the underground although it is near line 5 (L5), the changes to the main underground arertuous - it means walking down long tunnels. The trade off is the hotel is good value but location is problematic if you want to do the tourist bits.The hotel gave me erroneous information on the fountains at Las Espanya. They are spectacular and are on show on Fridays and Saturdays only - we were told we could see them after 9pm and got there to discover it was a lot earlier. (The fountains seem to be very mysteriously scheduled, tourists guides are not plentiful).Watch out for pickpockets:it is serious problem in Barcelona. I was accosted twice once at the Sants Underground Station when I bought a tourist ticket (and the female ticket seller took an age to serve me . I then went through the barrier and a young man aged in his early 20s tried to touch my pockets. The second time was on Las Ramblas in the evening. If there is a group of you always had a tail end charlie to watch your backs, and when you get on the underground go to the middle of the train so you are less isolated. Do not do the obvious things such as display your camera etc.The Graudi bits are really worth a visit and the ordinary people of Barcelona are very helpful and frendly. You will be asked for money by unrelenting beggars, some hold babies in the Gothic area: Wise up to the dangers of Barcelona, but so long as you are sensible you should be ok.It is an interesting city - the main cathedral is really worth a visit, I had not realised that it is completely unfinished and the whole building is almost a building site . It was really impressive inspite of that.Regards
