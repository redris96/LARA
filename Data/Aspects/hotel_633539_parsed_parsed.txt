Well situated hotel, very clean, fantastic shower. Great breakfast. Free loan of bikes. Free use of laptops in every bedroom  free printer use too. Nothing negative about this hotel - it's all good!

<Content>Fab hotel! Absolutely brilliant hotel. Brilliant location. Staff were extremely helpful! Room was cleaned daily and was immaculate. I thought the room was of adequate size and would not describe it as being pokey. I would recommend this hotel. In walking distance to las ramblas and many nice restaurants nearby.

<Content>This is not a 4 star plus hotel Stayed for 2 nights in a high tech room. No hotel information supplied. Rooms small and pokey and looking tired. Carpet had a big stain and a hole. Curtain hanging off the rails. Whilst room had a promised lap top no sight of the promised dvd and CD player unless you use the laptop perhaps but then only one person can watch. Also no trouser press and exercise bike as per the company麓s website. Staff friendly. Overall disappointed as part of our visit to Barcelona was to have a good quality hotel experience.

<Content>A good hotel for Dracula! This hotel has a great location and friendly staff, but these are really the only positive comments I can give it. I stayed with my husband and two kids for two nights as a follow on to a med cruise. The hotel looked great and ultra modern in the photos but was a disappointment in reality. The children were actually scared of the hotel's creepy atmosphere and dark corridors. Our room was modern, but absolutely tiny and it backed onto a school playground/nursery. With all of our luggage and the children there was not room to swing a cat. The bathroom seemed to be bigger than the living and bedroom space . I lay down on the bottom of two bunk beds and bashed my head on some kind of hook protruding from the wall - very child friendly! When I considered the top bunk, I realised that there was no safety rail for my 12 year old - nothing to stop her from falling out in her sleep. I phoned reception and they sent up a porter who demonstrated that the ladder could be removed and turned sideways along the bed to create a makeshift safety rail. The lad seemed quite pleased with himself until I pointed out that she could now not get down to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and that she would have to wake us all up to get down for any reason. After more phone calls and after being told that the hotel was full, and the absence of another ladder anywhere in the hotel, we were moved to a bigger room, which looked like a converted conference room with twin single beds and a pull down double which was very uncomfortable. The shower had jets, but if you put them on they soaked the floor - stylish but not practical. All in all a bad experience. This is not a family hotel at all, there is no atmosphere to the place and as my daughter says it is a good hotel for Dracula!

<Content>Hotel was ok, location a bit too far out for me Me and my partner went to Barcelona for his 30th. Absolutely loved the city and will definately go back. The hotel itself was very modern and clean, the hotel staff were ok never really had a lot to do with them other than checking in/out. They give you a book of barcelona with all the metro lines and places to go which helped us so much! The rooms were nicely decorated but the beds were two twins pushed together that were on wheels? Also mattresses very hard, free internet was nice but i didnt use it. The only english speaking channel with the TV is CNN but with so much to do i dont think that should be a major issue. Was disapointed with the location of the hotel had to walk a fair trek to get to the Ramblas and other attractions but if you like walking or prepared to use the metro then this hotel will be fine, we stayed in room 302 on the third floor at the front of the hotel and it was very noisy in the morning with traffic but i dont think you will escape this in barcelona. Rooms cleaned everyday, new towels, mini bar well stocked but very expensive but isnt it in every hotel? Overall pleased with my stay but when i go back i will definately book a hotel on or near the ramblas.

<Content>Great location We (family of four) stayed at the Petit Palace 11 to 14 April. I agree with all the reviews here both good and bad. It is a GREAT location. It's not a four star hotel - 3 at most. The decor is interesting and funky but on closer inspection rather shoddy and done on the cheap (a bit 60 minute make over). The staff were friendly but not much in evidence. The breakfast is completely overpriced so don't bother. You do have a lap top and internet access in your room. The bathroom is wonderful and the jacuzzi bath divine after a hard days sight seeing. The shampoo and bubble bath etc were never replaced after we used it up on the first night. The room was noisy - the plumbing seems to make odd noises all night that sounded like someone throwing up and slopping water over the side of a bath at the same time (may be it was). The beds are comfy. Most of the light fittings were hanging out. There was a big stain on the carpet. That all sounds a bit negative I know but don't be put off. It is probably all worth it for the location and, if you are in Barcelona, how much time do you want to spend in your hotel? Go and enjoy!

<Content>Cutting edge style This hotel is well-situated, easy walking distance from Placa Catalunya (where the airport Aerobus stops), and central for sightseeing.Charming receptionist, very modern decor (mostly black).The bedroom had a very comfortable double bed (2 single bases) and pull-down bunk beds behind a diaphanous curtain. The room was small, and one side of the bed was right up against the shower room (opaque glass) wall, but it was spotlessly clean and well designed, with plenty of storage space, a safe and a fridge.The shower was state-of-the-art with 3 different sprays including massage jets.In common with other reviewers, we found the room noisy because it was on the inside overlooking the central square which is a sports and play area, in constant daily use. However, all the players go home eventually, and don't start again until just before 08.00.The only real downside to this hotel was the breakfast. They charge 15 euros, and after the first day we just gave up on it and went to BraCafe on the next corner, for the best coffee in the world. The hot buffet was cold, they ran out of fresh fruit, and the drinks machine was broken for the entire 3 days we were there. The staff just said tomorrow and did not offer to bring coffee from the kitchen. The receptionist listened to our comments on day 2, but nothing had changed by day 3.

<Content>Great place for enjoying Barcelona with a family The Petit Palace turned out to be a great place from which to enjoy Barcelona, located about 5mins walk from Catalunya square (and all the tourist buses) and 15min walk from Sagrada Familia.We had read a couple of mixed reviews, mainly about the noise generated by the schools that have their play areas behind the hotel, but this didn't represent a problem to us and, if anything, it give our two kids (4 and 7) something else to enjoy from the balcony of the room.The room itself was big enough and the massive double bed that we had gave us as much enjoyment as the kids got from their bunkbeds. If there was a DVD player we didnt find it.The staff were very friendly and very helpful.The main drawback was the breakfast, which is set in a dark basement floor and cost a ridiculous 鈧?0 a day for the family (adults 鈧?5 each, kids 鈧?0 each) we gave it a miss after day one and just went somewhere local for a quarter of the price. Cant understand why they charge kids 鈧?0 each when all they will eat is a bit of toast.Definitely not a 5/5, but a good solid 4.

<Content>very dissapointed Just returned from a 3 night stay at the petit palace, warning, this is not a 4 star hotel. upon arrival we were given room 306 which over looks the back of the building ( having requested a room at the front before hand) the back of the hotel over looks a school playground where roller hockey games take place late into the evening, you could not hear your self think and to top that off the room is tiny and hot beyond belief, we complained about the heat and were told to turn down the air con- how stupid do they think we are, the first thing we did was turn down the air con but it is set to winter and therefor blows warm air!! we were then told we could be moved the following morning to a cooler room this room turned out to be the conference room with a pull down bed that was very uncomfertable and only suitable if you are about 5 feet tall, the pillows are as flat as pancakes and there is nothing welcoming about the rooms.the internet connection did not work therefor my daughter could not watch her dvd's.the room service not is 24hrs and the mini bar in the room only had 1 bottle of water, hardley fulfils a familys needs not to dehydrate!!all in all this was a very basic hotel, the location is good but i would not reccomend this hotel for a comfertable stay.

<Content>Paradise Found !!! Just returned after spending 2 great nights at the petit Palace,I must say i was a little aprihensive about it after reading so many mixed reviews,however i am glad to report that this place is a hidden secret, 3 of us, 3 football supporters (ok our team lost against the mighty Barca) Grown men, fussy individuals,booked a triple room, 2 Very large Bunk Beds and a Queen /king size bed,whichever is bigger, LCD, laptop, and hydro bath,heaven!!! the hotel,was very trendy, the receptionist was excellent, and had a smile for us at all times during our stay, the Bar??? as previousley stated is a corner with about 30 empty bottles of Raspberry flavoured Absolute Vodka as a backdrop, little atmostphere but with a choice of bars just a block away, this wasn,t a problem as we didn,t want to spend our time sitting in the hotel anyway, also in the room we had a balconey, didnt hear much traffic even though it was on a main street, only 2 towels in the room for showers on arrival, asked for more at reception, and they were in the room within minutes, there was also a complmentery bottle of Jameson Irish whiskey (Baby Size) in the room and when the porter relalised there were 3 men in the room he gave us a few more, excellent,, we didnt use the breakfast facility,s as we discovered a lovely coffee shop Bracafe just minutes away from the hotel to the left, the location is very good within walking distance to Catalonia Square, Las Ramblas etc,overall we were very impressed and look forward to a return trip.

<Content>Very disapointed. We stayed at the Petit Palace Barcelona for 1 night only. The web was very impressive and I was expecting a very good 4 starts hotel...I'm not sure if when you are only staying for 1 night, receptionist just give you the less attractive rooms but I'm afraid it was the case indeed!Our room was tiny and had a very small window facing an inside patio which was actually a school... Needless to say everytime the kids went out on the patio it was pretty loud... We couldn't actually hear our own tv... Also in the bathroom there was another tiny window which again faced an indoor patio, this time to a block of flats... Again, not great!As said before, I'm not sure if it was just the fact we got the worst room but it was definately not a 4 star room and definately not worth the price!By the way, the fancy bar shown on the website is not actually a bar... it's just a decorating feature, a few red bottles and a red flowers but not such a thing as a bar!Sorry but very disapointing...

<Content>The Best Hotel I can remember! I booked the Hotel over the internet, just going by the pictures  reviews that I had read on this site. I am so very glad that I did! The hotel itself is so lovely - modern, tasteful, excellently equipt  very clean. It's location couldn't be more perfect for the sites of Barcelona: Gaudi buildings, museums, shops, bars, resaurants,  Catalyuna Square litterally around the corner; bus  Metro services bring everything else one ride away - very few changes of bus or metro-line even. Extremely easy, which is what I need when I am on holiday...The hotel staff were beyond helpful with every request, even when we needed emergency dental treatment - the receptionist 'phoned her boss  we got to see his dentist straight away. That is impressive service,  excellent customer care.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. There are schools next door, but this effects you very little. Not an issue when the hotel is so wonderful.

<Content>Very good location we, a family of 4 with two teens, just came back from our 10 day trip in Spain and we stayed in four different hotels and three of them were Petit Palace hotels because they offered family rooms. Of the three, we liked this place the least but it was still very good. We really liked the other two. This is situated in a great place as it is a 5 minute walk to Placa Catalunya. The metro system in Barcelona is excellent and you can go anywhere in the city and the are three metro stops within two blocks of the place. We did a lot of walking along La Ramblas.The place is clean and the family was spacious and decorated well. It offered a queen size bed and two bunk beds. It also offered wi-fi so I used my laptop.The bathroom door was not really an issue and we had enough privacy.The only minor complaint is that it would have been great if the windows (which had a little balcony) is more sound proof as we could hear traffic noise. also there was some strange noise coming from the venting system even though the heating system was not on. They were doing some construction when we were there so maybe it was related to that.We would stay there again without any hestation.

<Content>Pretty OK. Very nice and tidy hotel. The rooms are perfect. All you can imagine from a 4* hotel. Very clean. Yet a little bit cold in the lobby and bar. Welcome service was average, but professional and OK. WiFi for free and Plasma TV. Location is just perfect. A little bit away from the centre bur full of interesting locations close by. Try Tapa莽24 which is really close by. The best. And George and dragon for a beer with a friend.

<Content>Did not meet expectations Just returned from barcelona where we stayed at the Petit Palace BCN Hotel for 4 nights. My reason for booking this hotel was the impressive website which showed pictures of bedrooms and the hotel bar etc. The hotel is listed as 4 star with luxury rooms. On arrival we were allocated our luxury room which consisted of a fold down double bed,a single bed and a large table and 6 chairs. The room also had laptop and printer and an overhead projector with pull down screen. Our luxury room was in effect a small conference/meeting room which transformed into a bedroom when the double bed was folded from the wall. You can imagine our disappointment as this was a very special anniversary for my wife and I. I questioned the luxury room I had booked and was advised that this was it and got no satisfaction from hotel staff. As for the bar which looked very chic on the website it was non-existant. A few coloured bottles on display in a make shift area of reception and was never open anyway. As a previous customer of this hotel has mentioned this hotel was built on the cheap and materials (mostly MDF) will not last. I would concur with this and also, who needs a laptop ect. on a romantic weekend. My advise to people is do not be fooled by the website of this hotel.

<Content>Basking in Barcelona Booked a short trip to Barcelona with EasyJet.Great package price included a stay at the Petit Palace Barcelona. The hotel is just a few minutes from the Paseo de Gracia, one of the main streets through the city.The hotel was ultra modern, minimalistic and stylish. The rooms were very good sized (our room was set out as if it could be used as a board room!)Staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again.Try the Noti restaurant just a few minutes walk away. Great food and lovely atmosphere.By the way, the temperatures over this weekend in January were up at 20 degrees C! Warm enough for lunch on the beach.

<Content>Mixed Experience! We've just had a few days in Barcelona and stayed at Petit Palace BCN. Here's what you need to know from our experience:Location: Overall, the hotel is in a great location - 5min walk to Placa Catalunya, 2 blocks from Passeig de Gracia. Various Metro stops very close also.Rooms: really cool decor!! very comfortable and clean. Laptop with free internet in the room was a great addition. Minibar has plenty of free space to hold your own items if desired. Safe operates on a credit card swipe - no extra charges. Plenty of TV chanels but CNN is the only English speaking one.Staff: They are all very friendly, speak English, and will help with all sorts of enquiries. Food:We didn't dine in the hotel - 鈧?6 for breakfast is just too much and it's a nicer experience to try a local cafe. Grips: small details overlooked in the room - no soap, no bottle opener, no drinking water, no pen, etc. - this is not the standard expected in a 4star establishment.Problem: the air conditioning in our room only worked one-way! Heating or nothing!! The room was 26degC and couldn't be cooled. Staffed explained that the A/C was shut off for the winter months and all rooms were the same - hard to accept as the common areas were all pleasantly adjusted to about 18-20degC. We found it difficult to sleep comfortable in such stiffling conditions. They did offer us the opportunity to try another room even though they are all similarily without A/C cooling ability.Summary: This hotel is a little above 3star average  hasn't reached anything near 4star standards yet so don't be expecting too much. The location, funky decor, friendly  helpful staff is what makes it woth considering if you want something a little bit different without paying too much. We'll use it again, and again, and again.

<Content>Excellent location, very nice hotel... We stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. The room was very nice and big enough for the four of us (2 adults/2 kids). The kids loved the bunk beds. The room was very clean and on the back of the hotel so very quiet at night. There is a school in the back that has lots of outdoor activity from about 9am or so - the sound wasn't a problem for us but might be if you want to sleep until noon and your window is open. We were able to walk easily to lots of great parts of the city - Las Ramblas, Plaza Catalunya, etc. The metro was also very convenient so it was easy for us to connect to the rest of the city. The staff was very nice and friendly with excellent English.

<Content>Clean, modern and great location Overall, the hotel is in a great location (very close to Placa Catalunya, Passeig de Gracias and La Rambla). We had a room at the back of the hotel (206) which was large enough for 4, even though there were only 2 of us (presumably they gave us a larger room as the hotel was quiet). There was a school behind the hotel which, if you leave your window open, could be quite noisy (but window opening probably not necessary as air conditioning in the room was very effective and independently controlled.) The road outside the hotel is busy so I don't know if the rooms at the front suffered from this.Laptop with free internet in the room was a great addition. Everything was comfortable and clean and, again, the location is fantastic. The staff are very friendly and speak English.Our only criticisms would be: the finish of the hotel felt a little rushed (paint splatters on wall paper, a slightly poorly fitted bathroom) though overall this doesn't detract from what is essentially a very modern, if slightly unusual decor/style. Don't let the images of black rooms put you off, the rooms are a lot brighter and friendlier than the images might suggest. Breakfast is pricey at 鈧?5 per person - we didn't take this option for our entire stay and went further afield to eat for the most part.We booked on lastminute.com and got a great deal, so for us this hotel was brilliant value for money.

<Content>great location !! Excellent Location! Its brand new. The room was a bit small, but they have laptop in the room with free internet service. The staff were very nice, they suguest us very good restaurants. The area is great, is very near las ramblas and plaza cataluna ,shops, etc (walking distance). Its just in front of the Ritzs Hotel. Great location in a safe area, you can walk to las ramblas and around.I prefer this area because las Ramblas is to busy and croud.Again love the location!

<Content>Petit Palace BCN is so cool Just back from Barcelona. This hotel is so cool. Open only 20 days. I traveled with my partner and two children. Lap top in room with free internet kids loved this. The bathroom is so big hugh massage bath. Bunk beds are great and set off our room with net curtains for a little extra privacy. Flat screen LG tv. Breakfast is good. Hotel staff are very helpfull. Very central hotel walking distance to everything. Spent a couple of days on the beach also five mins. taxi ride. Will definately go back.
